During the trials, Oliver Tambo left the country and was exiled. Whilst in other European and African countries, he started an organisation which helped bring publicity to the African National Congress's cause in South Africa. Some of the defendants were later convicted in the Rivonia Trial in 1964.\n\nChief Luthuli has said of the Treason Trial:The treason trial must occupy a special place in South African history. That grim pre-dawn raid, deliberately calculated to strike terror into hesitant minds and impress upon the entire nation the determination of the governing clique to stifle all opposition, made one hundred and fifty-six of us, belonging to all the races of our land, into a group of accused facing one of the most serious charges in any legal system.\n\nOn 5 December 1956, the South African Police's Security Branch raided and arrested 140 people from around the country on the charge of treason as they enforced the Suppression of Communism Act. Those not based in Johannesburg were flown there in military aircraft and held in custody until a hearing on 19 December 1956. The raids were follow-ups to those conducted in 1955 and included search warrants to look for documents at 48 anti-government organisations.\n\nOn the 19 December 1956, 153 prisoners were driven to the Johannesburg Drill Hall for a preliminary hearing to examine the states evidence. Magistrate Frederick Wessels was the presiding judge with J.C. van Niekerk as the state's public prosecutor. An attempt by the prosecutor to proceed with the case was interrupted three times as the noise of 5,000 Black South Africans, hoping to attend the case, surrounded the streets of the Drill Hall and sung Nkosi Sikeleli Afrika. The proceedings had to be halted. The Labour Party in the UK accused the South African Government of intimidating and victimising those opposed to Apartheid, condemning the trial and called South Africa a police state.\n\nResuming on 20 December 1956, the hearing was interrupted again when the defence objected to their clients being behind a six foot high wire fence. After an adjournment, it was agreed by the two sides to reduce it to a barrier four foot tall. The prosecutor J.C. van Niekerk then presented an outline of his evidence stretching back to 1953 of the liberation movements activities but his evidence was soon interrupted when violence broke out outside the court. After police began moving back the crowd of around a 1,000 black protesters, a policeman was injured by a stone and they retaliated by firing into the crowd and surrounding cars and shops, injuring fourteen people. Deputy Police Commissioner Colonel Piet Grobler was able to get his men stop shooting and order was restored.\n\nThe trial examination would continue on 21 December 1956 and the prosecutor presented his case as stating that the defendants were subversive, having attended the recent Congress of the People gathering at Kliptown where speeches had promoted Communism and the creation of the Freedom Charter, the need to seek help abroad and in other evidence, the need to raise money to buy firearms. With no charges yet presented to the individual detainees, bail was granted and the trial was then concluded until 9 January 1957. Rioting broke out at the end of the days proceedings when police charge a group of 400 Black South African protesters.\n\nOn resumption of the preliminary hearing and an examination of the state's evidence on 9 January 1957, three more defendants were added to the charges bringing the number to 156 persons. The defence would argue that the Freedom Charter was not treasonous, that it did not call for violence and it argued for peace and racial harmony for the country.\n\nThe hearing was still ongoing during August 1957, the accused were spending six hours each day in court. With the hearing to last a few more months, the magistrate had more 6,200 pages of testimony and 10,000 exhibits to examine and decide whether to pass the sentences himself or let the Attorney General decide whether to proceed to a trial. The trial was taking so long, the male prisoners formed a choir.\n\nOn 17 December 1957, Attorney General W.J. McKenzie decided to drop charges against 61 and proceed to with the remaining 95 defendants on 13 January 1958. Albert Luthuli and 44 Black, six Whites, four Indian and six Coloured defendants were released.\n\nThe hearing resumed on 13 January 1958 with the prosecutor informing the court of the names of those 61 defendants who had been cleared of further charges.\n\nThe hearing concluded on 30 January 1958 with Magistrate F.C. Wessels finding that there was sufficient evidence for the defendants to be tried on charges of high treason. The defendants were asked to plead, with all pleading not guilty they were released on bail. Their defence lawyers asked for a jury trial, the alternative being a trial by two or three judges, with the former request being rejected by the state in treason trials.\n\nThe Treason Trial began in Pretoria on 1 August 1958 with 91 people on trial having been charged with high treason. The trial saw 57 blacks, 16 whites, 16 Indians and two Coloureds charged with attempting to overthrow the South African government between 1952 and 1956 with the intention to replace it with a communism system. The defence lawyers opened the trial by lodging an objection to two of the three trial judges. They called for Justice Joseph Ludorf to withdraw because of his involvement as a lawyer in other cases against some defendants while Justice Rans Rumpff should withdraw as he had asked for the former to be appointed as a judge on the treason trial. The case was then adjourned until the following Monday.\n\nWhen the trial resumed on 12 August 1958, chief defence lawyer Israel Maisels continued to challenge the indictment referring to the masses of documentary evidence which he claimed was impossible to read in less than two years, and was a abuse of the court process and that the prosecution did not know what its case was about.\n\nAfter the trial collapsed in October, it was decided in November 1958 to resume the trial on 19 January 1959 with a decision to drop 60 people from the indictment.\n\nOn 22 November 1958, 30 of the 91 were re-indicted with the charge now been narrowed down to a conspiracy to endanger and overthrow the state based on the 1955 Congress of the People gathering and the adoption of the Freedom Charter. The remaining 61 were to be indicted in April 1959.\n\nThe trial resumed on 19 January 1959 in Pretoria with the defence arguing for the trial to be moved back to Johannesburg, due to the hardship of travel for the defendants, a city where the majority of them lived. The case was postponed on the first day until after lunch as the bus carrying the defendants had broken down. Trial resumed on 2 February 1959, with the venue change request squashed and the defence lawyers continuing their argument against the new indictments.\n\nWith the resumption of the trial on 20 April 1959 of the other 61 defendants, it was ended when Judge R.L. Rumpff declared that the Crown's case could not accuse the defendants of conspiracy without saying how they entered into the conspiracy and that they would need to know in order to defend their case. The defendants could return home and the prosecution would have to decide whether to re-indict them.\n\nOn 29 March 1961, down to 28 defendants, the trial's verdict was released and they were all found not guilty of treason and discharged. Judge F.L.H. Rumpff concluded that the prosecution could not show that the ANC had become a communist organisation and therefore no treason could be proven nor that any act of violence was to be used to overthrow the state. The defendants were met outside the court by their relatives and saw the singing of Nkosi Sikeleli Afrika.\n\nIn December 1956, many key members of the Congress Alliance were arrested and charged with treason, including almost the entire executive committee of the ANC, as well as the SACP, the SAIC, and the COD. 105 Africans, 21 Indians, 23 whites and 7 coloured leaders were arrested. Ten were women. Many arrestees, including Nelson Mandela, were detained in communal cells in Johannesburg Prison, known as the Fort, resulting in what Mandela described as \"the largest and longest unbanned meeting of the Congress Alliance in years.\" However, white men, white women, and black people were all held in a separate parts of the jail.\n\nInitially, 156 defendants were charged with high treason. The number of defendants was later reduced to 92. In November 1957, the prosecution reworded the indictment and proceeded a separate trial against 30 accused. Their trial commenced in August 1959. The remaining 61 accused were tried separately before the case against them was dismissed in mid 1960.\n\nTreason trial defendants (during various stages of the trial) included:\n\n\nLawyers for the defence included:\n\n\nProsecutors included:\n\n\nJudges included:\n\n\nWitnesses included:\n\n\nAfter the British Canon John Collins learnt about the trial, and the calls for the death penalty, he set up the Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa to pay all legal expenses and look after the families of those on trial. This was one of the first examples of foreign intervention against apartheid in South Africa and proved very successful with over Â£75,000 being raised towards defending those accused.\n\nIn 1957, the campaigner Mary Benson joined the Defence Fund as its secretary.\n\nIn many ways, the trial and prolonged periods in detention strengthened and solidified the relationships between members of the multi-racial Congress Alliance. Rusty Bernstein wrote:Inter-racial trust and co-operation is a difficult plant to cultivate in the poisoned soil outside. It is somewhat easier in here where ... the leaders of all ethnic factions of the movement are together and explore each other's doubts and reservations, and speak about them without constraint. Coexistance in the Drill Hall deepens and recreates their relationships.The trial and resulting periods of detention also allowed ANC leaders to consult about the direction of their struggle and the possibility of armed struggle. Ironically, the court found that the ANC was nonviolent just as the ANC was starting to question the effectiveness of this strategy.\n\nIn court, the 156 defendants sat in alphabetical order, visibly displaying the multiracial nature of the anti-apartheid movement. While the defendants sat side by side in court, they were strictly segregated in jail. When the trialists took over their own defence during the State of Emergency, they eventually convinced prison authorities to let them meet to plan their defence and white female defendants, white male defendants and black women defendants were brought to the African men's prison. Yet the prison authorities still sought to physically separate these defendants by race and gender in their meeting space. Mandela describes the practical dilemma the proponents of apartheid faced:The authorities erected an iron grille to separate Helen and Leon [Levy] (as whites) from us and a second partition to separate them from Lilian and Bertha [Mashaba Gxowa] (as African women) ... Even a master architect would have had trouble designing such a structure.\n\n\n\n"}

The main objectives of the reforms were to establish property rights on land, create and further develop market economy, provide the country's citizens with local agricultural products and generally, increase standards of living and welfare.\n\nAzerbaijan became an independent state in 1991, and during the early years of independence, the main drivers of the government, such as political, social, economic and public sectors were struggling. Some sources indicate that the period between 1991 and 1995 can be characterized as the period of \"economic chaos\". This happened because the country was hit by several problems, such as unstable political situation, military aggression against Azerbaijan and occupation of its territories, internal movement of refugees and consequently, increased unemployment, huge government spending on national defense due to the war in Nagorno-Karabakh area. The breakup of ties between Azerbaijan and foreign markets due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise in prices over 17 times. These processes eventually resulted in the civil war and sharp slowdown in each sector of the country.\n\nAs Azerbaijan had lost its connections in the world market, as did all other Soviet states. One of the most important aspects for improvement was the establishment and implementation of new land policies and reforms. The main impetus for land reforms was that the population had to be supplied by the agricultural foods and products, and the cheapest way of doing that was developing the local production.\n\nIn order to establish the process of economic breakthrough, the special State Commission on Agrarian Reforms was created by decree of the president of the Azerbaijan Republic No. 313 in March 1995, prior to the reforms. Another special commission was created in December 1994. One of the main responsibilities of the State Commission on Agrarian Reforms (SCAR) was to design and elaborate the agrarian reform program. This was done through examination of countries experiencing the transition to market economy and carrying out experiments in different sectors of the country. Other responsibilities of SCAR included examination and verification of territorial land reform programmes, providing instructions on how to implement those reforms and informing the population about the progress of the land reform.\n\nThe first period of agricultural reforms covered the years between 1995 and 2003. Till 2003, more than 50 decree and standard acts were issued by the government and the President of Azerbaijan Republic. These laws included the following:\n\nâ Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan âOn land reformsâ of July 16, 1996;\n\nâ Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"On the land tax\" December 24, 1996;\n\nâ The decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"On application of the Law of the Azerbaijan Republic \"On the land reform\", â 534\" January 10, 1997;\n\nâ Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"On state land cadastre, land monitoring and structure\" of December 22, 1998;\n\nâ Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"On land rent\" of March 12, 1999;\n\nâ Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"On land market\" May 7, 1999;\n\nâ Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"On the land's fertility\" December 30, 1999;\n\nâ Land Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan approved by Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan of June 25, 1999.\n\nThis law was signed on July 16, 1996 and created a foundation for preceding reforms. As stated in the official document, the purpose of the reform is:... creation of the new relations of land ownership on the basis of the principles of economic independence and social equality, development of market economy and entrepreneurial initiative, achievement of economic independence of the country, including providing the population with food, and increase as a result of this material wealth of the Azerbaijani people.The procedures of the \"On the land\" reformed were carried out by the State Commission on Agrarian Reforms (SCAR) with its representative in each region, the Regions Commission on Agrarian Reforms (RCAR). The RARC comprised the Head of the Executive Power of the according region, the officers from State Land Committee, and independent specialists.\n\nThe land reform specified the allocation of land into state, municipal and private ownership. The first stage included the free-of-charge allocation of part of the land fund of collective and state farms to citizens according to legal documentation. The main responsibility of the government institutions were to provide the population with the necessary documents for owning the land and to create a list of requirements for obtaining the land. It also outlines the procedures of privatization of lands and the rights of landowners.\n\nThe Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"On the land tax\" determines the rules of calculation, payments, objects and period of the land tax. The lands that are allocated to persons according to the legislation are considered as object for taxation. However, there exist several exemptions for this type of tax â the lands for common use (regardless of who is the owner â an individual or state), the lands which are under the state protection and reserves, the recreational lands, the lands used for the cultural-historical purpose, natural funds (water, wood) engaged in industrial activity and lands that are unusable or of little use, transferred to individuals for agricultural purposes â are exempted from taxation.\n\nThe tax is withheld in the form of lump sum, meaning that regardless of the amount of the economic activity the taxpayers will only pay a fixed amount of tax each year.\n\nThis law was signed on December 22, 1998 and it regulates the conduct of state land cadaster, controls the use of land on the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This cadaster is a collection of data considering the registration of land tenure, the quantity and quality of land and their economic estimation. The control of organizational works on lands is crucial, because by this way the government monitors the condition of lands, namely levels of fertility and pollution. By controlling and taking actions in a timely manner, the government can prevent and eliminate the negative consequences of irrational use of land.\n\nThis law identifies the unified system of documentation for the state land cadastre. This includes the rights of landowners, the certificates on transfer, etc.\n\nThis reform determines the procedures of renting the land, the required documentations and conditions for the transfer. It also identifies the possible types of transferring the land for the temporary use â short-term and long-term use. The taxes on land, the procedures of payment, the object of taxation and taxpayers are specified in this law.\n\nThis law reflects the issues about the land-market relations, the objectives and tasks of the legislation on the land market, the rules and laws concerning the land market, the resolution of disputes, the procedures following the infringement of the legislation, etc. This law specifies natural and legal persons as participants of the land market, and states that they can act in form of tenants, depositors, as well as users of the land. The issues concerning foreigners, international organizations and legal persons have found their reflection in this Law.\n\n"}
{"id": "346414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=346414", "title": "Associated state", "text": "Associated state\n\nAn associated state is the minor partner in a formal, free relationship between a political territory with a degree of statehood and a (usually larger) nation, for which no other specific term, such as protectorate, is adopted. The details of such free association are contained in United Nations General Assembly resolution 1541 (XV) Principle VI, a Compact of Free Association or Associated Statehood Act and are specific to the countries involved. In the case of the Cook Islands and Niue, the details of their free association arrangement are contained in several documents, such as their respective constitutions, the 1983 Exchange of Letters between the governments of New Zealand and the Cook Islands, and the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration. Free associated states can be described as independent or not, but free association is not a qualification of an entity's statehood or status as a subject of international law.\n\nInformally it can be considered more widely: from a post-colonial form of amical protection, or protectorate, to confederation of unequal members when the lesser partner(s) delegate(s) to the major one (often the former colonial power) some authority normally exclusively retained by a sovereign state, usually in such fields as defense and foreign relations, while often enjoying favorable economic terms such as market access.\n\nAccording to some scholars, a form of association based on benign protection and delegation of sovereignty can be seen as a defining feature of microstates.\n\nA federacy, a type of government where at least one of the subunits in an otherwise unitary state enjoys autonomy like a subunit within a federation, is similar to an associated state, with such subunit(s) having considerable independence in internal issues, except foreign affairs and defence. Yet in terms of international law it is a completely different situation because the subunits are not independent international entities and have no potential right to independence.\n\nThe Commonwealth of the Philippines was the first associated state of the United States. From 1935 to 1946, the foreign affairs and military of the Philippine commonwealth were handled by the United States although it was otherwise constitutionally separate and independent in domestic matters.\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia (since 1986), the Marshall Islands (since 1986), and Palau (since 1994) are associated with the United States under what is known as the Compact of Free Association, giving the states international sovereignty and ultimate control over their territory. However, the governments of those areas have agreed to allow the United States to provide defense; the U.S. federal government fund grants an access to U.S. social services for citizens of these areas. The United States benefits from its ability to use the islands as strategic military bases.\n\nThe Cook Islands and Niue have the status of \"self-government in free association\". New Zealand cannot legislate for them, and in some situations they are considered sovereign states. In foreign relations both interact as sovereign states, and they have been allowed to sign on as a state to UN treaties and bodies. New Zealand does not consider them to be constitutionally sovereign states due to their continued use of New Zealand citizenship. Both have established their own nationality and immigration regimes.\n\nTokelau (a dependent territory of New Zealand) voted on a referendum in February 2006 to determine whether it wanted to remain a New Zealand territory or become the third state in free association with New Zealand. While a majority of voters chose free association, the vote did not meet the two-thirds threshold needed for approval. A repeat referendum in October 2007 under United Nations supervision yielded similar results, with the proposed free association falling 16 votes short of approval.\n\nOther situations exist where one state has power over another political unit. A dependent territory is an example of this, where an area has its own political system and often internal self-government, but does not have overall sovereignty. In a loose form of association, some sovereign states cede some power to other states, often in terms of foreign affairs and/or defence.\n\nThe foreign affairs of Bhutan, a Himalayan Buddhist monarchy, were partially handled by the neighbouring republic India (from 1949), in a loose form of association, although Bhutan is otherwise constitutionally separate and independent in all other matters. A similar relationship existed between Sikkim and India from 1950 until 1975, when Sikkim became a state of India.\n\nAccording to a law of the Republic of Tatarstan (1990â2000) and the Treaty of Mutual Delegation of Powers between it and the Russian Federation (1994), from 1994 to 2000 Tatarstan was considered a sovereign state under international law, but associated with Russia.\n\nAccording to statements of officials of Abkhazia and Transnistria (self-proclaimed partially recognized republics seceded from the former USSR's constitutive republics of Georgia and Moldova), both intend after recognition of their independence to become associated states of the Russian Federation. In Transnistria a referendum took place in September 2006, in which secession from Moldova and \"future free association\" with Russia was approved by a margin of 97%, even though the results of the referendum were internationally unrecognized.\n\nA formal association existed under the Associated Statehood Act 1967 between the United Kingdom and the six West Indies Associated States. These were former British colonies in the Caribbean: Antigua (1967â1981), Dominica (1967â1978), Grenada (1967â1974), Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla (1967â1983), Saint Lucia (1967â1979), and Saint Vincent (1969â1979). Under this arrangement, each state had full control over its constitution. The United Nations never determined whether these associated states had achieved a full measure of self-government within the meaning of the United Nations Charter and General Assembly resolutions. Within a few years after the status of associated state was created, all six of the former associated states requested and were granted full independence, except for Anguilla within the former St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla union, which separated from the associated state before independence and remains a United Kingdom dependent territory.\n\nThe existence of free relationship based on both delegation of sovereignty and benign protection can be seen as a defining feature of microstates. According to the definition of microstates proposed by Dumienski (2014): \"Microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.\" Adopting this approach permits separating microstates from both small states and autonomies or dependencies. Microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as Bhutan, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco, Vatican City, Andorra, Niue, the Cook Islands, or Palau.\n\n"}
{"id": "2104462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104462", "title": "Baasskap", "text": "Baasskap\n\nBaasskap was a concept referring to white supremacy in South Africa which was used during apartheid. The word literally translates from Afrikaans to English as \"boss-ship\", but a more applicable translation is \"domination\", or \"white supremacy\" and it referred to the domination by white Afrikaners of South Africa.\n\nProponents of \"baasskap\" (who constituted the largest faction of apartheid ideologues in the National Party, and state institutions) applied segregation in a systematic way, in order to preserve racial purity, and to allow for the domination of Afrikaners in the economic and political spheres. However, proponents of \"baasskap\" were not opposed to black South African participation in the economy, as long as black labour was controlled in a manner that preserved the economic domination of Afrikaners.\n\nProminent proponents of \"baasskap\" included J.G. Strydom, Prime Minister from 1954 to 1958, and C.R. Swart, Minister of Justice. Hendrik Verwoerd had sympathy for the \"purist\" faction of apartheid ideologues, which opposed economic integration of Africans (in contrast to supporters of \"baasskap\" who were more concerned with white domination in an integrated economy). Nonetheless, Verwoerd provided the hitherto crude concept of \"baasskap\" with a veneer of intellectual respectability.\n"}

{"id": "90008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90008", "title": "Creole peoples", "text": "Creole peoples\n\nCreole people are ethnic groups which originated during the colonial-era from racial mixing between Europeans and non-European peoples, known as creolisation. These groups are typically descended from White Western European colonial settlers, West African slaves, Haitians and indigenous peoples of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Creole peoples vary widely in ethnic background and mixture, and many have since developed distinct ethnic identities. The development of creole languages is attributed to, but independent of, the emergence of creole ethnic identities.\n\nThe English word \"creole\" derives from the French \"crÃ©ole\", which in turn came from Portuguese \"crioulo\", a diminutive of \"cria\" meaning a person (especially a servant) raised in one's house. \"Cria\" is derived from \"criar\", meaning \"to raise or bring up,\", itself derived from the Latin \"creare\", meaning \"to make, bring forth, produce, beget\". Creole is also known by cognates in other languages, such as crioulo, criollo, creolo, crÃ©ole, kriolu, criol, kreyol, kreol, kriol, krio, and kriyoyo.\n\nThe following ethnic groups have been historically characterized as \"creole\" peoples:\n\nPeople of mixed Alaska Native American and Russian ancestry are Creole, sometimes colloquially spelled \"Kriol\". The intermingling of \"promyshlenniki\" men with Aleut and Alutiiq women in the late 18th century gave rise to a people who assumed a prominent position in the economy of Russian Alaska and the north Pacific rim.\n\nDuring the early settlement of the colonies, children born of immigrants in the colonies were often referred to as \"Creole\". This is found more often in the Chesapeake Colonies.\n\nIn the United States, the word \"Creole\" refers to people of any race or mixture thereof who are descended from colonial French La Louisiane and colonial Spanish Louisiana (New Spain) settlers before the Louisiana region became part of the United States in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase. Both the word and the ethnic group derive from a similar usage, which began in the 16th Century, in the Caribbean that distinguished people born in the French, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies from the various new arrivals born in their respective, non-Caribbean homelands. Some writers from other parts of the country have mistakenly assumed the term to refer only to people of mixed racial descent, but this is not the traditional Louisiana usage. In Louisiana, originally Creole was only used to describe people of French and then Spanish descent who were born in Louisiana and used the term to distinguish themselves from newly arrived immigrants. Later, the terms were differentiated further after the emergence of a newly mixed-race group that began to share the usage of the identity, as well as newly arriving Anglo-Americans lumping whites, mixed and blacks into a general francophone \"Creole\" cultural group. The later distinctions were French Creole (European ancestry), Creole of Color (someone of mixed racial ancestry), and sometimes slaves were referred to as Black Creole (meaning someone of primarily African descendant). There were also Spanish Creoles, but most in the city of New Orleans were integrated into the French Creole group as time went on, and ultimately both origins formed an indistinguishable \"Latin\" combination. However, Spanish Creoles survive today in Louisiana just outside of the city of New Orleans as the IsleÃ±os and MalagueÃ±os, both found in southern Louisiana. These distinctions were of the various groups in the Creole culture of Louisiana, especially that of New Orleans. Formally, in the early years of New Orleans, whites of French and Spanish descent were defined as the White Creoles and mixed racial people were described as free people of color and slaves were described as Creole slaves, meaning a possession of the Creoles (full European descent). However, all racial categories of Creoles - from Caucasian, mixed racial, African, to Native American - tended to think and refer to themselves solely as Creole, a commonality in many other Francophone and Iberoamerican cultures, who tend to lack strict racial separations common in United States History and other countries with large populations from Northern Europe's various cultures. This more racially neutral quality still persists to modern day as many Creoles do not use race as factor for being a part of the ethno-culture. \n\nContemporary usage has broadened the meaning of Louisiana Creoles to describe a broad cultural group of people of all races who share a French and Spanish background. Louisianans who identify themselves as \"Creole\" are most commonly from historically Francophone and Hispanic communities. Some of their ancestors came to Louisiana directly from France, Spain and others came via the French and Spanish colonies in the Caribbean and Canada. Many Louisiana Creole families arrived in Louisiana from Saint-Domingue as refugees from the Haitian Revolution, along with other immigrants from Caribbean colonial centers like Santo Domingo and Havana. The center of Creole culture in Louisiana is now focused on a combination between the two European based cultures, along with the Native American and African influences brought on through the centuries. \n\nSpoken Creole is dying with the dissolution of Creole families and continued 'Americanization' in the area. Most remaining Creole lexemes have drifted into popular culture. Traditional French Creole is spoken among those families determined to keep the language alive or in regions below New Orleans around St. James and St. John Parishes where German immigrants originally settled (also known as 'the German Coast', or La CÃ´te des Allemands) and cultivated the land, keeping the ill-equipped French Colonists from starvation during the Colonial Period and adopting commonly spoken French and Creole French (arriving with the exiles) as a language of trade.\n\nCreoles are largely Roman Catholic and influenced by traditional French and Spanish culture left from the first Colonial Period, officially beginning in 1722 with the arrival of the Ursuline Nuns, who were preceded by another order, the sisters of the Sacred Heart, with whom they lived until their first convent could be built with monies from the French Crown. (Both orders still educate girls in 2010). The \"fiery Latin temperament\" described by early scholars on New Orleans culture made sweeping generalizations to accommodate Creoles of Spanish heritage as well as the original French. The mixed race creoles, descendants of mixing of European colonists, slaves and Native Americans or sometimes 'Gens de Couleur' (free men and women of colour), began during the colonial periods with the arrival of slave populations. All Creoles, regardless of race, are a group of collective cultures known as \"Creole\", though many non-Louisianans do not distinguish between the two groups Creole groups, those of full European descent and those of mixed race. They do not recognize the distinctions made in the New Orleans area between the original white colonists whose offspring were the original first born Creoles in Louisiana and those that were a mixture of people of European ancestry and slave populations (or free men and women of color).\n\nThey were also referred to as 'criollos', a word from the Spanish language meaning \"created\" and used in the post-French governance period to distinguish the two groups of New Orleans area and down river Creoles. Both mixed race and European Creole groups share many traditions and language, but their socio-economic roots differed in the original period of Louisiana history. Actually the French word Creole is derived from the Portuguese word Crioulo, which described Spaniards born in the Americas as opposed to Spain.\n\nThe term is also often used to mean simply \"pertaining to the New Orleans area\".\n\nLouisianians descended from the French Acadians of Canada are technically creoles in a strict sense but are more commonly referred to as, and identify as, 'Cajuns' - a derivation of the word Acadian, indicating French Canadian settlers as ancestors. The distinction between \"Cajuns\" and \"Creoles\" is stronger today than it was in the past because American racial ideologies have strongly influenced the meaning of the word \"Creole\" to the extent that there is no longer unanimous agreement among Louisianians on the word's precise definition. Today, many assume that any francophone person of European descent is Cajun and any francophone of African descent is Creoleâa false assumption that would not have been recognized in the nineteenth century. Some assert that \"Creole\" refers to aristocratic urbanites whereas \"Cajuns\" are agrarian members of the francophone working class, but this is another untrue distinction. Creoles may be of any race and live in any area, rural or urban. The Creole culture of Southwest Louisiana is thus more similar to the culture dominant in Acadiana than it is to the Creole culture of New Orleans. Though the land areas overlap around New Orleans and down river, Cajun/Creole culture and language extend westward all along the southern coast of Louisiana, concentrating in areas southwest of New Orleans around Lafayette, and as far as Crowley, Abbeville and into the rice belt of Louisiana nearer Lake Charles and the Texas border.\n\nThe parishes of Pointe Coupee, Evangeline and Avoyelles are largely Creole, although many inhabitants self-identify as \"Cajun\" despite lacking Acadian ancestry. Today, the Parish of Avoyelles probably has one of the largest percentages of French Creole descendants in its population, according to www.avoyelles.com\n\nMississippi Gulf Coast has a significant population of Creoles -especially in Pass Christian, Gulfport, Biloxi, Pascagoula, and surrounding areas. Here, Creole is used to describe descendants of French or Spanish colonists with a mixed racial heritage -French or Spanish mixed with African American or Native American. The area was first settled by French colonists. In 1720, the capital of French Louisiana was Biloxi, MS. A community known as Creoletown is located in Pascagoula, MS -with it's history on record. Many in this location are Catholic and have also used Creole/French and English languages. \n\nTexas Gulf Coast have a significant population of Creole mostly in Southeast Texas areas such as (Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange). Southwestern Louisiana Creole language is mostly spoken in Southeastern Texas. \n\nThe \"crioulos\" of mixed Portuguese and African descent eventually gave rise to several major ethnic groups in Africa, especially in Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, SÃ£o TomÃ© e PrÃ­ncipe, Equatorial Guinea (especially Annobon Province), Ziguinchor (Casamance), Angola, Mozambique. Only a few of these groups have retained the name \"crioulo\" or variations of it:\n\n\nIn Brazil, the word \"crioulo\" initially denoted persons of Portuguese parentage who were born in Brazil (as distinct from colonists who were born in Portugal), as was the case in Portuguese-speaking Africa. During the slavery years, it eventually came to denote a person of primarily African ancestry born in Brazil. In colonial Brazil, it was common to refer to a Brazilian-born slave as a \"crioulo,\" whereas slaves from Africa were known as \"Africans\". \"Crioulo\" was used to refer to slaves born and raised in Brazil. Later, \"crioulos\" was used to refer to all people of African ancestry in Brazil, where many people were of mixed ethnicity. In modern-day Brazil, the word is considered pejorative in similar context to the N-word in the United States.\n\nIn regions that were formerly colonies of Spain, the Spanish word \"criollo\" (implying \"native\" or \"local\") historically denoted a class in the colonial caste system, comprising people born in the colonies but of totally or at least largely Spanish descent. The word came to refer to things distinctive of the region, as it is used today, in expressions such as \"comida criolla\" (\"country\" food from the area).\n\nIn the period of initial settlement of Latin America, the Spanish crown often passed over Criollos for the top military, administrative, and religious offices in the colonies in favor of the Spanish-born \"Peninsulares\" (literally \"born in the Iberian Peninsula\").\n\nThe word \"criollo\" is the origin and cognate of the French word \"creole\".\n\nThe racially based caste system was in force throughout the Spanish colonies in the Americas, since the 16th century. By the 19th century, this discrimination and the example of the American Revolution and the ideals of the Enlightenment eventually led the Spanish American Criollo elite to rebel against the Spanish rule. With the support of the lower classes, they engaged Spain in the Spanish American wars of independence (1810â1826), which ended with the break-up of former Spanish Empire in America into a number of independent republics.\n\nRacial mixture in the Spanish Philippines occurred mostly during the Spanish colonial period from the 16th to 19th century. The same Spanish racial caste system imposed in Latin America extended also to the Philippines, with a few major differences.\nPersons of pure Spanish descent born in the Spanish Philippines were those to whom the term \"Filipinos\" originally applied, though they were also called Insulares (\"islanders\", i.e. Spaniard born in the Philippine islands) or Criollos (\"Creoles\", i.e. [Philippine-born Spaniard] \"Locals\"). Persons of pure Spanish descent, along with many mestizos and castizos, living in the Philippines but born in Spanish America were classified as 'AmÃ©ricanos'. The Philippine-born children of 'AmÃ©ricanos' were classified as 'Filipinos'. During this era, the term \"Filipinos\" had not yet extended to include the majority indigenous Austronesian population of the Philippines to whom Filipinos has now shifted to imply. \n\nThe social stratification based on class that continues to this day in the Philippines has its beginnings in the Spanish colonial era with this caste system. Officially, however, the Spanish colonial caste system based on race was abolished after the Philippines' independence from Spain in 1898, and the word 'Filipino' expanded to include the entire population of the Philippines regardless of racial ancestry.\n\nIn many parts of the Southern Caribbean, the term Creole people is used to refer to the mixed-race descendents of Europeans and Africans born in the islands. Over time, there was intermarriage with residents from Asia as well. They eventually formed a common culture based on their experience of living together in islands colonized by the French, Spanish and English.\n\nA typical creole person from the Caribbean has French or Spanish ancestry, mixed with African and Native American. As workers from Asia entered the islands, Creole people of color intermarried with Tamil, Lebanese, Indian and Chinese. The latter combinations were especially common in Guadeloupe. The foods and cultures are the result of a creolization of these influences.\n\nCreole, \"KreyÃ²l\" or \"Kweyol\" also refers to the creole languages in the Caribbean, including Antillean Creole, Barbadian Creole, Belizean Creole, Jamaican Patois, Haitian Creole, Bahamian Creole, Trinidadian Creole, Guyanese Creole, and among others.\n\nPeople speak Antillean Creole on the following islands:\nSt. Lucia,\nMartinique,\nDominica,\nGuadeloupe,\nSt. Martin,\nSaint-BarthÃ©lemy,\nFrench Guiana,\nand Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nThe usage of creole in the islands of the southwest of the Indian Ocean varies according to the island. In Mauritius, the term Creole refers to colored people which have the ancestry of Africans with some French & Indian blood. The term also indicates the same to the people of RÃ©union and Seychelles.\n\nIn all three societies, creole also refers to the new languages derived from French and incorporating other languages.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47664661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47664661", "title": "Education inequality in China", "text": "Education inequality in China\n\nEducation inequality in China exists on multiple levels, with significant disparities occurring along gender, geographical, and ethnic divides. More specifically, disparities exist in the distribution of educational resources nationwide, as well as the availability of education on levels ranging from basic to higher education.\n\nShortly after the Chinese Revolution of 1949, the Communist government was confronted with heavy educational disparities across the nation. In the years following the Chinese Revolution, the Chinese government attempted to address these disparities with alternating approaches, creating periods of differing emphasis on opposing educational models. The first model, based on egalitarianism, emphasizes equality across regions of varying economic wealth and development. Conversely, the second model, based on competition, emphasizes individualistic competition, rationalizing any existing educational disparities as a necessary sacrifice for national economic development.\n\nThe Chinese government also focused educational policies on higher education and specialized training, leaving basic education underdeveloped throughout large parts of the country. Government funding for education was reserved for urban areas; rural communities, already at an economic disadvantage, were left to fund their own schools, exacerbating the already existing divide between urban and rural education. When collectivization policies passed in 1955, placing rural families into agricultural cooperatives that distributed income on the basis of labor hours, the importance of education dropped even further within these rural communities, and they were much less likely to fund primary education for the children of their communities.\n\nAlso beginning in the 1950s, the \"hukou\" system assigned the Chinese population into urban and rural regions, exacerbating continuously worsening inequalities within health, employment, housing, and education. Further complicating education policy, people of rural-\"hukou\" status are able to live and work in urban areas without changing their \"hukou\" designation. According to Xiaogang Wu's tabulation, based on figures from the 2000 Chinese Census, an estimated 33% of city residents were actually designated as rural-\"hukou\" holders.\n\nA significant shift in education finance policy occurred in 1982 with the introduction of decentralization, in which provincial governments were now individually in control of financing education within their region. The change in policy sought to capitalize on rapid income growth by funding education from non-governmental sources, and in the 1980s and 1990s, the government share of education expenditures dropped even as total education expenditures increased. As a result, families had to pay increased tuition and fees, and schools turned to surcharges and social contributions to fund themselves. Education for children of poorer families was only attainable with state subsidies, which often did not reach the families who were most in need. Tuition and fees also increase as students move from lower to higher grade levels, so even if these poorer students were able to move through the education system, many were prevented from even completing their compulsory education by economic barriers. Additionally, this shift to a wider financial base for education also coincided with rising interprovincial inequality, significantly impairing education opportunities for children in poorly developed rural provinces.\n\nAlthough basic education policies remain in control of the Communist Party, increased open-mindedness shown by party authorities indicates the possibility of more substantial educational reform, in addition to recent reforms to the national college entrance examination. Although educational inequality has lessened overall, great gaps in educational attainment still exist between populations on multiple divides, affirming the need for a regional focus within reform initiatives.\n\nAlthough recent studies have shown reductions in gender inequality within Chinese education since the 1980s, disparities still remain across different regions of China. Studies have indicated that education in rural areas of China shows significantly greater gender disparity than education in urban areas. Since 1981, the rural illiteracy rate of females has consistently been over twice that of males, despite an overall decrease in illiteracy in rural regions.\n\nHowever, with rapid economic growth, the increase of parental income enables more children to obtain at least a basic education, and this greatly increases chances of girls going to school as well. Previously, it was common for parents to prioritize the education of sons over that of their daughters; with greater opportunities, the demand for female education can be easier satisfied, fueling an increase in the actual demand for female education as well.\n\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to the existing disparities between urban and rural education, with the latter lagging far behind the former as a result of economic, social, and political disparities. In China, the household registration system separates citizens into urban residence and rural residence. The underfunding of rural schools, inadequate government efforts to provide financial aid for rural students, and the current household registration system all contribute to the urban-rural educational divide.\n\nInterprovincial inequality in school funding has increased, along with increased dependence in non-budgeted funding sources. Research indicates that the disparity between provincial primary educational expenditures per student nearly doubled between 1990 and 2000. Additionally, while overall illiteracy rates have dropped since 1980, the disparity between urban and rural illiteracy rates continued to increase, with the rural illiteracy rate double that of urban areas in 2000.\n\nAnother recent problem causing regional education disparity is the migration of a large portion of China's rural population into urban areas. In many rural regions, particularly within smaller rural towns, this decrease in population also creates problems for schools. As a result, to confront drastic increases in enrollment, many schools consolidate students of multiple grade levels into multigrade classes, a practice that not only challenges teachers, but also negatively affects the quality of education that students receive. \n\nAs a result of the vast numbers of rural workers migrating to the cities to find employment opportunities, many children are left behind, keeping these children in rural schools that still lag far behind their urban counterparts. For rural children who do follow their parents to urban areas, the \"hukou\" system bars them from attending urban public schools; these children often must attend private schools that charge higher tuition even while offering subpar education.\n\nThe population of China mainly consists of the Han ethnic majority, with 55 ethnic minorities accounting for around 8% of the total population. However, this small minority population accounts for almost half of China's absolute poor, highlighting the severe income inequality that exists between China's majority Han population and numerous minority groups. At the same time, research indicates that minority education attainment in urban areas, such as Beijing, is on par with Han population attainment. \n\nWhile overall enrollment rates have risen for both the Han Chinese population and the Chinese minority population, minority enrollment rates remain lower than that of the Han majority population. Aside from enrollment rates, ethnic disparities in education have also manifested in the form of cultural marginalization, especially with the emergence of state-sponsored curriculum that enforces assimilation. To preserve individual cultures and languages, many ethnic groups have created multilingual school systems.\n\nEducation heavily influences social and economic mobility, with research indicating that higher levels of parental education positively influence their children's levels of education. This connection is especially significant within rural communities, with education playing a large role in breaking the vicious cycle of poverty.\n\nHowever, Guangjie Ning's contrasting analysis of existing research suggests that income inequality and education equality are mutually reinforcing factors, perpetuating a vicious cycle of their own. Therefore, by Ning's logic, in accordance with the popular perception of education as a means of escape from poverty, children from poorer families theoretically need education the most, yet encounter greater economic barriers that prevent continuation of education.\n\nCurrently, variations in education policy across different levels of schooling continue to contribute to educational inequality. Even within the same region, school attendance and tuition are regulated differently, often causing confusion for families new to the education system.\n\nBeginning in the early 1980s, grades 1-6 have been designated as compulsory education; it was not until the mid-1990s that grades 7-9 were also designated as compulsory. This regulation of earlier education was enhanced by the elimination of tuition for grades 1-9 in the early 2000s, and in recent years, the poor are now able to obtain subsidies for the education of their children. This system of 9 year compulsory education has been partially successful in rural areas, with regions reporting very high primary-level enrollment and completion rates. However, grades 10-12 have not been designated as compulsory, and high secondary-level dropout rates break the 9 year compulsory education cycle even earlier. Additionally, in rural areas, the tuition for public high school is comparatively higher than that of most other developing countries, further discouraging rural households from focusing their income on upper secondary education.\n\nAdditionally, as a result of Chinaâs large population, college enrollment slots are still restricted in availability, with tuition so high that the costs far dwarf the income of a typical family in poverty. Recent efforts to expand college education availability, coupled with increasing emphasis on scholarships and loans, may help counter rising tuition costs (and other income-related barriers to higher education). Despite tuition challenges, more and more students have been able to graduate from college, with the number of college graduates quadrupling in the past decade.\n\nAs an attempt to level the playing field, the \"gaokao\", or Chinese university examination, offered extra points for students of ethnic minority backgrounds, although this was scaled back in recent 2014 reforms to national examination policy after multiple cases of ethnicity alteration prompted national backlash. The new reforms also included provisions for provincial quotas, requiring universities to reserve a designated number of admission seats for students from outside of the universityâs region.\n\n"}

On 25 February 1634, a group of Irish and Scottish officers acting under the approval of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor assassinated generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein and a group of his companions in the town of Eger (today Cheb, Czech Republic). The assassins were equated to executioners by a royal decree and rewarded with property confiscated from the families of their victims. The purge continued through the persecution of other high-ranking military personnel who were seen as Wallenstein's supporters.\n\nAlbrecht von Wallenstein was born on 24 September 1584, into the noble Bohemian Waldstein family. On 28 August 1599, he enrolled into the University of Altdorf but was soon expelled due to his involvement in brawls. He spent the next couple of years traveling around Europe. In 1604, he enlisted as an ensign into the military of the Holy Roman Empire. He fought during the closing stage of the Long Turkish War, rising to the rank of colonel by the outbreak of Bocskai uprising during which he commanded a unit of Bohemian Estates militia. In 1607, he became the chamberlain of Ferdinand of Styria, future Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. In May 1609, he married Lucretia ViÄkov, a widow of considerable means who died in 1614 granting Wallenstein her property. Wallenstein had previously secured his fortune by converting from the Protestant Unity of the Brethren denomination to Catholicism during the ongoing Recatholicazation campaign in Bohemia.\n\nAt the outbreak of the 1618 Bohemian Revolt he demonstrated his loyalty to the crown by fighting his former coreligionists represented by the Bohemian Estates. A unit of cuirassiers whom he had recruited at his own expense fought at the decisive Battle of White Mountain which ended the revolt in the crown's favor. In 1623, Wallenstein married Elizabeth von Harrach the daughter of Karl von Harrach an influential member of emperor Ferdinand's Geheimrat (Privy Council). Harrach's two other daughters married Adam Erdmann TrÄka von LÃ­pa and Wallenstein's cousin Max von Waldstein. Wallenstein's newly acquired connections and riches enabled him to purchase vast estates formerly belonging to rebel barons, loan the emperor vast sums of money and raise thousands of troops. He campaigned extensively during the Thirty Years' War repelling incursions by the pretender to the Hungarian throne Gabriel Bethlen, defeating the Mansfeldian army in the Palatinate campaign of 1623. Those successes were followed by victories against the Danes between 1626 and 1628 which ended their intervention into the war. In February 1628, Wallenstein wrote off 4,750,000 florins of debt to the imperial treasury, in exchange he was elevated into an imperial prince and received the Duchy of Mecklenburg. While his army was now triple the size of that of the Catholic League, the empire's biggest ally. His meteoric rise to power was unprecedented in its scale became increasingly controversial among the members of the League who feared that their own possessions might be confiscated shall they disobey the emperor's command.\n\nIn July 1630, the Catholic League used the opportunity of the Regensburg Electoral Congress to demand Wallenstein's dismissal. Wallenstein's reluctance to participate in the life of the court allowed his opponents to spread malicious rumors about him. Such as his supposed ambitions to take the imperial throne for himself. Notably the Habsburg Spanish faction of the court was enraged at his failure to intervene into the Eighty Years' War. Bowing to outside pressure Ferdinand dismissed the general on 13 August. The Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War that took place on the same year swung the balance of power against the empire. Many still saw the former generalissimo as the only military commander capable of maintaining a balance among the opposing forces, his reinstatement was thus formalized on 13 April 1632. Wallenstein spent most of the following year campaigning separately from his senior officers who operated autonomously, many of whom avoided him for fear of his rage outbursts. An axis of his opponents within the army began corresponding in encoded messages, criticizing his passive approach and the lack of opportunities for promotion stemming from it. Ferdinand found his responses to criticism inadequate and the two disagreed on the number of issues such as the unsanctioned release of the captured Protestant general JindÅich MatyÃ¡Å¡ Thurn and Wallenstein's refusal to conduct offensives during the winter months.\n\nWallenstein was increasingly criticized for his passivity in face of a Swedish incursion into Bavaria and the collapse of Lorraine under French pressure. His dislike of courtly life and the influence exerted by the church upon the emperor created an axis of undercover opposition that launched a smear campaign against him. On 11 January 1634, Gundakar, Prince of Liechtenstein sent Ferdinand II an official request, recommending Wallenstein's liquidation. A day later, Wallenstein summoned his colonels to sign the First Pilsner Reverse, a declaration of personal loyalty, 49 of them signed immediately while Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch and Scherffenberg gathered signatures in Silesia and Upper Austria respectively. Numerous commanders signed the Reverse so as not to arouse suspicion, while at the same time a party centered around Ottavio Piccolomini began circulating an anonymous tract that summarized the army's grudges against Wallenstein. On 17 February, Scherffenberg was arrested in Vienna. On 18 February, a second patent was released accusing Wallenstein of conspiracy and condemning him to death, its publication was delayed so as not to split the army in two. Wallenstein's letters refuting the accusations against him remained unanswered, after realizing that the emperor was positioning troops in such a manner as to surround him he decided to flee to the Swedes. \n\nWallenstein, Christian von Ilow and other loyal officers departed from their headquarters on 22 February along with 1,300 men. Irish colonel Walter Butler, the leader of a group of Irish and Scottish officers hired by Piccolomini to assassinate Wallenstein, was ordered by the unsuspecting general to follow them with his 900 dragoons. On 24 February, Wallenstein reached Eger, most of the trusted troops camped outside of the town as it was already garrisoned Butler's dragoons and other anti-Wallenstein elements.. The following day Ilow held a series of meetings with the would be assassins trying to persuade them to remain loyal to their commander. They made the decision to go on with Piccolomini's plan, fearing that they would be branded as rebels should they fail to do so. At 6.00 p.m., Wallenstein's inner circle consisting of Ilow, TrÄka von LÃ­pa, VilÃ©m KinskÃ½ and Captain Niemann were invited by the conspirators to the city's castle for a formal dinner. During the course of the dinner a servant nodded indicating that the conspirators were ready. Six dragoons burst into the dining hall shouting \"Who is a good Imperialist?\", Butler, John Gordon and Walter Leslie rose from the table yelling \"Long live Ferdinand!\". KinskÃ½ was killed immediately, although he made a desperate attempt to fight back. Ilow grabbed his sword and charged at Gordon; before being able to strike he was knocked to the ground by the dragoons and killed, others met a similar fate. Wallenstein was killed in his residence at 10.00 p.m. An imperial decree equated the participants of the perpetrators of the Eger Bloodbath with executioners. \n\nOn 1 March, the commander of the Troppau garrison (an officer under Schaffgotsch's command) declared his allegiance to Wallenstein, unaware of what had previously happened. An investigation into the incident proved that Schaffgotsch was not implicated the uprising. In the second half of April, he was sent to Vienna upon his request, where he continued to be interrogated. On 31 March 1635, Schaffgotsch was convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the emperor and sentenced to death. Schaffgotsch pleaded not guilty citing the fact that Wallenstein was not officially relieved of his command and as such he was obliged to follow his orders. On 4 July, presiding judge Heinrich von Schlick ordered the use of torture which failed to produce a confession of guilt. A day later, the emperor confirmed the death sentence which was implemented on the morning of 24 July 1635. Schaffgotsch's execution was part of larger purge that included the execution of the Troppau garrison commander and the demotion and the temporary imprisonment of seven generals including , all of the convicted were signatories of the Pilsner Reverse. \n\n"}

Though the song, like most Gloria Trevi songs of the day, used indirect references, \"El Recuento De Los DaÃ±os\" became well known for its music video aired on public television that broke taboos while bolting out lyrics explaining the depths of violence against women, in a heavily machismo and still traditional Mexico of 1994.\n\nThough technically a love-related song, it exposed the taboo and hitherto unspoken practice of men punching pregnant women they conceived out of wedlock in order to kill the fetus (\"del firme impacto de tus manos\", \"the firm impact of your hands\") by purposely eye opening lyrics. The music video shows a girl with blood drenching her swollen abdomen (a miscarriage), as well as a child abduction. The lyrics at the beginning of the chorus also goes \"Yo no puedo reponerme de ese beso que me subio al cielo, que es el mismo que ahora me hunde en el infierno\" (\"I cannot recover from that kiss that took me to Heaven, the same one which now plunges me to hell\").\n\nLater, Trevi herself was sentenced to jail for conspiring with director Sergio Andrade to sexually abuse women.

{"id": "10111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10111", "title": "Emperor", "text": "Emperor\n\nAn emperor (through Old French \"empereor\" from Latin \"imperator\") is a monarch, and usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (empress consort), mother (empress dowager), or a woman who rules in her own right (empress regnant). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe, the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages, considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as Emperor.\n\nBoth emperors and kings are monarchs, but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles. In as much as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation, therefore a king might be obliged to pay tribute to another ruler, or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion, but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints. However, monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contextsâthe British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the incorporation of India, though she was declared Empress of India.\n\nIn Western Europe, the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the Holy Roman Emperor, whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of \"\", i.e. they claimed succession to the authority of the Western Roman Emperors, thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology. Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy, by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states. Although technically an elective title, by the late 16th century the imperial title had in practice come to be inherited by the Habsburg Archdukes of Austria and following the Thirty Years' War their control over the states (outside the Habsburg Monarchy, i.e. Austria, Bohemia and various territories outside the empire) had become nearly non-existent. However, Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned Emperor of the French in 1804 and was shortly followed by Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, who declared himself Emperor of Austria in the same year. The position of Holy Roman Emperor nonetheless continued until Francis II abdicated that position in 1806. In Eastern Europe, the monarchs of Russia also used \"translatio imperii\" to wield imperial authority as successors to the Eastern Roman Empire. Their status was officially recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547. However, the Russian emperors are better known by their Russian-language title of Tsar even after Peter the Great adopted the title of Emperor of All Russia in 1721.\n\nHistorians have liberally used emperor and empire anachronistically and out of its Roman and European context to describe any large state from the past or the present. Such pre-Roman titles as Great King or King of Kings, used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent. Sometimes this reference has even extended to non-monarchically ruled states and their spheres of influence such as the Athenian Empire of the late 5th century BC, the Angevin Empire of the Plantagenets and the Soviet and American \"empires\" of the Cold War era. However, such \"empires\" did not need to be headed by an \"emperor\". Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century.\n\nFor purposes of protocol, emperors were once given precedence over kings in international diplomatic relations, but currently precedence amongst heads of state who are sovereignsâwhether they be kings, queens, emperors, empresses, princes, princesses and to a lesser degree presidentsâis determined by the duration of time that each one has been continuously in office. Outside the European context, emperor was the translation given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in diplomatic terms. In reciprocity, these rulers might accredit equal titles in their native languages to their European peers. Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.\n\nIn the Roman tradition a large variety in the meaning and importance of the imperial form of monarchy developed: in \"intention\" it was always the highest office, but it could as well fall down to a redundant title for nobility that had never been near to the \"Empire\" they were supposed to be reigning. Also the \"name\" of the position split in several branches of Western tradition, see below.\n\nThe importance and meaning of coronation ceremonies and regalia also varied within the tradition: for instance Holy Roman Emperors could only be crowned emperor by the Pope, which meant the coronation ceremony usually took place in Rome, often several years after these emperors had ascended to the throne (as \"king\") in their home country. The first Latin Emperors of Constantinople on the other hand had to be present in the newly conquered capital of their empire, because that was the only place where they could be granted to become emperor.\n\nEarly Roman Emperors avoided any type of ceremony or regalia different from what was already usual for republican offices in the Roman Republic: the most intrusive change had been changing the color of their robe to purple. Later new symbols of worldly and/or spiritual power, like the orb, became an essential part of the imperial accessories.\n\nRules for indicating successors also varied: there was a tendency towards \"male\" \"inheritance\" of the supreme office, but as well election by noblemen, as ruling empresses are known (for empires not too strictly under salic law). Ruling monarchs could additionally steer the succession by adoption, as often occurred in the two first centuries of Imperial Rome. Of course, intrigue, murder and military force could also mingle in for appointing successors; the Roman imperial tradition made no exception to other monarchical traditions in this respect. Probably the epoch best known for this part of the imperial tradition is Rome's third century rule.\n\nWhen Republican Rome turned into a \"de facto\" monarchy in the second half of the 1st century BC, at first there was no name for the title of the new type of monarch. Ancient Romans abhorred the name Rex (\"king\"), and it was critical to the political order to maintain the forms and pretenses of republican rule. Julius Caesar had been Dictator, an acknowledged and traditional office in Republican Rome. Caesar was not the first to hold it, but following his assassination the term was abhorred in Rome.\nAugustus, considered the first Roman emperor, established his hegemony by collecting on himself offices, titles, and honours of Republican Rome that had traditionally been distributed to different people, concentrating what had been distributed power in one man. One of these offices was \"princeps senatus\", (\"first man of the Senate\") and became changed into Augustus' chief honorific, \"princeps civitatis\" (\"first citizen\") from which the modern English word and title prince is descended. The first period of the Roman Empire, from 27 BC â 284 AD, is called the \"principate\" for this reason. However, it was the informal descriptive of \"Imperator\" (\"commander\") that became the title increasingly favored by his successors. Previously bestowed on high officials and military commanders who had \"imperium\", Augustus reserved it exclusively to himself as the ultimate holder of all \"imperium\". (\"Imperium\" is Latin for the authority to command, one of a various types of authority delineated in Roman political thought.)\n\nBeginning with Augustus, \"Imperator\" appeared in the title of all Roman monarchs through the extinction of the Empire in 1453. After the reign of Augustus' immediate successor Tiberius, being proclaimed \"imperator\" was transformed into the act of accession to the head of state. Other honorifics used by the Roman Emperors have also come to be synonyms for Emperor:\n\n\nAfter the turbulent Year of the four emperors in 69, the Flavian Dynasty reigned for three decades. The succeeding Nervan-Antonian Dynasty, ruling for most of the 2nd century, stabilised the Empire. This epoch became known as the era of the \"Five Good Emperors\", and was followed by the short-lived Severan Dynasty.\n\nDuring the Crisis of the 3rd century, Barracks Emperors succeeded one another at short intervals. Three short lived secessionist attempts had their own emperors: the Gallic Empire, the Britannic Empire, and the Palmyrene Empire though the latter used \"rex\" more regularly.\n\nThe Principate (27 BC â 284 AD) period was succeeded by what is known as the Dominate (284 AD â 527 AD), during which Emperor Diocletian tried to put the Empire on a more formal footing. Diocletian sought to address the challenges of the Empire's now vast geography and the instability caused by the informality of succession by the creation of co-emperors and junior emperors. At one point, there were as many as five sharers of the \"imperium\" (see: Tetrarchy). In 325 AD Constantine I defeated his rivals and restored single emperor rule, but following his death the empire was divided among his sons. For a time the concept was of one empire ruled by multiple emperors with varying territory under their control, however following the death of Theodosius I the rule was divided between his two sons and increasingly became separate entities. The areas administered from Rome are referred to by historians the Western Roman Empire and those under the immediate authority of Constantinople called the Eastern Roman Empire or (after the Battle of Yarmouk in 636 AD) the Later Roman or Byzantine Empire. The subdivisions and co-emperor system were formally abolished by Emperor Zeno in 480 AD following the death of Julius Nepos last Western Emperor and the ascension of Odoacer as the \"de facto\" King of Italy in 476 AD.\n\nHistorians generally refer to the continuing Roman Empire in the east as the Byzantine Empire after Byzantium, the original name of the town that Constantine I would elevate to the Imperial capital as New Rome in AD 330. (The city is more commonly called Constantinople and is today named Istanbul). Although the empire was again subdivided and a co-emperor sent to Italy at the end of the fourth century, the office became unitary again only 95 years later at the request of the Roman Senate and following the death of Julius Nepos, last Western Emperor. This change was a recognition of the reality that little remained of Imperial authority in the areas that had been the Western Empire, with even Rome and Italy itself now ruled by the essentially autonomous Odoacer.\n\nThese Later Roman \"Byzantine\" Emperors completed the transition from the idea of the Emperor as a semi-republican official to the Emperor as an absolute monarch. Of particular note was the translation of the Latin \"Imperator\" into the Greek \"Basileus\", after Emperor Heraclius changed the official language of the empire from Latin to Greek in AD 620. Basileus, a title which had long been used for Alexander the Great was already in common usage as the Greek word for the Roman emperor, but its definition and sense was \"King\" in Greek, essentially equivalent with the Latin \"Rex\". Byzantine period emperors also used the Greek word \"autokrator\", meaning \"one who rules himself\", or \"monarch\", which was traditionally used by Greek writers to translate the Latin \"dictator\". Essentially, the Greek language did not incorporate the nuances of the Ancient Roman concepts that distinguished \"imperium\" from other forms of political power.\n\nIn general usage, the Byzantine imperial title evolved from simply \"emperor\" (\"basileus\"), to \"emperor of the Romans\" (\"basileus tÅn RÅmaiÅn\") in the 9th century, to \"emperor and autocrat of the Romans\" (\"basileus kai autokratÅr tÅn RÅmaiÅn\") in the 10th. In fact, none of these (and other) additional epithets and titles had ever been completely discarded.\n\nOne important distinction between the post Constantine I (reigned AD 306â337) emperors and their pagan predecessors was cesaropapism, the assertion that the Emperor (or other head of state) is also the head of the Church. Although this principle was held by all emperors after Constantine, it met with increasing resistance and ultimately rejection by bishops in the west after the effective end of Imperial power there. This concept became a key element of the meaning of \"emperor\" in the Byzantine and Orthodox east, but went out of favor in the west with the rise of Roman Catholicism.\n\nThe Byzantine empire also produced three women who effectively governed the state: the Empress Irene and the Empresses Zoe and Theodora.\n\nIn 1204 Constantinople fell to the Venetians and the Franks in the Fourth Crusade. Following the tragedy of the horrific sacking of the city, the conquerors declared a new \"Empire of Romania\", known to historians as the Latin Empire of Constantinople, installing Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, as Emperor. However, Byzantine resistance to the new empire meant that it was in constant struggle to establish itself. Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos succeeded in recapturing Constantinople in 1261. The Principality of Achaea, a vassal state the empire had created in Morea (Greece) intermittently continued to recognize the authority of the crusader emperors for another half century. Pretenders to the title continued among the European nobility until circa 1383.\n\nWith Constantinople occupied, claimants to the imperial succession styled themselves as emperor in the chief centers of resistance: The Laskarid dynasty in the Empire of Nicaea, the Komnenid dynasty in the Empire of Trebizond and the Doukid dynasty in the Despotate of Epirus. In 1248, the Epirus recognized the Nicaean Emperors, who then recaptured Constantinople in 1261. The Trebizond emperor formally submitted in Constantinople in 1281, but frequently flouted convention by styling themselves emperor back in Trebizond thereafter.\n\nOttoman rulers held several titles denoting their Imperial status. These included: Sultan, Khan, Sovereign of the Imperial House of Osman, Sultan of Sultans, Khan of Khans, Commander of the Faithful and Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe, Protector of the Holy Cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem, Emperor of The Three Cities of Constantinople, Adrianopole and Bursa as well as many other cities and countries.\n\nAfter the Ottoman capture of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultans began to style themselves Kaysar-i Rum (Emperor of the Romans) as they asserted themselves to be the heirs to the Roman empire by right of conquest. The title was of such importance to them that it led them to eliminate the various Byzantine successor states â and therefore rival claimants â over the next eight years. Though the term \"emperor\" was rarely used by Westerners of the Ottoman sultan, it was generally accepted by Westerners that he had imperial status.\n\nThe \"Emperor\" of the Romans' title was a reflection of the \"translatio imperii\" (\"transfer of rule\") principle that regarded the Holy Roman Emperors as the inheritors of the title of Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, despite the continued existence of the Roman Empire in the east.\n\nFrom the time of Otto the Great onward, much of the former Carolingian kingdom of Eastern Francia became the Holy Roman Empire. The prince-electors elected one of their peers as King of the Romans and King of Italy before being crowned by the Pope. The Emperor could also pursue the election of his heir (usually a son) as King, who would then succeed him after his death. This junior King then bore the title of Roman King (King of the Romans). Although technically already ruling, after the election he would be crowned as emperor by the Pope. The last emperor to be crowned by the pope was Charles V; all emperors after him were technically \"emperors-elect\", but were universally referred to as \"Emperor\".\n\nThe first Austrian Emperor was the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. In the face of aggressions by Napoleon, Francis feared for the future of the Holy Roman Empire. He wished to maintain his and his family's Imperial status in the event that the Holy Roman Empire should be dissolved, as it indeed was in 1806 when an Austrian-led army suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz. After which, the victorious Napoleon proceeded to dismantle the old \"Reich\" by severing a good portion from the empire and turning it into a separate Confederation of the Rhine. With the size of his imperial realm significantly reduced, Francis II, \"Holy Roman Emperor\" became Francis I, \"Emperor of Austria\". The new imperial title may have sounded less prestigious than the old one, but Francis' dynasty continued to rule from Austria and a Habsburg monarch was still an emperor (\"Kaiser\"), and not just merely a king (\"KÃ¶nig\"), in name.\n\nThe title lasted just a little over one century until 1918, but it was never clear what territory constituted the \"Empire of Austria\". When Francis took the title in 1804, the Habsburg lands as a whole were dubbed the \"Kaisertum Ãsterreich\". \"Kaisertum\" might literally be translated as \"emperordom\" (on analogy with \"kingdom\") or \"emperor-ship\"; the term denotes specifically \"the territory ruled by an emperor\", and is thus somewhat more general than Reich, which in 1804 carried connotations of universal rule. Austria proper (as opposed to the complex of Habsburg lands as a whole) had been an Archduchy since the 15th century, and most of the other territories of the Empire had their own institutions and territorial history, although there were some attempts at centralization, especially during the reign of Marie Therese and her son Joseph II and then finalized in the early 19th century. When Hungary was given self-government in 1867, the non-Hungarian portions were called the Empire of Austria and were officially known as the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council (\"Reichsrat\")\". The title of Emperor of Austria and the associated Empire were both abolished at the end of the First World War in 1918, when German Austria became a republic and the other kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council established their independence or adhesion to other states.\n\nByzantium's close cultural and political interaction with its Balkan neighbors Bulgaria and Serbia, and with Russia (Kievan Rus', then Muscovy) led to the adoption of Byzantine imperial traditions in all of these countries.\n\nIn 913, Simeon I of Bulgaria was crowned Emperor (Tsar) by the Patriarch of Constantinople and imperial regent Nicholas Mystikos outside the Byzantine capital. In its final simplified form, the title read \"Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans\" (\"Tsar i samodarzhets na vsichki balgari i gartsi\" in the modern vernacular). The Roman component in the Bulgarian imperial title indicated both rulership over Greek speakers and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans, however this component was never recognised by the Byzantine court.\n\nByzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial title was revoked by the succeeding Byzantine government. The decade 914â924 was spent in destructive warfare between Byzantium and Bulgaria over this and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch, who had further irritated his Byzantine counterpart by claiming the title \"Emperor of the Romans\" (\"basileus tÅn RÅmaiÅn\"), was eventually recognized, as \"Emperor of the Bulgarians\" (\"basileus tÅn BoulgarÅn\") by the Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lakapenos in 924. Byzantine recognition of the imperial dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the Bulgarian patriarch was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian-Byzantine dynastic marriage in 927. In the meantime, the Bulgarian imperial title may have been also confirmed by the pope. The Bulgarian imperial title \"tsar\" was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule. 14th-century Bulgarian literary compositions clearly denote the Bulgarian capital (Tarnovo) as a successor of Rome and Constantinople, in effect, the \"Third Rome\".\n\nAfter Bulgaria obtained full independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1908, its monarch, who was previously styled \"Knyaz\", [prince], took the traditional title of \"Tsar\" [king] and was recognized internationally as such.\n\nThe kings of the \"Ancien RÃ©gime\" and the July Monarchy used the title \"Empereur de France\" in diplomatic correspondence and treaties with the Ottoman emperor from at least 1673 onwards. The Ottomans insisted on this elevated style while refusing to recognize the Holy Roman Emperors or the Russian tsars because of their rival claims of the Roman crown. In short, it was an indirect insult by the Ottomans to the HRE and the Russians. The French kings also used it for Morocco (1682) and Persia (1715).\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, who was already First Consul of the French Republic (\"Premier Consul de la RÃ©publique franÃ§aise\") for life, declared himself Emperor of the French (\"Empereur des FranÃ§ais\") on 18 May 1804, thus creating the French Empire (\"Empire FranÃ§ais\").\n\nNapoleon relinquished the title of Emperor of the French on 6 April and again on 11 April 1814.\nNapoleon's infant son, Napoleon II, was recognized by the Council of Peers, as Emperor from the moment of his father's abdication, and therefore reigned (as opposed to ruled) as Emperor for fifteen days, 22 June to 7 July 1815.\n\nSince 3 May 1814, the Sovereign Principality of Elba was created a miniature non-hereditary Monarchy under the exiled French Emperor Napoleon I. Napoleon I was allowed, by the treaty of Fontainebleau with (27 April), to enjoy, for life, the imperial title. The islands were \"not\" restyled an empire.\n\nOn 26 February 1815, Napoleon abandoned Elba for France, reviving the French Empire for a Hundred Days; the Allies declared an end to Napoleon's sovereignty over Elba on 25 March 1815, and on 31 March 1815 Elba was ceded to the restored Grand Duchy of Tuscany by the Congress of Vienna. After his final defeat, Napoleon was treated as a general by the British authorities during his second exile to Atlantic Isle of St. Helena. His title was a matter of dispute with the governor of St Helena, who insisted on addressing him as \"General Bonaparte\", despite the \"historical reality that he had been an emperor\" and therefore retained the title.\n\nNapoleon I's nephew, Napoleon III, resurrected the title of emperor on 2 December 1852, after establishing the Second French Empire in a presidential coup, subsequently approved by a plebiscite. His reign was marked by large scale public works, the development of social policy, and the extension of France's influence throughout the world. During his reign, he also set about creating the Second Mexican Empire (headed by his choice of Maximilian I of Mexico, a member of the House of Habsburg), to regain France's hold in the Americas and to achieve greatness for the 'Latin' race. Napoleon III was deposed on 4 September 1870, after France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. The Third Republic followed and after the death of his son Napoleon (IV), in 1879 during the Zulu War, the Bonapartist movement split, and the Third Republic was to last until 1940.\n\nThe origin of the title \"Imperator totius Hispaniae\" (Latin for \"Emperor of All Spain\") is murky. It was associated with the Leonese monarchy perhaps as far back as Alfonso the Great (\"r.\" 866â910). The last two kings of its Astur-Leonese dynasty were called emperors in a contemporary source.\n\nKing Sancho III of Navarre conquered Leon in 1034 and began using it. His son, Ferdinand I of Castile also took the title in 1039. Ferdinand's son, Alfonso VI of LeÃ³n and Castile took the title in 1077. It then passed to his son-in-law, Alfonso I of Aragon in 1109. His stepson and Alfonso VI's grandson, Alfonso VII was the only one who actually had an imperial coronation in 1135.\n\nThe title was not exactly hereditary but self-proclaimed by those who had, wholly or partially, united the Christian northern part of the Iberian Peninsula, often at the expense of killing rival siblings. The popes and Holy Roman emperors protested at the usage of the imperial title as a usurpation of leadership in western Christendom. After Alfonso VII's death in 1157, the title was abandoned, and the kings who used it are not commonly mentioned as having been \"emperors\", in Spanish or other historiography.\n\nAfter the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the legitimate heir to the throne, Andreas Palaiologos, willed away his claim to Ferdinand and Isabella in 1503.\n\nAfter the independence and proclamation of the Empire of Brazil from the Kingdom of Portugal by Prince Pedro, who became Emperor, in 1822, his father, King John VI of Portugal briefly held the honorific style of Titular Emperor of Brazil and the treatment of \"His Imperial and Royal Majesty\" under the 1825 Treaty of Rio de Janeiro, by which Portugal recognized the independence of Brazil. The style of Titular Emperor was a life title, and became extinct upon the holder's demise. John VI held the imperial title for a few months only, from the ratification of the Treaty in November 1825 until his death in March 1826. During those months, however, as John's imperial title was purely honorific while his son, Pedro I, remained the sole monarch of the Brazilian Empire.\n\nIn the late 3rd century, by the end of the epoch of the \"barracks emperors\" in Rome, there were two Britannic Emperors, reigning for about a decade. After the end of Roman rule in Britain, the Imperator Cunedda forged the Kingdom of Gwynedd in northern Wales, but all his successors were titled kings and princes.\n\nThere was no consistent title for the king of England before 1066, and monarchs chose to style themselves as they pleased. Imperial titles were used inconsistently, beginning with Athelstan in 930 and ended with the Norman conquest of England. Empress Matilda (1102â1167) is the only English monarch commonly referred to as \"emperor\" or \"empress\", but she acquired her title through her marriage to Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nDuring the rule of Henry VIII the Statute in Restraint of Appeals declared that 'this realm of England is an Empire...governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the imperial Crown of the same'. This was in the context of the divorce of Catherine of Aragon and the English Reformation, to emphasize that England had never accepted the quasi-imperial claims of the papacy. Hence England and, by extension its modern successor state, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is according to English law an Empire ruled by a King endowed with the imperial dignity. However, this has not led to the creation of the \"title\" of Emperor in England, nor in Great Britain, nor in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1801, George III rejected the title of Emperor when offered. The only period when British monarchs held the title of \"Emperor\" in a dynastic succession started when the title Empress of India was created for Queen Victoria. The government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, conferred the additional title upon her by an Act of Parliament, reputedly to assuage the monarch's irritation at being, as a mere Queen, notionally inferior to her own daughter (Princess Victoria, who was the wife of the reigning German Emperor); the Indian Imperial designation was also formally justified as the expression of Britain succeeding the former Mughal Emperor as suzerain over hundreds of princely states. The Indian Independence Act 1947 provided for the abolition of the use of the title \"Emperor of India\" by the British monarch, but this was not executed by King George VI until a royal proclamation on 22 June 1948. Despite this, George VI continued as king of India until 1950 and as king of Pakistan until his death in 1952. \n\nThe last Empress of India was George VI's wife, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\n\nUnder the guise of idealism giving way to realism, German nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848 to Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck's authoritarian \"Realpolitik\". Bismarck wanted to unify the rival German states to achieve his aim of a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany. Three wars led to military successes and helped to convince German people to do this: the Second war of Schleswig against Denmark in 1864, the Austro-Prussian War against Austria in 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War against the Second French Empire in 1870â71. During the Siege of Paris in 1871, the North German Confederation, supported by its allies from southern Germany, formed the German Empire with the proclamation of the Prussian king Wilhelm I as German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles, to the humiliation of the French, who ceased to resist only days later.\n\nAfter his death he was succeeded by his son Frederick III who was only emperor for 99 days. In the same year his son Wilhelm II became the third emperor within a year. He was the last German emperor. After the empire's defeat in World War I the empire, called in German \"Reich\", had a president as head of state instead of an emperor. The use of the word \"Reich\" was abandoned after the Second World War.\n\nIn 1472, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, Sophia Palaiologina, married Ivan III, grand prince of Moscow, who began championing the idea of Russia being the successor to the Byzantine Empire. This idea was represented more emphatically in the composition the monk Filofej addressed to their son Vasili III. After ending Muscovy's dependence on its Mongol overlords in 1480, Ivan III began the usage of the titles Tsar and Autocrat (\"samoderzhets\"). His insistence on recognition as such by the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire since 1489 resulted in the granting of this recognition in 1514 by Emperor Maximilian I to Vasili III. His son Ivan IV emphatically crowned himself Tsar of Russia on 16 January 1547. The word \"Tsar\" derives from Latin Caesar, but this title was used in Russia as equivalent to \"King\"; the error occurred when medieval Russian clerics referred to the biblical Jewish kings with the same title that was used to designate Roman and Byzantine rulers â \"Caesar\".\n\nOn 31 October 1721, Peter I was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. The title used was Latin \"\"Imperator\", which is a westernizing form equivalent to the traditional Slavic title \"Tsar\"\". He based his claim partially upon a letter discovered in 1717 written in 1514 from Maximilian I to Vasili III, in which the Holy Roman Emperor used the term in referring to Vasili.\n\nA formal address to the ruling Russian monarch adopted thereafter was 'Your Imperial Majesty'. The crown prince was addressed as 'Your Imperial Highness'.\n\nThe title has not been used in Russia since the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II on 15 March 1917.\n\nImperial Russia produced four reigning Empresses, all in the eighteenth century.\n\nIn 1345, the Serbian King Stefan UroÅ¡ IV DuÅ¡an proclaimed himself Emperor (Tsar) and was crowned as such at Skopje on Easter 1346 by the newly created Serbian Patriarch, and by the Patriarch of Bulgaria and the autocephalous Archbishop of Ohrid. His imperial title was recognized by Bulgaria and various other neighbors and trading partners but not by the Byzantine Empire. In its final simplified form, the Serbian imperial title read \"Emperor of Serbs and Greeks\" (\"ÑÐ°Ñ Ð¡ÑÐ±Ð° Ð¸ ÐÑÐºÐ°\" in modern Serbian). It was only employed by Stefan UroÅ¡ IV DuÅ¡an and his son Stefan UroÅ¡ V in Serbia (until his death in 1371), after which it became extinct. A half-brother of DuÅ¡an, Simeon UroÅ¡, and then his son Jovan UroÅ¡, claimed the same title, until the latter's abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in Thessaly. The \"Greek\" component in the Serbian imperial title indicates both rulership over Greeks and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans.\n\nThe Aztec and Inca traditions are unrelated to one another. Both were conquered under the reign of King Charles I of Spain who was simultaneously emperor-elect of the Holy Roman Empire during the fall of the Aztecs and fully emperor during the fall of the Incas. Incidentally by being king of Spain, he was also Roman (Byzantine) emperor in pretence through Andreas Palaiologos. The translations of their titles were provided by the Spanish.\n\nThe only pre-Columbian North American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the \"Hueyi Tlatoani\" of the Aztec Empire (1375â1521). It was an elected monarchy chosen by the elite. Spanish conquistador HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s slew Emperor CuauhtÃ©moc and installed puppet rulers who became vassals for Spain.\n\nThe only pre-Columbian South American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the \"Sapa Inca\" of the Inca Empire (1438â1533). Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro, conquered the Inca for Spain, killed Emperor Atahualpa, and installed puppets as well. Atahualpa may actually be considered a usurper as he had achieved power by killing his half-brother and he did not perform the required coronation with the imperial crown \"mascaipacha\" by the \"Huillaq Uma\" (high priest).\n\nWhen Napoleon I ordered the invasion of Portugal in 1807 because it refused to join the Continental System, the Portuguese Braganzas moved their capital to Rio de Janeiro to avoid the fate of the Spanish Bourbons (Napoleon I arrested them and made his brother Joseph king). When the French general Jean-Andoche Junot arrived in Lisbon, the Portuguese fleet had already left with all the local elite.\n\nIn 1808, under a British naval escort, the fleet arrived in Brazil. Later, in 1815, the Portuguese Prince Regent (since 1816 King JoÃ£o VI) proclaimed the \"United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves\", as a union of three kingdoms, lifting Brazil from its colonial status.\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon I and the Liberal revolution in Portugal, the Portuguese royal family returned to Europe (1821). Prince Pedro of Braganza (King JoÃ£o's older son) stayed in South America acting as regent of the local kingdom, but, two years later in 1822, he proclaimed himself Pedro I, first Emperor of Brazil. He did, however, recognize his father, JoÃ£o VI, as \"Titular Emperor of Brazil\" âa purely honorific titleâuntil JoÃ£o VI's death in 1826.\n\nThe empire came to an end in 1889, with the overthrow of Emperor Pedro II (Pedro I's son and successor), when the Brazilian republic was proclaimed.\n\nHaiti was declared an empire by its ruler, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who made himself Jacques I, on 20 May 1805. He was assassinated the next year. Haiti again became an empire from 1849 to 1859 under Faustin Soulouque.\n\nIn Mexico, the First Mexican Empire was the first of two empires created. After the declaration of independence on September 15, 1821, it was the intention of the Mexican parliament to establish a commonwealth whereby the King of Spain, Ferdinand VII, would also be Emperor of Mexico, but in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the House of Bourbon to accede to the Mexican throne.\n\nFerdinand VII, however, did not recognize the independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. By request of Parliament, the president of the regency AgustÃ­n de Iturbide was proclaimed emperor of Mexico on 12 July 1822 as AgustÃ­n I. AgustÃ­n de Iturbide was the general who helped secure Mexican independence from Spanish rule, but was overthrown by the Plan of Casa Mata.\n\nIn 1863, the invading French, under Napoleon III (see above), in alliance with Mexican conservatives and nobility, helped create the Second Mexican Empire, and invited Archduke Maximilian, of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, younger brother of the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef I, to become emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. The childless Maximilian and his consort Empress Carlota of Mexico, daughter of Leopold I of Belgium, adopted AgustÃ­n's grandsons Agustin and Salvador as his heirs to bolster his claim to the throne of Mexico. Maximilian and Carlota made Chapultepec Castle their home, which has been the only palace in North America to house sovereigns. After the withdrawal of French protection in 1867, Maximilian was captured and executed by the liberal forces of Benito JuÃ¡rez.\n\nThis empire led to French influence in the Mexican culture and also immigration from France, Belgium, and Switzerland to Mexico.\n\nIn Persia, from the time of Darius the Great, Persian rulers used the title \"King of Kings\" (\"Shahanshah\" in Persian) since they had dominion over peoples from the borders of India to the borders of Greece and Egypt. Alexander probably crowned himself \"shahanshah\" after conquering Persia, bringing the phrase \"basileus ton basileon\" to Greek. It is also known that Tigranes the Great, king of Armenia, was named as the king of kings when he made his empire after defeating the Parthians. Georgian title \"mephet'mephe\" has the same meaning.\n\nThe last \"shahanshah\" (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) was ousted in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution. \"Shahanshah\" is usually translated as \"king of kings\" or simply \"king\" for ancient rulers of the Achaemenid, Arsacid, and Sassanid dynasties, and often shortened to \"shah\" for rulers since the Safavid dynasty in the 16th century. Iranian rulers were typically regarded in the West as emperors.\n\nThe Sanskrit word for emperor is \"SamrÄj\" or \"Chakravartin\". This word has been used as an epithet of various Vedic deities, like Varuna, and has been attested in the Rig-Veda, possibly the oldest compiled book among the Indo-Europeans. \"Chakravarti\" refers to the king of kings. A \"Chakravarti\" is not only a sovereign ruler but also has feudatories.\n\nTypically, in the later Vedic age, a Hindu high king (\"Maharajah\") was only called \"SamrÄá¹­\" after performing the Vedic \"Rajasuya\" sacrifice, enabling him by religious tradition to claim superiority over the other kings and princes. Another word for emperor is \"sÄrvabhaumÄ\". The title of \"SamrÄá¹­\" has been used by many rulers of the Indian subcontinent as claimed by the Hindu mythologies. In proper history, most historians call Chandragupta Maurya the first \"samrÄá¹­\" (emperor) of the Indian subcontinent, because of the huge empire he ruled. The most famous emperor was his grandson Ashoka the Great. Other dynasties that are considered imperial by historians are the Kushanas, Guptas, Vijayanagara, Kakatiya, Hoysala and the Cholas.\n\nRudhramadevi (1259â1289) was one of the most prominent rulers of the Kakatiya dynasty on the Deccan Plateau, being one of the few ruling queens (empress) in Indian history.\n\nAfter India was invaded by the Mongol Khans and Turkic Muslims, the rulers of their major states on the subcontinent were titled \"SultÄn\", In this manner, the only empress-regnant ever to have actually sat on the throne of Delhi was Razia Sultan. The Mughal Emperors were the only Indian rulers for whom the term was consistently used by Western contemporaries. For the period from 1877 to 1947 when British Emperors ruled British India as the pearl in the crown of the British Empire, see above.\n\nFrom 1270 the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia used the title , literally \"King of Kings\". The use of the \"king of kings\" style began a millennium earlier in this region, however, with the title being used by the Kings of Aksum, beginning with Sembrouthes in the 3rd century.\n\nAnother title used by this dynasty was . translates as Empress, and was used by the only reigning Empress, Zauditu, along with the official title (\"Queen of Kings\").\n\nIn 1936, the Italian king Victor Emmanuel III claimed the title of Emperor of Ethiopia after Ethiopia was occupied by Italy during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. After the defeat of the Italians by the British and the Ethiopians in 1941, Haile Selassie was restored to the throne but Victor Emmanuel did not relinquish his claim to the title until 1943.\n\nIn 1976, President Jean-BÃ©del Bokassa of the Central African Republic, proclaimed the country to be an autocratic Central African Empire, and made himself Emperor as Bokassa I. The expenses of his coronation ceremony actually bankrupted the country. He was overthrown three years later and the republic was restored.\n\nThe rulers of China and (once Westerners became aware of the role) Japan were always accepted in the West as emperors, and referred to as such. The claims of other East Asian monarchies to the title may have been accepted for diplomatic purposes, but it was not necessarily used in more general contexts.\n\nThe East Asian tradition is different from the Roman tradition, having arisen separately. What links them together is the use of the Chinese logographs ç (\"huÃ¡ng\") and å¸ (\"dÃ¬\") which together or individually are imperial. Because of the cultural influence of China, China's neighbors adopted these titles or had their native titles conform in \"hanzi\". Anyone who spoke to the emperor was to address himself as bÃ¬xiÃ  (éä¸, lit. the \"Bottom of the Steps\"), corresponding to \"Imperial Majesty\"; shÃ¨ngshÃ ng (èä¸, lit. Holy Highness); or wÃ nsuÃ¬ (è¬æ­², lit. \"You, of Ten Thousand Years\").\n\nIn 221 BC, Ying Zheng, who was king of Qin at the time, proclaimed himself \"Shi Huangdi\" (å§çå¸), which translates as \"first emperor\". \"Huangdi\" is composed of \"huang\" (\"august one\", ç) and \"di\" (\"sage-king\", å¸), and referred to legendary/mythological sage-emperors living several millennia earlier, of which three were \"huang\" and five were \"di\". Thus Zheng became Qin Shi Huang, abolishing the system where the \"huang\"/\"di\" titles were reserved to dead and/or mythological rulers. Since then, the title \"king\" became a lower ranked title, and later divided into two grades. Although not as popular, the title ç \"wang\" (king or prince) was still used by many monarchs and dynasties in China up to the Taipings in the 19th century. ç is pronounced \"vÆ°Æ¡ng\" in Vietnamese, \"Å\" in Japanese, and \"wang\" in Korean.\n\nThe imperial title continued in China until the Qing Dynasty was overthrown in 1912. The title was briefly revived from 12 December 1915 to 22 March 1916 by President Yuan Shikai and again in early July 1917 when General Zhang Xun attempted to restore last Qing emperor Puyi to the throne. Puyi retained the title and attributes of a foreign emperor, as a personal status, until 1924. After the Japanese occupied Manchuria in 1931, they proclaimed it to be the Empire of Manchukuo, and Puyi became emperor of Manchukuo. This empire ceased to exist when it was occupied by the Soviet Red Army in 1945. \n\nIn general, an emperor would have one empress (\"Huanghou\", çå) at one time, although posthumous entitlement to empress for a concubine was not uncommon. The earliest known usage of \"huanghou\" was in the Han Dynasty. The emperor would generally select the empress from his concubines. In subsequent dynasties, when the distinction between wife and concubine became more accentuated, the crown prince would have chosen an empress-designate before his reign. Imperial China produced only one reigning empress, Wu Zetian, and she used the same Chinese title as an emperor (\"Huangdi\", çå¸). Wu Zetian then reigned for about 15 years (690â705 AD).\n\nThe earliest Emperor recorded in Kojiki and Nihon Shoki is Emperor Jimmu, who is said to be a descendant of Amaterasu's grandson Ninigi who descended from Heaven (Tenson kÅrin). If one believes what is written in Nihon Shoki, the Emperors have an unbroken direct male lineage that goes back more than 2,600 years.\n\nIn ancient Japan, the earliest titles for the sovereign were either ã¤ããå¤§ç/å¤§å (\"yamato Åkimi\", Grand King of Yamato), å­ç/å­å½ç (\"waÅ\"/\"wakokuÅ\", King of Wa, used externally), or æ²»å¤©ä¸å¤§ç (\"amenoshita shiroshimesu Åkimi\", Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally). As early as the 7th century the word å¤©ç (which can be read either as \"sumera no mikoto\", divine order, or as \"tennÅ\", Heavenly Emperor, the latter being derived from a Tang Chinese term referring to the Pole star around which all other stars revolve) began to be used. The earliest use of this term is found on a wooden slat, or \"mokkan\", unearthed in Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture in 1998. The slat dated back to the reign of Emperor Tenmu and Empress JitÅ. The reading 'TennÅ' has become the standard title for the Japanese sovereign up to the present age. The term å¸ (\"mikado\", Emperor) is also found in literary sources.\n\nJapanese monarchs were given their official title by the Chinese emperor. The new Japanese monarch after coming into power would send a representative to China and receive the anointment. They would receive their official title on several golden plates of several meters tall. Since the Japanese monarchs changed their title to å¤©ç (Heavenly Emperor) in 607, the Chinese emperor refused to anoint the Japanese king, thus, ending relations with Japan for the next few hundred years. Although the Japanese emperors used Chinese imperial titles, rarely was the Chinese-style \"Son of Heaven\" used. In the Japanese language, the word \"tennÅ\" is restricted to Japan's own monarch; \"kÅtei\" (çå¸) is used for foreign emperors. Historically, retired emperors often kept power over a child-emperor as de facto regent. For a long time, a \"shÅgun\" (formally the imperial generalissimo, but made hereditary) or an imperial regent wielded actual political power. In fact, through much of Japanese history, the emperor has been little more than a figurehead.\n\nAfter World War II, all claims of divinity were dropped (see Ningen-sengen). The Diet acquired all prerogative powers of the Crown, reverting the latter to a ceremonial role. By the end of the 20th century, Japan was the only country with an emperor on the throne.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, Japan's succession law prohibits a female from ascending the throne. With the birth of a daughter as the first child of the current crown prince, Naruhito, Japan considered abandoning that rule. However, shortly after the announcement that Princess Kiko was pregnant with her third child, the proposal to alter the Imperial Household Law was suspended by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. On 3 January 2007, after the birth of her son, Prince Hisahito, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that he would drop the proposal.\n\nCurrently, many believe the new prince of Japan will ascend the throne, as the law defines. Historically, Japan has had eight reigning empresses who used the genderless title \"TennÅ\", rather than the female consort title \"kÅgÅ\" (çå) or \"chÅ«gÅ«\" (ä¸­å®®). There is ongoing discussion of the Japanese Imperial succession controversy.\n\nAlthough current Japanese law prohibits female succession, all Japanese emperors claim to trace their lineage to \"Amaterasu\", the Sun Goddess of the ShintÅ religion. Thus, the Emperor is thought to be the highest authority of the Shinto religion, and one of his duties is to perform Shinto rituals for the people of Japan.\n\nThe rulers of Goguryeo (37 BC-668 AD) used the title of \"Taewang\" (Hangul: íì, Hanja: å¤ªç), literally translated as the \"Greatest of the Kings\". Also some Silla (57 BC-935 AD) rulers including Beopheung and Jinheung used this title for their declaration of independence from the influence of Goguryeo.\n\nThe rulers of Balhae (698â926) internally called themselves \"Seongwang\" (Hangul: ì±ì, Hanja: èç). The rulers of Goryeo used the titles of emperor and Son of Heaven. After the Mongolian invasions (1231â1258), however, Korea relinquished the imperial title.\n\nThe rulers of the Joseon Dynasty (1392â1897) still used the term \"King of the Joseon\" (Hangul: ì¡°ì êµ­ì, Hanja: æé®®åç). In the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894â'95, Japan defeated the Qing Dynasty China, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki was concluded in which Japan had China recognize the independence and autonomy of Korea. However, King Gojong used term of \"His Majesty the Great Monarch\" (Hangul: ëêµ°ì£¼íí, Hanja: å¤§åä¸»éä¸), not an official imperial title.\n\nIn 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the founding of the Korean Empire (1897â1910), and became emperor of Korea. Emperor Gojong declared the new era name \"Gwangmu\" (Hangul: ê´ë¬´, Hanja: åæ­¦, Warrior of light). The Korean Empire maintained their state until 1910 â though it was an Empire by name, it was in fact in the process of being absorbed by Japan.\n\nPre-Mongol Kingdoms such as the Xiongnu used the title \"Chanu\" meaning \"Ruler of all\" in old Mongolian. However it was not until the Chanu name was dropped and instead replaced by \"Khan\" that the rulers of Mongolia claimed the divine right as the ruler of all under the blue sky, this rule was closely tied with the ancient religious beliefs of the people of Mongolia (Tengrism). The title Khagan (khan of khans or grand khan) was held by Genghis Khan, founder of the Mongol Empire in 1206. After 1271, the emperors of the Yuan Dynasty also took the Chinese title \"huangdi\", or Chinese emperor. Only the Khagans from Genghis Khan to the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 are normally referred to as Emperors in English.\n\nNgÃ´ Quyá»n, the first ruler of Äáº¡i Viá»t as an independent state, used the title \"VÆ°Æ¡ng\" (ç, \"King\"). However, after the death of NgÃ´ Quyá»n, the country immersed in a civil war known as Chaos of the 12 Lords that lasted for over 20 years. In the end, Äinh Bá» LÄ©nh unified the country after defeating all the warlords and became the first ruler of Äáº¡i Viá»t to use the title \"HoÃ ng Äáº¿\" (çå¸, \"Emperor\") in 968. Succeeding rulers in Vietnam then continued to use this Emperor title until 1806 when this title was stopped being used for a century.\n\nÄinh Bá» LÄ©nh wasn't the first to claim the title of \"Äáº¿\" (å¸, \"Emperor\"). Before him, LÃ½ BÃ­ and Mai ThÃºc Loan also claimed this title. However, their rules were very short lived.\n\nThe Vietnamese emperors also gave this title to their ancestors who were lords or influence figures in the previous dynasty like the Chinese emperors. This practice is one of many indications of the idea \"Vietnam's equality with China\" which remained intact up to the twentieth century.\n\nIn 1802 the newly established Nguyá»n dynasty requested canonization from Chinese Jiaqing Emperor and received the title \"Quá»c VÆ°Æ¡ng\" (åç, \"King of a State)\" and the name of the country as \"An Nam\" (å®å) instead \"Äáº¡i Viá»t\" (å¤§è¶). To avoid unnecessary armed conflicts, the Vietnamese rulers accepted this in diplomatic relation and use the title Emperor only domestically. However, Vietnamese rulers never accepted the vassalage relationship with China and always refused to come to Chinese courts to pay homage to Chinese rulers (a sign of vassalage acceptance). China waged a number of wars against Vietnam throughout history, and after each failure, settled for the tributary relationship. The Yuan dynasty under Kublai Khan waged three wars against Vietnam to force it into a vassalage relationship but after successive failures, Kublai Khan's successor, TemÃ¼r Khan, finally settled for a tributary relationship with Vietnam. Vietnam sent tributary missions to China once in three years (with some periods of disruptions) until the 19th century, Sino-French War France replaced China in control of northern Vietnam.\n\nThe emperors of the last dynasty of Vietnam continued to hold this title until the French conquered Vietnam. The emperor, however, was then a puppet figure only and could easily be disposed of by the French for more pro-France figure. Japan took Vietnam from France and the Axis-occupied Vietnam was declared an empire by the Japanese in March 1945. The line of emperors came to an end with Báº£o Äáº¡i, who was deposed after the war, although he later served as head of state of South Vietnam from 1949-55.\n\nThe lone holders of the imperial title in Oceania were the heads of the semi-mythical TuÊ»i Tonga Empire.\n\nThere have been many fictional emperors in movies and books. To see a list of these emperors, see .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53396042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53396042", "title": "European Firearms Directive", "text": "European Firearms Directive\n\nThe European Firearms Directive is a law of the European Union which sets minimum standards regarding civilian firearms acquisition and possession that EU Member States must implement into their national legal systems.\n\nThe Member States are free to adopt more stringent rules, which leads to differences in the extent of citizens' legal access to firearms within different EU countries â see \"Gun laws in European Union countries\".\n\nThe 1985 White Paper on completion of the internal market (by the European Commission) stressed that the absence of border checks must not provide an incentive to buy arms in countries with less strict legislation. This goal was to be reached by approximation of the countries' national legislation on firearms.\n\nPrior to abolition of the internal border controls under the Schengen Agreement, the Council of the European Communities adopted the Directive 91/477/EEC, which was later, in 2008, amended by Directive 2008/51/EC. As a Directive, it is not a self-executing norm, but a legislative act which requires Member State to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving it. Member States must meet the minimum requirements laid down by the directive, but may also elect to adopt more stringent rules. Certain countries such as the United Kingdom are thus unaffected as they have maintained more stringent gun control laws than those effectively set as a minimum by the European Union, while others, like the Czech Republic, were forced to introduce more regulation in their national legislation.\n\nThe original Directive No. 91/477/EC was adopted in 1991 on the background of abolition of intra-Community frontiers. It aimed at partial approximation of national legislation that would prevent passing possession of firearms from one Member State to another, unless it is done according to rules established by the Directive. At the same time, the Directive introduced the European Firearms Pass that would allow hunters and target shooters to move between the Member States without unnecessary impediments. Generally, a person with a valid European Firearms Pass travelling to or through other Member States may be in possession of one or more firearms during that journey, provided that they are in possession of a European Firearms Pass listing such firearm or firearms and provided that they are able to substantiate the reasons for their journey, in particular by producing an invitation. That, however, does not apply to a journey through Member States that have more stringent laws and generally prohibit such firearms within their territory.\n\nThe Directive was without prejudice to any national provisions concerning carrying of weapons, hunting or target shooting and allowed Member States to adopt more stringent rules. The Directive introduced A-B-C-D categories of firearms (see below) with different rules pertaining to their acquisition. Under the Directive, national laws were to allow acquisition of A and B category firearms only subject to authorisation, while C category firearms were subject to registration.\n\nHanding over of a firearm to a person from a different country was to be allowed only subject to a written declaration of authorisation of such a transfer by the country of residence of the acquiree.\n\nThe Directive also bound Member States to intensify controls on external Community frontiers in order to prevent supply of black market firearms into the Community.\n\nFollowing the signing of the United Nations Protocol on the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts, components and ammunition, annexed to the Convention against transnational organised crime, the European Council and Parliament noted the need to amend the existing firearms directive in order to bring European legislation in line with the UN Protocol rules.\n\nFurther reasons for amendment included increase in the use of converted weapons within the Community, bringing distance (internet) purchases of firearms within the scope of authority of the Directive and better tracing of firearms.\n\nThe directive required Member States to enact legislation that would require marking and registration of any firearm or essential part placed on the market and to establish national computerised data-filing system concerning registration.\n\nThe Directive also placed a set of specific duties on the European Commission:\n\nFirearm categorisation prior to 13 June 2017\n\nThe European Commission proposed a package of measures aimed to \"make it more difficult to acquire firearms in the European Union\" on 18 November 2015, which became known as the \"EU Gun Ban\". President Juncker introduced the aim of amending the European Firearms Directive as a Commission's reaction to a previous wave of Islamist terror attacks in several EU cities. The main aim of the Commission proposal rested in banning B7 firearms (and objects that look alike).\n\nOpponents point out that no such firearm has previously been used during commitment of a terror attack in EU. Of 31 terror attacks committed in the EU in the years preceding the Commissions proposal, 9 were committed with guns, the other 22 with explosives or other means (truck in Nice). Of these 9, 8 cases made use of either illegally smuggled or illegally refurbished deactivated firearms (for which the European Commission didn't enact any rules, despite being tasked to do so in the Directive No. 2008/51/EC, see above) while during the 2015 Copenhagen shootings a military rifle stolen from the army, was used.\n\nThe European Commission proposal, if adopted, would have the following effect:\n\nIn the proposal, the European Commission suggested that the Amendment includes Article 10b, which would bind the Commission to issue common deactivation standards as it was ordered to do in the 2008 Directive (see above) and which the Commission issued on 19 December 2015. Meanwhile, poorly deactivated firearms, alongside smuggling from third countries, became one of major sources of black market guns used by criminals and terrorists in Europe, having been used in 2015 Hypercacher kosher supermarket siege, France.\n\nThe Dutch EU Presidency introduced 2nd reworked version of the amendment proposal on 4 April 2016. Apart from taking over all of Commission's proposals, Netherlands went further with proposing, among other things, a total ban on all semi-automatic firearms capable of being fitted with a magazine with more than six rounds, i.e. all pistols and most existing semi-automatic rifles.\n\nThree weeks later, the Dutch presidency introduced a third version of the amendment proposal. This time Netherlands proposed, on top of EU Commission proposal, to ban self-loading firearms that have a magazine with more than 20 rounds attached, as well as ban such magazines themselves. According to Czech Ministry of Interior Impact Assessment it would make a total chaos in firearms categorisation (i.e. a firearm would be B category when a 15 round magazine is inserted, and A category a second later after inserting a different, larger magazine) as well as vagueness, as it allowed also interpretation that all firearms that might potentially accept a larger than 20 rounds magazines might be themselves banned. The Impact Assessment further pointed out that millions of now legally owned standard capacity magazines could be expected to flow into the black market. Moreover, such firearms could only be owned only for hunting and sporting purposes, having crippling effect in countries where self defence is prevailing reason for firearm possession, such as the Czech Republic. To appeal to some disagreeing countries (Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, Switzerland), the proposal now included special exemptions for firearms possessions by military reserve or militia members.\n\nThe Dutch Presidency proposed to remove the entire D category of firearms and move the firearms into C category, i.e. making for example muzzle loaders subject to same rules as firearms.\n\nThe amendment proposal was introduced at the European Parliaments' Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO). Its members slammed the proposal as \"unworkable\". According to IMCO chair Vicky Ford, the Commission proposal \"was poorly worded and we need to make sure that the legislation is practicable.\"\n\nThis led to filing of over 900 proposals for changes to the Commission amendment proposal.\n\nInstead of going through the standard process of up to three rounds of debate and amendment between the Council and the Parliament, the Firearms Directive Amendment proposal entered the Trilogue.\n\nThe European Council's position on the issue was negotiated through Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER). In a leaked \"non-paper\" that was sent to other countries' representations shortly before the 30 November 2016 meeting, the Permanent Representation of France to the EU pointed out that France, (Germany), Italy and Spain consider the following as particularly essential goals:\n\nOn 20 December 2016, the COREPER, which included a representative of Switzerland (the rules extend to the country due to its membership of Schengen Area) reached a majority decision in favour of the proposed amendment. Only two countries opposed: Luxembourg, which would prefer more firearm restrictions, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Czech Republic further lodged a declaration of reservations which was published by the Czech Ministry of Interior. According to the declaration key elements of the proposal are inappropriate in substance and legally unclear and sometimes disproportionate. It further included regrets over unclear, unnecessary, overbroad and injudicious prohibitions of some semi-automatic firearms which may \"cause transfer of significant portion of firearms that are held legally now into illegal ownership or even black market and thus increase their availability to terrorists and criminals\". The Czech Republic also stated concern about last minute changes to the proposal about which the Member States were not informed in advance and thus could not properly evaluate their impact.\n\nThe COREPER version was closer to the second Dutch proposal (third reworked version) than to original Commission version.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, IMCO Committee accepted the COREPER amendment proposal by majority of 25 to 9 votes. Among those that did not support the proposal were all four Czech committee members. According to Vicky Ford, the IMCO negotiators amended the proposal to defend the interests of legal owners and close some loopholes, especially on poorly deactivated firearms. Ford commented that she would prefer a version that would not include magazine limitations, however she accepted it as it was of extreme importance to some countries.\n\nShadow rapporteur Dita CharanzovÃ¡ said that she has never in her career met a proposal that would be this much politicised, with the Commission exercising extreme pressure especially by the end of the negotiations. CharanzovÃ¡ said that, since first proposing the amendment in 2015, the Commission had not presented an Impact Assessment, although it is required by its own legislative rules and although she had asked for it numerous times. She further asked the Commission what it had done with over 28,000 inputs gained during public consultation phase, but to no avail. Further, representatives of the Commission would often bring last minute changes to meetings they couldn't justify â at one point trying to answer her objection \"with a definition taken from Wikipedia\". CharanzovÃ¡ also noted the rise of anti-EU sentiment connected with the proposal.\n\nMylÃ¨ne Troszczynski filed a minority opinion on behalf of the ENF, according to which the legislation \"seeks only to restrict the civil liberties of blameless citizens in their efforts to acquire and possess firearms\".\n\nThe European Parliament voted on the proposal during its session on 14 March 2017.\n\nThere were altogether 164 proposals for amendments filed by MEPs that sought to change the text negotiated in the Trialogue. However, under the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament Art. 53(3), any provisional agreement reached in the Trialogue under Art 69f(4) \"shall be given priority in voting and shall be put to a single vote\". MEP Dita CharanzovÃ¡ put forward a motion on behalf of the ALDE Group that would allow voting on the MEPs' proposals for changes, arguing that the plenary \"has never had the opportunity to take the position on this important text as it was negotiated directly by the Committee, therefore I ask all my colleagues to vote in favor of this request which would simply allow all members to express their opinions\". Vicky Ford then argued that these amendments had been debated in the Committee, discussed with the Council and ultimately rejected by the Member States. She argued that adopting the amendments would \"destabilize the entire agreement\", throwing away \"all the hard work\" and \"success that the Parliament has had in improving the text\". CharanzovÃ¡'s proposal was rejected by unknown margin, as, according to chair \"the vote was absolutely clear for everyone to see, there is no point in having a check\" with no record of number of votes cast being made.\n\nThe Parliament passed the proposal by 491 to 178 margin after 4 minutes and 50 seconds with no public debate.\n\nEuropean Council approved the proposal by majority vote on 25 April 2017. The Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Poland voted against the proposal.\n\nThe Directive was published under No. (EU) 2017/853 on 17 May 2017 in the Official Journal. Member States will have 15 months to implement the Directive into their national legal systems.\n\nUnder the 2017 Directive, certain firearms formerly classified as B category (\"subject to authorization\") firearms are newly reclassified as A category (\"prohibited\") firearms and thus they are banned for certain classes of civilians. These are:\nThe Directive, however, includes several exemptions that Member States \"may\" enact and under which the above mention banned firearms may either remain in possession of existing owners or may be acquired by new owners:\nEuropean Commission has been tasked to enact rules for proper deactivation of firearms under the Directive No. 2008/51/EC of 21 May 2008 and did so on 19 December 2015 through Regulation No. (EU) 2015/2403. While the Regulation was adopted to ensure that deactivated firearms may not be refurbished to function again, the 2017 Directive set forth that possession of A and B category firearms deactivated under the Regulation shall be subject to same rules as possession of live C category firearms.\n\nUnder the 2017 Directive, the Commission is tasked to provide a system for exchange of information between Member states on the authorisations granted for the transfer of firearms to another Member State and information with regard to refusals to grant authorisations as provided for in Articles 6 and 7 on grounds of security or relating to the reliability of the person concerned.\n\nMember states shall have in place a monitoring system to ensure that the conditions of authorisation set by national law are met throughout the duration of the authorisation and, inter alia, relevant medical and psychological information is assessed. In case conditions of authorisation are not met, the State shall withdraw the authorisation.\n\nAuthorization for possession of firearms be shall be reviewed periodically in intervals not exceeding 5 years and renewed or prolonged if conditions of its granting are still met.\n\nThe Commission shall by 14 September 2020 and then periodically every 5 years submit a report on the Directive and propose further changes.\n\nFirearms categorisation underwent a general overhaul.\n\nThe Czech Government announced that the country will challenge the proposed amendment Directive before the European Court of Justice by 17 August 2017 at the latest due to its impact on legal owners of historical replicas, semi-automatic firearms and standard capacity magazines. According to the Ministry of Interior, the Directive will affect law-abiding owners of hundreds of thousands firearms and well over a million firearm magazines.\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Milan Chovanec commented: \"Filing the suit gives me no pleasure, but there is no other option left. The Directive violates the principle of proportionality as well as prohibition of discrimination. We shall not allow the EU to use the guise of fight against terrorism in order to disproportionately infringe onto the Member States' scope of authority and citizens' rights. The EU Gun Ban would affect almost all of the 300,000 legal gun owners in the country. This is why we will lodge not only the suit to invalidate the Directive, but also propose postponement of Directive's effectiveness.\" The suit against the 2017 Amending Directive was filed on 9 August 2017. In the meantime both Hungary and Poland joined the proceedings. The Czech Republic bases the suit on the following reasoning:\n\nOn 15 December 2016, Czech Ministry of Interior introduced a proposal to amend Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic expressly providing the right to be armed as part of citizen's duty of participation in provision of internal order, security and democratic order. The proposal aimed at making use of EU Primary Law internal security derogation . Its purpose lays at utilisation of already existing specific conditions as regards firearms ownership in the Czech Republic (240.000 people having concealed carry licence, high level of ownership of semi-automatic firearms suitable for self-defense as compared to other EU countries) for security purposes, whereby firearms owners should contribute to soft targets protection.\n\nOn 6 February 2017, the proposal was lodged by 36 members of parliament into legislative process. It must gain support of 3/5 of all Members of Chamber of Deputies and 3/5 of Senators present to be passed.\nThis proposal was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 28 June 2017 with a solid majority of 139:9\nOn 6 December 2017, the proposal was rejected by the Senate. Since the Chamber of Deputies cannot overturn Senate rejection of proposed changes of constitution, this means the end of the proposal.\n\nAccording to Swiss People's Party vice-president Christoph Blocher, Switzerland should consider abandoning EU's borderless Schengen Area if the Swiss people reject the proposed measures in a referendum.\n\n"}

The petitioner asked the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nChief Justice Morrison Waite wrote the opinion for the majority. The constitutional grounds under which the petitioner challenged the Act were not discussed by the Court. Waite noted that Congress had a lengthy history of passing laws restricting the rights and privileges of civil servants, and the constitutionality of such laws had never before been challenged. \n\nNext, Waite affirmed that Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution clearly gave Congress the power to determine for itself what was proper in the realm of reining in political corruption:\n\nWaite refused to pass judgment on the validity of the writ of habeas corpus, concluding that the Supreme Court's \"jurisdiction is limited to the single question of the power of the court to commit the prisoner for the act of which he has been convicted.\"\n\nAssociate Justice Joseph P. Bradley dissented. He concluded that the Act impermissibly infringed on First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association:\n\nJustice Bradley also concluded that the Act was overbroad and that the same positive ends (ending political corruption) could have been achieved by alternative, narrower means.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of the majority's decision is that it believed Congress prohibited not civil servants from making political donations on their own but making such donations through their supervisors. Justice Bradley dissented, in part, by arguing that the law banned even voluntary contributions made through superiors (a ban that he felt was unconstitutional).\n\nAt least one commentator has concluded that \"Ex parte Curtis\" is still \"good law.\"\n"}

Fumaric acid has a fruit-like taste and has been used as a food acidulant since 1946. Its E number is E297.\n\nIt is produced in eukaryotic organisms from succinate in complex 2 of the electron transport chain via the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. It is one of two isomeric unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, the other being maleic acid. In fumaric acid the carboxylic acid groups are \"trans\" (\"E\") and in maleic acid they are \"cis\" (\"Z\").\n\nThe salts and esters are known as fumarates. Fumarate can also refer to the ion (in solution).\n\nFumaric acid has been used as a food acidulant since 1946. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU, USA and Australia and New Zealand. As a food additive, it is used as an acidity regulator and can be denoted by the E number E297. It is generally used in beverages and baking powders for which requirements are placed on purity. Fumaric acid is used in the making of wheat tortillas as a food preservative and as the acid in leavening. It is generally used as a substitute for tartaric acid and occasionally in place of citric acid, at a rate of 1Â g of fumaric acid to every ~1.5Â g of citric acid, in order to add sourness, similarly to the way malic acid is used. As well as being a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as \"Salt and Vinegar\" flavored potato chips, it is also used as a coagulant in stove-top pudding mixes.\n\nThe European Commission Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, part of DG Health, found in 2014 that fumaric acid is \"practically non-toxic\" but high doses are probably nephrotoxic after long-term use.\n\nIn patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the ester dimethyl fumarate (BG-12, Biogen) significantly reduced relapse and disability progression in a phase 3 trial. It activates the Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway, the primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress.\n\nVarious fumaric acid esters (FAES) have specific immunomodulating (respectively moderate immunosuppression) properties which are responsible for certain effects in the treatment of psoriasis. In the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and the Benelux countries substances derived from fumaric acid have been used for half a century for this purpose. \nAlthough it seems that a certain effectiveness exists (and many studies have confirmed the effect), more statistically powerful studies are necessary to provide better evidence of the effectiveness of fumaric acid esters in treatment of psoriasis (e.g. more accurate in terms of the dermatological nosology of this autoimmune disease). Such studies should in the future help specify which psoriasis variants (in terms of the course, the immunological profile of the patient etc.) are suited to be treated with fumaric acid esters.\n\nFumaric acid is naturally present in the herb called Fumaria officinalis. The top of this herb is used to treat various skin disorders including psoriasis. Baths with this herb have been used for several centuries. \nAt present, these baths (after consultation with a general practitioner or dermatologist) are used as an adjunct therapy to basic treatment.\n\nFumaric acid is used in the manufacture of polyester resins and polyhydric alcohols and as a mordant for dyes.\nSince the early 21st century, it has been used to synthesize one of the first metal-organic frameworks presenting commercial applications thanks to its remarkable adsorption and mechanical properties, combined with a low toxicity compared to other well-studied MOFs.\n\nFumaric acid converts to the irritant maleic anhydride, upon partial combustion.\n\nIt is \"practically non-toxic\" but high doses are probably nephrotoxic after long-term use.\n\nFumaric acid was first prepared from succinic acid. A traditional synthesis involves oxidation of furfural (from the processing of maize) using chlorate in the presence of a vanadium-based catalyst.\nCurrently, industrial synthesis of fumaric acid is mostly based on catalytic isomerisation of maleic acid in aqueous solutions at low p\"H\". Maleic acid is accessible in large volumes as a hydrolysis product of maleic anhydride, produced by catalytic oxidation of benzene or butane.\n\nThe chemical properties of fumaric acid can be anticipated from its component functional groups. This weak acid forms a diester, it undergoes additions across the double bond, and it is an excellent dienophile.\n\nFumaric acid does not combust in a bomb calorimeter under conditions where maleic acid deflagrates smoothly. For teaching experiments designed to measure the difference in energy between the cis- and trans- isomers, a measured quantity of carbon can be ground with the subject compound and the enthalpy of combustion computed by difference.\n\nFumaric acid is found in fumitory (\"Fumaria officinalis\"), bolete mushrooms (specifically \"Boletus fomentarius var. pseudo-igniarius\"), lichen, and Iceland moss.\n\nFumarate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle used by cells to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from food. It is formed by the oxidation of succinate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. Fumarate is then converted by the enzyme fumarase to malate.\n\nHuman skin naturally produces fumaric acid when exposed to sunlight.\n\nFumarate is also a product of the urea cycle.\n\n\n"}

In 1877, during the Trial of the Fifty, Gelfman was sentenced to two years in the Litovsky Castle. On 14 March 1879, she was sent into exile to the province of Novgorod, from where she escaped and joined Narodnaya Volya in Saint Petersburg in 1879.\n\nAt a personal level, she also practiced then-revolutionary free love.\n\nIn 1881 she was part of the group that assassinated Alexander II, along with her then lover, Nikolai Sablin. When the police raided their apartment, Sablin shot himself.\n\nDuring the Pervomartovtsi trial in March 1881, Gelfman refused to admit her guilt, but she was nevertheless sentenced to death by hanging for her alleged part in the assassination of the Tsar. However, a few hours after being convicted, she made a statement reading in part that \"in view of the ... sentence I have received, I consider it my moral duty to declare that I am in the fourth month of pregnancy\". According to contemporary law execution of pregnant women was banned as the fetus was considered innocent. Therefore, Gelfman's execution was officially postponed until forty days after childbirth, and in the meantime she would stay in the harsh Peter and Paul Fortress prison. Three months later, thanks to the campaign against her execution by Socialists in Western Europe and in the foreign press, her sentence was exchanged for an indefinite period of katorga and she was transferred back to the remand prison where she had been held before. On 5 July [NS], whilst still in the Peter and Paul Fortress and by permission of the Minister of the Interior, Count Ignatiev, she was granted an interview (which lasted almost an hour and a half) with a journalist from the newspaper \"Golos\" who was accompanied by her defence counsel at her trial, a lawyer named Goerke. During the course of this interview, she complained about the lack of \"proper medical and female attendance\".\n\nGelfman gave birth in detention in October 1881. Upon the request of the Department of Police, her childbirth was assisted by a gynaecologist who was also employed by the Imperial court, something unprecedented. She had a severe maternal complication, as her perineum was torn. It was rumoured that the gynaecologist had refused the prison doctor's suggestion to sew the wound together; in any case, it never healed. She remained delirious during some of the postnatal period. By 24 November, she had developed peritonitis, which became acute on 17 January 1882. She nevertheless nursed her daughter from her birth in October until 25 January, when the baby was taken away from her, placed in an orphanage and registered as a child of unknown parents. According to the subsequent medical report, the peritonitis became general and caused fever on the same day. Six days later, Gelfman died. Her child soon died of an unknown disease as well.\n\nThe importance of Gelfman's role in the assassination was undetermined, and her Jewish origins stressed during the pogroms that followed the assassination. Another conspirator, Ignacy Hryniewiecki, was also rumored to be Jewish, though there seems to have been no basis for this.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17330081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17330081", "title": "Josh Mandel", "text": "Josh Mandel\n\nJoshua Aaron Mandel (born September 27, 1977) is an American Republican politician who is the State Treasurer of Ohio. Mandel is a former city councilman and member of the Ohio House of Representatives. He was the unsuccessful Republican challenger to incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown in the 2012 U.S. Senate election. In 2016, he announced his intention to again challenge Brown in 2018; he withdrew on January 5, 2018, citing family health reasons.\n\nMandel was born on September 27, 1977 in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Rita (nÃ©e Friedman) and Bruce Mandel. He has a sister, Rachel. He attended Beachwood High School where he was the quarterback of the football team. Mandel attended The Ohio State University where he earned a BA in communication. At Ohio State, he served two terms as the undergraduate student government president. While there he was also a member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. After graduating in 2000, he earned a JD from the Case Western Reserve University School of Law.\n\nMandel enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, where he served eight years as an intelligence specialist. His first tour was from February to November 2004, during which he was attached to a light armored reconnaissance battalion. He left for his second tour in September 2007. Attached to an infantry battalion, Mandel served in the city of Haditha.\n\nMandel's experience as an elected official began as a Lyndhurst, Ohio city councilman, where he was elected in 2003. He served three years on the council's finance committee.\n\nOn January 24, 2005, Mandel sent a letter to Lyndhurst residents, proposing a one time tax rebate of $400, paying the postage for the letters from his campaign fund. Faced with opposition from fellow council members, Mandel introduced and advocated for a 2 mill property tax rollback, which would have saved the average homeowner $100 a year on a home valued at $160,000. What passed council, on April 4, 2005, was a 1.5 mill rollback, which saved the average homeowner $75 a year.\n\nMandel was first elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in November 2006.\nHe represented Ohio's 17th House district, consisting of 17 communities of various sizes in southeastern Cuyahoga County. Mandel was re-elected to a second term in 2008.\n\nMandel's first piece of legislation as a State Representative, H.B. 151, was an initiative to force the multibillion-dollar Ohio pension funds to divest from companies doing business in Iran. He joined State Representative Shannon Jones (R) in an attempt to make Ohio the first state in the nation to divest from Iran, but the legislation was never signed into law due to a compromise between state pension executives and Ohio House leadership, agreed to by Mandel. Then-Speaker of the Ohio House Jon Husted brokered a deal to drop half of the state's investments in Iran and Sudan with the eventual goal of removing all investment from the two countries. In April 2010, Mandel appeared on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" to discuss his leadership on Iran divestment in Ohio.\n\nIn the 127th Assembly, Mandel, along with other members of the Ohio House who served in Iraq, were excused from voting on HB649 in December 2008, which provided payments to military veterans of the Middle East wars and compensation to families who had lost loved ones in the conflicts.\n\nIn the 128th Assembly, Mandel was one of 19 house members to vote against HB108, a bill to make cockfighting a felony. Mandel said that the legislation was not a pressing priority for the state and that the General Assembly should spend its time in other ways.\n\nAlso in the 128th Assembly, Mandel voted against the Ohio House Bill 176, the Equal Housing and Employment Act which \"[p]rohibits discriminatory practices on the basis of \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" under many of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (OCRC) Law's existing prohibitions against various unlawful discriminatory practices.\". The bill passed the Ohio House by a vote of 56 to 39.\n\nIn May 2009, Mandel announced his candidacy for Ohio Treasurer of State via web video. Mandel's campaign generated controversy in late September 2010 when it ran a TV commercial falsely suggesting that Mandel's opponent, African-American Kevin Boyce, was a Muslim. The commercial was criticized for playing on anti-Muslim bias, and was ultimately withdrawn by the Mandel campaign. However, voters subsequently received a campaign mailing with similar themes. The Mandel campaign said that the Ohio Republican Party was responsible for the mailers, which had already been sent bulk rate, up to a week prior.\n\nIn October 2010, in response to an Ohio Democratic Party complaint, the Ohio Elections Commission found that Mandel had deceptively depicted Boyce (an African Methodist Episcopal) as a Muslim in the ads. On November 2, 2010, Mandel was elected Ohio State Treasurer, defeating Boyce by 14 percentage points to become chief investment officer of state funds. Mandel was sworn in on January 10, 2011.\n\nDuring Mandel's time as treasurer, Ohio retained the highest possible rating from Standard & Poor's for the state's $4 billion government investment fund. On March 19, 2012, Mandel severed contracts with two major banks that handled $41 billion in Ohio pension investments, amid government investigations into whether the banks overcharged clients for currency trading accusing them of \"systematically exploiting public pension funds and taxpayers.\"\n\nMandel was reelected to a second term as state treasurer in 2014, defeating Democratic State Representative Connie Pillich.\n\nOn December 2, 2014 Mandel launched OhioCheckbook.com, a website that reports every expenditure in state government, in an effort, according to Mandel, to \"create an army of citizen watchdogs who have the power to hold politicians accountable.\" In September 2018, Mandel was awarded the \"Transparency in Government Award\" by the State Financial Officers Foundation for his work on OhioCheckbook.com and promoting greater government spending transparency in Ohio and across the country.\n\nOhioCrypto.com\n\nOn November 25, 2018 Mandel made Ohio the first state in America to enable taxpayers to pay taxes with cryptocurrency.Â  This initiative, OhioCrypto.com, was an effort to provide more options to Ohio taxpayers and to project Ohio as a state thatâs embracing blockchain technology.Â  Mandel described himself as a cryptocurrency enthusiast and said that he hopes the launch of OhioCrypto.com will bring more normalization and legitimacy to cryptocurrency.\n\nIn summer 2015, Ohio passed legislation granting the Ohio Treasurer's Office the authority to open and administer ABLE accounts; such accounts are a federally-authorized, state-run savings program for eligible people with disabilities. In June 2016, Mandel began offering the nation's first ABLE accounts, called in Ohio \"STABLE Accounts\". The Ohio Treasurer's Office, in addition to administering Ohio's STABLE Accounts, also jointly administers the ABLE accounts in Arizona, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the Ohio Treasurer's Office under Mandel spent almost $1.7 million in taxpayer-funded television ads, featuring him and Urban Meyer, the head coach for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team. Mandel's office made each payment for the ads to individual television stations in an amount less than $50,000 per fiscal year, thus circumventing the need for approval by the state Controlling Board, which must sign-off on state payments over this amount. Thirteen ad buys were within $1,000 of the $50,000 threshold. Mandel defended the ads, saying they helped increase awareness of an investment program for disabled Ohioans. Critics questioned the airing of self-promotional ads at a time when Mandel was running for U.S. Senate and said that Mandel's office was trying to avoid scrutiny by structuring the ad buys to avoid Controlling Board approval.\n\nIn response to the controversy, the Ohio House introduced an amendment to the state's 2017 budget. The amendment would require approval by the Controlling Board for ad buys that in aggregate exceed $50,000. This rule would have prevented Mandel from avoiding oversight by distributing the advertising campaign among individual ad buys. Mandel did not attend an Ohio Senate hearing on the matter. He sent a deputy instead.\n\nMandel was the Republican nominee to challenge Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown in the 2012 General Election. Josh Mandel officially announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate March 1, 2012, in a speech to the Akron Press Club. He won the March 6, 2012 Republican primary with 63% of the vote in a five candidate race. In March, Mandel stated his reason for running: \"I am running for the United States Senate because no longer can I stomach the gridlock and partisanship in Washington that has bankrupted Social Security, bankrupted Medicare, and caused one-half million jobs to leave Ohio in the past decade.\"\n\nMandel earned the endorsement of several prominent conservative politicians including: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. John McCain. Mandel received the endorsement of the Club for Growth, Jim DeMint's Senate Conservatives Fund, Senator Rob Portman, Congressman Jim Jordan and conservative commentators Hugh Hewitt and Mark Levin.\n\nMandel's campaign was singled out by the independent fact-checking group Politifact for its \"casual relationship with the truth\" and its tendency to \"double down\" after inaccuracies were pointed out. The fact-checking group wrote: \"For all the gifts Mandel has, from his compelling personal narrative as an Iraq war veteran to a well-oiled fundraising machine, whoppers are fast becoming a calling card of his candidacy.\"\n\nMandel had raised $7.2 million through the first quarter of 2012; his $5.3 million cash on hand trailed Brown's $6.3 million. Mandel benefited from massive support from conservative out-of-state superPACs, which raise unlimited amounts of money from anonymous donors. These outside groups, including Crossroads GPS, aired $10 million in TV advertising supporting Mandel and attacking Brown as of July 2012, outspending Democratically-aligned outside groups by more than five-to-one. Mandel's campaign was aided by over $1 million spent primarily on attack ads by a 501(c)(4) organization called the \"Government Integrity Fund\".\n\nMandel failed to unseat Sherrod Brown in the November 6, 2012 General Election, losing 45% to 51%.\n\nIn August 2013, Mandel was accused of violating federal and state campaign laws by using a vehicle owned by his U.S. Senate campaign for personal use unrelated to the campaign. No charges were brought and there was no case made against him. Mandel was involved in a traffic accident with the vehicle on March 5, 2013 near Toledo, Ohio, nearly four months after the campaign.\n\nIn December 2016, Mandel announced that he would seek election to the United States Senate in the 2018 election.\n\nIn late 2016, a Super PAC called Ohio Freedom Fund was created in order to help elect Mandel. The Ohio Freedom Fund's primary contributor is Citizens for a Working America, a nonprofit not subject to campaign finance disclosures. At the time that the Ohio Freedom Fund Super PAC was created, Mandel, in his capacity as state treasurer, was appearing in a series of advertisements promoting a new investment program for families with special needs children. Mandel's office said the ads were taped and aired before Mandel was a candidate for U.S. Senate.\n\nIn July 2017, Mandel stated his support for alt-right activists and conspiracy theorists Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec after Cernovich and Posobiec were criticized in an Anti-Defamation League (ADL) report. Mandel accused the ADL of being a \"partisan witchhunt group\" and tweeted \"I stand with @Cernovich & @JackPosobiec.\"\n\nMandel dropped out of the race on January 5, 2018, citing the need to spend more time with his family relating to his wife's health issues.\n\nMandel has called for the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In a campaign advertisement during his 2012 Senatorial run, Mandel claimed opponent Sherrod Brown \"cast the deciding vote on the government takeover of health care\". Politifact has labeled as false the claim that Brown cast the deciding vote for the act. The description of the act as a government takeover of health care, by Mandel, has been labeled by Politifact as \"nonsensical\" and a \"myth\".\n\nMandel has been an outspoken critic of the scientific consensus on climate change. He has referred to climate change research as \"riddled with fraud\" and has vowed to fight attempts to advance clean-air standards.\n\nMandel has called for what he terms as \"aggressive and responsible\" energy exploration that protects \"the air we breathe and water we drink\" while reducing environmental regulation. He supports the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. Mandel is a supporter of expanded coal plants and has criticized what he has termed as \"radical\" environmental groups.\n\nIn October 2009, he appeared on the show \"Fox & Friends\" stating his support for listening to the military generals on the ground in Afghanistan.\n\nMandel was a member of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee at The Ohio State University. He spoke at the 2008 AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, D.C, where he said, \"Israel is our best friend and ally in the Middle East and it's important that we maintain a strong and lasting relationship with them.\" In the same speech, Mandel stated Iran was a threat and discussed his divestment initiatives as a legislator in Ohio.\n\nIn 2012, Mandel broke with Mitt Romney on foreign policy concerning the status of U.S. military forces in Europe, advocating for their withdrawal.\n\nMandel and his wife Ilana reside in Beachwood, Ohio with their three children, Rosie, Judah, and Gideon. They were married August 28, 2008, in Jerusalem.\n\nMandel said in a speech that his maternal grandfather, Joe, is originally from Poland and is a Holocaust survivor, while his maternal grandmother, Fernanda, is originally from Italy and was hidden from the Nazis by a Catholic family during World War II. In a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition, he said the tribulations of his grandparents and family inspired him to public service.\n\n"}

Harper is an American attorney and diplomat who was the first Native American to ever receive the rank of a U.S. ambassador. He is a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and as a lawyer he is known for working on behalf of Native Americans. He was, from June 2014 to January 2017, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.\n\nAlthough a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, Harper did not grow up in Oklahoma, due to his father being in the military and posted elsewhere. Harper's forebears include David Rowe, an Assistant Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation who was elected as a judge of the Northern Judicial Circuit shortly after the Civil War.\n\nHarper attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated in 1990 with a B.A. in sociology and psychology. He then went to the New York University School of Law, where he graduated with a J.D. in the class of 1994. There he served as an editor on the \"New York University Journal of International Law and Politics\". He was admitted to the New York bar the following year.\n\nAfter law school, Harper served as a law clerk to Judge Lawrence W. Pierce of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He considered it a formative experience with Pierce becoming one of his role models. He also worked early in his career for the New York firm of Davis, Polk & Wardwell.\n\nHarper was a litigator at the Native American Rights Fund for eleven years spanning from 1995 to 2006. He is most known for his work in the \"Cobell v. Kempthorne\", a large class-action lawsuit brought by Native American representatives against two departments of the United States government. The case was brought in 1996 on behalf of upwards of 500,000 Native Americans, and was resolved in 2009 with the Obama administration agreeing to a $3.4Â billion settlement.\n\nHe also did some teaching: as an adjunct professor at the Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law from 1998 to 2001, and as a professorial lecturer at the American University Washington College of Law from 1999 to 2001.\n\nHe then became a partner at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, in Washington, D.C., where he focused his practice on litigation and Native American affairs, representing tribes and individual Indians.\n\nWith the new firm, Harper continued his work as a lead attorney on \"Cobell\", and by the 2010s the lawyers on that case had earned over $85Â million in attorneys' fees. The high payments became an issue among some Native Americans, and during 2010â2011 Harper toured Indian country to defend the settlement terms and the payments to attorneys. Harper was also accused by some other Native American lawyers of using physical intimidation tactics in several cases in the mid-late 2000s during disagreements over \"Cobell\" matters.\n\nHarper has also served on the bench: as a justice of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe's Appellate Court from 2001 to 2007, and following that as a justice of the Supreme Court of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians from 2007 to 2008.\n\nHarper acted as a key liaison between the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008, and Indian tribes. In 2010, Harper was mentioned as a possible pick for the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In 2011, President Obama named him to a spot on the President's Commission on White House Fellowships. Harper worked on the re-election Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012, and helped bring in over $500,000 in donations. He personally helped host a conference and two major fundraisers for the campaign. As such, Harper was considered a \"mega-bundler\" who played a major role in setting overall record levels of campaign donations for Obama from Native Americans.\n\nOn July 11, 2017, Harper endorsed Debra Haaland for Congress. Haaland is running for New Mexico's first congressional district, and if elected would be the first Native American woman elected to congress.\n\nHarper was nominated by President Obama for the position of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council on June 10, 2013. Many human rights advocates were unfamiliar with Harper, and as such the pick reflected a long-standing practice of presidents rewarding top supporters with ambassadorships and similar postings. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered his nomination in two rounds of confirmation hearings, in September 2013 and February 2014.\n\nA number of Republicans objected to the nomination, either because of his earnings or tactics during the \"Cobell\" case or because of his role in Obama campaign fundraising. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who led the arguments against Harper, said, \"Mr. Harper is just another example of a campaign bundler wholly ill-suited to serve in the diplomatic post for which he's been nominated.\" Senator Jon Tester of Montana said, on the other hand, that \"As a longtime advocate for the civil rights of Native Americans, Keith will be a great Ambassador for our country.\" While many Native American groups supported Harper's nomination, some indigenous rights advocates were wary of it, saying that Harper had shown a lack of substantial positions on Indian human rights issues throughout his legal career.\n\nEventually, Harper was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 3, 2014, nearly a year after his nomination, in a party-line 52â42 vote with Democrats supporting and Republicans opposed. As such he benefited from the \"nuclear option\" adopted in the Senate the year before, where Senate filibusters could no longer be used against such appointees. Harper thus became the first person from a federally recognized Native American tribe to achieve the rank of U.S. ambassador.\n\nHarper was sworn into his position by June 5, 2014, and immediately flew to Geneva for a Human Rights Council meeting.\n\nHarper's tenure in the position ended with the change of administrations in Washington in January 2017.\n\nIn February 2017, Harper returned to practice as a partner at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton. He planned to work from the firm's Washington office again and to focus on both public and private sector work regarding both Native American affairs and international matters.\n\n\nSources:\n"}

Seeking to undermine the popularity of the communist Viá»t Minh's policies of land redistribution to poor peasants, the government of South Vietnam implemented their own land-redistribution policies during the Vietnam War. \n\nEarly reforms enacted by the South Vietnamese government in the 1950s largely failed, as the ordinances prescribed by the government often attempted to directly undo the already-popular land reforms of the Viá»t Minh, requiring poor peasants to pay to acquire land that the communists had already given to them. During the 1960s, such programs were rendered defunct and unenforceable due to the South Vietnamese army's inability to control farmland territories against the Viet Cong.\n\nIn the 1970s, South Vietnam implemented the \"Land to the Tiller\" reform with the aid of the United States. This program was more successful than earlier programs, and was almost entirely underwritten by the United States. The reform program was discontinued in 1975 following South Vietnam's defeat in the Vietnam War and the unification of Vietnam.\n\nFollowing the unification, the government of Vietnam attempted to carry out further land reform in the southern part of the country in order to develop its transformation to a socialist economy. This attempt at reform was met with difficulties, and did not achieve its goals.\n\nFollowing World War II, the communist Viá»t Minh (the predecessor of Viet Cong) fought against the French colonialists and their local supporters (mainly landowners) in the First Indochina War. \nAt the time, a large percentage of agricultural land was owned by powerful landowners and the majority of the rural population of Vietnam owned only small plots of land (with little legal assurance) or were simply landless peasants. \nThe early success of the land reform program under the Viet Minh gave the communists a strong base of support among the 80% of the Vietnamese people who lived in rural areas.\n\nPrior to the provisional separation of North and South Vietnam, emperor Bao Dai in 1953 responded to the Viet Minh program of land redistribution and rent reduction with a decree declaring that rents for land should not exceed 15 percent of the crop. The decree was unenforceable and rendered null by a failing colonial government and, in any case, contained loopholes that could have been exploited by landlords.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1975 land reform in Vietnam was pursued on two separate channels and regions as the country was provisionally divided into two parts: South Vietnam (The Republic of Vietnam) and North Vietnam (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam), resembling the current partition of Korea. \nCommunist North Vietnam and its southern supporters, the Viet Cong, adopted a policy of confiscating the land of landlords and rich peasants by force and redistributing it to poor and landless peasants, thus organizing the rural population into collectives.\n\nCapitalist South Vietnam failed in several land reform endeavors before finally achieving some success with the \"Land to the Tiller\" program in the early 1970s that was almost fully devised and supported by the United States, which considered it to be part of their policy of the Vietnamization of the war.\n\nIn 1954, South Vietnam's ally, the United States, advised the new government of South Vietnam, headed by Ngo Dinh Diem, to undertake \"indispensable reforms\" including land reform. In response on 8 January 1955, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 2, which capped rental of land at 25 percent of production. In 1956, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 57 which forbade ownership by an individual of more than of rice land and prescribed the conditions and terms under which the excess land expropriated from the rich could be transferred to less-wealthy farmers. Under the program the government acquired from 1958 to 1961 and distributed . The land redistributed thus comprised less than 10 percent of the 7.5 million acres of cultivated land in South Vietnam. \n\nThe land reform program implemented under Ordinance 57 was unpopular in the countryside. The Viet Minh had already divided up the land -- \"fairly,\" in the words of one official. The government's program was less generous to the majority of farmers than had been the Viet Minh redistribution of land in areas which it controlled. The amount of land that individuals were permitted to retain was large, farmers were required to pay for land they acquired under the program, and the program was riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Many rural people believed that the United States army and the government of South Vietnam were on the side of the landlords. Military operations by the U.S. and South Vietnamese armies to clear communist insurgents from an area would often result in landlords reclaiming land previously abandoned or confiscated and redistributed by the Viet Minh or Viet Cong.\n\nOrdinance 57 resulted in the reverse of what was the objective of land reform advocates: large landowners and landlords increased their influence, especially in the important rice-growing area of the Mekong Delta. The ordinance remained in effect until 1970, but was largely unutilized after 1960 as the Viet Cong insurgents took control or disputed government control of most of the rural areas of South Vietnam.\n\nThe Land to the Tiller project carried out in Vietnam from 1970 to 1973 was based on a proposal by Roy Prosterman, a prominent American \"land-rights-activist\", who the US government of the time recruited within its efforts against Viet Cong in South Vietnam. Drawing on experiences in other countries (particularly in Latin America), Prosterman proposed a \"land-to-the-tiller\" program to compete with the Viet Cong for the allegiance of the peasants. The plan mimicked the communists' land expropriation strategy, coupled with monetary compensation to the former landowners.\n\nOn 26 March 1970, with the war still underway, the government of South Vietnam began implementation of the Land-to-the-Tiller program following Prosterman's model. In total, the United States financed 339 million US dollars of the reform's 441 million dollars of expenses.\nIndividual land holding was limited to 15 hectares. Legal titles were extended to peasants in areas under control of the South Vietnamese government to whom land had previously been distributed by the Viet Cong.\n\nBernard B. Fall a prominent war correspondent, historian, political scientist, and expert on Indochina during the 1950s and 1960s, claimed that delayed land reform in South Vietnam had played such a fundamental role in the Vietnam War that it was as important as \"ammunition for howitzers.\" South Vietnam's ally and financial supporter, the United States, either failed to realise the importance of land reform in a timely fashion or was not able to persuade the South Vietnamese government of its importance. Andrew Biggs, at researcher at the University of Washington argues that the \"Land to the Tiller\" program of the early 1970s was too little, too late to swing the war in the favour of the US.\n\nIn the words of an American official, Robert Samson \"The Americans (lost the war because) they offered the peasant a constitution; the Viet Cong offered him his land and with it the right to survive\".\n\nAccording to Trung Dinh Dang, a scholar at the Cornell School of Government and Politics Of Asia and The Pacific, the Vietnamese Communist Party struggled to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture in the south of Vietnam following the unification of the country. The contemporary party leaders initially considered land reform initiatives to be a temporary measure toward mass collectivisation. \n\nDang posits that further land reform initiatives set the grounds for conflict between the party and Southern Vietnamese. Land reform initiatives encountered unexpected difficulty in the southern region and its implementation could not be achieved for many years. According to Dang, agrarian reform in the south failed to benefit the majority of villagers, instead perpetuating inequality, sowing discord, and creating unrest. Instead of eliminating land-based exploitation, it created a new strata of exploiters in the form of local officials that abused their power to secure land for themselves and their relatives instead of impoverished peasants.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10558149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10558149", "title": "League of American Writers", "text": "League of American Writers\n\nThe League of American Writers was an association of American novelists, playwrights, poets, journalists, and literary critics launched by the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) in 1935. The group included Communist Party members, and so-called \"fellow travelers\" who closely followed the Communist Party's political line without being formal party members, as well as individuals sympathetic to specific policies being advocated by the organization.\n\nThe League's policy objectives changed over time in accord with the shifting party line of the CPUSA. Beginning as an anti-fascist organization in 1935, the League turned to an anti-war position following the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 and to a pro-war position after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The organization was prominent in the defense of Republican Spain during the Spanish Civil War and in providing financial and moral support to writers in need in the United States and internationally.\n\nThe organization was terminated in January 1943.\n\nThe League of American Writers was established by the First American Writers Congress, a gathering held from April 26â28, 1935. (According to member Myra Page, it started on May 1, 1935âMay Day.)\n\nThe organization was affiliated with the International Union of Revolutionary Writers (IURW) as well as the International Association of Writers for the Defense of Culture and was the American equivalent of the British League of Writers. Initial members included: Alexander Trachtenberg of International Publishers, Frank Folsom, Louis Untermeyer, Bromfelds, I.F. Stone, Millen Brand, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman, and Dashiell Hammett, and Myra Page.\n\nIn an article in the magazine of the IURW, \"International Literature,\" League of American Writers member Alan Calmer noted that the new organization sprung from a decision made at the 1934 convention of the Communist Party's John Reed Clubs:\n\nThe chief malady of the revolutionary culture movement was characterized at the second national conference of the John Reed Clubs in 1934 as the old malady of sectarianism. ... Pointing to these handicaps, the delegates to the conference instructed their executive committee to take the initiative in sponsoring a broad conference of left-wing authors ... A new organization committee was formed, which gradually involved more and more sympathetic writers into the leadership of the committee which issued the \"Call for an American Writers Congress\" at the beginning of 1935.\n\nThe convention call for establishing the first Congress of American Writers declared that capitalism was rapidly crumbling and sought to gather the \"hundreds of poets, novelists, dramatists, critics, short story writers and journalists\" who recognized \"the necessity of personally helping to accelerate the destruction of capitalism and the establishment of a workers' government.\"\n\nThe founding convention of the League was called to order at the Mecca Temple in New York City, attended by 400 invited \"writer-delegates\" in front of a total audience of nearly 5,000. Although later called a \"front group,\" the Communist Party's role in the League of American Writers was never secret. Earl Browder, General Secretary of the CPUSA, delivered the keynote address to the delegates of the First Congress of the League of American Writers at its opening session. Browder acknowledged that writers were typically \"skeptical of all political parties, if not contemptuous.\" He continued:\n\nThey find, however, in the new life in which they participate, there is a political party which plays an increasingly influential role, the Communist Party. They find it necessary to define their attitudes towards this Party which actively participates in their chosen world. They see that this Party is a force in fine literature, as well as in strikes, in unemployment struggles, in battling for Negro rights, even in reactionary Congress ... Yes, the Communist Party is a force, in every phase of the life of the masses, even that of poets, dramatists, novelists, and critics.\n\nJoining Browder in addressing the delegates to the organization's founding convention was CPUSA political committee member Clarence Hathaway, who greeted the Congress in the name of \"the entire staff of \"The Daily Worker,\"\" the official newspaper of the Communist Party. Other leading CPUSA activists addressing the gathering included Moissaye Olgin of the Yiddish-language \"Morning Freiheit,\" Joseph Freeman of \"The New Masses,\" and Alexander Trachtenberg of International Publishers, part of the CPUSA's publishing arm.\n\nThe group declared itself to be \"a voluntary association of writers dedicated to the preservation and extension of a truly democratic culture.\"\nWaldo Frank was elected the first president of the new organization. The governing Executive Council elected by the first Congress included Frank, Freeman, Trachtenberg, Michael Gold, Granville Hicks, Malcolm Cowley, Josephine Herbst, Albert Maltz, Kenneth Burke, Harold Clurman, Hart, Josephson, Lawson, Scheider, Seaver, Genevieve Taggard and Alfred Kreymborg.\n\nThe League of American Writers was a dues based organization, with annual dues set at $5 per year, payable in advance on January 1 of each year. Participants who were members of local or regional chapters paid dues to that organization, with $2 of the $5 remitted to the National Office; others stood as members at large and paid dues directly to New York.\n\nAlthough the League of American Writers was technically a \"mass organization\" of the CPUSA in the sense that it sought to unite party members with non-party individuals sharing the general Communist Party orientation, membership in the organization was limited by design to the literary elite. Several months after the April 1935 founding congress, membership in the group was reported as only 125 â far fewer than the 400 who had attended the founding convention as delegates. \"Applications for membership flow in, but the standard is kept high, membership is granted only to creative writers whose published work entitles them to a professional status,\" noted Isidor Schneider.\n\nAccording to the group's formal membership application, membership in the League was \"open to all writers whose work has been published or used with reasonable frequency in channels of communication of more than local scope, including magazines, newspapers, the radio, the stage, and the screen.\" In addition, members had to accept and observe a set of 7 membership aims:\n\nThe League of American Writers was governed by Congresses held every two years. The organization also had a number of local chapters which conducted various fundraising activities and events designed to raise public awareness about matters of concern to the League. Chapters were maintained in New York City, Washington, DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Minneapolis. The organization published an official newsletter, \"The Bulletin of the League of American Writers.\"\n\nA number of prominent writers were enlisted in the cause over the next several years, including Thomas Mann, John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, Theodore Dreiser, James Farrell, Archibald MacLeish, Lillian Hellman, Nathanael West, Elsa Gidlow and William Carlos Williams. The participation of many of these literary luminaries in League affairs was often nominal, limited to signature of an occasional petition. This effort at gathering prominent figures was assisted by a muting the explicitly revolutionary language and communist tone of the organization by the time of its June 1937 second convention.\n\nThe 1937 convention was a more subdued affair than the high-profile 1935 launch, with its opening at Carnegie Hall attended by 50 \"writer-delegates.\" The keynote speech was delivered by Ernest Hemingway, newly returned from the Spanish Civil War. Hemingway denounced fascism as \"a lie told by bullies\" and declared that \"a writer who will not lie cannot live or work under fascism.\" Excerpts from the film \"The Spanish Earth\" were shown to the audience.\n\nCommunist Party General Secretary Earl Browder again spoke to the 1937 convention, emphasizing the CPUSA's \"Popular Front\" analysis that the world was divided into \"two great warring camps, democracy against fascism\" and leaving it to writers to \"adjust their own work to the higher discipline of the whole struggle for democracy.\" Gone was talk of the collapse of capitalism and the duty of writers to speed its demise as participants in the class struggle; now the task at hand, in Browder's view, was the building of \"broad unity of all democratic and progressive forces ... against the menace of fascist barbarism.\"\n\nFrank was replaced as President of the League in 1937, owing to his questioning of the evidence and verdicts being rendered at the great \"Show Trials\" in Moscow. He was replaced as President by Donald Ogden Stewart. The professional head of the organization as Executive Secretary from 1937 to 1942 was Communist Party stalwart Franklin Folsom. The League touted seven prominent Vice-Presidents during the last years of the 1930s, including Van Wyck Brooks, Erskine Caldwell, Malcolm Cowley, Paul DeKruif, Langston Hughes, Meridel LeSueur, and Upton Sinclair.\n\nThe 3rd Congress of the League of American Writers, held in New York City in June 1939, once again opened with a Friday night public session at Carnegie Hall. Poet Langston Hughes delivered the keynote address, in which he likened the situation of American blacks to that of the Jewish minority in Germany, with but one difference: \"Here we may speak openly about our problems, write about them, protest, and seek to better our conditions.In Germany the Jews may do none of those things.\" Hughes' speech was broadly democratic and did not include revolutionary sloganeering.\n\nThe League of American Writers somewhat irregularly published a mimeographed newsletter for its members, \"The Bulletin of the League of American Writers.\" Circulation was small, with a press run of 700 copies cited in an issue from November 1937, and few specimens seem to have survived.\n\nIn 1937 the League of American Writers sent out surveys to over 1,000 American writers asking their position on the Spanish Civil War. Some 418 returned the survey forms, with 410 supporting the Loyalists to the Spanish Republic, 7 professing neutrality, and only one â Gertrude Atherton â supporting General Francisco Franco and his nationalist forces. In accord with the CPUSA's political line, no effort was made to contact writers known to be sympathetic to Leon Trotsky. When Max Eastman, a translator of Trotsky and opponent of Joseph Stalin, was inadvertently mailed a survey form, Eastman's reply was excluded at the insistence of Communist Party newspaper editor Moissaye Olgin. The other replies were distilled into a pamphlet published by the League of American Writers, entitled \"Writers Take Sides.\"\n\nWith the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact in the fall of 1939, the League of American Writers turned its official policy from one of advocacy of collective security against fascism in Europe to one of opposition to the so-called \"imperialist war,\" in accord with a change in the political line of the Communist International and the CPUSA. This abrupt reversal was not cost-free to the organization, however, as series of prominent members of the League of American Writers left the group's ranks. Those exiting during this \"Yanks Are Not Coming\" period included Archibald MacLeish, Malcolm Cowley, Van Wyck Brooks, Thomas Mann, and Granville Hicks, among others.\n\nIn January 1940, the League formed a \"Keep America Out of War Committee.\" This group's members included: Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Lawrence A. Goldstone, Eleanor Flexner, Len Zinberg, Shaemas O'Sheel, and Sonia Raiziss, among others.\n\nTheodore Dreiser was honorary president of the League of American Writers in 1941.\n\nThe League again abruptly shifted its political position, ending its anti-war stance, with the German invasion of the USSR in the summer of 1941. Echoing another abrupt change of the political line of the CPUSA, the League of American Writers became advocates of American entry into World War II in defense of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe League of American Writers was terminated in January 1943.\n\nThe archive of the League of American Writers is housed at the Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley.

{"id": "16142949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16142949", "title": "Macedonian Patriotic Organization", "text": "Macedonian Patriotic Organization\n\nMacedonian Patriotic Organization (MPO) is the oldest organization of Americans and Canadians of Macedonian descent in North America. The MPO was founded in Fort Wayne, Indiana in the United States in 1922 by immigrants from Greek Macedonia. It was originally called the Macedonian Political Organization but changed its name in 1952.\n\nThe MPO is a pan-Macedonian organization that advocates the idea of an independent and united Macedonia in which all ethnic groups would enjoy freedom and equal human rights. In the past, the organization has generally promoted the view that Macedonian Slavs are Bulgarians, but today it unites both Macedonian Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians. The MPO supports the independent Republic of Macedonia and is involved in pro-Macedonian advocacy within the US and Canada.\n\nSince 1926 MPO is publishing the \"Macedonian Tribune\", which is the oldest continuously published Macedonian newspaper in the world.\n\nA century of Ottoman maladministration over Macedonia as well as the Ilinden Uprising of 1903 caused thousands of Macedonians to emigrate to places of safety and security â mainly in the United States and Canada. By the early 1920s, there were around 35,000 Macedonian immigrants in North America, most of whom have well established themselves in various industries and trades. It is important to note that in those days the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia declared themselves as Macedono-Bulgarians, and considered themselves to be a part of the Bulgarian people â as did the majority of early Macedonian immigrants to North America. All of their early churches, schools, benevolent associations and cultural centers were named \"Macedono-Bulgarian\", emphasizing their strong Macedonian regional and cultural identity.\n\nFirst Macedonian associations in the United States date back to 1899, with the foundation of the \"Macedonian-Bulgarian Society Vasil Levski\". Other associations include \"Bulgarian-Macedonian American Committee\" founded in 1904, \"Nadezhda\" founded in 1908, etc. In September 1913, delegates from Macedonian organizations in the United States and Canada gathered in Chicago, Illinois to form a \"Macedonian-Bulgarian National Union\". The union published the newspaper \"Svoboda\", and had as its objective the autonomy for Ottoman Macedonia and the Adrianople area. Some members of these organizations participated in the Balkan Wars as volunteers in the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps\n\nFollowing World War I, Macedonia was divided by Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria. In the parts conquered by Serbia and Greece, the new administrators forced out most of the Bulgarian priests and teachers, and began implementing a forceful state-sponsored Serbianizatons and Hellenization of Slavic-speaking Macedonians. These harsh policies of political, cultural and religious repression in Serbian and Greek Macedonia were conducted with the consent of France and Great Britain, in spite of the warning by well-known political experts that the unsolved Macedonian problem would keep the Balkans in constant turmoil. This had a devastating effect on Macedonians in the United States and Canada and triggered a wave of apathy and indifference. All attempts to keep the Macedonian groups together met with failure, and eventually lead to the disillusion of the Macedono-Bulgarian National Union.\n\nThe Macedonian Patriotic Organization was formed in these turbulent years following the World War I, when prospect for freedom by many oppressed groups were dashed. The appeals for a renewed struggle first came from Fort Wayne, Indiana. and Steelton, PA., which were the bastions of Macedonian immigration, and were followed by Macedonian groups in Indianapolis, Gary, Indiana, Lansing, Detroit, Dayton, Springfield, Ohio, Cincinnati and New York City. Ft. Wayne was chosen as the site for the first formative convention, which took place on October 2, 1922, with a handful of delegates, most of whom were Ilinden veterans. The first convention charted a framework within which to build the structure of the new organization, and considerable attention was given to find an appropriate name for it. The proposal for Macedonian Patriotic Organizations was rejected because after the defeat of the Central Powers in the World War I, the word \"patriot\" had assumed a repulsive meaning. The convention settled for the name of Macedonian Political Organizations â which, in 1956 was changed to the original proposal â Macedonian Patriotic Organizations (MPO).\n\nThroughout the next several annual conventions, the delegates finalized the organization's bylaws. The unchanged fundamentals of this document are still guiding the MPO into the third millennium. The first article of the MPO bylaws states: \"The Macedonian Immigrants of the United States and Canada, as well as their descendants, regardless of nationality, religion, sex or convictions, realizing the necessity of joint organized activity for the liberation of Macedonia, formed the Macedonian Patriotic Organization with the slogan 'Macedonia for the Macedonians'.\" The historic phrase \"Macedonia for the Macedonians\", which was adopted as an official slogan of the MPO, was a proclamation of William Gladstone, who in 1897 expressed his views on the Macedonian Question.\n\nThe bylaws specify in Article 6. eligibility for MPO membership. \"A regular member of these organizations can be any person over 18 years of age, born in Macedonia or of Macedonian descent, who accepts and maintains the aim of these by-laws and pledges himself to fulfill its regulations.\" As written originally, the bylaw's concept of \"Macedonians\" and \"Macedonian emigrants\" was equally valid for all ethnic groups in Macedonia, which in those days included Bulgarians, Romanians, Turks, Albanians, Greeks etc.\n\nThe aim of the MPO, as defined in Article 2. of the bylaws, is: \"To work for strengthening the feelings of loyalty and patriotism among the immigrants and their descendants toward the respective countries where they live â The United States and Canada;\" and \"To strive in a legal manner for the establishment of Macedonia as an independent state unit within her historic and geographic boundaries, which should constitutionally guarantee the ethnic, religious, cultural and political rights and liberties of all citizens.\"\n\nFor the accomplishment of the above purposes, the MPO founders defined in Article 4. of the bylaws very specific means for the Organization: \"It publishes newspapers, books and brochures to disseminate the truth regarding the just cause of Macedonia and informs the public opinion on the correct solution of the Macedonian problem.\" and \"It presents the Macedonian cause before foreign nations, legislative bodies, international institutes and societies through memorandums, petitions, statements, protests, resolutions, etc.\"\n\nSince its inception, the MPO has advocated to organize and educate the emigrants in civil values, and to prepare them for fighting in favor of Macedonian liberation. Over the next seven decades the MPO directed its activities toward the establishment of an independent and united Macedonian state that would \"guarantee constitutional, ethnic, religious, cultural and political rights and freedoms of all of its citizens.\"\n\nThe different phases that the Macedonian Question went through have put a pressure upon MPO to develop new modern means to achieve its aims. To fulfill the stipulations of the MPO bylaws, the delegates to the 4th annual MPO Convention in 1925 in Indianapolis, decided to establish a newspaper that was to become an official organ of the organization. The newspaper was founded under the name \"Macedonian Tribune\", and under the guidance and leadership of MPO Central Committee Secretary Jordan Tchkatroff is and began publication on February 10, 1927.\nAfter the end of World War II, MPO was openly opposed the communist regimes in Belgrade and Sofia, as well as the oppressive government in Greece. Throughout the 60s and the 70s, the MPO raised its voice against the historiographic revisionism that was taking place in Socialist Yugoslavia which aimed at diminishing the Bulgarian cultural and historic heritage in Macedonia. In the 70s, the Macedonian Tribune regularly printed articles and appeals by the last leader of the IMRO, Ivan Mihailov. His memoirs (written in Bulgarian) were advertised by the paper and were avidly read.\n\nThroughout the period of the Cold War, the MPO continuously advocated with the United States and Canadian governments, the United Nations, and other relevant international factors for a solution to the Macedonian Question that would involve self-government for Macedonians under a United Nations protectorate. The organization also worked on raising international awareness regarding violations of human rights in all three parts of Macedonia \n\nOver the years a number of the Americans born of Macedonian Bulgarian descent began having less and less knowledge of Bulgaria and often identify themselves simply as Macedonians. Also, in 1990s MPO began openly accepting and embracing the ethnic Macedonian identity, alongside the Macedono-Bulgarian identity of the organization's founders. On February 22, 1990, the Macedonian Tribune published an article by then President Ivan Lebamoff, where he stated that MPO is responding to change in Macedonia, throughout the world, and in the organization itself by recognizing the reality of ethnic Macedonians, and by inviting them to join the ranks of the MPO as equals.\n\nMPO approached the third millennium with great enthusiasm connected with the establishment of the independent Macedonian state â the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nThe MPO played an enormous role for the recognition of the Republic of Macedonia's independence. Only days after the parliament of the Republic of Macedonia (until then a federal unit in communist Yugoslavia) declared its independence from Yugoslavia, a delegation of the MPO visited Washington, DC in an attempt to lobby with the US government to recognize Macedonia as an independent state. The delegation was received by US senators from Indiana, Dan Coats and Richard Lugar, as well as by members of the House of Representatives MPO's activism, in addition to diplomatic activities by officials from the Republic of Macedonia finally yielded some results, and on April 8, 1992 the country was admitted to the UN.\n\nTo exert pressure for Macedonia's international recognition, MPO President Ivan Lebamoff sent a resolution prepared at the Detroit MPO Convention to many heads of state around the world.\n\nIn September 1992 the MPO organized the \"Forum on Macedonian Unity\", which brought together the leaders of the MPO, the United Macedonians of Toronto and the representatives from the VMRO-DPMNE. The delegates agree on a common goal â a free and independent Macedonia, and the result of the forum was a resolution in which they demanded the international recognition of the Republic of Macedonia. In December 1992, the MPO began coordinating efforts to bring humanitarian aid to the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nThroughout 1992, the Greek diaspora in the United States and Canada demonstrated against the recognition of Macedonian independence, above all against the name of the new state containing the word \"Macedonia.\" They claimed that Macedonia was an ancient Greek name and that the newly declared independent state is stealing this name from them The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America also demanded that Republic of Macedonia's independence not to be recognized by the United States. In reaction to this, MPO President Ivan Lebamoff sent protest letters against this position to the patriarchs and bishops of Orthodox Churches worldwide as well as to numerous newspapers. He also demanded from Macedonian Americans to enhance their propaganda activities towards getting the Republic of Macedonia internationally recognized as soon as possible. Macedonian Americans responded to his call with a mass campaign of writing numerous articles in American newspapers and making phone calls to US Senators.\n\nMPO also used its influence in the US Senate to assist the Republic of Macedonia's stabilization efforts. MPO President Ivan Lebamoff asked Indiana Senator Lugar to propose that the United States sends US troops to Macedonia. Lebamoff also informed Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov about his proposal. MPO proposal was also supported by he Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rep. Fascell. In November 1992, the MPO asked Macedonian Americans to call the White House Hotline directly to ask President Bush to immediately recognize the Republic of Macedonia immediately.\n\nIn 1994, members of the MPO Central Committee visited Washington, DC several times in order to further press the US government to recognize Macedonia. For this reason, MPO decided to have its 76th Convention in 1995 in Washington, DC. The keynote speaker of the 1995 Convention was Jane Kirkpatrick, former US Ambassador to the UN. Furthermore, in July 1996, MPO President Col. Boris Chaleff met with President Bill Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore, with whom he lobbied for an early NATO admittance of the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nIn July 1998, the first Macedonian Ambassador to the US visited the MPO headquarters in Fort Wayne. In 2004, a MPO delegation met President George W. Bush at the White House to persuade him to recognize the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name â which his government did in 2004.\n\nRegarding the question of MPO's attitude towards Macedonia's historic and contemporary identities, in 2015, then president Jordan Lebamoff wrote an article in the Macedonian Tribune in which he explains that when visited his relatives in Kastoria, Florina, and Skopje, he used to carry with him three letters: one written in Bulgarian, one in Macedonian, and the other in Greek. He explains that regardless of whether his relatives believed that they were Greek, Bulgarian or Macedonian, they were to him family. Further in the article he states the following:\n\nThe various ethnic identifications connected to the name Macedonia have often caused a lot of misunderstandings. For example, in 1992 Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) addressed former MPO president Ivan Lebamoff as a distinguished member of the Greek-American community. Lebamoff responded that he is not a Greek, and that Macedonians are not Greeks. In his response, Lebamoff stated:\n\nWith reference to the question of the ethnic character of the organization, in 2012, MPO veteran and former Macedonian Tribune editor Lou Todorov said that the MPO is neither an ethnic Macedonian nor an ethnic Bulgarian organization, but that is patriotic organization of all the people from Macedonia, who share the ideal of a free, independent and united Macedonia. To better illustrate the subject, he further explained that:\n\nWith regard to MPO's relationship with the Republic of Macedonia, in 2018, MPO Board of Trustees member Nick Stefanoff stated the following:\n\nIn an unofficial interview for a Macedonian newspaper, former MPO President George Lebamoff sharply criticized the lack of democracy in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the official misinterpretations of Macedonian history, with an emphasis on the Bulgarian historic heritage in country. At the 2009 MPO Convention, past Central Committee President Andrea Alusheff was said to have illegally expelled the Toronto MPO chapter \"Switzerland of the Balkans\", because of the latter's alleged pro-Bulgarian bias. Once Alusheff's mandate expired, the new Central Committee reinstated the MPO \"Switzerland of the Balkans\" into the organization. On the other hand, a former chapter of MPO from Toronto called MPO \"Luben Dimitroff\", splintered from the Canadian MPO and started publishing a parallel \"Macedonian Tribune\" in the pre-World War II Bulgarian orthography, espousing pro-Bulgarian views.

The missions were active from 1946 until 1990.\n\nThe agreements between the allied nations and the Soviet Union permitted the deployment of small numbers of military intelligence personnel â together with associated support staff â in each other's territory in Germany, ostensibly for the purposes of monitoring and furthering better relationships between the Soviet and Western occupation forces. The British, French and American missions matched the size of the counterpart Soviet missions into West Germany (the nominal post-war British, French and American zones of occupations). The MLMs also played an intelligence-gathering role. The MLM teams were based in West Berlin but started their \"tours\" from the national mission houses in Potsdam in matte-olive-drab heavy cars. The Mission teams on a tour frequently comprised one officer accompanied by an NCO and a driver.\nThe missions persisted throughout the Cold War period and ended in 1990 just prior to German reunification. The missions were\nand their reciprocal Soviet missions (SOXMIS/SMLM).\n\nThe BritishâSoviet missions were the first to be established (16 September 1946) under the terms of the RobertsonâMalinin Agreement (the respective commanders-in-chief). It also had the largest contingent of personnel with 31 accredited team members. Later agreements with the US (HuebnerâMalinin, March 1947) and France (NoiretâMalinin, April 1947) had significantly fewer permitted personnel, possibly because those Allied powers did not want large Soviet missions operating in their zones and vice versa.\n\nThe Allied liaison missions, having quasi diplomatic status, were relatively free to roam around East Germany save for specifically designated permanent and temporary restricted areas. They were largely 'untouchable' either by the law or military personnel. However a small number of team members were injured or killed in accidents or 'incidents' which gave rise to significant military and political tensions.\n\nLittle is publicly documented about the Soviet missions.\n\nAlthough not widely known to the general public, the MLMs played a significant intelligence-gathering role during the Cold War. They also had a significant role in confirming that preparations for offensive action were not under way, thus reducing the tension.\n\nProbably the most notable incident involving the American MLM was the death of Major Arthur D. Nicholson, a U.S. MLM Tour Officer. He was killed on March 23, 1985, shot by Soviet Army Sergeant Aleksandr Ryabtsev, and was considered the last American casualty of the Cold War, and the only U.S. MLM Officer to die in the course of duty, though other British and French tour personnel had died earlier. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Nicholson's death was honored on the floor of both houses of the United States Congress, with a speech that was read into the official record.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6718638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6718638", "title": "Moralism", "text": "Moralism\n\nMoralism is a philosophy that arose in the 19th century that concerns itself with imbuing society with a certain set of morals, usually traditional behaviour, but also \"justice, freedom, and equality\". It has strongly affected American and British culture, concerning private issues such as the family unit and sexuality, as well as issues that carry over into the public square, such as the temperance movement.\n\nIn tracing the origins of moralism, sociologist Malcolm Waters writes that \"Moralism emerged from a clash between the unrestrained character of frontier expansionism, a middle-class, Protestant emphasis on respectability cultivated in small-town America and an egalitarian and anti-intellectual evangelism among splinter Protestant groups.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, the issues of abolition and temperance formed the \"twin pillars\" of moralism, becoming popular through Christian Churches in the United States, both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Moralism as promoted by some Christian denominations, such as the Quakers, manifested in wide support for abolitionism and industrial unionism. \n\nThe rise of postmillennialism in the 19th century \"encouraged a general culture of Protestant moralism and pushed it toward a series of social reform movements, from antislavery and abolitionism (freedom for the slaves now), to protests against Indian Removal, to antiwar and peace efforts, to women's rights, to temperance work before and after the Civil War.\" As such, the campaign for women's suffrage, evidenced by the ethos of organisations such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), was highly driven by the moralism of that era.\n\nIn the latter part of 20th century, as well as the 21st century, moralists in the United States turned their attention to championing the pro-life movement. Moralists have also focused their efforts in maintaining blue laws, such as those that discourage Sunday shopping, in accordance with first-day Sabbatarian beliefs that resonate with the sensibilities of labourers and trade unions.\n\n"}

{"id": "60857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60857", "title": "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals", "text": "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA ; stylized PeTA) is an American animal rights organization based in Norfolk, Virginia, and led by Ingrid Newkirk, its international president. A nonprofit corporation with nearly 400 employees, it claims that it has 6.5 million members and supporters, in addition to claiming that it is the largest animal rights group in the world. Its slogan is \"Animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way.\"\n\nFounded in March 1980 by Newkirk and fellow animal rights activist Alex Pacheco, the organization first caught the public's attention in the summer of 1981 during what became known as the Silver Spring monkeys case, a widely publicized dispute about experiments conducted on 17 macaque monkeys inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case lasted 10 years, involved the only police raid on an animal laboratory in the United States, triggered an amendment in 1985 to that country's Animal Welfare Act, and established PETA as an internationally known organization. Today, it focuses on four core issuesâopposition to factory farming, fur farming, animal testing, and the use of animals in entertainment. It also campaigns for a vegan lifestyle and against eating meat, fishing, the killing of animals regarded as pests, the keeping of chained backyard dogs, cock fighting, dog fighting, and bullfighting.\n\nThe group has been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading exporters of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enoughâlaw professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls \"the new welfarists,\" arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told \"Salon\" in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives. There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, \"Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it.\" Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, \"[I]t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world.\" Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be \"press sluts.\" She argues, \"It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves.\"\n\nNewkirk was born in England in 1949, and raised in Hertfordshire and later New Delhi, India, where her fatherâa navigational engineerâwas stationed. Newkirk, now an atheist, was educated in a convent, the only British girl there. She moved to the United States as a teenager, first studying to become a stockbroker, but after taking some abandoned kittens to an animal shelter in 1969 and being appalled by the conditions that she found there, she chose a career in animal protection instead. She became an animal-protection officer for Montgomery County, Maryland, and then the District of Columbia's first woman poundmaster. By 1976, she was head of the animal disease control division of D.C.'s Commission on Public Health and in 1980, was among those named as \"Washingtonians of the Year.\" She told Michael Specter of \"The New Yorker\" that working for the shelters left her shocked at the way the animals were treated:\n\nI went to the front office all the time, and I would say, \"John is kicking the dogs and putting them into freezers.\" Or I would say, \"They are stepping on the animals, crushing them like grapes, and they don't care.\" In the end, I would go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry just thinking about it. And I just felt, to my bones, this cannot be right.\nIn 1980, she divorced Steve Newkirk, whom she had married when she was 19, and the same year met Alex Pacheco, a political science major at George Washington University. Pacheco had studied for the priesthood, then worked as a crew member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's first ship. He volunteered at the shelter where she worked, and they fell in love and began living together, although as Kathy Snow Guillermo writes, they were very differentâNewkirk was older and more practical, whereas Pacheco could barely look after himself. Newkirk read Peter Singer's influential book, \"Animal Liberation\" (1975), and in March 1980, she persuaded Pacheco to join her in forming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, at that point just \"five people in a basement,\" as Newkirk described it. They were mostly students and members of the local vegetarian society, but the group included a friend of Pacheco's from the U.K., Kim Stallwood, a British activist who went on to become the national organizer of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. Pacheco was reluctant at first. \"It just didn't sound great to me,\" he told \"The Los Angeles Times\" in 1992. \"I had been active in Europe ... and I thought there were just too many formalities. I thought we should just do things ourselves. But she made a convincing case that Washington needed a vehicle for animals because the current organizations were too conservative.\"\n\nThe group first came to public attention in 1981 during the Silver Spring monkeys case, a dispute about experiments conducted by researcher Edward Taub on 17 macaque monkeys inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case led to the first police raid in the United States on an animal laboratory, triggered an amendment in 1985 to the United States Animal Welfare Act, and became the first animal-testing case to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which upheld a Louisiana State Court ruling that denied PETA's request for custody of the monkeys.\n\nPacheco had taken a job in May 1981 inside a primate research laboratory at the Institute, intending to gain firsthand experience of working inside an animal laboratory. Taub had been cutting sensory ganglia that supplied nerves to the monkeys' fingers, hands, arms, and legsâa process called \"deafferentation\"âso that the monkeys could not feel them; some of the monkeys had had their entire spinal columns deafferented. He then used restraint, electric shock, and withholding of food and water to force the monkeys to use the deafferented parts of their bodies. The research led in part to the discovery of neuroplasticity and a new therapy for stroke victims called constraint-induced movement therapy.\n\nPacheco went to the laboratory at night, taking photographs that showed the monkeys living in what the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research's \"ILAR Journal\" called \"filthy conditions.\" He passed his photographs to the police, who raided the lab and arrested Taub. Taub was convicted of six counts of cruelty to animals, the first such conviction in the United States of an animal researcher; the conviction, though, was overturned on appeal. Norm Phelps writes that the case followed the highly publicized campaign of Henry Spira in 1976 against experiments on cats being performed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and Spira's subsequent campaign in April 1980 against the Draize test. These and the Silver Spring monkey case jointly put animal rights on the agenda in the United States.\n\nThe 10-year battle for custody of the monkeysâdescribed by \"The Washington Post\" as a vicious mud fight, during which both sides accused the other of lies and distortionâÂ transformed PETA into a national, then international, movement. By February 1991, it claimed over 350,000 members, a paid staff of over 100, and an annual budget of over $7 million.\nPETA was based in Rockville, Maryland, until 1996, when it moved to Norfolk, Virginia. It opened a Los Angeles division in 2006 and also has offices in Washington, D.C., and Oakland, California. In addition, PETA has international affiliates in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, India and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nPETA is an animal rights organization and, as such, it rejects speciesism and also opposes the use and abuse of animals in any way, as food, clothing, entertainment, or research subjects. One oft-cited quote of Newkirk's is: \"When it comes to feelings like hunger, pain, and thirst, a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy.\" PETA lobbies government agencies to impose fines and/or confiscate animals when animal-welfare legislation has been violated, promotes a vegan lifestyle, tries to reform practices on factory farms and in slaughterhouses, sends undercover investigators into animal-research laboratories, farms, and circuses, initiates media campaigns against particular companies or practices, helps to find sanctuaries for animals formerly used by circuses and zoos, and initiates lawsuits against companies that refuse to change their practices. The group has been criticized by a few animal rights advocates for its willingness to work with industries that use animals for the purpose of affecting gradual change. Newkirk rejects this criticism and has said the group exists to hold the radical line.\n\nThe group has 6.5 million members and supporters, it received donations of over $65 million for the year ending July 31, 2016, and its website was receiving 4 million hits a month as of November 2008. Over 83 percent of its operating budget was spent on its programs in 2015â2016, 15 percent on membership development, and 1 percent on management and general operations. Seven percent of its staff earned under $30,000 and 56 percent over $45,000, and Newkirk made just over $30,000.\n\nPacheco left the group in 1999. Its current leadership, in addition to Newkirk, includes Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman, Senior Vice President of Laboratory Investigations Kathy Guillermo, Senior Vice President of Communications Lisa Lange, Senior Vice President of Media Campaigns Dan Mathews, and Senior Vice President of Cruelty Investigations Daphna Nachminovitch. Its honorary directors include Pamela Anderson, James Cromwell, Chrissie Hynde, Bill Maher, and, until his death in 2015, Sam Simon.\n\nThe organization is known for its aggressive media campaigns, combined with a solid base of celebrity supportâin addition to its honorary directors, Paul McCartney, Alicia Silverstone, Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Ellen DeGeneres, and many other notable celebrities have appeared in PETA ads. Every week, Newkirk holds what \"The New Yorker\" calls a \"war council,\" with two dozen of her top strategists gathered at a square table in the PETA conference room, with no suggestion considered too outrageous. PETA also gives an annual prize, called the Proggy Award (for \"progress\"), to individuals or organizations dedicated to animal welfare or who distinguish themselves through their efforts within the area of animal welfare.\n\nMany of the campaigns have focused on large corporations. Fast food companies such as KFC, Wendy's, and Burger King have been targeted. In the animal-testing industry, PETA's consumer boycotts have focused on Avon, Benetton, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Chesebrough-Pond's, Dow Chemical, General Motors, and others. The group's \"modus operandi\" includes buying shares in target companies such as McDonald's and Kraft Foods in order to exert influence. The campaigns have delivered results for PETA. McDonald's and Wendy's introduced vegetarian options after PETA targeted them; Petco stopped selling some exotic pets; and Polo Ralph Lauren said it would no longer use fur. Avon, EstÃ©e Lauder, Benetton, and Tonka Toy Co. all stopped testing products on animals, the Pentagon stopped shooting pigs and goats in wounds tests, and a slaughterhouse in Texas was closed down.\n\nAs part of its anti-fur action, PETA members have infiltrated hundreds of fashion shows in the U.S. and Europe and one in China, throwing red paint on the catwalks and unfurling banners. Celebrities and supermodels have posed naked for the group's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\" campaignâsome men, but mostly womenâtriggering criticism from some feminist animal rights advocates. \"The New Yorker\" writes that PETA activists have crawled through the streets of Paris wearing leg-hold traps and thrown around money soaked in fake blood at the International Fur Fair. They sometimes engage in pie-throwingâin January 2010, Canadian MP Gerry Byrne compared them to terrorists for throwing a tofu cream pie at Canada's fishery minister Gail Shea in protest of the seal slaughter, a comment Newkirk called a silly chest-beating exercise. \"The thing is, we make them gawk,\" she told \"Satya\" magazine, \"maybe like a traffic accident that you have to look at.\"\n\nPETA has also objected to the practice of mulesing (removing strips of wool-bearing skin from around the buttocks of a sheep). In October 2004, PETA launched a boycott against the Australian wool industry, leading some clothing retailers to ban products using Australian wool from their stores. In response, the Australian wool industry sued PETA, arguing among other things that mulesing prevents flystrike, a very painful disease that can affect sheep. A settlement was reached, and PETA agreed to stop the boycott, while the wool industry agreed to seek alternatives to mulesing.\n\nIn 2011, PETA named five orcas as plaintiffs and sued SeaWorld over the animals' captivity, seeking their protection under the Thirteenth Amendment. A federal judge heard the case and dismissed it in early 2012. In August 2014, SeaWorld announced it was building new orca tanks that would almost double the size of the existing ones to provide more space for its whales. PETA responded that a \"larger prison is still a prison.\" In 2016, SeaWorld admitted that it had been sending its employees to pose as activists to spy on PETA. Following an investigation by an outside law firm, SeaWorld's Board of Directors directed management to end the practice.\n\nPatricia de Leon worked with PETA in 2011 to reduce support for bullfighting among Hispanic people.\n\nSome campaigns have been particularly controversial. Newkirk was criticized in 2003 for sending a letter to PLO leader Yasser Arafat asking him to keep animals out of the conflict, after a donkey was blown up during an attack in Jerusalem. The group's 2003 \"Holocaust on your Plate\" exhibitionâeight panels juxtaposing images of Holocaust victims with animal carcasses and animals being transported to slaughterâwas criticized by the Anti-Defamation League, which said, \"the effort by Peta to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent\" and \"[r]ather than deepen our revulsion against what the Nazis did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and to find a way to make sure such catastrophes never happen again.\" In July 2010, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that PETA's campaign was not protected by free speech laws and banned it within Germany as an offense against human dignity. The exhibit, however, had been funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist and created by Matt Prescott, who lost several relatives in the Holocaust. Prescott said: \"The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possibleâthat we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior'âis what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms.\" And analogies between animal rights and the Holocaust had been initiated by the prominent Jewish author Isaac Bashevis Singer. In 2005, the NAACP criticized the \"Are Animals the New Slaves?\" exhibit, which showed images of African-American slaves, Native Americans, child laborers, and women, alongside chained elephants and slaughtered cows.\n\nPETA's \"It's still going on\" campaign features newspaper ads comparing widely publicized murder-cannibalization cases to the deaths of animals in slaughterhouses. The campaign has attracted significant media attention, controversy and generated angry responses from the victims' family members. Ads were released in 1991 describing the deaths of the victims of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, in 2002 describing the deaths of the victims of serial killer Robert William Pickton, and in 2008 describing the murder of Tim McLean. In several cases, newspapers have refused to run the ads.\n\nThe group has also been criticized for aiming its message at young people. \"Your Mommy Kills Animals\" features a cartoon of a woman attacking a rabbit with a knife. To reduce milk consumption, it created the \"Got Beer?\" campaign, a parody of the dairy industry's series of Got Milk? ads, which featured celebrities with milk \"mustaches\" on their upper lips. When the mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000, PETA ran a photograph of him with a white mustache and the words \"Got prostate cancer?\" to illustrate their claim that dairy products contribute to cancer, an ad that caused an outcry in the United States. After PETA placed ads in school newspapers linking milk to acne, obesity, heart disease, cancer, and strokes, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and college officials complained it encouraged underage drinking; the British Advertising Standards Authority asked that the ads be discontinued after complaints from interest groups such as The National Farmers' Unions.\n\nIn August 2011, it was announced that PETA will be launching a soft pornography website in the .xxx domain. PETA spokesperson Lindsay Rajt told the \"Huffington Post\", \"We try to use absolutely every outlet to stick up for animals,\" adding that \"We are careful about what we do and wouldn't use nudity or some of our flashier tactics if we didn't know they worked.\" PETA also used nudity in its \"Veggie Love\" ad which it prepared for the Super Bowl only to have it banned by the network. PETA's work has drawn the ire of some feminists who argue that the organization sacrifices women's rights to press its agenda. Lindsay Beyerstein criticized PETA saying \"They're the ones drawing disturbing analogies between pornography, misogyny and animal cruelty.\"\n\nOther campaigns are less confrontational and more humorous. In 2008, it launched the \"Save the Sea Kittens\" campaign to change the name of fish to \"sea kittens\" to give them a positive image, and it regularly asks towns to adopt a new name. It campaigned in 1996 for a new name for Fishkill, New York, and in April 2003 offered free veggie burgers to Hamburg, New York, if it would call itself Veggieburg.\n\nPETA sometimes issues isolated statements or press releases, commenting on current events. After Lady Gaga wore a dress made of meat in 2010, PETA issued a statement objecting to the dress. After a fisherman in Florida was bitten by a shark in 2011, PETA proposed an advertisement showing a shark biting a human, with the caption \"Payback Is Hell, Go Vegan\". The proposed ad drew criticism from relatives of the injured fisherman. After Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer admitted that he had killed Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe in 2015, PETA's president, Newkirk, issued a statement on behalf of PETA in which she said: \"Hunting is a coward's pastime. If, as has been reported, this dentist and his guides lured Cecil out of the park with food so as to shoot him on private property, because shooting him in the park would have been illegal, he needs to be extradited, charged, and, preferably, hanged.\"\n\nPETA sends its staff undercover into research laboratories, factory farms, and circuses to document the treatment of animals. Investigators may spend many months as employees of a facility, making copies of documents and wearing hidden cameras. By 2007, it had conducted 75 such investigations. It has also produced videos based on material collected during ALF raids. Some undercover efforts have led to lawsuits or government action against companies and universities. PETA itself faced legal action in April 2007 after the owners of a chinchilla ranch in Michigan complained about an undercover inquiry there, but the judge ruled in PETA's favor that undercover investigations can be legitimate.\n\nOne notable case led to a 26-minute film that PETA produced in 1984, \"Unnecessary Fuss\". The film was based on 60 hours of researchers' footage obtained by the ALF during a raid on the University of Pennsylvania's head injury clinic. The footage showed researchers laughing at baboons as they inflicted brain damage on them with a hydraulic device intended to simulate whiplash. Laboratory animal veterinarian Larry Carbone writes that the researchers openly discussed how one baboon was awake before the head injury, despite protocols being in place for anesthesia. The ensuing publicity led to the suspension of funds from the university, the firing of its chief veterinarian, the closure of the lab, and a period of probation for the university.\n\nIn 1990, two PETA activists posed as employees of Carolina Biological, where they took pictures and video footage inside the company, alleging that cats were being mistreated. Following the release of PETA's tapes, the USDA conducted its own inspection and subsequently charged the company with seven violations of the Animal Welfare Act. Four years later, an administrative judge ruled that Carolina Biological had not committed any violations.\n\nIn 1990, Bobby Berosini, a Las Vegas entertainer, lost his wildlife license as well as (on appeal) a later lawsuit against PETA, after the group broadcast an undercover film of him slapping and punching orangutans in 1989. In 1997, a PETA investigation inside Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), a contract animal-testing company, produced film of staff in the UK beating dogs, and what appeared to be abuse of monkeys in the company's New Jersey facility. After the video footage aired on British television in 1999, a group of activists set up Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty to close HLS down, a campaign that continues.\n\nIn 1999, a North Carolina grand jury handed down indictments against pig-farm workers on Belcross Farm in Camden County, the first indictments for animal cruelty on a factory farm in the United States, after a three-month PETA investigation produced film of the workers beating the animals. In 2004, PETA published the results of an eight-month undercover investigation in a West Virginia Pilgrim's Pride slaughterhouse that supplies chickens to KFC. \"The New York Times\" reported the investigation as showing workers stomping on live chickens, throwing dozens against a wall, tearing the head off a chicken to write graffiti, strangling one with a latex glove, and squeezing birds until they exploded. Yum Brands, owner of KFC, called the video appalling and threatened to stop purchasing from Pilgrim's Pride if no changes were made. Pilgrim's Pride subsequently fired 11 employees and introduced an anti-cruelty pledge for workers to sign.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, PETA shot footage inside Covance, an animal-testing company in the U.S. and Europe, that appeared to show monkeys being mistreated in the company's facility in Vienna, Virginia. According to \"The Washington Post\", PETA said an employee of the group filmed primates there being choked, hit, and denied medical attention when badly injured. After PETA sent the video and a 253-page complaint to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Covance was fined $8,720 for 16 citations, three of which involved lab monkeys; the other citations involved administrative issues and equipment. The company said none of the issues were pervasive or endemic and that it had taken corrective action. In 2005, Covance initiated a lawsuit charging PETA with fraud, violation of employee contract, and conspiracy to harm the company's business but did not proceed with it.\n\nPETA also goes undercover into circuses. In 2006, it filmed trainers at Carson & Barnes Circusâincluding Tim Frisco, the animal-care directorâstriking elephants while shouting at them. \"The Washington Post\" writes that the video shows Frisco shouting, \"Make 'em scream!\". A company spokesperson dismissed PETA's concerns as \"Utopian philosophical ideology\" but said the circus would no longer use electric prods.\n\nPETA investigated angora rabbit farms in China in 2013. As CBS News reported of the resulting video footage, \"In the video, the rabbits' high-pitched screams can be heard as farmers rip out their wool until the animal is bald. The rabbits are then thrown back into their cage and appear to be stunned and in shock.\" PETA claimed that 90 percent of the world's angora comes from China, and retailers that carry angora did not initially comment to CBS. Over the next two years, though, because of the investigation, more than 70 retailers, including H&M, Topshop, and Inditex (the world's largest retailer), discontinued their use of angora. Inditex donated its angora products, valued at $878,000, to Syrian refugees.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014, PETA investigated sheep shearing sheds used by the wool industry in Australia and the U.S., uncovering \"evidence of widespread animal abuse.\" In Australia, the group \"sent three undercover investigators to 19 different sheep shearing sheds run by nine different contractors in three states.\" As NBC News reported, \"PETA charges that in Australia, workers for seven contractors kicked, stomped or stood on animals' heads necks and hind limbs, while workers for eight contractors punched or struck sheep with clippers. One worker allegedly beat a lamb over the head with a hammer. Workers for five contractors allegedly threw sheep and or slammed their heads and bodies against floors.\" PETA also sent an investigator to \"25 ranches in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Nebraska\" and subsequently \"asked local authorities in two Colorado counties to file criminal charges against a specific shearer because of alleged acts of abuse witnessed at two ranches.\" Moffat County Sheriff Tim Jantz called the video evidence \"highly concerning\" and launched an investigation.\n\nIn 2014, PETA conducted an undercover investigation of the horse-racing industry, filming seven hours of footage that, as \"The New York Times\" reported, \"showed mistreatment of the horses to be widespread and cavalier.\" Noted trainer Steve Asmussen and his top assistant trainer, Scott Blasi, were accused \"of subjecting their horses to cruel and injurious treatments, administering drugs to them for nontherapeutic purposes, and having one of their jockeys use an electrical device to shock horses into running faster.\" The newspaper noted that this investigation \"was PETA's first significant step into advocacy in the horse racing world.\" In November 2015, as a result of PETA's investigation, Asmussen was fined $10,000 by the New York State Gaming Commission. Robert Williams, executive director of the commission, said, \"We recognize PETA for playing a role in bringing about changes necessary to make thoroughbred racing safer and fairer for all.\" By contrast, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, which also received PETA's allegations, found that Asmussen did not violate any of its rules. Asmussen remains under investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. After a thorough investigation, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission did not bring any charges against Asmussen, stating the allegations \"had neither a factual or scientific basis.\" While the fine from the New York State Gaming Commission was for a minor transgression, the most serious charges were deemed unfounded.\n\nAlso in 2014, PETA investigated China's dog leather trade in the province of Jiangsu. As the \"Daily Mirror\" reported, \"PETA has obtained footage showing workers grabbing terrified dogs with a metal noose, clubbing them then slitting their throats. ... The video footage is too graphic to be shown here and is very distressing to watch.\" The newspaper also noted that \"this is the first time that the production of Chinese dog leather has been captured on camera.\" PETA claimed that \"[p]roducts made from dog leather are exported throughout the world to be sold to unsuspecting customers.\"\n\nIn 2015, as \"The Washington Post\" reported, PETA investigated Sweet Stem Farm, a pig farm that supplies meat to Whole Foods. The resulting video footage \"featured images of pigs, some allegedly sick and not given appropriate care, crowded into hot pens and roughly handled by employees,\" contradicting both the farm's own video self-portrait and Whole Foods' claims about \"humane meat\" (a term that PETA maintains is an oxymoron). \"The Post\" notes that \"[i]n the wake of the PETA investigation, Whole Foods has removed the Sweet Stem video from its Web site.\" PETA subsequently filed a class-action lawsuit against Whole Foods, \"alleging that the chain's claims about animal welfare amount to a 'sham.'\" The lawsuit was dismissed by a federal magistrate, who ruled that the store's signage \"amounted to permissible 'puffery'\" and that \"the statement that 'no cages' were used to raise broiler chickens was not misleading merely because Whole Foods failed to also disclose that poultry suppliers normally do not use cages in the first place.\"\n\nOther PETA investigations from around this time focused on crocodile and alligator farms in Texas and Zimbabwe, a monkey breeding facility in Florida, pigeon racing in Taiwan, ostrich slaughterhouses and tanneries in South Africa, and a dairy farm in North Carolina, where cows were \"wading knee deep through thousands of gallons of their own manure.\"\n\nCBS News reported in November 2016 that PETA had captured footage from restaurants that serve live octopus, shrimp, and other marine animals. The group's video showed \"an octopus writhing as its limbs are severed by a chef at T Equals Fish, a Koreatown sushi restaurant in Los Angeles.\" PETA noted that octopuses \"are considered among the most intelligent invertebrates\" and \"are capable of feeling pain just as a pig or rabbit would.\"\n\nIn December 2016, PETA released video footage from an investigation at Texas A&M University's dog laboratory, which deliberately breeds dogs to contract muscular dystrophy. PETA claims that for \"35 years, dogs have suffered in cruel muscular dystrophy experiments ... which haven't resulted in a cure or treatment for reversing the course of muscular dystrophy in humans.\" The \"Houston Press\" noted that \"Texas A&M has been less than transparent about the research, and in some cases has denied that the dogs experience pain or discomfort.\" Among other efforts, PETA placed a billboard to oppose the ineffectual research on animals.\n\nBio Corporation, a company that supplies dead animals for study and dissection, was the subject of a November 2017 PETA undercover investigation. It was claimed that video footage showed workers at the company's facility in Alexandria, Minnesota \"drowning fully-conscious pigeons, injecting live crayfish with latex and claiming that they sometimes would freeze turtles to death.\" PETA brought 25 charges of cruelty to animals against the company. Drowning is not considered an acceptable form of euthanasia, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, and its standards of humane euthanasia must be followed by companies certified by the United States Department of Agriculture such as Bio Corporation. On 18 April 2018, the case was dismissed and all charges dropped based on the Alexandria City Attorney's Office's assessment that the allegations of cruelty against either pigeons or crayfish were not sufficiently supported. Daniel Paden, PETA's director of evidence analysis, said that PETA is \"reviewing its options to protect animals killed at Bio Corporaton.\"\n\nOn 1 May 2018, PETA released an investigation of the mohair industry that led more than 80 retailers, including UNIQLO and Zappos, to drop products made with mohair. The video evidence \"depicts goats being thrown around wood floors, dunked in poisonous cleaning solution or having their ears mutilated with pliers. â¦ [E]mployees are shown cutting goats' throats, breaking their necks, electrically shocking them and beheading them.\"\n\nVarious states, including Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, and Utah, have passed so-called \"ag-gag\" laws in order to prevent PETA and other groups from conducting undercover investigations of operations that use animals. But PETA and a coalition of animal-welfare groups brought a lawsuit, \"citing First Amendment protections for free speech,\" against Idaho that overturned the state's \"ag-gag\" law in August 2015, setting a precedent that may help overturn these laws in other states. PETA, ALDF, and other groups are also currently suing the states of Utah, North Carolina, and Iowa. \"Ag-gag\" laws have been heavily promoted by the conservative think tank the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).\n\nIn July 2017, a federal judge ruled Utah's ag-gag law an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment, in the case brought against the state by PETA and ALDF. Idaho appealed the case that it lost, in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but lost again in January 2018, after a two-year legal battle, as the judges ruled that portions of the law were \"staggeringly overbroad\" and \"a classic example of a content-based restriction that could not survive strict scrutiny.\" The \"Boise Weekly\" noted that the panel of judges \"upheld sections of the law about obtaining employment under false pretenses, but came down hard against provisions criminalizing videotaping or photographing inside agricultural facilities in Idaho.\"\n\nPETA opposes the no-kill movement, attempts to address the animal-overpopulation crisis at its source through spaying and neutering companion animals as well as by opposing breeders and puppy mills, transfers adoptable animals to open-admission shelters, and euthanizes most of the animals who end up at its \"shelter of last resort.\" According to its 2014 recent filing with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), PETA euthanized 81 percent of the animals who ended up at its shelter. According to VDACS, PETA took 3,017 animals into its shelters in 2014, of which 2,455 were euthanized, 162 were adopted, 353 were released to other shelters, and 6 were reclaimed by their original owners. The group justifies its euthanasia policies toward animals who are not adopted by saying that it takes in feral cat colonies with diseases such as feline AIDS and leukemia, stray dogs, litters of parvo-infected puppies, and backyard dogs and says that it would be unrealistic to follow a \"no-kill\" policy in such instances. PETA offers free euthanasia services to counties that kill unwanted animals via gassing or shootingâthe group recommends the use of an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital if administered by a trained professional and for severely ill or dying animals when euthanasia at a veterinarian is unaffordable. The group recommends not breeding pit bulls and supports euthanasia in certain situations for animals in shelters: for example, for those living for long periods in cramped cages.\nPETA's operation of an animal shelter has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and criticism from animal rights activists. In 2015, the Virginia General Assembly passed a measure aimed at curtailing the operations of its shelter that makes almost no attempt to save animals. Virginia's Senate Bill 1381, enacted in March 2015, defines an animal shelter as \"a facility operated for the purpose of finding permanent adoptive homes for animals.\" PETA opposed the legislation and risked losing access to euthanizing drugs if it did not comply with its requirements.\n\nIn 2008, industry lobby group the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF) formally petitioned VDACS, requesting official reclassification of PETA as a slaughterhouse. The CCF said in a news release that \"[a]n official report filed by PETA itself shows that the animal rights group put to death nearly every dog, cat, and other pet it took in for adoption in 2006.\" A spokesperson for the VDACS said that it had considered changing PETA's status from \"shelter\" to \"euthanasia clinic,\" citing PETA's willingness to handle animals other shelters would not.\n\nPETA has promoted legal initiatives to enforce existing euthanasia laws. In 1990, Georgia's Humane Euthanasia Act became one of the first laws in the nation to mandate intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital as the prescribed method for euthanizing cats and dogs in Georgia animal shelters. Prior to that time, gas chambers and other means were commonly employed. Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin was tasked with licensing the shelters and enforcing the new law, through the department's Animal Protection Division. However, Commissioner Irvin failed to abide by the terms of the law, and instead continued to license gas chambers. PETA contacted the author of the original legislation, and in March 2007, the Georgia Department of Agriculture and Commissioner Irvin were sued by former State Representative Chesley V. Morton. The Fulton County Superior Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, validating the terms of the Humane Euthanasia Act, with an injunction prohibiting the department from issuing licenses to shelters using gas chambers in violation of the act. When the department continued to license a gas chamber in Cobb County, a second court action was brought, which resulted in the department being held in contempt.\n\nTwo PETA employees were acquitted in 2007 of cruelty to animals after at least 80 euthanized animals were left in dumpsters in a shopping center in Ahoskie over the course of a month in 2005; the two employees were seen leaving behind 18 dead animals, and 13 more were found inside their van. The animals had been euthanized after being removed from shelters in Northampton and Bertie counties. A Bertie County Deputy Sheriff stated that the two employees assured the Bertie Animal Shelter that \"they were picking up the dogs to take them back to Norfolk where they would find them good homes.\" During the trial, Daphna Nachminovitch, the supervisor of PETA's Community Animal Project, said PETA began euthanizing animals in some rural North Carolina shelters after it found the shelters killing animals in ways PETA considers inhumane, including by shooting them. She also stated that the dumping of animals did not follow PETA policy.\n\nIn November 2014, a resident of Accomack County, Virginia, produced video evidence that two workers in a van marked with a PETA logo had entered his property in a trailer park and taken his dog, who was then euthanized. He reported the incident to the police, who identified and charged two PETA workers, but the charges were later dropped by the commonwealth attorney on the grounds that it was not possible to prove criminal intent. The trailer park's manager had contacted PETA after a group of residents moved out, leaving their dogs behind, which is why the workers were on the property. The state later determined that PETA had violated state law by failing to ensure that the Chihuahua, who was not wearing a collar or tag, was properly identified and for failing to keep the dog alive for five days before euthanizing the animal. Citing a \"severity of this lapse in judgment,\" the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued PETA a first-ever violation and imposed a $500 fine. The contract worker who had taken the dog was dismissed by PETA.\n\nPETA has also produced various Flash games showcasing its campaigns, including parodies of \"Cooking Mama\", \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Super Meat Boy\", and \"PokÃ©mon\", in order to spread its message on animal welfare, vegetarianism and veganism.\n\nOne of the group's first notable satirical games, called Super Chick Sisters, parodying \"Super Mario Bros\", was released in December 2007, in order to spread its idea of Kentucky Fried Cruelty. Within the game, KFC and especially Colonel Sanders is portrayed as evil and self-serving. The sequel, New Super Chick Sisters, featuring McDonald's and Ronald McDonald as the villain, was released in December 2009, in criticism of how McDonald's McNuggets were made. PETA claims that McDonald's chickens have been treated poorly and said, \"There is a less cruel method of slaughter available today that would eliminate these abuses, yet McDonald's refuses to require its U.S. and Canadian suppliers to switch to it.\"\n\nIn November 2011, another satirical game was released featuring a skinned tanuki chasing Mario to reclaim its fur from him. This was widely criticized as \"absurd and unresearched\" by the gaming community, prompting PETA to explain that it was a tongue-in-cheek effort to draw attention to the real-life issue of tanuki being skinned alive.\n\nNot all critical response to the games has been unfavorable. Mike Fahey of Kotaku opined that \"New Super Chick Sisters\" \"manages to be a rather capable little platformer despite its heavy-handed message.\" Nikole Zivalich of G4TV called \"Super Tofu Boy\" \"actually a pretty good time waster\" and, as she is a vegetarian, claimed to be \"on Team Tofu.\" Overall, Mike Splechta from GameZone stated that \"some are a little less flattering than others, but they do tend to get their point across.\" He also called \"Cage Fight\" \"kickass\", praising its gameplay and chiptune soundtrack, and encouraged readers to play it.\n\nIn some cases, the creators of the original games have responded to PETA's parodies. Such responses included \"Super Meat Boy\" developer Team Meat adding Tofu Boy as a playable character in a \"Super Meat Boy\" update, Majesco responding to \"Cooking Mama: Mama Kills Animals\" about the false information about the game characters' behaviour, and Nintendo criticizing abuse of its intellectual property with PETA's \"PokÃ©mon Black & Blue\" game.\n\nEach year, PETA selects a \"Person of the Year\" who has helped advance the cause of animal rights. In 2015, as \"Time\" magazine reported, the group selected Pope Francis, who took his name from the patron saint of animals, St. Francis of Assisi. Ingrid Newkirk noted, \"With more than a billion Catholics worldwide, Pope Francis' animal-friendly teachings have a massive audience.\" Previous PETA persons of the year include Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Russell Simmons, and Ricky Gervais. More recent picks include Mary Matalin in 2016 and the first nonhuman pick, the macaque Naruto, the subject of the monkey selfie copyright dispute, in 2017.\n\nNewkirk is outspoken in her support of direct action, writing that no movement for social change has ever succeeded without what she calls the militarism component: \"Thinkers may prepare revolutions,\" she wrote of the ALF in 2004, \"but bandits must carry them out.\"\n\nIn 2004 \"The Observer\" described what it called a network of relationships between apparently unconnected animal rights groups on both sides of the Atlantic, writing that, with assets of $6.5 million, and with the PETA Foundation holding further assets of $15 million, PETA funds a number of activists and groupsâsome with links to militant groups, including the ALF, which the FBI has named as a domestic terrorist threat. American writer Don Liddick writes that PETA gave $1,500 to the Earth Liberation Front in 2001âNewkirk said the donation was a mistake, and that the money had been intended for public education about destruction of habitat, but Liddick writes that it went to the legal defense of Craig Rosebraugh, an ELF spokesman. That same year, according to \"The Observer\", PETA gave a $5,000 grant to American animal rights activist Josh Harper, an advocate of arson.\n\nAccording to Liddick, PETA has substantial links with Native American ALF activist Rod Coronado. He alleges that two Federal Express packages were sent to an address in Bethesda, Maryland, before and after a 1992 fire at Michigan State University that Coronado was convicted of setting, reportedly as part of \"Operation Bite Back\", a series of ALF attacks on American animal testing facilities in the 1990s. The first package was picked up by a PETA employee, Maria Blanton, and the second intercepted by the authorities, who identified the handwriting as Coronado's. Liddick writes that the package contained documents removed from the university and a videotape of one of the perpetrators. When they searched Blanton's home, police found some of the paraphernalia of animal liberation raids, including code names for Coronado and Alex PachecoâPETA's co-founderâburglary tools, two-way radios, and fake identification. Liddick also writes that PETA gave Coronado $45,000 for his legal bills and another $25,000 to his father.\n\nNewkirk is a strong supporter of direct action that removes animals from laboratories and other facilitiesâshe told \"The Los Angeles Times\" in 1992 that when she hears of anyone walking into a lab and walking out with animals, her heart sings. Newkirk commented to the Chronicle of Higher Education in 1999, \"When you see the resistance to basic humane treatment and to the acknowledgment of animals' social needs, I find it small wonder that the laboratories aren't all burning to the ground. If I had more guts, I'd light a match.\"\n\nIn an interview for Wikinews (a sister project of Wikipedia which is a news website) in 2007, she said she had been asked by other animal protection groups to condemn illegal acts. \"And I won't do it, because if it were my animal I'd be happy.\" But she added that she does not support arson. \"I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, and so I think at some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that, but maybe that's wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing if they hurt anyone ... Why would you preserve [a building] just so someone can make a profit by continuing to hurt and kill individuals who feel every bit as much as we do?\"\n\nPETA runs several programs though its Community Animal Project for cats and dogs in poorer areas of Virginia, near its headquarters. In 2014, the group sterilized 10,950 cats and dogs, including 851 pit bulls and 584 feral cats, at a discounted rate or free of charge. PETA also shelters neglected dogs and cats who are ill and injured, pursues cruelty cases, and sets up doghouses with straw bedding for dogs chained outside all winter. It supplied 340 doghouses, 1,000 bales of straw, and 2,500 dog toys in 2013. The group urges population control through neutering and adoption from shelters and campaigns against organizations such as the American Kennel Club that promote the selection of purebred breeds.\n\nPETA takes the following position on dogs and cats:\n\nIn a perfect world, animals would be free to live their lives to the fullest, raising their young and following their natural instincts in their native environments. Domesticated dogs and cats, however, cannot live \"free\" in our concrete jungles, so we are responsible for their care. People with the time, money, love, and patience to make a lifetime commitment to an animal can make an enormous difference by adopting an animal from a shelter or rescuing an animal from a perilous life on the streets.\n\nNewkirk has stated that she doesn't use the word \"pet,\" preferring the term \"companion animal,\" and described PETA's vision:\n\nFor one thing, we would no longer allow breeding. People could not create different breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people had companion animals in their homes, those animals would have to be refugees from the animal shelters and the streets. You would have a protective relationship with them just as you would with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased out, and we would return to a more symbiotic relationshipâenjoyment at a distance.\n\nPETA writes that millions of dogs spend their lives chained outside in all weather conditions or locked up in chain-link pens and wire cages in puppy mills, and that even in good homes animals are often not well cared for. They would like to see the population of dogs and cats reduced through spaying and neutering and for people never to purchase animals from pet shops or breeders but to adopt them from shelters instead. PETA supports hearing dog programs in which animals are taken from shelters and placed in appropriate homes but does not endorse seeing-eye-dog programs because, according to one of the group's vice presidents, \"[T]he dogs are bred as if there are no equally intelligent dogs literally dying for homes in shelters.\" PETA also opposes the keeping of fish in aquarium tanks, suggesting that people view computer videos of fish instead.\n\nPETA opposes animal testingâwhether toxicity testing, basic or applied research, or for education and trainingâon both moral and practical grounds. Newkirk told the \"Vogue\" magazine in 1989 that even if animal testing resulted in a cure for AIDS, PETA would oppose it. The group also believes that it is wasteful, unreliable, and irrelevant to human health, because artificially induced diseases in animals are not identical to human diseases. They say that animal experiments are frequently redundant and lack accountability, oversight, and regulation. They promote alternatives, including embryonic stem cell research and in vitro cell research. PETA employees have themselves volunteered for human testing of vaccines; Scott Van Valkenburg, the group's Director of Major Gifts, said in 1999 that he had volunteered for human testing of HIV vaccines.\n\nPETA opposes the use of animals for producing clothing made with fur, leather, wool, or silk. It also opposes the use of down from birds and the use of silk from silkworms or spiders. The group notes on its website: \"Every year, millions of animals are killed for the clothing industryâall in the name of fashion. Whether the clothes come from Chinese fur farms, Indian slaughterhouses, or the Australian outback, an immeasurable amount of suffering goes into every fur-trimmed jacket, leather belt, and wool sweater.\" The group's ongoing campaigns against the use of animals for clothing include \"Ink, Not Mink,\" which highlights images of celebrities with tattoos, including Brandon Flowers of the San Diego Chargers and many others.\n\nAccording to ScienceBasedMedicine.org, PETA has \"a history of (as the old saying goes) using science as a drunk uses a lamppost â for support rather than illumination. In that way they are typical of ideological groups. They have an agenda, they are very open about their beliefs, and they marshal whatever arguments they can in order to promote their point of view.\"\n\nPETA that \"scientific studies have shown that many autistic kids improve dramatically when put on a diet free of dairy foods.\"\n\nStudies such as these have been around for decades and are mainly centered around the concept that behavioral differences between people with autism and neurotypicals may be observed through a gluten-free diet. According to ScienceBasedMedicine.org:\nBehavior in children, especially those with the challenge of autism, can be unpredictable. Unpredictable and variable symptoms lend themselves to confirmation bias, with a strong tendency to lead to the anecdotal experience that whatever is being looked for is real. For example, many parents believe that sugar makes their children hyperactive, when this is simply not true. [...] The evidence for any effect on behavior is weak and likely not real. There is also no credible evidence to suggest that casein plays a causal role in autism. The evidence is overwhelming that autism is a genetic disorder. [...] This is clearly, in my opinion, a campaign of fear mongering based upon a gross distortion of the scientific evidence. The purpose is to advocate for a vegan diet, which fits their ideological agenda. They are likely aware that it is easier to spread fears than to reassure with a careful analysis of the scientific evidence.\n\nEven though the website cites studies, these studies are outdated, vague, relied on a very small sample size of children, were single-blind tests (which can be heavily influenced by an experimenter's bias), and conflated correlation with causation. The billboards put up by PETA promoting this research have also been considered offensive by many autistic individuals.\n\nPETA is critical of television personalities they call self-professed wildlife warriors, arguing that while a conservationist message is getting across, some of the actions are harmful to animals, such as invading animals' homes, netting them, subjecting them to stressful environments, and wrestling with themâoften involving young animals the group says should be with their mothers. In 2006 when Steve Irwin died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had made a career out of antagonizing frightened wild animals. Australian Member of Parliament Bruce Scott said PETA should apologize to Irwin's family and the rest of Australia.\n\nPETA Asia-Pacific was founded by Ingrid Newkirk in Hong Kong in 2005 to support animal rights programs and campaigns in Asia. Jason Baker, a former staff member of PETA who was involved in setting up PETA India and PETA Australia, is PETA Asia-Pacific's first director. Its offices are in Hong Kong and Manila. It works through public education, animal cruelty investigations, research, animal rescue, legislation, special events, celebrity involvement, and protest campaigns. Its campaigns cover countries including China, Japan, Malaysia, and South Korea.\n\nPETA Asia-Pacific promotes vegetarian and vegan diets through three specific campaigns: education about the benefits of a vegetarian diet, demonstrations and celebrity involvement against fast food outlets, and undercover investigations of animals used for live transport and traditional religious slaughter. The organization has also used the PETA Lettuce Ladies in local demonstrations. PETA Asia-Pacific regularly demonstrates against KFC outlets to promote better treatment of chickens used by the company.\n\nPETA Asia-Pacific supports the PETA campaign \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur,\" in which celebrities appear nude to express their opposition to wearing fur. The group also stages anti-fur events to publicize its opposition to fur. PETA Asia-Pacific has been involved in several undercover investigations of fur farms in China.\n\nThe group regularly protests the use of animals in entertainment, including circuses. These demonstrations are specific to the area, including anti-bull riding, not keeping wild animals in chains, stopping humanâanimal wrestling matches., and elephant polo. Allegations of animal cruelty surfaced in Thailand during the 2018 King's Cup Elephant Polo tourney.\n\nFour days after an anti-polo PETA editorial ran in Bangkok's English-language newspaper, \"The Nation\", the Thailand Elephant Polo Association announced that it will end polo matches in Thailand. The King's Cup Elephant Polo tourney had been held annually at Anantara Hotel Bangkok owned by Minor Hotels.\n\nPETA Asia-Pacific also coordinates protests against other uses of animals it believes are abusive, including rats, which it seeks to improve the treatment of, and also advocates for improvements for companion animals. In 2016, PETA Asia-Pacific shocked customers with a fake pop-up shop in Bangkok called The Leather Work, which seemed to specialize in \"luxury\" leather bags, shoes, and other clothing and accessories. Inside the items, though, were what appeared to be the gory flesh, sinews, beating hearts, and blood of animals slaughtered for such items. According to the \"Asian Correspondent\", the stunt caused shoppers to jump back and gasp in horror. PETA claims \"to have found workers in crocodile farms 'sawing open reptile's necks while the animals are still alive'\" and that \"snakes and lizards are cruelly 'nailed to trees' or 'decapitated' before being 'skinned alive.'\"\nPETA India, based in Mumbai, was founded in January 2000. According to the group's website, it focuses principally on \"investigative work, public education efforts, research, animal rescues, legislative work, special events, celebrity involvement and national media coverage.\"\n\nThe group has launched investigations of jallikattu events, circuses that use animals in performances, and filthy horse stables in Mumbai, among others. The investigation of 16 circuses in India over a nine-month period \"revealed that animals used in circuses were subjected to chronic confinement, physical abuse, and psychological torment\" and also led the Animal Welfare Board of India to \"ban registration of elephants for performance in view of the cruelties and abuse suffered by them.\"\n\nIn 2015, with support from celebrities such as Paul McCartney and Pamela Anderson, PETA India rescued a 14-year-old male elephant named Sunder, who had been kept captive in chains \"at a temple in the Kolhapur district of Maharashtra for seven years.\" Sunder was transferred to Bannerghatta Biological Park, a forested sanctuary, where he can roam freely in the company of other elephants.\n\nIndian celebrities who have collaborated with PETA India include Shahid Kapoor, Hema Malini, and Raveena Tandon, among many others.\n\nPETA India is affiliated with Animal Rahat (\"Rahat\" means \"relief\"), a nonprofit organization that \"was created to make a difference in the lives of working bullocks, donkeys, ponies, horses, and other animals.\" It's located in the sugar-mill district of Sangli, India, and is dedicated to providing \"free aid to bullocks who work in sugar mills, donkeys who are used in the brick kilns, horses who pull carts, and other working animals\" as well as helping \"animals' owners, who are often too poor to afford the sustenance necessary to maintain animals' health and strength, pay for veterinary care in times of illness and injury, or give their animals time for rest and recuperation.\" The group, which began its work in 2011, \"has worked to ensure that over 7,000 bullocks primarily employed in Maharashtra's sugar factories were replaced by mini-tractors.\"\n\n\nIn February 1995, a parody website calling itself \"People Eating Tasty Animals\" registered the domain name \"peta.org\". PETA sued, claiming trademark violation, and won the suit in 2001; the domain is currently owned by PETA. While still engaged in legal proceedings over \"peta.org\", PETA themselves registered the domains \"ringlingbrothers.com\" and \"voguemagazine.com\", using the sites to accuse Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus and Vogue of animal cruelty. PETA later surrendered the domains under threat of similar legal action over trademark infringement.\n\nRobert Garner of the University of Leicester writes that Newkirk and Pacheco are the leading exporters of animal rights to the more moderate groups in the United Statesâboth members of an animal rights elite that he argues has shaken up the animal rights movement, setting up new groups and radicalizing old ones.\n\nPhilanthropedia says of the group: \"A very controversial organization, PETA is known for bringing into public view the plight of animals of many different kinds. They have brought many issues to the front of people's consciousness about inhumane treatment of animals even though many experts find their marketing and communication tactics a bit extreme at times.\" The site's summary of expert opinion on the organization's strengths is as follows: \"PETA is highly visible, consistent, and well organized. According to experts, they are very tightly focused on their mission and they are able to generate media attention to the cause.\"\n\nSpecific experts consulted by Philanthropedia, including academics and senior staff members of other nonprofits, made the following observations about the group's position within the animal rights movement:\n\nDespite the group's successes, there has been criticism of PETA from both the conservative and radical ends of the animal rights movement. Michael Specter writes that it provides for groups such as the Humane Society of the United States the same dynamic that Malcolm X provided for Martin Luther King, or Andrea Dworkin for Gloria Steinemâsomeone radical to alienate the mainstream and make moderate voices more appealing. The failure to condemn the Animal Liberation Front triggers complaints from the conservatives, while the more radical activists say the group has lost touch with its grassroots, is soft on the idea of animal rights, and that it should stop the media stunts, the pie-throwing, and the use of nudity. \"It's hard enough trying to get people to take animal rights seriously without PETA out there acting like a bunch of jerks,\" one activist told writer Norm Phelps. However, Phelps continued: \"But it's hard to argue with success, and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world, in terms of both membership and spreading the animal rights message to the public at large.\"\n\nThe ads featuring barely clad or naked women have been criticized by some feminist animal rights advocates. When Ronald Reagan's daughter Patti Davis posed naked for \"Playboy\", donating half her $100,000 fee to PETA, the group issued a press release saying Davis \"turns the other cheek in an eye-opening spread,\" then announced she had been photographed naked with Hugh Hefner's dog for an anti-fur ad. In 1995, PETA formed a partnership with \"Playboy\" to promote human organ donation, with the caption \"Some People Need You Inside Them\" on a photograph of Hefner's wife. The long-standing campaign, \"I'd rather go naked than wear fur,\" in which celebrities and supermodels strip for the camera, generated particular concern.\n\nNewkirk has replied to the criticism that no one is being exploited, the women taking part are volunteers, and if sexual attraction advances the cause of animals, she is unapologetic. Asked in 2007 how she feels when criticized from within the movement, she said: \"Somebody has to push the envelope. If you say something that someone already agrees with, then what's the point, and so we make some more conservative animal protection organizations uncomfortable; they don't want to be associated with us because it will be embarrassing for them, and I understand that. Our own members write to us sometimes and say, 'Oh why did you do this? I don't want anyone to know I'm a PETA member.'\"\n\nGary Francione, professor of law at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, argues that PETA is not an animal rights groupâand further that there is no animal rights movement in the United Statesâbecause of their willingness to work with industries that use animals to achieve incremental change. This makes them an animal welfare group, in Francione's view: what he calls the new welfarists. A proponent of abolitionism, Francione argues that PETA is trivializing the movement with what he calls the \"Three Stooges\" theory of animal rights, making the public think progress is underway when the changes are only cosmetic.\n\nHowever, like Francione, PETA describes itself as abolitionist. Newkirk told an animal rights conference in 2002 that PETA's goal remains animal liberation: \"Reforms move a society very importantly from A to B, from B to C, from C to D. It's very hard to take a nation or a world that is built on seeing animals as nothing more than hamburgers, handbags, cheap burglar alarms, tools for research, and move them from A to Z ...\"\n\nFrancione has also criticized PETA for having caused grassroots animal rights groups to close, groups that he argues were essential for the survival of the animal rights movement, which rejects the centrality of corporate animal charities. Francione writes that PETA initially set up independent chapters around the United States, but closed them in favor of a top-down, centralized organization, which not only consolidated decision-making power, but centralized donations too. Now, local animal rights donations go to PETA, rather than to a local group. Some members of the animal-rights movement have responded that Francione's position with respect to groups engaged in actual fieldwork is unnecessarily divisive and hurts animal advocacy.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23808", "title": "Pope Pius XII", "text": "Pope Pius XII\n\nPope Pius XII (), born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (; 2Â March 18769 October 1958), was the Pope of the Catholic Church from 2 March 1939 to his death. Before his election to the papacy, he served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany, and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \"Reichskonkordat\" with Nazi Germany. \n\nWhile the Vatican was officially neutral during World War II, Pius XII maintained links to the German Resistance, used diplomacy to aid the victims of the war and lobby for peace, and spoke out against race-based murders and other atrocities. The \"Reichskonkordat\" and his leadership of the Catholic Church during the war remain the subject of controversyâincluding allegations of public silence and inaction about the fate of the Jews. After the war, he advocated peace and reconciliation, including lenient policies towards former Axis and Axis-satellite nations. He was also a staunch opponent of Communism and of the Italian Communist Party.\n\nDuring his papacy, the Church issued the Decree against Communism, declaring that Catholics who profess Communist doctrine are to be excommunicated as apostates from the Christian faith. In turn, the Church experienced severe persecution and mass deportations of Catholic clergy in the Eastern Bloc. He explicitly invoked \"ex cathedra\" papal infallibility with the dogma of the Assumption of Mary in his Apostolic constitution \"Munificentissimus Deus\". His magisterium includes almost 1,000 addresses and radio broadcasts. His forty-one encyclicals include \"Mystici corporis\", the Church as the Body of Christ; \"Mediator Dei\" on liturgy reform; and \"Humani generis\" on the Church's positions on theology and evolution. He eliminated the Italian majority in the College of Cardinals in 1946.\n\nAfter his 1958 death, he was succeeded by Pope John XXIII. In the process toward sainthood, his cause for canonization was opened on 18Â November 1965 by Pope Paul VI during the final session of the Second Vatican Council. He was made a Servant of God by Pope John Paul II in 1990 and Pope Benedict XVI declared Pius XII Venerable on 19 December 2009.\n\nEugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli was born on 2 March 1876 in Rome into a family of intense Catholic piety with a history of ties to the papacy (the \"Black Nobility\"). His parents were Filippo Pacelli (1837â1916) and Virginia (nÃ©e Graziosi) Pacelli (1844â1920). His grandfather, Marcantonio Pacelli, had been Under-Secretary in the Papal Ministry of Finances and then Secretary of the Interior under Pope Pius IX from 1851 to 1870 and helped found the Vatican's newspaper, \"L'Osservatore Romano\" in 1861. His cousin, Ernesto Pacelli, was a key financial advisor to Pope Leo XIII; his father, Filippo Pacelli, a Franciscan tertiary, was the dean of the Roman Rota; and his brother, Francesco Pacelli, became a lay canon lawyer and the legal advisor to Pope Pius XI, in which role he negotiated the Lateran Treaty in 1929, the pact with Benito Mussolini, bringing an end to the Roman Question.\nTogether with his brother Francesco and his two sisters, Giuseppina and Elisabetta, he grew up in the Parione district in the centre of Rome. Soon after the family had moved to Via Vetrina in 1880 he began school at the convent of the French Sisters of Divine Providence in the Piazza Fiammetta. The family worshipped at Chiesa Nuova. Eugenio and the other children made their First Communion at this church and Eugenio served there as an altar boy from 1886. In 1886 too he was sent to the private school of Professor Giuseppe Marchi, close to the Piazza Venezia. In 1891 Pacelli's father sent Eugenio to the Liceo Ennio Quirino Visconti Institute, a state school situated in what had been the Collegio Romano, the premier Jesuit university in Rome.\n\nIn 1894, aged 18, Pacelli began his theology studies at Rome's oldest seminary, the Almo Collegio Capranica, and in November of the same year, registered to take a philosophy course at the Jesuit Pontifical Gregorian University and theology at the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare. He was also enrolled at the State University, La Sapienza where he studied modern languages and history. At the end of the first academic year however, in the summer of 1895, he dropped out of both the Capranica and the Gregorian University. According to his sister Elisabetta, the food at the Capranica was to blame. Having received a special dispensation he continued his studies from home and so spent most of his seminary years as an external student. In 1899 he completed his education in Sacred Theology with a doctoral degree awarded on the basis of a short dissertation and an oral examination in Latin.\n\nWhile all other candidates from the Rome diocese were ordained in the Basilica of St. John Lateran, Pacelli was ordained a priest on Easter Sunday, 2 April 1899 alone in the private chapel of a family friend the Vicegerent of Rome, Mgr Paolo Cassetta. Shortly after ordination he began postgraduate studies in canon law at Sant'Apollinaire. He received his first assignment as a curate at Chiesa Nuova. In 1901 he entered the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, a sub-office of the Vatican Secretariat of State.\n\nMonsignor Pietro Gasparri, the recently appointed undersecretary at the Department of Extraordinary Affairs, had underscored his proposal to Pacelli to work in the \"Vatican's equivalent of the Foreign office\" by highlighting the \"necessity of defending the Church from the onslaughts of secularism and liberalism throughout Europe\". Pacelli became an \"apprendista\", an apprentice, in Gasparri's department. In January 1901 he was also chosen, by Pope Leo XIII himself, according to an official account, to deliver condolences on behalf of the Vatican to King Edward VII of the UK after the death of Queen Victoria.\n\nBy 1904 Pacelli received his doctorate. The theme of his thesis was the nature of concordats and the function of canon law when a concordat falls into abeyance. Promoted to the position of \"minutante\", he prepared digests of reports that had been sent to the Secretariat from all over the world and in the same year became a papal chamberlain. In 1905 he received the title domestic prelate. From 1904 until 1916, he assisted Cardinal Pietro Gasparri in his codification of canon law with the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. According to John Cornwell, \"the text, together with the Anti-Modernist Oath, became the means by which the Holy See was to establish and sustain the new, unequal, and unprecedented power relationship that had arisen between the papacy and the Church.\"\n\nIn 1908, Pacelli served as a Vatican representative on the International Eucharistic Congress, accompanying Rafael Merry del Val to London, where he met Winston Churchill. In 1911, he represented the Holy See at the coronation of King George V.\nPacelli became the under-secretary in 1911, adjunct-secretary in 1912 (a position he received under Pope Pius X and retained under Pope Benedict XV), and secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in February 1914. On 24 June 1914, just four days before Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated in Sarajevo, Pacelli, together with Cardinal Merry del Val, represented the Vatican when the Serbian Concordat was signed. Serbia's success in the First Balkan War against Turkey in 1912 had increased the number of Catholics within greater Serbia. At this time Serbia, encouraged by Russia, was challenging Austria-Hungary's sphere of influence throughout the Balkans. Pius X died on 20 August 1914. His successor Benedict XV named Gasparri as secretary of state and Gasparri took Pacelli with him into the Secretariat of State, making him undersecretary. During World War I, Pacelli maintained the Vatican's registry of prisoners of war and worked to implement papal relief initiatives. In 1915, he travelled to Vienna to assist Monsignor Raffaele Scapinelli, nuncio to Vienna, in his negotiations with Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria regarding Italy.\n\nPope Benedict XV appointed Pacelli as nuncio to Bavaria on 23 April 1917, consecrating him as titular Archbishop of Sardis in the Sistine Chapel on 13 May 1917. After his consecration, Eugenio Pacelli left for Bavaria. As there was no nuncio to Prussia or Germany at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the German Empire.\n\nOnce in Munich, he conveyed the papal initiative to end the war to German authorities. He met with King Ludwig III on 29 May, and later with Kaiser Wilhelm II and Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, who replied positively to the Papal initiative. However, Bethmann-Hollweg was forced to resign and the German High Command, hoping for a military victory, delayed the German reply until 20 September.\n\nSister Pascalina later recalled that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned \"deaf ear to all his proposals\". She later wrote, \"Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it occurs to me over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the Rhine with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well.' I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right.\"\n\nFor the remainder of the Great War, Pacelli concentrated on Benedict's humanitarian efforts especially among Allied POWs in German custody. In the upheaval following the Armistice, a disconcerted Pacelli sought Benedict XV's permission to leave Munich, where Kurt Eisner had formed the Free State of Bavaria, and he left for a while to Rorschach, and a tranquil Swiss sanatorium run by nuns. Monsignor Schioppa, the \"uditore\", was left in Munich.\n\n\"His recovery began with a 'rapport with the 24-year-old Sister Pascalina Lehnertâshe would soon be transferred to Munich when Pacelli \"pulled strings at the highest level\".\n\nWhen he returned to Munich, following Eisner's assassination by an anti-Semitic extreme nationalist, Count Anton von Arco auf Valley, he informed Gasparri-using Schioppa's eye-witness testimony of the chaotic scene at the former royal palace as the trio of Max Levien, Eugen Levine, and Towia Axelrod sought power: \"the scene was indescribable [-] the confusion totally chaotic [-] in the midst of all this, a gang of young women, of dubious appearance, Jews like the rest of them hanging around [-] the boss of this female rabble was Levien's mistress, a young Russian woman, a Jew and a divorcÃ©e [-] and it was to her that the nunciature was obliged to pay homage in order to proceed [-] Levien is a young man, also Russian and a Jew. Pale, dirty, with drugged eyes, vulgar, repulsive ...\" John Cornwell alleges that a worrying impression of anti-Semitism is discernible in the \"catalogue of epithets describing their physical and moral repulsiveness\" and Pacelli's \"constant harping on the Jewishness of this party of power usurpers\" chimed with the \"growing and widespread belief among Germans that the Jews were the instigators of the Bolshevik revolution, their principal aim being the destruction of Christian civilization\". Also according to Cornwell, Pacelli informed Gasparri that \"the capital of Bavaria, is suffering under a harsh Jewish-Russian revolutionary tyranny\".\n\nAccording to Sister Pascalina Lehnert, the Nuncio was repeatedly threatened by emissaries of the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Once, in a violation of international law, the Bavarian Revolutionary Government attempted to confiscate the Nunciature's car at gunpoint. Despite their demands, however, Pacelli refused to leave his post.\n\nAfter the Munich Soviet Republic was defeated and toppled by Freikorps and Reichswehr troops, the Nuncio focused on, according to Lehnert, \"alleviating the distress of the postwar period, consoling, supporting all in word and deed\".\nPacelli was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Germany on 23 June 1920, andâafter the completion of a Bavarian concordatâhis nunciature was moved to Berlin in August 1925. Many of Pacelli's Munich staff stayed with him for the rest of his life, including his advisor Robert Leiber and Sister Pascalina Lehnertâhousekeeper, cook, friend, and adviser for 41 years. In Berlin, Pacelli was Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and active in diplomatic and many social activities. He was aided by the German priest Ludwig Kaas, who was known for his expertise in Church-state relations and was a full-time politician, politically active in the Catholic Centre Party, a party he led following Wilhelm Marx's resignation in October 1928. While in Germany, he travelled to all regions, attended Katholikentag (national gatherings of the faithful), and delivered some 50 sermons and speeches to the German people. In Berlin he lived in the Tiergarten quarter and threw parties for the official and diplomatic elite. Paul von Hindenburg, Gustav Stresemann, and other members of the Cabinet were regular guests.\nIn post-war Germany, in the absence of a nuncio in Moscow, Pacelli worked also on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. He negotiated food shipments for Russia, where the Church was persecuted. He met with Soviet representatives including Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin, who rejected any kind of religious education, the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican.\n\nDespite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until Pius XI ordered them to be discontinued in 1927. Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies. He blocked French attempts for an ecclesiastical separation of the Saar region, supported the appointment of a papal administrator for Danzig and aided the reintegration of priests expelled from Poland. A Prussian Concordat was signed on 14 June 1929. Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the beginnings of a world economic slump appeared, and the days of the Weimar Republic were numbered. Pacelli was summoned back to Rome at this timeâthe call coming by telegram when he was resting at his favourite retreat, the Rorschach convent sanatorium. He left Berlin on 10 December 1929. David Dalin wrote \"of the forty-four speeches Pacelli gave in Germany as papal nuncio between 1917 and 1929, forty denounced some aspect of the emerging Nazi ideology\". In 1935 he wrote a letter to the bishop of Cologne describing the Nazis as \"false prophets with the pride of Lucifer\". and as \"bearers of a new faith and a new Evangile\" who were attempting to create \"a mendacious antimony between faithfulness to the Church and the Fatherland\". Two years later at Notre Dame in Paris he named Germany as \"that noble and powerful nation whom bad shepherds would lead astray into an ideology of race\".\n\nPacelli was made a Cardinal-Priest of \"Santi Giovanni e Paolo\" on 16 December 1929 by Pope Pius XI, and within a few months, on 7 February 1930, Pius XI appointed him Cardinal Secretary of State, responsible for foreign policy and state relations throughout the world. In 1935, Pacelli was named Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church.\n\nAs Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with a number of countries and states. Immediately on becoming Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli and Ludwig Kaas took up negotiations on a Baden Concordat which continued until the spring and summer of 1932. Papal fiat appointed a supporter of Pacelli and his concordat policy, Conrad GrÃ¶ber, the new Archbishop of Freiburg, and the treaty was signed in August\n1932. Others followed: Austria (1933), Germany (1933), Yugoslavia (1935) and Portugal (1940). The Lateran treaties with Italy (1929) were concluded before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Catholicism had become the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic Catholic Popular Party, in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged Catholic Action, \"an anaemic form of clerically dominated religious rally-rousing\". It was permitted only so long as it developed \"its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles\". Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g., church decrees of nullity in the area of marriage).\n\nAs the decade began Pacelli wanted the Centre Party in Germany to turn away from the socialists. In the summer of 1931 he clashed with Catholic chancellor Heinrich Bruning, who frankly told Pacelli he believed that he \"misunderstood the political situation in Germany and the real character of the Nazis\". Following Bruning's resignation in May 1932 Pacelli, like the new Catholic chancellor Franz von Papen, wondered if the Centre Party should look to the Right for a coalition, \"that would correspond to their principles\". He made many diplomatic visits throughout Europe and the Americas, including an extensive visit to the United States in 1936 where he met President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who appointed a personal envoyâwho did not require Senate confirmationâto the Holy See in December 1939, re-establishing a diplomatic tradition that had been broken since 1870 when the pope lost temporal power.\nPacelli presided as Papal Legate over the International Eucharistic Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 10â14 October 1934, and in Budapest in 25â30 May 1938. At this time, anti-semitic laws were in the process of being formulated in Hungary. Pacelli made reference to the Jews \"whose lips curse [Christ] and whose hearts reject him even today\". This traditional adversarial relationship with Judaism would be reversed in \"Nostra aetate\" issued during the Second Vatican Council. According to Joseph Bottum, Pacelli in 1937 \"warned A. W. Klieforth, the American consul to Berlin, that Hitler was 'an untrustworthy scoundrel and fundamentally wicked person', to quote Klieforth, who also wrote that Pacelli 'did not believe Hitler capable of moderation, and ... fully supported the German bishops in their anti-Nazi stand.' This was matched with the discovery of Pacelli's anti-Nazi report, written the following year for President Roosevelt and filed with Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, which declared that the Church regarded compromise with the Third Reich as 'out of the question'.\"\n\nHistorian Walter Bussmann argued that Pacelli, as Cardinal Secretary of State, dissuaded Pope Pius XIâwho was nearing death at the timeâfrom condemning the \"Kristallnacht\" in November 1938, when he was informed of it by the papal nuncio in Berlin. \n\nThe draft encyclical \"Humani generis unitas\" (\"On the Unity of the Human Race\") was ready in September 1938 but, according to those responsible for an edition of the document and other sources, it was not forwarded to the Holy See by the Jesuit General Wlodimir LedÃ³chowski. The draft encyclical contained an open and clear condemnation of colonialism, racial persecution and antisemitism. Historians Passelecq and Suchecky have argued that Pacelli learned about the existence of the draft only after the death of Pius XI and did not promulgate it as Pope. He did use parts of it in his inaugural encyclical \"Summi Pontificatus\", which he titled \"On the Unity of Human Society\". His various positions on Church and policy issues during his tenure as Cardinal Secretary of State were made public by the Holy See in 1939. Most noteworthy among the 50 speeches is his review of Church-State issues in Budapest in 1938.\n\nThe \"Reichskonkordat\" was an integral part of four concordats Pacelli concluded on behalf of the Vatican with German States. The state concordats were necessary because the German federalist Weimar constitution gave the German states authority in the area of education and culture and thus diminished the authority of the churches in these areas; this diminution of church authority was a primary concern of the Vatican. As Bavarian Nuncio, Pacelli negotiated successfully with the Bavarian authorities in 1925. He expected the concordat with Catholic Bavaria to be the model for the rest of Germany. Prussia showed interest in negotiations only after the Bavarian concordat. However, Pacelli obtained less favorable conditions for the Church in the Prussian concordat of 1929, which excluded educational issues. A concordat with the German state of Baden was completed by Pacelli in 1932, after he had moved to Rome. There he also negotiated a concordat with Austria in 1933. A total of 16 concordats and treaties with European states had been concluded in the ten-year period 1922â1932.\n\nThe \"Reichskonkordat\", signed on 20 July 1933, between Germany and the Holy See, while thus a part of an overall Vatican policy, was controversial from its beginning. It remains the most important of Pacelli's concordats. It is debated, not because of its content, which is still valid today, but because of its timing. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli's main objectives as secretary of state, because he had hoped to strengthen the legal position of the Church. Pacelli, who knew German conditions well, emphasized in particular protection for Catholic associations (Â§31), freedom for education and Catholic schools, and freedom for publications.\n\nAs nuncio during the 1920s, he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments, but the opposition of Protestant and Socialist parties, the instability of national governments and the care of the individual states to guard their autonomy thwarted this aim. In particular, the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.\n\nAdolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor on 30 January 1933 and sought to gain international respectability and to remove internal opposition by representatives of the Church and the Catholic Centre Party. He sent his vice chancellor Franz von Papen, a Catholic nobleman and member of the Centre Party, to Rome to offer negotiations about a Reichskonkordat. On behalf of Pacelli, Prelate Ludwig Kaas, the outgoing chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated first drafts of the terms with Papen. The concordat was finally signed, by Pacelli for the Vatican and von Papen for Germany, on 20 July and ratified on 10 September 1933. Father Franziscus Stratman, senior Catholic chaplain at Berlin University wrote \"The souls of well-disposed people are in a turmoil as a result of the tyranny of the National Socialists, and I am merely stating a fact when I say that the authority of the bishops among innumerable Catholics and non-Catholics has been shaken by the quasi-approval of the National Socialist movement\". Bishop Preysing cautioned against compromise with the new regime, against those who saw the Nazi persecution of the church as an aberration that Hitler would correct.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1939, Pacelli issued 55 protests of violations of the \"Reichskonkordat\". Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the \"Reichskonkordat\"; this was to become Pius XI's 1937 encyclical, \"Mit brennender Sorge\". The encyclical was written in German and not the usual Latin of official Catholic Church documents. Secretly distributed by an army of motorcyclists and read from every German Catholic Church pulpit on Palm Sunday, it condemned the paganism of the National Socialism ideology. Pius XI credited its creation and writing to Pacelli. It was the first official denunciation of Nazism made by any major organization and resulted in persecution of the Church by the infuriated Nazis who closed all the participating presses and \"took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of the Catholic clergy\". On 10 June 1941, the pope commented on the problems of the \"Reichskonkordat\" in a letter to the Bishop of Passau, in Bavaria: \"The history of the Reichskonkordat shows, that the other side lacked the most basic prerequisites to accept minimal freedoms and rights of the Church, without which the Church simply cannot live and operate, formal agreements notwithstanding\".\n\nCardinal Pacelli gave a lecture entitled \"La Presse et L'Apostolat\" at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\" on April 17, 1936.\n\nPope Pius XI died on 10 February 1939. Several historians have interpreted the conclave to choose his successor as facing a choice between a diplomatic or a spiritual candidate, and they view Pacelli's diplomatic experience, especially with Germany, as one of the deciding factors in his election on 2Â March 1939, his 63rd birthday, after only one day of deliberation and three ballots. He was the first cardinal Secretary of State to be elected pope since Clement IX in 1667. He was one of only two men known to have served as Camerlengo immediately prior to being elected as pope (the other being Pope Leo XIII). According to rumours, he asked for another ballot to be taken to ensure the validity of his election. After his election was indeed confirmed, he chose the name Pius XII in honour of his immediate predecessor.\n\nHis coronation took place on 12 March 1939. Upon being elected pope he was also formally the Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches and prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation. There was however a Cardinal-Secretary to run these bodies on a day-to-day basis.\n\nPacelli took the same papal name as his predecessor, a title used exclusively by . He was quoted as saying, \"I call myself Pius; my whole life was under Popes with this name, but especially as a sign of gratitude towards Pius XI.\" On 15 December 1937, during his last consistory, Pius XI strongly hinted to the cardinals that he expected Pacelli to be his successor, saying \"He is in your midst.\" He had previously been quoted as saying: \"When today the Pope dies, you'll get another one tomorrow, because the Church continues. It would be a much bigger tragedy, if Cardinal Pacelli dies, because there is only one. I pray every day, God may send another one into one of our seminaries, but as of today, there is only one in this world.\"\n\nAfter his election, he made Luigi Maglione his successor as Cardinal Secretary of State. Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished diplomatic relations with Switzerland and was for many years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignors Montini (later Pope Paul VI) and Domenico Tardini. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section. Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals, an honor which both turned down. They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia. Tardini continued to be a close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of Milan, after the death of Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster.\n\nPius XII slowly eroded the Italian monopoly on the Roman Curia; he employed German and Dutch Jesuit advisors, Robert Leiber, Augustin Bea, and Sebastian Tromp. He also supported the elevation of Americans such as Cardinal Francis Spellman from a minor to a major role in the Church. After World War II, Pius XII appointed more non-Italians than any Pope before him. American appointees included Joseph P. Hurley as regent of the nunciature in Belgrade, Gerald P. O'Hara as nuncio to Romania, and Monsignor Muench as nuncio to Germany. For the first time, numerous young Europeans, Asians and \"Americans were trained in various congregations and secretariats within the Vatican for eventual service throughout the world.\"\n\nOnly twice in his pontificate did Pius XII hold a consistory to create new cardinals, in contrast to Pius XI, who had done so 17 times in as many years. Pius XII chose not to name new cardinals during World War II, and the number of cardinals shrank to 38, with Dennis Joseph Dougherty of Philadelphia being the only living U.S. cardinal. The first occasion on 18 February 1946âwhich has become known as the \"Grand Consistory\"âyielded the elevation of a record 32 new cardinals, almost 50 percent of the College of Cardinals and reaching the canonical limit of 70 cardinals. In the 1946 consistory, Pius XII, while maintaining the maximum size of the College of Cardinals at 70, named cardinals from China, India, the Middle East and increased the number of Cardinals from the Americas, proportionally lessening the Italian influence.\n\nIn his second consistory on 12 January 1953, it was expected that his closest co-workers, Msgrs. Domenico Tardini and Giovanni Montini would be elevated and Pius XII informed the assembled cardinals that both of them were originally on the top of his list, but they had turned down the offer, and were rewarded instead with other promotions. Both Montini and Tardini would become Cardinals shortly after Pius' death; Montini later became Pope Paul VI. The two consistories of 1946 and 1953 brought an end to over five hundred years of Italians constituting a majority of the College of Cardinals.\n\nWith few exceptions, Italian prelates accepted the changes positively; there was no protest movement or open opposition to the internationalization efforts.\n\nIn his encyclical \"Mediator Dei\", Pius XII links liturgy with the last will of Jesus Christ.\nThe Church has, therefore, according to Pius XII, a common aim with Christ himself, teaching all men the truth, and offering to God a pleasing and acceptable sacrifice. This way, the Church re-establishes the unity between the Creator and his creatures. The sacrifice of the altar, being Christ's own actions, conveys and dispenses divine grace from Christ to the members of the Mystical Body.\n\nBishop Carlos Duarte Costa, a long-time critic of Pius XII's policies during World War II and an opponent of clerical celibacy and the use of Latin as language of the liturgy, was excommunicated by Pius XII on 2 July 1945.\n\nThe numerous reforms of Pius XII show two characteristics: renewal and rediscovery of old liturgical traditions, such as the reintroduction of the Easter Vigil, and a more structured atmosphere within the Church buildings.\n\nDecentralized authority and increased independence of the Uniate Churches were aimed at in the Canon Law/Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC) reform. In its new constitutions, Eastern Patriarchs were made almost independent from Rome (CIC Orientalis, 1957) Eastern marriage law (CIC Orientalis, 1949), civil law (CIC Orientalis, 1950), laws governing religious associations (CIC Orientalis, 1952) property law (CIC Orientalis, 1952) and other laws. These reforms and writings of Pius XII were intended to establish Eastern Orientals as equal parts of the mystical body of Christ, as explained in the encyclical \"Mystici corporis\".\n\nWith the Apostolic constitution \"Sedis Sapientiae\", Pius XII added social sciences, sociology, psychology and social psychology, to the pastoral training of future priests. Pius XII emphasised the need to systematically analyze the psychological condition of candidates to the priesthood to ensure that they are capable of a life of celibacy and service. Pius XII added one year to the theological formation of future priests. He included a \"pastoral year\", an introduction into the practice of parish work.\n\nPius XII wrote in \"Menti Nostrae\" that the call to constant interior reform and Christian heroism means to be above average, to be a living example of Christian virtue. The strict norms governing their lives are meant to make them models of Christian perfection for lay people. Bishops are encouraged to look at model saints like Boniface, and Pope Pius X. Priests were encouraged to be living examples of the love of Christ and his sacrifice.\n\nPius XII explained the Catholic faith in 41 encyclicals and almost 1000 messages and speeches during his long pontificate. Mediator Dei clarified membership and participation in the Church. The encyclical \"Divino afflante Spiritu\" opened the doors for biblical research. His magisterium was far larger and is difficult to summarize. In numerous speeches Catholic teaching is related to various aspects of life, education, medicine, politics, war and peace, the life of saints, Mary, the Mother of God, things eternal and contemporary. Theologically, Pius XII specified the nature of the teaching authority of the Church. He also gave a new freedom to engage in theological investigations.\n\nThe encyclical \"Divino afflante Spiritu\", published in 1943, emphasized the role of the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in Greek and Hebrew. Noting improvements in archaeology, the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the Latin Vulgate. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Hebrew history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate biblical studies for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in sermons and religious instruction.\n\nThis theological investigative freedom does not, however, extend to all aspects of theology. According to Pius, theologians, employed by the Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the Church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in empirical research, which the Church generously supports, but in matters of morality and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the Church, the Magisterium. \"The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ... in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church.\" The deposit of faith is authentically interpreted not to each of the faithful, not even to theologians, but only to the teaching authority of the Church.\n\nAs a young boy and in later life, Pacelli was an ardent follower of the Virgin Mary. He was consecrated as a bishop on 13 May 1917, the very first day of the apparitions of Our Lady of FÃ¡tima. He consecrated the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1942. His remains were to be buried in the crypt of Saint Peter's Basilica on the feast day of Our Lady of FÃ¡tima, 13 October 1958.\n\nOn 1 November 1950, Pius XII defined the dogma of the Assumption of Mary, namely that she \"having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.\" The dogma was preceded by the 1946 encyclical \"Deiparae Virginis Mariae\", which requested all Catholic bishops to express their opinion on a possible dogmatization. On 8 September 1953, the encyclical \"Fulgens corona\" announced a Marian year for 1954, the centennial of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception. In the encyclical Ad caeli reginam he promulgated the Queenship of Mary feast. \"Mystici corporis\" summarizes his mariology. On 15 August 1954, the Feast of the Assumption, he initiated the practice of leading the Angelus every Sunday before address to the crowd assembled at Castel Gandolfo.\n\nPius XII delivered numerous speeches to medical professionals and researchers. He addressed doctors, nurses, midwives, to detail all aspects of rights and dignity of patients, medical responsibilities, moral implications of psychological illnesses and the uses of psycho pharmaca. He also took on issues like the uses of medicine in terminally ill persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice. Pope Pius XII often reconsidered previously accepted truth, thus he was first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.\n\nPope Pius XII developed an extensive theology of the family, taking issue with family roles, sharing of household duties, education of children, conflict resolution, financial dilemmas, psychological problems, illness, taking care of older generations, unemployment, marital holiness and virtue, common prayer, religious discussions and more. He accepted the rhythm method as a moral form of family planning, although only in limited circumstances, within the context of family.\n\nTo Pius XII, science and religion were heavenly sisters, different manifestations of divine exactness, who could not possibly contradict each other over the long term. Regarding their relation, his advisor Professor Robert Leiber wrote: \"Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo\".\n\nIn 1950, Pius XII promulgated \"Humani generis\" which acknowledged that evolution might accurately describe the biological origins of human life, but at the same time criticized those who \"imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolutionÂ ... explains the origin of all things\". Catholics must believe that the human soul was created immediately by God. Since the soul is a spiritual substance it is not brought into being through transformation of matter, but directly by God, whence the special uniqueness of each person. Fifty years later, Pope John Paul II, stating that scientific evidence now seemed to favour the evolutionary theory, upheld the distinction of Pius XII regarding the human soul. \"Even if the human body originates from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is spontaneously created by God.\"\n\nIn an address given on September 14, 1952, Pope Pius XII said that the Church does not regard the execution of criminals as a violation by the State of the universal right to life:\n\nWhen it is a question of the execution of a condemned man, the State does not dispose of the individual's right to life. In this case it is reserved to the public power to deprive the condemned person of the enjoyment of life in expiation of his crime when, by his crime, he has already disposed himself of his right to live.\n\nThe Church regards criminal penalties as both \"medicinal\", preventing the criminal from re-offending, and \"vindictive\", providing retribution for the offense committed. Pius defended the authority of the State to carry out punishment, up to and including the death penalty.\n\nPius XII issued 41 encyclicals during his pontificateâmore than all his successors in the past 50 years taken togetherâalong with many other writings and speeches. The pontificate of Pius XII was the first in Vatican history that published papal speeches and addresses in vernacular language on a systematic basis. Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in Latin in \"Acta Apostolicae Sedis\" since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared occupation of the Vatican by the German Wehrmacht, not all documents exist today. In 1944, a number of papal documents were burned or \"walled in\", to avoid detection by the advancing German army. Insisting that all publications must be reviewed by him on a prior basis to avoid any misunderstanding, several speeches by Pius XII, who did not find sufficient time, were never published or appeared only once issued in the Vatican daily, \"Osservatore Romano\".\n\nSeveral encyclicals addressed the Eastern Catholic Churches. \"Orientalis Ecclesiae\" was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of Cyril of Alexandria, a saint common to Eastern Christianity and Latin Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the Churches. \"Orientales omnes Ecclesias\", issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the Ruthenian Church, threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. \"Sempiternus Rex\" was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to Miaphysite theology to return to the Catholic Church. \"Orientales Ecclesias\" was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued Stalinist persecution of the Church. Several Apostolic Letters were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God, was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in \"Fulgens corona\", as well as a papal letter to the people of Russia.\n\nPius XII made two substantial interventions on the media. His 1955 discourse \"The Ideal Movie\", originally given in two parts to members of the Italian cinema industry, offered a \"sophisticated analysis of the film industry and the role of cinema in modern society\". Compared to his predecessor's teaching, the encyclical \"Miranda Prorsus\" (1957) shows a \"high regard for the importance of cinema, television, and radio\".\n\nIn 1958, Pope Pius XII declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Catholics. The first medal of the Holy Face, produced by Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli, based on the image on the Shroud of Turin had been offered to Pius XII who approved the medal and the devotion based on it. The general devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus had been approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885 before the image on the Turin Shroud had been photographed.\n\nPope Pius XII canonized numerous people, including Pope Pius Xâ\"both were determined to stamp out, as far as possible, all traces of dangerous heterodoxy\"âand Maria Goretti. He beatified Pope Innocent XI. The first canonizations were two women, the founder of a female order, Mary Euphrasia Pelletier, and a young housekeeper said to have stigmata, Gemma Galgani. Pelletier had a reputation for opening new ways for Catholic charities, helping people in difficulties with the law, who had been neglected by the system and the Church. Galgani was a woman in her twenties whose virtue became model by her canonization.\n\nDuring World War II Pius saw his primary obligation as being to ensure the continuation the \"Church visible\" and its divine mission. Pius XII lobbied world leaders to prevent the outbreak of World War II and then expressed his dismay that war had come in his October 1939 \"Summi Pontificatus\" encyclical. He followed a strict public policy of Vatican neutrality for the duration of the conflict mirroring that of Pope Benedict XV during World War I, but preached against selfish nationalism and, through the use of diplomacy, sermons and radio broadcasts and the creation of the Vatican Information Service, worked to ameliorate the suffering of the victims of the war. He permitted local churches to assess and formulate responses to the Nazis, and instructed them to provide discreet aid to Jews. However, it is important to note that the Vatican endorsed Mussolini to regain some of its lost power and for money, The Vatican also was the first to sign a treaty with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party and help Nazis escape after the war.\n\nIn 1939, Pius XII turned the Vatican into a centre of aid which he organized from various parts of the world. At the request of the Pope, an information office for prisoners of war and refugees operated in the Vatican under Giovanni Battista Montini, which in the years of its existence from 1939 until 1947 received almost 10Â million (9,891,497) information requests and produced over 11Â million (11,293,511) answers about missing persons.\n\nMcGoldrick (2012) concludes that during the war:\nPius XII had genuine affection for Germany, though not the criminal element into whose hands it had fallen; he feared Bolshevism, an ideology dedicated to the annihilation of the church of which he was head, but his sympathies lay with the Allies and the democracies, especially the United States, into whose war economy he had transferred and invested the Vatican's considerable assets.\n\n\"Summi Pontificatus\" was the first papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII, in October 1939 and established some of the themes of his pontificate. During the drafting of the letter, the Second World War commenced with the German/Soviet invasion of Catholic Polandâthe \"dread tempest of war is already raging despite all Our efforts to avert it\". The papal letter denounced antisemitism, war, totalitarianism, the attack on Poland and the Nazi persecution of the Church.\n\nPius XII reiterated Church teaching on the \"principle of equality\"âwith specific reference to Jews: \"there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision\". The forgetting of solidarity \"imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men\" was called \"pernicious error\". Catholics everywhere were called upon to offer \"compassion and help\" to the victims of the war. The Pope declared determination to work to hasten the return of peace and trust in prayers for justice, love and mercy, to prevail against the scourge of war. The letter also decried the deaths of noncombatants.\n\nFollowing themes addressed in Non abbiamo bisogno (1931); Mit brennender Sorge (1937) and Divini redemptoris (1937), Pius wrote against \"anti-Christian movements\" and needing to bring back to the Church those who were following \"a false standardÂ ... misled by error, passion, temptation and prejudice, [who] have strayed away from faith in the true God\". Pius wrote of \"Christians unfortunately more in name than in fact\" having shown \"cowardice\" in the face of persecution by these creeds, and endorsed resistance:\n\nPius wrote of a persecuted Church and a time requiring \"charity\" for victims who had a \"right\" to compassion. Against the invasion of Poland and killing of civilians he wrote:\n\nWith Italy not yet an ally of Hitler in the war, Italians were called upon to remain faithful to the Church. Pius avoided explicit denunciations of Hitlerism or Stalinism, establishing the \"impartial\" public tone which would become controversial in later assessment of his pontificate: \"A full statement of the doctrinal stand to be taken in face of the errors of today, if necessary, can be put off to another time unless there is disturbance by calamitous external events; for the moment We limit Ourselves to some fundamental observations.\"\n\nIn \"Summi Pontificatus\", Pius expressed dismay at the killing of non-combatants in the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland and expressed hope for the \"resurrection\" of that country. The Nazis and Soviets commenced a persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland. In April 1940, the Vatican advised the US government that its efforts to provide humanitarian aid had been blocked by the Germans and that the Holy See had been forced to seek indirect channels through which to direct its aid. Michael Phayer, a critic of Pius XII, assesses his policy as having been to \"refuse to censure\" the \"German\" invasion and annexation of Poland. This, Phayer wrote, was regarded as a \"betrayal\" by many Polish Catholics and clergy, who saw his appointment of Hilarius Breitinger as the apostolic administrator for the Wartheland in May 1942, a \"implicit recognition\" of the breakup of Poland; the opinions of the \"Volksdeutsche\", mostly German Catholic minorities living in occupied Poland, were more mixed. Phayer argues that Pius XIIâboth before and during his papacyâconsistently \"deferred to Germany at the expense of Poland\", and saw Germanyânot Polandâas critical to \"rebuilding a large Catholic presence in Central Europe\". In May 1942, Kazimierz PapÃ©e, Polish ambassador to the Vatican, complained that Pius had failed to condemn the recent wave of atrocities in Poland; when Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione replied that the Vatican could not document individual atrocities, PapÃ©e declared, \"when something becomes notorious, proof is not required\". Although Pius XII received frequent reports about atrocities committed by and/or against Catholics, his knowledge was incomplete; for example, he wept after the war on learning that Cardinal Hlond had banned German liturgical services in Poland.\n\nThere was a well-known case of Jewish Rabbis who, seeking support against the Nazi persecution of Polish Jews in the General Government (Nazi-occupied Polish zone), complained to the representatives of the Catholic Church. The Church's attempted intervention caused the Nazis to retaliate by arresting rabbis and deporting them to the death camp. Subsequently, the Catholic Church in Poland abandoned direct intervention, instead focusing on organizing underground aid, with huge international support orchestrated by Pope Pius XII and his Holy See. The Pope was informed about Nazi atrocities committed in Poland by both officials of the Polish Church and the Polish Underground. Those intelligence materials were used by Pius XII on March 11, 1940 during a formal audience with Joachim von Ribbentrop (Hitler's foreign affairs adviser) when Pope was \"listing the date, place, and precise details of each crime\" as described by Joseph L. Lichten after others.\n\nWith Poland overrun, but France and the Low Countries yet to be attacked, Pius continued to hope for a negotiated peace to prevent the spread of the conflict. The similarly minded US President Franklin D. Roosevelt re-established American diplomatic relations with the Vatican after a seventy-year hiatus and dispatched Myron C. Taylor as his personal representative. Pius warmly welcomed Roosevelt's envoy and peace initiative, calling it \"an exemplary act of fraternal and hearty solidarity... in defence against the chilling breath of aggressive and deadly godless anti-Christian tendencies\". American correspondence spoke of \"parallel endeavours for peace and the alleviation of suffering\". Despite the early collapse of peace hopes, the Taylor mission continued at the Vatican.\nAccording to Hitler biographer John Toland, following the November 1939 assassination attempt by Johann Georg Elser, Hitler said Pius would have wanted the plot to succeed: \"he's no friend of mine\". In the spring of 1940, a group of German generals seeking to overthrow Hitler and make peace with the British approached Pope Pius XII, who acted as an interlocutor between the British and the abortive plot. According to Toland, Munich lawyer, Joseph Muller, made a clandestine trip to Rome in October 1939, met with Pius XII and found him willing to act as intermediary. The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Franz Halder and Walther von Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.\n\nPius warned the Allies of the planned German invasion of the Low Countries in 1940. In Rome in 1942, US envoy Myron C. Taylor, thanked the Holy See for the \"forthright and heroic expressions of indignation made by Pope Pius XII when Germany invaded the Low countries\". After Germany invaded the Low Countries during 1940, Pius XII sent expressions of sympathy to the Queen of the Netherlands, the King of Belgium, and the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. When Mussolini learned of the warnings and the telegrams of sympathy, he took them as a personal affront and had his ambassador to the Vatican file an official protest, charging that Pius XII had taken sides against Italy's ally Germany. Mussolini's foreign minister claimed that Pius XII was \"ready to let himself be deported to a concentration camp, rather than do anything against his conscience\".\n\nWhen in 1940, the Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop led the only senior Nazi delegation permitted an audience with Pius XII and asked why the Pope had sided with the Allies, Pius replied with a list of recent Nazi atrocities and religious persecutions committed against Christians and Jews, in Germany, and in Poland, leading the New York Times to headline its report \"Jews Rights Defended\" and write of \"burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution\". During the meeting, Ribbentrop suggested an overall settlement between the Vatican and the Reich government in exchange for Pius XII instructing the German bishops to refrain from political criticism of the German government, but no agreement was reached.\n\nAt a special mass at St Peters for the victims of the war, held in November 1940, soon after the commencement of the London Blitz bombing by the Luftwaffe, Pius preached in his homily: \"may the whirlwinds, that in the light of day or the dark of night, scatter terror, fire, destruction, and slaughter on helpless folk cease. May justice and charity on one side and on the other be in perfect balance, so that all injustice be repaired, the reign of right restored\". Later he appealed to the Allies to spare Rome from aerial bombing, and visited wounded victims of the Allied bombing of 19 July 1943.\n\nUnsuccessfully, Pius attempted to dissuade the Italian Dictator Benito Mussolini from joining Hitler in the war. In April 1941, Pius XII granted a private audience to Ante PaveliÄ, the leader of the newly proclaimed Croatian state (rather than the diplomatic audience PaveliÄ had wanted). Pius was criticised for his reception of PaveliÄ: an unattributed British Foreign Office memo on the subject described Pius as \"the greatest moral coward of our age\". The Vatican did not officially recognise PaveliÄ's regime. Pius XII did not publicly condemn the expulsions and forced conversions to Catholicism perpetrated on Serbs by PaveliÄ; however, the Holy See did expressly repudiate the forced conversions in a memorandum dated 25 January 1942, from the Vatican Secretariat of State to the Yugoslavian Legation. The pope was well-informed of Catholic clergy involvement with the UstaÅ¡e regime, even possessing a list of clergymembers who had \"joined in the slaughter\", but decided against condemning the regime or taking action against the clergy involved, fearing that it would lead to schism in the Croatian church or undermine the formation of a future Croatian state. Pius XII elevated Aloysius Stepinacâa Croatian archbishop convicted of collaborating with the UstaÅ¡e by the newly established Yugoslav Communist regimeâto the cardinalate. Phayer agrees that Stepinac's was a \"show trial\", but states \"the charge that he [Pius XII] supported the UstaÅ¡a regime was, of course, true, as everyone knew\", and that \"if Stepinac had responded to the charges against him, his defense would have inevitably unraveled, exposing the Vatican's support of the genocidal PaveliÄ.\" Throughout 1942, the Yugoslav government in exile sent letters of protest to Pius XII requesting him to use all possible means to stop the massacres against the Serbs in the NDH, however Pius XII did nothing. \n\nIn 1941, Pius XII interpreted \"Divini Redemptoris\", an encyclical of Pope Pius XI, which forbade Catholics to help communists, as not applying to military assistance to the Soviet Union. This interpretation assuaged American Catholics who had previously opposed Lend-Lease arrangements with the Soviet Union.\n\nIn March 1942, Pius XII established diplomatic relations with the Japanese Empire and received ambassador Ken Harada, who remained in that position until the end of the war.\n\nIn June 1942, diplomatic relations were established with the Nationalist government of China. This step was envisaged earlier, but delayed due to Japanese pressure to establish relations with the pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei government. The first Chinese Minister to the Vatican, Hsieh Shou-kang, was only able to arrive at the Vatican in January 1943, due to difficulties of travel resulting from the war. He remained in that position until late 1946.\n\nThe Pope employed the new technology of radio and a series of Christmas messages to preach against selfish nationalism and the evils of modern warfare and offer sympathy to the victims of the war. Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address via Vatican Radio voiced concern at human rights abuses and the murder of innocents based on race. The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society; at the very end of the speech, Pius XII mentioned \"the hundreds of thousands of persons who, without any fault on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline\". According to Rittner, the speech remains a \"lightning rod\" in debates about Pius XII. The Nazis themselves responded to the speech by stating that it was \"one long attack on everything we stand for.Â ... He is clearly speaking on behalf of the Jews.Â ... He is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews, and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals.\" The New York Times wrote that \"The voice of Pius XII is a lonely voice in the silence and darkness enveloping Europe this Christmas.Â ... In calling for a 'real new order' based on 'liberty, justice and love',Â ... the pope put himself squarely against Hitlerism.\" Historian Michael Phayer claims, however, that \"it is still not clear \"whose\" genocide or \"which\" genocide he was referring to\". Speaking on the 50th anniversary of Pius's death in 2008, the German Pope Benedict XVI recalled that the Pope's voice had been \"broken by emotion\" as he \"deplored the situation\" with a \"clear reference to the deportation and extermination of the Jews\".\n\nSeveral authors have alleged a plot to kidnap Pius XII by the Nazis during their occupation of Rome in 1943 (Vatican City itself was not occupied); British historian Owen Chadwick and the Jesuit ADSS editor Rev. Robert Graham each concluded such claims were an invention of British wartime propagandists. However, in 2007, subsequent to those accounts, Dan Kurzman published a work which he maintains establishes that the plot was a fact.\n\nAs the war was approaching its end in 1945, Pius advocated a lenient policy by the Allied leaders in an effort to prevent what he perceived to be the mistakes made at the end of World War I. In August 1944, he met British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who was visiting Rome. At their meeting, the Pope acknowledged the justice of punishing war criminals, but expressed a hope that the people of Italy would not be punished, preferring that they be made \"full allies\" in the remaining war effort.\n\nDuring the Second World War, after Nazi Germany commenced its mass executions of Jews in occupied Soviet territory, Pius XII employed diplomacy to aid victims of the Holocaust and directed the Church to provide discreet aid to Jews. Upon his death in 1958, among many Jewish tributes, the Chief Rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff, said: \"Jews will always remember what the Catholic Church did for them by order of the Pope during the Second World War. When the war was raging, Pius spoke out very often to condemn the false race theory.\" This is disputed by commentator John Cornwell, who in his book, \"Hitler's Pope\", argues that the pope was weak and vacillating in his approach to Nazism. Cornwell asserts that the pope did little to challenge the progressing holocaust of the Jews out of fear of provoking the Nazis into invading Vatican City.\n\nIn his 1939 \"Summi Pontificatus\" first papal encyclical, Pius reiterated Catholic teaching against racial persecution and antisemitism and affirmed the ethical principles of the \"Revelation on Sinai\". At Christmas 1942, once evidence of mass executions of Jews had emerged, Pius XII voiced concern at the murder of \"hundreds of thousands\" of \"faultless\" people because of their \"nationality or race\" and intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries. Upon his death in 1958, Pius was praised emphatically by the Israeli Foreign Minister, and other world leaders. But his insistence on Vatican neutrality and avoidance of naming the Nazis as the evildoers of the conflict became the foundation for contemporary and later criticisms from some quarters. His strongest public condemnation of genocide was considered inadequate by the Allied Powers, while the Nazis viewed him as an Allied sympathizer who had dishonored his policy of Vatican neutrality. Hitler biographer John Toland, while scathing of Pius's cautious public comments in relation to the mistreatment of Jews, concluded that the Allies' own record of action against the Holocaust was \"shameful\", while \"The Church, under the Pope's guidance, had already saved the lives of more Jews than all other churches, religious institutions and rescue organizations combined\".\n\nIn 1939, the newly elected Pope Pius XII appointed several prominent Jewish scholars to posts at the Vatican after they had been dismissed from Italian universities under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini's racial laws. In 1939, the Pope employed a Jewish cartographer, Roberto Almagia, to work on old maps in the Vatican library. Almagia had been at the University of Rome since 1915 but was dismissed after Benito Mussolini's antisemitic legislation of 1938. The Pope's appointment of two Jews to the Vatican Academy of Science as well as the hiring of Almagia were reported by \"The New York Times\" in the editions of 11 November 1939 and 10 January 1940.\n\nPius later engineered an agreementâformally approved on 23 June 1939âwith Brazilian President GetÃºlio Vargas to issue 3,000 visas to \"non-Aryan Catholics\". However, over the next 18 months Brazil's Conselho de ImigraÃ§Ã£o e ColonizaÃ§Ã£o (CIC) continued to tighten the restrictions on their issuance, including requiring a baptismal certificate dated before 1933, a substantial monetary transfer to the Banco do Brasil, and approval by the Brazilian Propaganda Office in Berlin. The program was cancelled 14 months later, after fewer than 1,000 visas had been issued, amid suspicions of \"improper conduct\" (i.e., continuing to practice Judaism) among those who had received visas.\n\nIn April 1939, after the submission of Charles Maurras and the intervention of the Carmel of Lisieux, Pius XII ended his predecessor's ban on Action FranÃ§aise, a virulently antisemitic organization.\n\nFollowing the German/Soviet invasion of Poland, the Pope's first encyclical, \"Summi Pontificatus\" reiterated Catholic teaching against racial persecution and rejected antisemitism, quoting scripture singling out the \"principle of equality\"âwith specific reference to Jews: \"there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision\" and direct affirmation of the Jewish \"Revelation on Sinai\". The forgetting of solidarity \"imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men\" was called \"pernicious error\". Catholics everywhere were called upon to offer \"compassion and help\" to the victims of the war. The Pope declared determination to work to hasten the return of peace and trust in prayers for justice, love and mercy, to prevail against the scourge of war. The letter also decried the deaths of noncombatants.\n\nCardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione received a request from Chief Rabbi of Palestine Isaac Herzog in the spring of 1940 to intercede on behalf of Lithuanian Jews about to be deported to Germany. Pius called Ribbentrop on 11 March, repeatedly protesting against the treatment of Jews. In 1940, Pius asked members of the clergy, on Vatican letterhead, to do whatever they could on behalf of interned Jews.\n\nIn 1941, Cardinal Theodor Innitzer of Vienna informed Pius of Jewish deportations in Vienna. Later that year, when asked by French Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain if the Vatican objected to antisemitic laws, Pius responded that the church condemned antisemitism, but would not comment on specific rules. Similarly, when Philippe PÃ©tain's regime adopted the \"Jewish statutes\", the Vichy ambassador to the Vatican, LÃ©on BÃ©rard (a French politician), was told that the legislation did not conflict with Catholic teachings. Valerio Valeri, the nuncio to France was \"embarrassed\" when he learned of this publicly from PÃ©tain and personally checked the information with Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione who confirmed the Vatican's position. In June 1942, Pius XII personally protested against the mass deportations of Jews from France, ordering the papal nuncio to protest to PÃ©tain against \"the inhuman arrests and deportations of Jews\". In September 1941, Pius XII objected to a Slovak Jewish Code, which, unlike the earlier Vichy codes, prohibited intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews. In October 1941, Harold Tittmann, a US delegate to the Vatican, asked the pope to condemn the atrocities against Jews; Pius replied that the Vatican wished to remain \"neutral,\" reiterating the neutrality policy which Pius invoked as early as September 1940.\n\nIn 1942, the Slovak chargÃ© d'affaires told Pius that Slovak Jews were being sent to concentration camps. On 11 March 1942, several days before the first transport was due to leave, the chargÃ© d'affaires in Bratislava reported to the Vatican: \"I have been assured that this atrocious plan is the handwork of ... Prime Minister (Tuka), who confirmed the plan ... he dared to tell meâhe who makes such a show of his Catholicismâthat he saw nothing inhuman or un-Christian in it ... the deportation of 80,000 persons to Poland, is equivalent to condemning a great number of them to certain death.\" The Vatican protested to the Slovak government that it \"deplore(s) these... measures which gravely hurt the natural human rights of persons, merely because of their race.\"\n\nOn 18 September 1942, Pius XII received a letter from Monsignor Montini (future Pope Paul VI), saying, \"the massacres of the Jews reach frightening proportions and forms.\" Later that month, Myron Taylor, U.S. representative to the Vatican, warned Pius that the Vatican's \"moral prestige\" was being injured by silence on European atrocities, a warning which was echoed simultaneously by representatives from the United Kingdom, Brazil, Uruguay, Belgium, and Poland. Myron C. Taylor passed a US Government memorandum to Pius on 26 September 1942, outlining intelligence received from the Jewish Agency for Palestine which said that Jews from across the Nazi Empire were being systematically \"butchered\". Taylor asked if the Vatican might have any information which might \"tend to confirm the reports\", and if so, what the Pope might be able to do to influence public opinion against the \"barbarities\". Cardinal Maglione handed Harold Tittmann a response to the letter on 10 October. The note thanked Washington for passing on the intelligence, and confirmed that reports of severe measures against the Jews had reached the Vatican from other sources, though it had not been possible to \"verify their accuracy\". Nevertheless, \"every opportunity is being taken by the Holy See, however, to mitigate the suffering of these unfortunate people\". In December 1942, when Tittmann asked Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione if Pius would issue a proclamation similar to the Allied declaration \"German Policy of Extermination of the Jewish Race\", Maglione replied that the Vatican was \"unable to denounce publicly particular atrocities\". Pius XII directly explained to Tittman that he could not name the Nazis without at the same time mentioning the Bolsheviks.\n\nFollowing the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland, Pius XII's \"Summi Pontificatus\" called for the sympathy of the whole world towards Poland, where \"the blood of countless human beings, even noncombatants\" was being spilled. Pius never publicly condemned the Nazi massacre of 1,800,000â1,900,000 Poles, overwhelmingly Catholic (including 2,935 members of the Catholic clergy), In late 1942, Pius XII advised German and Hungarian bishops to speak out against the massacres on the Eastern Front. In his 1942 Christmas Eve message, he expressed concern for \"those hundreds of thousands, who ... sometimes only by reason of their nationality or race, are marked down for death or progressive extinction. On 7 April 1943, Msgr. Tardini, one of Pius XII's closest advisors, advised Pius XII that it would be politically advantageous after the war to take steps to help Slovak Jews.\n\nIn January 1943, Pius XII declined to denounce publicly the Nazi discrimination against the Jews, following requests to do so from WÅadysÅaw Raczkiewicz, president of the Polish government-in-exile, and Bishop Konrad von Preysing of Berlin. According to Toland, in June 1943, Pius XII addressed the issue of mistreatment of Jews at a conference of the Sacred College of Cardinals and said: \"Every word We address to the competent authority on this subject, and all Our public utterances have to be carefully weighed and measured by Us in the interests of the victims themselves, lest, contrary to Our intentions, We make their situation worse and harder to bear\".\n\nOn 26 September 1943, following the German occupation of northern Italy, Nazi officials gave Jewish leaders in Rome 36 hours to produce of gold (or the equivalent) threatening to take 300 hostages. Then Chief Rabbi of Rome Israel Zolli recounts in his memoir that he was selected to go to the Vatican and seek help. The Vatican offered to loan 15 kilos, but the offer proved unnecessary when the Jews received an extension. Soon afterward, when deportations from Italy were imminent, 477 Jews were hidden in the Vatican itself and another 4,238 were protected in Roman monasteries and convents. Eighty percent of Roman Jews were saved from deportation. Phayer argues that the German diplomats in Rome were the \"initiators of the effort to save the city's Jews\", but holds that Pius XII \"cooperated in this attempt at rescue\", while agreeing with Zuccotti that the pope \"did not give orders\" for any Catholic institution to hide Jews.\n\nOn 30 April 1943, Pius XII wrote to Bishop Graf von Preysing of Berlin to say: \"We give to the pastors who are working on the local level the duty of determining if and to what degree the danger of reprisals and of various forms of oppression occasioned by episcopal declarationsÂ ... \"ad maiora mala vitanda\" (to avoid worse)Â ... seem to advise caution. Here lies one of the reasons, why We impose self-restraint on Ourselves in our speeches; the experience, that we made in 1942 with papal addresses, which We authorized to be forwarded to the Believers, justifies our opinion, as far as We see.Â ... The Holy See has done whatever was in its power, with charitable, financial and moral assistance. To say nothing of the substantial sums which we spent in American money for the fares of immigrants.\"\n\nOn 28 October 1943, Ernst von WeizsÃ¤cker, the German Ambassador to the Vatican, telegraphed Berlin that \"the Pope has not yet let himself be persuaded to make an official condemnation of the deportation of the Roman Jews.Â ... Since it is currently thought that the Germans will take no further steps against the Jews in Rome, the question of our relations with the Vatican may be considered closed.\"\n\nIn March 1944, through the papal nuncio in Budapest, Angelo Rotta, the pope urged the Hungarian government to moderate its treatment of the Jews. The pope ordered Rotta and other papal legates to hide and shelter Jews. These protests, along with others from the King of Sweden, the International Red Cross, the United States, and Britain led to the cessation of deportations on 8 July 1944. Also in 1944, Pius appealed to 13 Latin American governments to accept \"emergency passports\", although it also took the intervention of the U.S. State Department for those countries to honor the documents. The Kaltenbrunner Report to Hitler, dated 29 November 1944, against the backdrop of the 20 July 1944 Plot to assassinate Hitler, states that the Pope was somehow a conspirator, specifically naming Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII), as being a party in the attempt.\n\nIn 2005, \"Corriere della Sera\" published a document dated 20 November 1946 on the subject of Jewish children baptized in war-time France. The document ordered that baptized children, if orphaned, should be kept in Catholic custody and stated that the decision \"has been approved by the Holy Father\". Nuncio Angelo Roncalli (who became Pope John XXIII, and was recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations) ignored this directive. Abe Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who had himself been baptized as a child and had undergone a custody battle afterwards, called for an immediate freeze on Pius's beatification process until the relevant Vatican Secret Archives and baptismal records were opened. Two Italian scholars, Matteo Luigi Napolitano and Andrea Tornielli, confirmed that the memorandum was genuine although the reporting by the \"Corriere della Sera\" was misleading, as the document had originated in the French Catholic Church archives rather than the Vatican archives and strictly concerned itself with children without living blood relatives who were supposed to be handed over to Jewish organizations.\n\nAfter World War II, Pope Pius XII focused on material aid to war-torn Europe, an internal internationalization of the Catholic Church, and the development of its worldwide diplomatic relations. His encyclicals, \"Evangelii praecones\" and \"Fidei donum\", issued on 2 June 1951 and 21 April 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture. Though his language retained old conceptionsÂ â Africa, for example, merited special attention since the church there worked 'to forward her work among the heathen multitudes' â in 1956 he expressed solidarity with the 'non-Europeans who aspire to full political independence.' Continuing the line of his predecessors, Pius XII supported the establishment of local administration in Church affairs: in 1950, the hierarchy of Western Africa became independent; in 1951, Southern Africa; and in 1953, British East Africa. Finland, Burma and French Africa became independent dioceses in 1955.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, Pius XII elevated a number of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946, among them the German Bishops Joseph Frings of Cologne, August von Galen of MÃ¼nster and Konrad von Preysing of Berlin. From elsewhere in the liberated Nazi Empire Pius selected other resistors: Dutch Archbishop Johannes de Jong; Hungarian Bishop JÃ³zsef Mindszenty; Polish Archbishop Adam Stefan Sapieha; and French Archbishop Jules-GÃ©raud SaliÃ¨ge. In 1946 and 1953, respectively, he named as cardinals Thomas Tien of China and Valerian Gracias of IndiaÂ â the first indigenous Catholics of their respective nations to sit in the College of Cardinals. Italian Papal diplomat Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) and Polish Archbishop Stefan WyszyÅski were others among those elevated in 1953.\n\nA German contingent dominated his inner circle at this periodÂ â the German Jesuits Robert Leiber, Wilhelm Hentrich and Ivo Zeiger. His personal confessor Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit and Mother Pascalina Lehnert and the other German speaking sisters of the papal household added to this element. The American bishop Aloisius Muench wrote in November 1948 that Pius XII was 'more interested in affairs of the Church in Germany than in any other part of the Church' and resolved to make the postwar German crisis a top priority â 'its refugee crisis, poverty, hunger and disease, the fate of prisoners-of-war and accused war criminals, the disruption to the internal organization and communal life of German Catholicism, and Germany's uncertain political future.'\n\nHe was concerned too about the potential spread of Communism in Western Europe and the Americas. As he sought to secure resources from abroad to aid post-war recovery, believing deprivation fuelled political agitation, so he also sought to influence Italian politics. In January 1948, Luigi Gedda, of Italy's Catholic Action movement, was called to the Vatican as the campaign for the first parliament of Italy's post-fascist republic was underway. The Communists and Socialists seemed headed for victory and Pius XII wanted Catholic Action, an organization of Catholic laity, to mobilise the Catholic vote against parties of the Left. In July 1949 he approved a controversial move by the Holy Office to threaten with excommunication anyone with known Communist affiliations. A group of Jesuits around the journal \"La Civilta Cattolica\", active in Vatican circles, further spread alarm that \"fifth columns\" of Soviet Communism were active in Western Europe poised to exploit popular discontent to aid Soviet expansionism. He was responsible for giving the appellative title, The Catholic University of the Philippines to the then Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas.\n\nPius XII was rather distrustful of Alcide de Gasperi and Italy's Christian Democrats, considering the party indecisive and fractiousÂ â reformist currents within it particularly, which tended to the moderate LeftÂ â represented by the Sicilian priest Luigi Sturzo for exampleÂ â he considered too accommodating to the Left. On the eve of the 1952 local elections in Rome, in which again the Communist and Socialist parties threatened to win out, he used informal connections to make his views known. Pius XII stated that the war against communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an allianceÂ â an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the Italian Social Movement. Adopting a domino theory he warned that, if \"the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe'. de Gasperi rejected the idea as politically dangerous to the long term fortunes of a centrist Catholic party.\n\nThe last years of the pontificate of Pius XII began in late 1954 with a long illness, during which he considered abdication. Afterwards, changes in his work habit became noticeable. The Pope avoided long ceremonies, canonizations and consistories and displayed hesitancy in personnel matters. He found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees such as his physician, Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi, who after numerous indiscretions was excluded from Papal service for the last years, but, keeping his title, was able to enter the papal apartments to make photos of the dying Pope, which he sold to French magazines. Pius underwent three courses of cellular rejuvenation treatment administered by Paul Niehans, the most important in 1954 when Pacelli was gravely ill. Side-effects of the treatment included hallucinations, from which the Pope suffered in his last years. \"These years were also plagued by horrific nightmares. Pacelli's blood-curdling screams could be heard throughout the papal apartments.\"\n\nPius XII often elevated young priests as bishops, such as Julius DÃ¶pfner (35 years) and Karol Wojtyla (later Pope John Paul II, 38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. He took a firm stand against pastoral experiments, such as \"worker-priests\", who worked full-time in factories and joined political parties and unions. He continued to defend the theological tradition of Thomism as worthy of continued reform, and as superior to modern trends such as phenomenology or existentialism.\n\nPope Pius XII had been seriously ill with gastritis intermittently since 1953, when he had offered to resign the papacy. He also underwent cellular rejuvenation treatment, whose side-effects caused hallucinations and nightmares. With frequent absences from work, he had come to depend heavily on a few close colleagues, especially his aide Domenico Tardini, his speechwriter Robert Leiber, and his long-serving housekeeper Pascalina Lehnert. Pope Pius XII still addressed lay people and groups about a wide range of topics. Sometimes he answered specific moral questions, which were addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of Church teachings. Robert Leiber helped him occasionally with his speeches and publications. Cardinal Augustine Bea SJ was his personal confessor. Sister Pasqualina was for forty years his \"housekeeper, muse and lifelong companion\".\n\nOn 5 October 1958, at his summer residence Castel Gandolfo, the Pope suffered painful complications, but tried to continue his duties between intervals of rest. Next morning, the doctors came to pump his stomach, apparently with success, but he lost consciousness and was given the last rites. Presently he awoke, and the nuns opened the door to the Papal Chapel so he could see and hear them praying the rosary. The next day, he appeared to improve and received visitors. When they opened the window in the evening, he looked out at the stars and said quietly \"Look, how beautiful, how great is our Lord.â On the last full day of his life, his temperature rose steadily and his breathing became difficult. At 3.52 a.m. on 9 October, he gave a smile, lowered his head and died. The cause of death was recorded as acute heart failure. Monsignor Domenico Tardini prayed the \"Magnificat Anima mea dominum\", the Virgin Mary's praise of the Lord, in Latin. His doctor Gaspanini said afterwards: \"The Holy Father did not die because of any specific illness. He was completely exhausted. He was overworked beyond limit. His heart was healthy, his lungs were good. He could have lived another 20 years, had he spared himself.\"\n\nPius XII's physician, Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi, reported that the pontiff's body was embalmed in the room where he died using a novel process invented by Oreste Nuzzi.\n\nPope Pius XII did not want the vital organs removed from his body, demanding instead that it be kept in the same condition \"in which God created it\". According to Galeazzi-Lisi, this was the reason why he and Nuzzi, an embalmer from Naples, used an atypical approach with the embalming procedure. In a controversial press conference, Galeazzi-Lisi described in great detail the embalming of the body of the late pontiff. He claimed to have used the same system of oils and resins with which the body of Jesus Christ was preserved.\n\nGaleazzi-Lisi asserted that the new process would \"preserve the body indefinitely in its natural state\". However, whatever chance the new embalming process had of efficaciously preserving the body was obliterated by intense heat in Castel Gandolfo during the embalming process. As a result, the body decomposed rapidly and the viewing of the faithful had to be terminated abruptly.\n\nGaleazzi-Lisi reported that heat in the halls, where the body of the late Pope lay in state, caused chemical reactions which required it to be treated twice after the original preparation. Swiss Guards stationed around Pius XII's body were reported to have become ill during their vigil.\n\nHis funeral procession into Rome was the largest congregation of Romans as of that date. Romans mourned \"their\" pope, who was born in their own city, especially as a hero in the time of war. Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (later to be Pope John XXIII) wrote in his diary on 11 October 1958 that probably no Roman emperor had enjoyed such a triumph, which he viewed as a reflection of the spiritual majesty and religious dignity of the late Pius XII.\n\nThe late pope lay in state on a bier surrounded by four Swiss Guards, and was then placed in the coffin for burial. Pius XII was buried in the grottos beneath St. Peter's Basilica in a simple tomb in a small chapel.\n\nThe Testament of Pope Pius XII was published immediately after his death. Pope Pius XII's cause of canonization was opened on 18 November 1965 by Pope Paul VI during the final session of the Second Vatican Council. In May 2007, the congregation recommended that Pius XII should be declared Venerable. Pope Benedict XVI did so on 19 December 2009, simultaneously making the same declaration in regard to Pope John Paul II.\n\nFor Venerable status The Congregation for the Causes of Saints certifies the \"heroic virtues\" of the candidate. Making Pius XII Venerable met with various responses, most centred on the papal words and actions during World War II. Benedict's signature on the Decree of Heroic Virtue was regarded by some as a public relations blunder, though acceptance of Pius XII as a saviour of Europe's Jews is regarded as 'proof of fidelity to the Church, the \"pope\" and the Tradition' by neoconservative Catholic groups. On the other hand, Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean at the Simon Wiesenthal Center said, \"...there would be a great distortion of history\" if Pius XII were canonized. Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence, the head of Sydney's Great Synagogue, said: \"How can one venerate a man who ... seemed to give his passive permission to the Nazis as the Jews were prised from his doorstep in Rome?\" A counterpoint to such comments is the case of Israel Zolli, the Chief Rabbi in Rome from 1939 to 1945, who became a Catholic and took the name of Eugenio in honor of Pius XII.\n\nFather Peter Gumpel, the relator of the Pius XII's cause for canonization, claims that there are already several miracles attributable to Pius XII, including \"one quite extraordinary one\".\n\nOn 1 August 2013, an anonymous \"source who works for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints\" said Pope Francis is considering canonization without a miracle, \"us[ing] the formula of \"scientia certa\"\".\n\nPope Francis also announced his intention in January 2014 to open the Vatican Secret Archives to scholars so that an evaluation of the late pontiff's role in the war can be determined before canonization. This has been met with praise by the Jewish community. However, it was said that it could take up to a year to gather all the documents and then analyze them.\n\nOn 26 May 2014 on his way back from the Holy Land to Vatican City, Pope Francis stated that the late pope would not be beatified because the cause has stalled. The pope said that he checked the progress of the cause for the controversial pope and said that there were no miracles attributed to his intercession, which was the main reason that the cause had halted.\n\nFather Peter Gumpel stated, on a 12 January 2016 documentary on the late pope, that there was consultation of the Vatican Secret Archives which were carried out in secret; in short it means that there are no controversies surrounding the late pontiff that could impede the potential beatification. In that same documentary, the cause's vice-postulator Marc Lindeijer stated that several miracles attributed to the late pope are reported to the postulation every year but the individuals' related to the healings do not come forward to enact diocesan proceedings of investigation. Lindeijer explained that this was the reason that the cause has stalled in the past as none have come forward to assist the postulation in their investigations.\n\nReports from 2014 indicate a potential miracle from the United States attributed to the intercession of the late pope that was reported to the postulation. The miracle pertains to a male plagued with severe influenza and pneumonia that could have proven to be fatal; the individual was said to have been healed in full after a novena to Pius XII.\n\nDuring the war, \"Time\" magazine credited Pius XII and the Catholic Church for \"fighting totalitarianism more knowingly, devoutly and authoritatively, and for a longer time, than any other organised power\". During the war he was also praised editorially by \"The New York Times\" for opposing Nazi anti-Semitism and aggression. According to Paul O'Shea, \"The Nazis demonised the Pope as the agent of international Jewry; the Americans and British were continually frustrated because he would not condemn Nazi aggression; and the Russians accused him of being an agent of Fascism and the Nazis.\"\n\nOn 21 September 1945, the general secretary of the World Jewish Council, Leon Kubowitzky, presented an amount of money to the pope, \"in recognition of the work of the Holy See in rescuing Jews from Fascist and Nazi persecutions.\" After the war, in the autumn of 1945, Harry Greenstein from Baltimore, a close friend of Chief Rabbi Herzog of Jerusalem, told Pius XII how grateful Jews were for all he had done for them. \"My only regret\", the pope replied, \"is not to have been able to save a greater number of Jews.\"\n\nPius XII was also criticised during his lifetime. Leon Poliakov wrote in 1950 that Pius XII had been a tacit supporter of Vichy France's anti-Semitic laws, calling him \"less forthright\" than Pope Pius XI either out of \"Germanophilia\" or the hope that Hitler would defeat communist Russia.\n\nAfter Pius XII's death on 9 October 1958 many Jewish organisations and newspapers around the world paid tribute to his legacy. At the United Nations, Golda Meir, Israel's Foreign Minister, said, \"When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict.\" \"The Jewish Chronicle\" (London) stated on 10 October that \"Adherents of all creeds and parties will recall how Pius XII faced the responsibilities of his exalted office with courage and devotion. Before, during, and after the Second World War, he constantly preached the message of peace. Confronted by the monstrous cruelties of Nazism, Fascism and Communism, he repeatedly proclaimed the virtues of humanity and compassion\". In the Canadian Jewish Chronicle (17 October), Rabbi J. Stern stated that Pius XII \"made it possible for thousands of Jewish victims of Nazism and Fascism to be hidden away...\" In the 6 November edition of the Jewish Post in Winnipeg, William Zukerman, the former American Hebrew columnist, wrote that no other leader \"did more to help the Jews in their hour of greatest tragedy, during the Nazi occupation of Europe, than the late Pope\". Other prominent Jewish figures, such as Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett and Chief Rabbi Isaac Herzog expressed their public gratitude to Pius XII.\n\nSome early works echoed the favourable sentiments of the war period, including Polish historian Oskar Halecki's \"Pius XII: Eugenio Pacelli: Pope of peace\" (1954) and Nazareno Padellaro's \"Portrait of Pius XII\" (1949).\n\nPinchas Lapide, a Jewish theologian and Israeli diplomat to Milan in the 1960s, estimated controversially in \"Three Popes and the Jews\" that Pius \"was instrumental in saving at least 700,000 but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands.\" Some historians have questioned this often cited number, which Lapide reached by \"deducting all reasonable claims of rescue\" by non-Catholics from the total number of European Jews surviving the Holocaust. A Catholic scholar, Kevin Madigan, has interpreted this and other praise from prominent Jewish leaders, including Golda Meir, as less than sincere, an attempt to secure Vatican recognition of the State of Israel.\n\nIn 1963, Rolf Hochhuth's controversial drama \"Der Stellvertreter. Ein christliches Trauerspiel\" (\"The Deputy, a Christian tragedy\", released in English in 1964) portrayed Pope Pius XII as a hypocrite who remained silent about the Holocaust. The depiction is described as lacking \"credible substantiation\" by the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. Books such as Joseph Lichten's \"A Question of Judgment\" (1963), written in response to \"The Deputy\", defended Pius XII's actions during the war. Lichten labelled any criticism of the pope's actions during World War II as \"a stupefying paradox\" and said, \"no one who reads the record of Pius XII's actions on behalf of Jews can subscribe to Hochhuth's accusation.\" Critical scholarly works like Guenter Lewy's controversial \"The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany\" (1964) also followed the publication of \"The Deputy\". Lewy's conclusion was that \"the Pope and his advisersâinfluenced by the long tradition of moderate anti-Semitism so widely accepted in Vatican circlesâdid not view the plight of the Jews with a real sense of urgency and moral outrage. For this assertion no documentation is possible, but it is a conclusion difficult to avoid\". In 2002 the play was adapted into the film, \"Amen.\". An article on \"La CivilitÃ  Cattolica\" in March 2009 indicated that the accusations that Hochhuth's play made widely known originated not among Jews but in the Communist bloc. It was on Moscow Radio, on 2 June 1945, that the first accusation directly against Pius XII of refusing to speak out against the exterminations in Nazi concentration camps. It was also the first medium to call him \"Hitler's Pope\".\n\nThe former high-ranking Securitate General Ion Mihai Pacepa alleged in 2007 that Hochhuth's play and numerous publications attacking Pius XII as a Nazi sympathizer were fabrications that were part of a KGB and Eastern bloc Marxist secret services disinformation campaign, named Seat 12, to discredit the moral authority of the Church and Christianity in the west. Pacepa indicated that he was involved in contacting eastern bloc agents close the Vatican in order to fabricate the story to be used for the attack against the wartime pope.\n\nIn the aftermath of the controversy surrounding \"The Deputy\", in 1964, Pope Paul VI authorized Jesuit scholars to access the Vatican State Department Archives, which are normally not opened for seventy-five years. Original documents in French and Italian, \"Actes et documents du Saint SiÃ¨ge relatifs Ã  la Seconde Guerre Mondiale\", were published in eleven volumes between 1965 and 1981. The volumes were edited by Four Jesuits: Angelo Martini, Burkhart Schneider, Robert Graham and Pierre Blet. Blet also published a summary of the eleven volumes.\n\nIn 1999, British author John Cornwell's \"Hitler's Pope\" criticised Pius XII for his actions and inactions during the Holocaust. Cornwell argued that Pius XII subordinated opposition to the Nazis to his goal of increasing and centralising the power of the Papacy. Further, Cornwell accused Pius XII of anti-Semitism. The EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica described Cornwell's depiction of Pius XII as anti-Semitic as lacking \"credible substantiation\". Kenneth L. Woodward stated in his review in \"Newsweek\" that \"errors of fact and ignorance of context appear on almost every page.\" Paul O'Shea summarized the work by saying it was \"disappointing because of its many inaccuracies, selective use of sources, and claims that do not bear any scrutiny. However, [Cornwell] has rendered a service by insisting Pacelli be re-examined thoroughly and placed firmly within the context of his times\". Five years after the publication of \"Hitler's Pope\", Cornwell stated: \"I would now argue, in the light of the debates and evidence following \"Hitler's Pope\", that Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany\".\n\nCornwell's work was the first to have access to testimonies from Pius XII's beatification process as well as to many documents from Pacelli's nunciature which had just been opened under the 75-year rule by the Vatican State Secretary archives. Susan Zuccotti's \"\" (2000) and Michael Phayer's \"The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930â1965\" (2000) and \"Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War\" (2008) provided further critical, though more scholarly analysis of Pius's legacy. Daniel Goldhagen's \"A Moral Reckoning\" and David Kerzer's \"The Pope Against the Jews\" denounced Pius, while Ralph McInery and JosÃ© Sanchez wrote more nuanced critical assessments of Pius XII's pontificate.\n\nIn specific riposte to Cornwell's criticism, American Rabbi and historian David Dalin published \"The Myth of Hitler's Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews from the Nazis\" in 2005. He reaffirmed previous accounts of Pius having been a saviour of thousands of Europe's Jews. In a review of the book, another Jewish scholarâChurchill biographer, Martin Gilbertâwrote that Dalin's work was \"an essential contribution to our understanding of the reality of Pope Pius XII's support for Jews at their time of greatest danger. Hopefully, his account will replace the divisively harmful version of papal neglect, and even collaboration, that has held the field for far too long\". Dalin's book also argued that Cornwell and others were liberal Catholics and ex-Catholics who \"exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today\" and that Pius XII was responsible for saving the lives of many thousands of Jews.\n\nA number of other scholars replied with favourable accounts of Pius XII, including Margherita Marchione's \"Yours Is a Precious Witness: Memoirs of Jews and Catholics in Wartime Italy\" (1997), \"Pope Pius XII: Architect for Peace\" (2000) and \"Consensus and Controversy: Defending Pope Pius XII\" (2002); Pierre Blet's \"Pius XII and the Second World War, According to the Archives of the Vatican\" (1999); and Ronald J. Rychlak's \"Hitler, the War and the Pope\" (2000). Ecclesiastical historian William Doino (author of \"The Pius War: Responses to the Critics of Pius XII\"), concluded that Pius was \"emphatically \"not\" silent\". Other important works challenging the negative characterization of Pius's legacy were written by Eamon Duffy, Clifford Longley, Cardinal Winning, Michael Burleigh, Paul Johnson, and Denis Mack Smith.\n\nIn his 2003 book, \"A Moral Reckoning\", Daniel Goldhagen, asserted that Pius XII \"chose again and again not to mention the Jews publicly... [In] public statements by Pius XII ... any mention of the Jews is conspicuously absent.\" In a review of Goldhagen's book, Mark Riebling counters that Pius used the word \"Jew\" in his first encyclical, \"Summi Pontificatus\", published on 20 October 1939. \"There Pius insisted that all human beings be treated charitablyâfor, as Paul had written to the Colossians, in God's eyes \"there is neither Gentile nor Jew.\" In saying this, the Pope affirmed that Jews were full members of the human communityâwhich is Goldhagen's own criterion for establishing 'dissent from the anti-Semitic creed.'\"\n\nIn \"Pius XII, The Hound of Hitler\", Catholic journalist Gerard Noel dismissed accusations that Pius was \"anti-semitic\" or \"pro-Nazi\", but accused him of \"silence\" based on fear of retaliation and wrote that \" Hitler played the Pope with consummate expertise\". Gerald Steinacher's \"Nazis on the Run\" accused Pius of turning a blind eye to the activities of Vatican priests assisting \"denazification through conversion\" â which, he said, helped ex-Nazi anticommunists to escape justice.\n\nA Berlin Jewish couple, Mr. and Mrs. Wolfsson, argued in defense of the pope: \"None of us wanted the Pope to take an open stand. We were all fugitives, and fugitives do not wish to be pointed at. The Gestapo would have become more excited and would have intensified its inquisitions. If the Pope had protested, Rome would have become the center of attention. It was better that the Pope said nothing. We all shared this opinion at the time, and this is still our conviction today.\" There were examples when Church reaction to Nazi brutality only intensified SS persecutions of both Jews and the Church.\n\nIn 1999, in an attempt to address some of this controversy, the International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission (Historical Commission), a group of three Catholic and three Jewish scholars was appointed, respectively, by the Holy See's Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews (Holy See's Commission) and the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC), to whom a preliminary report was issued in October 2000.\n\nThe Commission did not discover any documents, but had the agreed-upon task to review the existing Vatican volumes, that make up the \"Actes et Documents du Saint Siege (ADSS)\" The Commission was internally divided over the question of access to additional documents from the Holy See, access to the news media by individual commission members, and, questions to be raised in the preliminary report. It was agreed to include all 47 individual questions by the six members, and use them as Preliminary Report.<ref name=\"Gerard P Fogarty, Vatican/Holocaust\">Fogarty, Gerard P., \"The Vatican and the Holocaust, Presentation to the Dominican House of Studies, Washington, D.C.\", 9 December 2000</ref> In addition to the 47 questions, the commission issued no findings of its own. It stated that it was not their task to sit in judgment of the Pope and his advisors but to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the papacy during the Holocaust.\n\nThe 47 questions by the six scholars were grouped into three parts: (a) 27 specific questions on existing documents, mostly asking for background and additional information such as drafts of the encyclical \"Mit brennender Sorge\", which was largely written by Eugenio Pacelli. (b) Fourteen questions dealt with themes of individual volumes, such as the question how Pius viewed the role of the Church during the war. (c) Six general questions, such as the absence of any anti-communist sentiments in the documents. The disagreement between members over additional documents locked up under the Holy See's 70 year rule resulted in a discontinuation of the Commission in 2001 on friendly terms. Unsatisfied with the findings, Michael Marrus, one of the three Jewish members of the Commission, said the commission \"ran up against a brick wall ... It would have been really helpful to have had support from the Holy See on this issue.\"\n\nPeter Stanford, a Catholic journalist and writer, wrote, regarding \"Fatal Silence: the pope, the resistance and the German occupation of Rome\" (written by Robert Katz; ; Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003):\n\nKatz's book also discusses how the Pope's view of the anti-Nazi resistanceâas harbingers of Communismâmeant he chose not to intervene in the Ardeatine Caves Massacre.\n\nIn \"The Real Odessa. How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina\" (2002), the Argentine journalist, Uki GoÃ±i described how the Argentinean government dealt with war criminals that entered Argentina. However, during his research GoÃ±i accidentally stumbled on documents of the British Foreign Office about the involvement of Vatican personnel in the smuggling of war criminals, the so-called post-war \"ratlines\". GoÃ±i found out that the British Envoy D'Arcy Osborne had intervened with Pope Pius XII to put an end to these illegal activities. Furthermore, he discovered \"that the Pope secretly pleaded with Washington and London on behalf of notorious criminals and Nazi collaborators\". Suzanne Brown-Fleming's \"The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience. Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany\" (2006) underlines GoÃ±i's findings. In her remarkable study, Brown-Fleming clearly demonstrated how Pius XII intervened on behalf of rather vicious German war criminals (e.g. Otto Ohlendorf). Brown-Fleming's main source was the archive of Pope Pius XII's representative in post-war Germany, Cardinal Aloisius Muench. Then, Phayer's \"Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War\" (2008) makes use of many documents that have recently come to light thanks to Bill Clinton's 1997 executive order declassifying wartime and postwar documents, many of which are currently at the US National Archives and Holocaust Memorial Museum. These documents include diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and even decryptions of German communications. Relevant documents have also been released by the Argentine government and the British Foreign Office and other information sources have become available, including the diary of Bishop Hurley. These documents reveal new information about Pius XII's actions regarding the UstaÅ¡e regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the ratlines for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe. According to Phayer, \"the face of Pope Pius that we see in these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions\".\n\nOn 19 September 2008, Pope Benedict XVI held a reception for conference participants during which he praised Pius XII as a pope who made every effort to save Jews during the war. A second conference was held from 6â8 November 2008 by the Pontifical Academy of Life.\n\nOn 9 October 2008, the 50th anniversary of Pius XII's death, Benedict XVI celebrated pontifical Mass in his memory. Shortly before and after the Mass, dialectics continued between the Jewish hierarchy and the Vatican as Rabbi Shear Yeshuv Cohen of Haifa addressed the Synod of Bishops and expressed his disappointment towards Pius XII's \"silence\" during the war.\n\nOn 16 June 2009, the Pave the Way Foundation announced that it would release of 2,300 pages of documents in Avellino, Italy, dating from 1940 to 1945, which the organisation claims show that Pius XII \"worked diligently to save Jews from Nazi tyranny\"; the organisation's founder, Krupp has accused historians of harbouring \"private agendas\" and having \"let down\" the public. The foundation's research led to the publication of the book \"Pope Pius XII and World War II: the documented truth\", authored by Krupp; the book reproduces 225 pages of the new documents produced by the foundation's research.\n\nMark Riebling argued in his 2015 book \"Church of Spies\" that Pius XII was involved in plots to overthrow Hitler since mid-October 1939 and was prepared to mediate a peace between the Allies and the Axis in the event of a regime change in Germany. The courier between the resistance group under Admiral Canaris and the Pope was the Bavarian lawyer and Catholic politician Joseph MÃ¼ller.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43995676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43995676", "title": "Proportional Representation Society of Ireland", "text": "Proportional Representation Society of Ireland\n\nThe Proportional Representation Society of Ireland was the principle electoral reform organisation in Ireland until the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. It was closely associated with the Irish Home Rule movement.\n\nThe Proportional Representation Society of Ireland was founded on 20 April 1911 in Dublin. Its establishment came about following a visit to Ireland by Leonard Courtney, 1st Baron Courtney of Penwith, who advocated proportional representation as an answer to the political problems faced in Ireland at the time. The Society was initially a branch of its sister organisation in Great Britain, the Proportional Representation Society. The Society's foundation was welcomed by several notable Irish politicians, including Arthur Griffith, who saw proportional representation as a way of ensuring that both the Unionist and Nationalist communities were fairly represented in Ireland once it had Home Rule. The electoral system endorsed by the Society was the single transferable vote (STV), combined with the quota counting method and multi-member constituencies.\n\nThe Society's president was the moderate unionist Thomas Spring Rice, 2nd Baron Monteagle of Brandon. He helped to encourage support for the STV system among southern unionists as Home Rule began to look more likely, while Griffith used his considerable influence to ensure Sinn FÃ©in adopted STV as official policy. Largely as a result of the work done by the Proportional Representation Society of Ireland, the system was embodied in the Third Home Rule Bill (1912), subsequently the ill-fated Home Rule Act of 1914. The Society maintained its activity and proportional representation was first introduced in 1918 for a local election to the Sligo Corporation the following year. Proportional representation was introduced to the whole of Ireland in all elections, parliamentary and municipal, in the following two years. Proportional representation was enshrined in the Constitution of the Irish Free State.\n\nThe success of the Society resulted in its disestablishment in the 1920s. The two attempts of Fianna FÃ¡il to alter the voting system (1959 and 1968) were campaigned against by the British Electoral Reform Society, led by Enid Lakeman. The single transferable vote electoral system continues to be used in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n"}
{"id": "8401830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8401830", "title": "Qey Shibir", "text": "Qey Shibir\n\nQey Shibir (also Key Shibbir; Amharic: áá­ á½á¥á­ \"á¸³Ã¤y Å¡ÉbbÉr\"; 1977â1978) or the Ethiopian Red Terror, was a violent political campaign against competing Marxist-Leninist groups in Ethiopia and Eritrea that most visibly took place after Mengistu Haile Mariam achieved control of the Derg, the military junta, on 3 February 1977. In December 2006, Mengistu was convicted \"in absentia\" for his role in the Red Terror while leader of Ethiopia. It is estimated that 30,000 to 500,000 or 750,000 people were killed over the course of the Qey Shibir.\n\nFollowing the deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie on 12 September 1974, the Derg was faced with a number of civilian groups competing for control of Ethiopia, most notably the communist Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP). In September 1976, EPRP militants were arrested and executed, at the same time as the EPRP carried out an assassination campaign against ideologues and supporters of the Derg. Although an unsuccessful attempt to kill Mengistu on 23 September was attributed to the EPRP, the first prominent victim of the EPRP's terror was Dr. Feqre Mar'ed, a member of the Political Bureau and All-Ethiopia Socialist Movement (MEISON), another Marxist-Leninist party.\n\nHowever, the Derg was split by a rivalry between Mengistu and a faction allied against him, which limited his control. This rivalry was resolved at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Derg on 3 February 1977, at which fifty-eight top Derg officers were killed in an hour-long shootout. Seven of these officers were opponents of Mengistu, including chairman and Lieutenant General Tafari Benti, Captain Almayahu Haile, Captain Mogas Wolde Mikael and Lt. Colonel Asrat Desta, the latter being an avowed Marxist-Leninist: \"We are doing what Lenin did. You cannot build socialism without Red Terror.\" Although two rivals to Mengistu were still aliveâColonel Berhanu Bayeh and Lt. Colonel Atnafu AbateâCol. Berhanu had sided with Mengistu, and Lt. Colonel Atnafu quickly sided with the victor of the bloodbath, leaving Mengistu as the undisputed head of the Derg, and ruler of Ethiopia. A few days later, Mengistu turned his attention to his rivals outside of the Derg, foremost being the EPRP.\n\nMengistu officially began his campaign with a speech in Revolution Square (formerly and currently Mesqel Square) in the heart of Addis Ababa, which included the words \"Death to counterrevolutionaries! Death to the EPRP!\" When he delivered these words, he produced three bottles of what appeared to be blood and smashed them to the ground to show what the revolution would do to its enemies. This campaign involved organized groups of civilians, or \"kebeles\", which within a month's time began to receive arms from the Derg. \"Contrary to expectations,\" note researcher Marina Ottaway and then Washington Post correspondent David Ottaway in their account, \"these squads did not all side with the \"Derg\" or heed its call to track down 'reactionaries' and 'anarchists'. Rather, many followed their own whim and law, in accordance to the political faction that controlled each \"kebele\" or factory. Not only had numerous defense squads been infiltrated by the EPRP, but also those controlled by the Political Bureau were often bent on furthering the interests of MEISON rather than the \"Derg\".\"\n\nThe Ottaways date the height of the Red Terror in Addis Ababa to 22 March, when the Derg felt that they had armed enough civilian groups to permit a house-by-house search for EPRP members, arms, and other paraphernalia. However the search was anything but systematic, the Ottways note, with \"each squad a law unto itself. Some looked only for arms, but others confiscated food supplies, building materials, and gasoline; some considered cameras espionage equipment, and others regarded typewriters as highly dangerous.\" Despite many being taken from their homes in the middle of the night, some never to return home, few of the top leaders of the EPRP were among the dead.\n\nA number of distinctly ugly incidents followed. One was at the Berhanena Selam Printing Press, where three days later a dozen workers were arrested for being EPRP members, then afterwards released for lack of evidence; on the morning of 26 March, nine of them were found murdered, including a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, which shocked the city. The deaths were found to be the responsibility of a certain Girma Kebede, and who was later found to be \"the Political Bureau's chief executioner; he had already murdered twenty-four persons and had a list of over two hundred others he was supposed to liquidate.\" Embarrassed, the Derg had him and five associates executed as counterrevolutionaries on 2 April.\n\nDespite this brutality, the EPRP continued to strike back, best as it could. As one contemporary report describes:\n\nEvents like this led to tension between the Derg junta (and presumably Mengistu) and the civilian Political Bureau. Concern over the threat of the EPRP kept this tension from becoming a definite break until the eve of May Day, when the Political Bureau, on the pretext that an anti-government protest was in the offing, ordered the \"kebeles\" to arrest any young person suspected of being an EPRP member. According to the Ottaways, \"Hundreds were arrested, taken to three different sites on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, and executed en masse. Scores of others were gunned down in the streets by the Derg's 'permanent secretaries', the jeeps mounted with machine guns constantly patrolling the streets of Addis Ababa. The death toll may have been as high as one thousand.\" Afterwards, the Derg disavowed this outrage and put the blame for the slaughter on the Political Bureau in a proclamation on 14 July. The Bureau's leader Haile Fide and a group of his followers attempted to flee the capital the following August, but were caught.\n\nAt the same time, the Red Terror made MEISON its next target. \"Sensing danger,\" writes Bahru Zewde, \"the leaders of the organization hastily tried to go underground. But almost all of them were either captured or killed in August 1977 as they tried to retreat into the countryside in several detachments.\"\n\nThousands of men and women were rounded up and executed in the following two years. Amnesty International estimates that the death toll could be as high as 500,000. Groups of people were herded into churches that were then burned down, and women were subjected to systematic rape by soldiers. The Save the Children Fund reported that the victims of the Red Terror included not only adults, but 1,000 or more children, mostly aged between eleven and thirteen, whose corpses were left in the streets of Addis Ababa.\n\nThe victims' lives are immortalized in the \"Red Terror\" Martyrs' Memorial Museum in Addis Ababa.\n\nMengistu was found guilty of genocide \"in absentia\" and was sentenced to life in prison in January 2007. After his conviction, Zimbabwe, where he received sanctuary due to friendship with Robert Mugabe, said it would not extradite him. On 26 May 2008, the Ethiopian Supreme Court sentenced Mengistu \"in absentia\" to death. Eighteen associates of Mengistu, two of whom live in the Italian embassy in Addis Ababa and 16 in Ethiopian prisons, also are under a death sentence. Another individual who was found guilty \"in absentia \"in May 2002, Kelbessa Negewo, was returned from his exile in the United States several years later to serve a life sentence.\n\n\n\n"}

The Court held that both firms and lawyers have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to their clients and so lawyer or firm cannot represent a client whose interests may be adverse to the interests of another client unless there is consent and a reasonable belief that the interests will not be adverse. This greatly expanded the old rules of conflict of interest which required actual knowledge of confidential information before a lawyer was in conflict.\n\nDavid Lloyd Neil was accused of a series of criminal charges. In his prior job he retained the legal services of a solicitor from an Edmonton law firm. Neil's assistant, Helen Lambert, had hired Gregory Lazin from the same firm to represent her in the relation to the charges. Lazin sat in on an interview with Neil's lawyer in order to gain advantage for his client. In a second incident, Lazin was approached by an old client of Neil named Doblanko who believed that Neil had fabricated a divorce document. Lazin referred him to the same police officer who was investigating Neil's other charges.\n\nThe issue was whether Lazin created a conflict of interest by assisting in establishing the charges against Neil, when he was a past client. \n\nJustice Binnie, writing for the Court, dismissed the appeal. He held that the firm owed a duty of loyalty to Neil and should not have communicated with the other parties. \n\nBinnie used the case as an opportunity to survey the meaning of a lawyer's duty of loyalty. He takes a strong stance, arguing that the duty is an essential to the integrity of the profession and the administration of justice. Loyalty promotes effective legal representation.\n\nWhile the \"bright-line rule\" stated in \"Neil\" was \"obiter\" to the case at hand, in 2007 it became the \"ratio\" for determining the later SCC case of \"Strother v. 3464920 Canada Inc.\" Although \"Strother\" was decided in part by a divided Court, the later case of \"Canadian National Railway Co. v. McKercher LLP\" in 2013, decided by a unanimous Court, clarified Canadian jurisprudence in this field.\n\n\n"}

The Reform Party was created on 11 February by a group of four Members of Parliament (MPs) who left the United Party under the guidance of the leader of the United Party in the Transvaal, Harry Schwarz, who became the party's leader. Schwarz and others were staunchly opposed to apartheid and called for a much more rigorous opposition to the National Party. They said that they no longer felt the UP was \"the vehicle in which we can travel the path of verligtheid\". The party had four MPs, two senators, ten members of the Transvaal Provincial Council, 14 out of the 36 Johannesburg City Councillors and four Randburg City Councillors. This made it the official opposition in the Transvaal Provincial Council.\n\nThere was much division in the United party, between liberals and conservatives in the 1960s and early 1970s. Divisions came to a head in 1972 when Harry Schwarz, leader of the liberal \"Young Turks\" within the party, wrestled the leadership of the party in the Transvaal from Marais Steyn. His victory was a visible sign of strength from the liberals within the party. In 1975 Harry Schwarz broke away from the party with four other MPs, two senators, ten members of the Transvaal Provincial Council, 14 out of the 36 Johannesburg City Councillors, four Randburg City Councillors formed the Reform Party.\n\nAt the Reform Party's first meeting it mapped out the party's objectives. Among the main ones were:\n\n1. The Reform Party believes in equality of opportunity and must create the conditions in which equality of opportunity can be exercised.\n\n2. The Reform Party stands for the removal of discrimination based on colour. It must get together with the people of other races to evolve a way in which discrimination will be removed.\n\nAlthough closer to the Progressives' agenda, the new Reform Party made no immediate move to merge the two parties. Eventually the party merged with the Progressive Party on 25 July 1975 to form the Progressive Reform Party with Colin Eglin as the new leader and Schwarz as Chairman of the National Executive. This proved to realign the opposition in South Africa, as the PRP became the official opposition party following the demise of the UP. In 1977 another group of United Party members left the Party to form the Committee for a United Opposition, which then joined the Progressive Reform Party to form the Progressive Federal Party.\n\n"}

With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated \"slice by slice\" until one realizes (too late) that it is gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several factions within the opposing political party and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the 'sliced' sides to protest. Salami tactics are most likely to succeed when the perpetrators keep their true long-term motives hidden and maintain a posture of cooperativeness and helpfulness while engaged in the intended gradual subversion.\n\nThe term \"salami tactics\" () was coined in the late 1940s by the orthodox communist leader MÃ¡tyÃ¡s RÃ¡kosi to describe the actions of the Hungarian Communist Party in its ultimately successful drive for complete power in Hungary. RÃ¡kosi claimed he destroyed the non-Communist parties by \"cutting them off like slices of salami.\" By portraying his opponents as fascists (or at the very least fascist sympathizers), he was able to get the opposition to slice off its right wing, then its centrists, then the more courageous left wingers, until only those Fellow travellers willing to collaborate with the Communists remained in power.\n\nThe term is also known as a \"piecemealy strategy\". It was used by the Nazi Party (which used the term \"Gleichschaltung\") to achieve absolute power in Germany, beginning in the early months of 1933. The Reichstag fire of February 27 rattled the German population and led to the Reichstag Fire Decree, leading to the suspension of many civil liberties and outlawing of the Communist Party and the Social Democrat parties. An estimated 10,000 people were arrested in two weeks. An Enabling Act soon followed on March 24. The act gave Hitler plenary power, which allowed him to bypass the Reichstag and consolidate power. Hitler and the Nazis then eliminated such potential opposition as trade unions and rival political parties. They established organizations with mandatory membership, such as the Hitler Youth, the League of German Girls and the Reich Labour Service. The Enabling Act was renewed in 1937 and 1941. \n\nOn April 26, 1942, the Reichstag passed a law making Hitler the \"oberster Gerichtsherr\" or the supreme judge of the land, giving him the power of life and death over every citizen, which effectively extended the Enabling Act for the rest of the war.\n\nSalami tactics are discussed by the British Chief Scientific Adviser in the \"Yes, Prime Minister\" episode, \"The Grand Design\".\n\nIn the 2016 film \"Arrival\", Agent Halpern mentions a Hungarian word meaning to eliminate your enemies one by one. It is thought that this alludes to \"szalÃ¡mitaktika.\" Indeed, this is cited in Amazon Prime X-Ray (1:07:50).\n\n\n"}

The attribute of sex characteristics was first defined in national law in Malta, in 2015. The legal term has since been adopted by United Nations, European, and Asia-Pacific institutions, and in a 2017 update to the Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics.\n\nPhysical sex characteristics include primary sex characteristics and secondary sex characteristics. A primary sexual characteristic, as narrowly defined, is any anatomical part of the body involved in sexual reproduction and constituting the reproductive system in a complex organism, especially the external sex organs; the external sex organs are also commonly referred to as the genitalia or genitals. Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear at sexual maturity in animals and during puberty in humans, especially the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish the sexes of a species, but that, unlike the sex organs, are not directly part of the reproductive system.\n\nSex characteristics is a term used in law and in human rights frameworks. The term was first used in Malta in 2015, when the country enacted legal protections from discrimination and forced medical procedures on grounds of sex characteristics. The Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act defined sex characteristics as:\n\nIn November 2017, the Yogyakarta Principles were expanded to include new principles and new attributes of sex characteristics and gender identity. The supplement noted that the new \"explicit ground for protection from violations of human rights has evolved in international jurisprudence\". Sex characteristics is defined as:\n\nIn 2015, the Fundamental Rights Agency published a comparative legal analysis on protection against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics in the EU.\n\nIn 2016, the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (AFP) manual on Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics. The document provides an analysis of human rights issues, including the rights to physical integrity, non-discrimination, effective remedies and redress, and recognition before the law.\n\nThe Maltese Act that introduced the term was widely welcomed internationally by civil society organizations as it offered protections to intersex people for the first time. The Act was later followed by a report by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe that recognized that sex characteristics are distinct from a person's sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn a wide-ranging analysis on intersex human rights and health issues, the Council of Europe published an \"Issue Paper\" entitled \"Human rights and intersex people\" in May 2015. In the Issue Paper, the Council's Commissioner for Human Rights recommended that Member States of the Council of Europe protect intersex citizens on grounds of \"sex characteristics\", or otherwise protect intersex persons on grounds of sex or gender:\n\nIn 2015, the United Nations published a fact sheet using the term sex characteristics to define intersex:\n\nThis was followed by a public statement by UN and regional human rights experts in 2016 utilizing a similar definition. In September 2015, Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, opened an Expert meeting on ending human rights violations against intersex persons stating:\n\nIn 2017, Amnesty International published a report condemning \"non-emergency, invasive and irreversible medical treatment with harmful effects\" on children born with variations of sex characteristics in Germany and Denmark.

This approach was developed in order to close the 'reassurance gap' - the paradoxical situation in which the public's 'fear of crime' (as measured by the British Crime Survey/Crime Survey for England and Wales) does not change in tandem with the overall crime rate. The Signal Crimes Perspective contended that fear of crime and people's risk perceptions - the perceived likelihood of being victimised - were linked to certain crimes, deviant behaviours or the residual signs of these activities:\n\nSignal crimes vary in strength or \"value\"; strong signals are borne out of serious events with high public awareness, whilst weak signals may emanate from minor disorderly behaviours. However, the effect of many weak signal events over time can be just as damaging to people's feelings of security. Furthermore, different people and communities will interpret events in different ways, attaching different signal values to crimes and events based on a range of factors - e.g. lived experiences, age, or social class. An example may be that women are more likely to attach higher signal values to sexual assault, whereas young men may not be affected in the same way.\n\nThe Signal Crimes Perspective is useful to local policing styles that are based on the philosophy of community policing, as it underlines the need for engaging with communities - through local beat meetings or the 'Neighbourhood Security Interview' - to understand the local problems that create insecurity. With this understanding, local policing teams can attempt to prioritise the issues that appear to have the highest signal values and consequently improve local security.\n\n\n"}

It stars Steve Irwin and his wife Terri Irwin and was directed by frequent Irwin collaborator John Stainton. The film was released in between the fourth and fifth seasons of the series. The film follows Steve and Terri who attempt to save a crocodile from \"poachers\" not knowing that the two men are actually American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents who are after them because the crocodile in the Irwins' possession has accidentally swallowed an important satellite tracking beacon.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on 12 July 2002 in the U.S. by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which used a crocodile in place of the usual Leo the Lion for its title credit logo sequence. The film earned $33.4 million on a $12 million budget.\n\nIn outer space, a United States-owned satellite blows up and one of the last remaining pieces, a beacon, is sent hurdling towards Earth where it lands in Australia, only to be swallowed by a crocodile. Back at the CIA, Agent Buckwhiler and Deputy Director Reynolds reveal that, in the wrong hands, the beacon can change the axis of power in the world, so they send two agents, Robert Wheeler and Vaughn Barcher, down to Australia to retrieve the beacon. Department Director Ansell also secretly hires an operative of his own, Jo Buckley, to go and retrieve the beacon before Wheeler and Archer, so Ansell can take Reynolds' job.\n\nIn Australia, the crocodile that swallowed the beacon lives in a river next to the house of Brozzie Drewitt, an obnoxious cattle station owner who is taking it in her own hands to kill the crocodile for preying on her cattle. Because of this, the Department of Fauna and Fisheries send one of its workers, Sam Flynn, to Drewitt's house. Sam attempts to convince Brozzie to hire some professionals to relocate the animal, instead of having her kill it, which is illegal. Despite Flynn's words, Brozzie attempts to kill the crocodile later that night, only to fail.\n\nMeanwhile, the Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin and his wife Terri are filming a documentary about the \"less-lovable of Australia's wildlife\" when they are hired by Flynn to relocate the crocodile that has been bothering Brozzie. Steve successfully gets the crocodile in his boat. Wheeler and Barcher are nearby using GPS technology to track the beacon. When the two agents see Steve and Terri zoom past them in their boat with the crocodile who swallowed the beacon on board, they are convinced that the Irwins have the beacon. They call up the CIA, who believe the Irwins plan to use the beacon to pay for a multimillion-dollar expansion to Australia Zoo. Steve and Terri board up the crocodile in a crate and put it in the back of the truck to drive to a new river system. Wheeler and Barcher follow them from behind in a Land Rover, and when Wheeler hops on the top of the Irwins' truck, Steve believes them to be poachers who are after the crocodile. Steve climbs up on the roof and, after a brief fistfight, manages to knock Wheeler off the truck. When the Irwins reach the river, Steve opens the crocodile's crate and discovers that the crocodile had defecated. In the poop, Steve sees a shiny metal object (the beacon) which he mistakes to be a misproperly discarded children's spinning top toy. Steve and Terri successfully get the crocodile in the river, but Wheeler and Barcher show up again in a boat, determined to get the beacon. Jo Buckley shows up in an ultralight and throws sticks of dynamite down on Wheeler and BArcher's boat, destroying it and knocking the two agents in the river. Steve believes that he and Terri are caught up in the middle of a \"poacher war\" and, not wanting the dynamite to hurt the newly relocated crocodile, gets a rope out of the boat and lassoes the aircraft, causing it to crash in the river and seemingly kill Buckley. It turns out Buckley did survive and she swims to shore to inform Ansell via a phone call that she failed to retrieve the beacon. Ansell informs Buckley that he is on the run from the CIA and the police for hiring her for the mission. He is found by police and is arrested for his crimes, ending the phone call.\n\nDue to Wheeler and Barcher's failure to retrieve the beacon, the CIA decides that it is time for drastic measures and they call up U.S. President George W. Bush in the White House to request permission to use military helicopters to fly to Australia and get the beacon.\n\nSteve is ending his documentary by throwing the beacon in the air, when the military helicopters arrive. Steve hands them the beacon revealing that the whole predicament was a misunderstanding, and, in return, the CIA send Wheeler and Barcher to work at the zoo as volunteers. Brozzie becomes a volunteer for the Department of Fauna and Fisheries.\n\n\nDue to the series' immense popularity, director/producer Stainton had developed an idea for a feature-length \"Crocodile Hunter\" film in 1999 while shooting a documentary in Africa. He wanted to make a good film, but, at the same time, make it easy for Steve who was not used to acting, believing that Irwin should only play himself. It was Stainton's idea to film Steve and Terri doing a traditional nature documentary in the Australian Outback and film these scenes in a 1:85 screen ratio. In fact, nothing for the \"documentary\" scenes were ever scripted, and when the actors (from the scripted dramatic scenes that use a 2:40 screen ratio) entered the Irwins' world for a few brief scenes, Steve (who did not know anything about the script or plot) was informed by Stainton what was about to happen so Irwin could prepare and ad-lib as much as he wanted or needed. Cheyenne Enterprises, a film and television production company owned by Bruce Willis and producer Arnold Rifkin showed interest in producing and helping finance the project. MGM then showed interest in distributing the film worldwide and principal photography began in November 2001, after having filmed the non-scripted documentary segments for well over a year. The Irwins came across hundreds of animals for the filming of the documentary scenes, but only a few, the kangaroo, the perentie, the bird eating spider, and two snakes made it into the film. The animals they encountered were re-written into the script by Holly Goldberg-Sloan for the dramatic scenes when Wheeler and Archer encounter the Irwins' truck.\n\n\"Collision Course\" was shot in two film aspect ratios, 1.85:1 for the scenes with Steve and Terri and 2.35:1 for the plot about the Australian farmer and the CIA and their efforts to find the tracking drone. In theaters and on DVD, the 1.85:1 image appears with pillar boxing, a format usually reserved for 1.33:1 ratio content appearing within 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 frames. On the Fullscreen versions, the windowboxing (mostly in the scenes with Steve and Terri and the finale) is not present due to the fullscreen process cropping the widescreen image to the 1.33:1 ratio, causing the windowboxing borders not to be shown, even when shown on a widescreen television if the image is stretched as per fullscreen programs usually are.\n\nThe film holds a 53% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 88 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, stating \"You see a couple of likable people journeying through the outback, encountering dangerous critters and getting too close for comfort, while lecturing us on their habits and dangers and almost being killed by them.\" Robert K. Elder of the \"Chicago Tribune\" said, \"Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free.\"\n\nThe film made $28.4 million at the American box office, with a worldwide gross of $33.4 million, which against the production budget of $12 million, makes the film a considerable box office success.\n\nThe \"Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course\" was released to VHS and DVD in the United States on 17 December 2002.\n\n"}

{"id": "54571091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54571091", "title": "Youth unemployment in Spain", "text": "Youth unemployment in Spain\n\nYouth unemployment in Spain is the unemployment of youth (generally ages 15â24) and is different from the general unemployment of Spain. Unemployment describes those who actively search for work but that are without jobs. In Spain, youth unemployment has increasingly become alarming, especially in recent decades, given that the rate of youth unemployment has risen to such high levels. Youth unemployment in Spain rose very much during and following the Financial Crisis of 2008, and among OCDE nations Spain experienced the largest increase of job losses among young people. The increase in segmentation of the labor market, the lack of effective employment policies and deficiencies in the education system have been cited as some of the principal reasons behind the significant level of youth unemployment in Spain.\n\nIn 2014, 57.9% of young people in Spain were unemployed. From 2008 to 2014, workers younger than 35 had an average loss of purchasing power of 25.7%, more than a quarter of their income. In 2012, Spain had the highest rate of long-term youth unemployment (more than 40%) of the countries in the euro zone. At the end of 2016, the rate of unemployment among young people was 42.91%, 3.3% lower than the previous year (46.2%). Though this may been seen as a sign of improvement, it is still concerning that of the 4.23 million unemployed counted at the end of 2016, 14.5% were youth younger than 25, of which almost 46% were long-term unemployed (more than a year unemployed). Even though the rate of long-term youth unemployment has lowered recently, the fact that it remains high is cause for concern, since the more unemployed youth that exist, the greater the potential effects not only on themselves but on the Spanish economy as a whole.\n\nAmong the general causes of why young people experience higher unemployment rates than their seniors is the fact that they generally have less work experience, less knowledge about how to find a job and fewer contacts to get jobs. Furthermore, some young people do not have the exact skills that some jobs require of them, resulting in a difficult transition from school to the workforce.\n\nHowever, there are some labor practices, especially in Europe, which specifically contribute to the problem of youth unemployment in the long term. Young people are more likely to work under temporary contracts. The benefit for companies to use such contracts is that they do not have to follow regulations that make it hard to fire full time workers. About one third of young people employed in advanced economies had temporary employment contracts before the 2008 financial crisis. Half of the young people employed in Spain were using temporary contracts before the crisis and were among the first workers to be fired. This had the double effect of not only leaving young people out of work, but also leaving them without some of the social benefits their jobs provided.\n\nOther causes of the high rate of youth unemployment include leaving school early and the mismatch of supply and demand between work and education level.\n\nSpain suffers from a high rate of school drop outs, which is the percentage of the population between 18 and 24 years old who has not completed secondary education and who has not taken part in any technical training. From 2005 to 2010, Spain recorded a dropout rate of 30.6%; Only Malta (38.0%) and Portugal (34.3%) had higher rates among European Union members. In Spain, there is more concern not just for the number of dropouts, but for the fact that the rate persists and has shown little to do with the economy over the past 15 years.\n\nYouth unemployment affects not only young people, but also the economy on a broader scale, specifically income inequality. As the rate of youth unemployment increased, the gap between the rich and poor in Spain widened. It is estimated that Spain has experienced the widest expansion of income distribution in Europe, as it experienced an increase in income inequality of 18%.\n\nNot finding work has been linked to cause other problems, such as social problems typically linked to youth. The lack of work can lead to a vicious circle of poverty and social problems among young people. On top of that, unemployment can force young people to move away or to start engaging in violence and juvenile delinquency, as well as having low self-esteem and discouragement that can lead to addiction and other health problems in the future. If young people are out of work for too long, they may begin to lose their skills or stop looking for a job altogether - which means that the unemployment rate may not really be indicative of the unemployment picture in Spain.\n\nIn order to target the high school dropout rate, some have suggested greater control and support for at-risk students. In addition, some have thought that an early warning strategy, along with mandatory participation in classes where individualized support can be provided, may possibly help students stay in school longer.\n\nOn the other hand, the measures approved by the Council of Ministers in 2011 to lower the age of participation in the Initial Professional Qualification Programs (PCPI) to 15 years old, the greater accessibility of facilities and the extension of the programs for up to two years should encourage certain students to remain in the education system longer.\n\nSome in Spain believe that it is necessary to encourage students to stay in the education system through policies that make their studies more attractive (both for the students themselves and for their parents). Moreover, there are attempts to reincorporate students who have left the education system.\n\nWith regard to the workforce, it is believed that reducing segmentation, activating, and including young people with greater success will be key objectives in the future. There has also been a call to ensure that the skills of future workers remain intact while in school, in order to avoid the mismatch that exists today. Some have even suggested that the government encourage employers to help solve the problem of youth unemployment by reducing employers' social security contributions for new hires or by subsidizing firms which hire long-term unemployed youth.\n\nIn addition, in order to correct the disparity between regular and temporary workers, the government has been advised by some to reduce regulations in fixed-term contracts, while increasing regulations in temporary contracts. In doing so, there would be a smaller gap between the two and employers would theoretically be less encouraged to take advantage of temporary contracts, which has been shown to have negative effects on young people.\n"}
