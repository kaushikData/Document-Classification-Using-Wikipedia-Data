{"id": "4153339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4153339", "title": "All-Polish Youth", "text": "All-Polish Youth\n\nThe All-Polish Youth () is a Polish youth organization based on ultra-nationalist and fascist doctrines, formerly affiliated with the League of Polish Families, with a Catholic-nationalist philosophy. Its agenda declares that its aim is to raise Polish youth in a Catholic and patriotic spirit. It currently plays a major role as part of the National Movement party.\n\nIts manifesto from 1989 states, for example, that \"one's country is the greatest earthly good. After God, your foremost love belongs to the Homeland, and foremost after God you must serve your own country,\" and declares itself opposed to \"doctrines promoting liberalism, tolerance, and relativism.\nThe earliest roots of Polish Youth reach back to 1922, the organisation was delegalised in 1934 and the present incarnation was created on December 2, 1989. Polish Youth was affiliated with the League of Polish Families, but was never officially its youth wing.\n\nIn recent years, All-Polish Youth have been widely condemned as homophobic by various organisations including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the United Nations.\n\nThe organisation, properly the Academic Union \"All-Polish Youth\" (\"Związek Akademicki \"Młodzież Wszechpolska\"\"), was founded in 1922 as an ideological youth organisation with a strong nationalist sentiment, and was the largest student organisation in the Second Polish Republic. The Founding Convention of the All-Polish youth took place in March 1922, with Roman Dmowski being selected honorary chairman.\n\nThe term \"All-Polish\" is intended to represent a desire to unify all Polish lands, and accentuate national ties and the equality of all people of Polish origin regardless of their wealth or social status. The idea for creating the organization occurred when Poland was partitioned and not officially on the world map, therefore it aimed to unite Poles from all three partitions. In the inter-war period, members of the organisation participated actively in academic life, and became the heads of many student organisations. The All-Polish Youth was the largest student organization in Poland during the 1930s. The goals of the organization were mainly focused on three issues:\n\nAll-Polish Youth was the least radical of organizations of the National Democracy camp. Nevertheless, some of its members praised Mussolini and his Italian fascism for its hardline stances towards the left and realisation of \"national revolution\".. Most leaders of the All-Polish Youth criticized Hitler for racism and radicalism. According to Jan Mosdorf, a pre-war chairman of All-Polish Youth who died in Auschwitz for saving Jews, the organization was against fascists and Hitlerites. Some Members of the All-Polish Youth also praised authoritarian regimes of the Mediterranean, Salazar's Portugal and Franco's Spain.\n\nThey also favoured economically boycotting the Jews, limiting their access to higher education (numerus clausus) in order to equal the chance of children from countryside families who had very limited access to education to the chance of the children of Jewish families living in the towns and cities. The All-Polish Youth also actively campaigned for ghetto benches, segregated seating for Jewish students \n\nThe modern incarnation of the All-Polish Youth was founded in Poznań in 1989, on the initiative of Roman Giertych, the former leader of the League of Polish Families (LPR). Continuing the tradition of its precursors, the organisation maintains its aim of raising youth with their ideology, and operates across all of Poland, working with high-school and university students. \n\nIn 2006, the Polish Public Prosecutor's office launched an investigation after a video recording from a private party was leaked to the Polish press. It was considered that All-Polish Youth members including Leokadia Wiącek, a personal assistant of Maciej Giertych (member of the European Parliament), were seen fraternizing with Neo-Nazi skinheads, listening to Neo-Nazi bands, and saluting the swastika. Following the incident, Leokadia Wiącek was expelled from All-Polish Youth, and the League of Polish Families cut ties with the group. As it was later determined, during the private party Leokodia Wącek was not a member of the organisation and the main Polish television channel Telewizja Polska apologized to All-Polish Youth for accusing them of neo-nazi connotations.\n\nAll-Polish Youth have declared that it is only by making Poland a Catholic state that its future will be secured, and chairman Konrad Bonisławski has stated \"We do not want to become like Holland with its free drugs and gay marriage. Since joining the European Union we have seen attempts to destroy our Catholic values.\"\n\nAll-Polish Youth have gained considerable press coverage due to their staunch opposition of abortion and, particularly, homosexuality (which their website condemns as \"unnatural behaviour\" and describes gay rights marches as \"militant homosexualism\"). This has led to (sometimes violent) clashes with pro-choice and gay rights demonstrators.\n\nAll-Polish Youth have been widely condemned as homophobic by various organisations including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and even the United Nations (which, in their \"Universal Periodic Review\", describes All-Polish Youth as an \"extremist homophobic grouping\"), as well as a multitude of Gay Rights organisations such as OutRage! and the Polish Campaign Against Homophobia. In 2004, 2005, and 2006, All-Polish Youth members and sympathizers violently attacked people who were taking part in pro-gay demonstrations, throwing eggs, bottles and rocks at them, and were reported to have shouted \"Send the fags to the hospital\", \"Perverts, get out of Kraków\", \"Let's gas the fags\" and \"We'll do to you what Hitler did to the Jews\".\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, the organisation has been heavily involved in playing a major role as part of the National Movement party, a party which the organisation was one of the several co-founders.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "317583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317583", "title": "Andreas Hofer", "text": "Andreas Hofer\n\nAndreas Hofer (November 22, 1767 – February 20, 1810) was a Tyrolean innkeeper and drover, who in 1809 became the leader of the Tyrolean Rebellion against the revolutionary Napoleonic invasion during the War of the Fifth Coalition. He was subsequently captured and executed.\n\nHofer is still today venerated as a folk hero, freedom fighter and Austrian patriot.\n\nAndreas Hofer was born 1767 in St. Leonhard in Passeier, in the Habsburg crown land of Tyrol. His father was an innkeeper of the \"Sandhof\" inn and Andreas followed in his footsteps when he inherited the establishment. He also traded wine and horses in adjacent Northern Italy and learned the Italian language. He married Anna Ladurner. In 1791 he was elected to the Tyrolean Landtag assembly. In German he was known as a \"Wirt\" (innkeeper) and thus ever after \"Sandwirt\".\n\nIn the War of the Third Coalition against the French he became a sharpshooter and later a militia captain in the Austrian Imperial and Royal Army. After the Austrian defeat, Tyrol was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria (France's ally) according to the 1805 Treaty of Pressburg. During the stern measures of Minister Maximilian von Montgelas and the forced recruitment into the Bavarian Army, Hofer became a leader of the anti-Bavarian movement. In January 1809, he was part of a delegation to Vienna to ask Emperor Francis I of Austria for support for a possible uprising. The Emperor gave his assurances and the delegation returned home.\n\nHofer begun to secretly organize insurrection, visiting villagers and holding councils of war in local inns. Reputedly he was so much on the move that he signed his messages \"Andreas Hofer, from where I am\" and letters to him were addressed to \"wherever he may be\". At the same time other leaders organized their own forces elsewhere in the Alps. Hofer became a leader of a militia contingent in the Passeier Valley.\n\nThe Tyrolean Rebellion began on 9 April 1809 in Innsbruck. The previous night, organizers dumped sacks of sawdust into the River Inn as a sign to start the rebellion; floating through the town and down the Inn Valley, it alerted the rebels. Church bells summoned men to fight with muskets and farmyard implements. They soon overran smaller Bavarian garrisons and surprised a column of French infantry that was passing through the area.\n\nOn April 11 Tyrolean militia defeated a Bavarian force in Sterzing which led to the occupation of Innsbruck before noon. Though French forces came across the Brenner Pass as a relief and a united French-Bavarian contingent counterattacked the next night, the Tyroleans fought them in the First Battle of Bergisel until Hofer and his allies won on the morning of the 13th. While Austrian forces under General Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles moved into the Tyrolean capital and installed a provisional government led by Joseph Hormayr, Hofer advanced south, taking Bozen and Trent.\n\nHopes of a successful rebellion waned when Napoleon defeated the Austrian forces of Archduke Charles of Austria in a series of battles of Teugen-Hausen, Abensberg, Eckmühl, and Ratisbon, whereafter the Austrian troops withdrew from Tyrol and Hofer had to pull back to the mountains. The French Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre took charge of the Tyrolean theatre, and Bavarian and Saxon forces under the command of Karl Philipp von Wrede on May 13 defeated the Austrians in a bloody skirmish at Wörgl. The Bavarians re-occupied Innsbruck on May 19. However, when their French allies left, the rebellion flared up again.\n\nHofer became the effective commander-in-chief of the Tyrolean rebels, with the support of other leaders such as Josef Speckbacher and Father Joachim Haspinger. He commanded a force of Tyroleans approximately 20,000 strong, together with a couple of hundred Austrian soldiers who had joined them after the retreat of the Austrian army.\n\nIn the second Battle of Bergisel, from May 25 to May 29 1809, Hofer's troops again defeated the Bavarians, driving them out of the country and retaking Innsbruck on May 30. On May 29 Hofer received a letter from Emperor Francis in which he promised not to sign any peace treaty that would include giving up Tyrol. An Austrian intendant came to rule Tyrol and Hofer returned to his home. However, Napoleon again defeated Austrian troops in the Battle of Wagram on July 6. The Armistice of Znaim ceded Tyrol to Bavaria again. Napoleon sent 40,000 French and Bavarian troops to take over Tyrol and they re-occupied Innsbruck.\n\nAfter little hesitation, Hofer joined battle again. The French offered a reward for his head. On August 13–14, in the third Battle of Bergisel, Hofer's Tyroleans defeated the French troops of Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre in a 12-hour battle after a downhill charge. The Tyroleans retook Innsbruck.\nHofer declared himself Imperial Commandant of the Tyrol in the absence of the ruler and for two months ruled the land from Hofburg in the name of the Emperor of Austria. He announced new laws and taxes and minted his own coins. He also sent two men to Britain to ask for assistance. On September 29 he received a medal from the emperor and another promise that Austria would not abandon Tyrol.\n\nHofer's hopes were dashed on October 14 when the Treaty of Schönbrunn again ceded Tyrol to Bavaria. French and Bavarian troops advanced and Hofer retreated to the mountains. Promised amnesty, Hofer and his followers laid down their weapons on November 8. Hofer retired to his home valley.\n\nOn November 12, Hofer received false reports of Austrian victories and tried to summon his troops on November 15. This time he had little following and French troops defeated his forces. His subordinate commanders surrendered and urged him to escape over the mountains.\n\nHofer hid in a hut in the mountains in the Passeiertal and the French announced a reward of 1500 guilders for his head. His neighbor Franz Raffl betrayed him and revealed his hiding place to the authorities. Hofer was captured by Italian troops on January 28, 1810 and was sent to Mantua in chains to face a court-martial. (Raffl died impoverished in Bavaria twenty years later.)\n\nOfficers holding the court martial disagreed on the exact sentence until they received a message from Milan. It was supposedly from the Viceroy, transmitting Napoleon's order to \"give him a fair trial and then shoot him.\" Later Napoleon claimed to Prince Metternich that Hofer was executed against his wishes.\n\nAndreas Hofer was executed by a firing squad on February 20, 1810. He refused a blindfold or to kneel, and gave money to a corporal in charge, telling him to \"shoot straight\". He gave the order to fire himself. Hofer became a martyr in Germany and Austria and a rallying symbol against the power of Napoleon.\n\nIn 1818, his family was given a patent of nobility by the emperor of Austria (he and Anna had 7 children, at least two of whom emigrated to America). In 1823, Hofer's remains were moved from Mantua to Innsbruck, and in 1834, his tomb was decorated with a marble statue. In 1893, a bronze statue of Hofer was erected in Bergisel (Innsbruck). A large painting depicting his arrest hangs in the Palace of Maria Theresa in Innsbruck, and there is an annual open-air play in Meran based on his life. In Meran there is also a monumental statue of him opposite the train station at the beginning of the Via Andreas Hofer, which was erected by Tyrolean nationalists in 1915.\n\nThe song \"Zu Mantua in Banden\" (today the anthem of the State of Tyrol) tells the story of his tragic fate and execution.\nHis most famous quote: \"I will not trade my life for a lie\"\n\nThe 1929 German silent film \"Andreas Hofer\" is a biopic of his life. Hofer was played by Fritz Greiner.\n\n\n\n"}

She deepened her conservative interests while studying history at Cornell University, where she helped found \"The Cornell Review\". She subsequently embarked on a career as a law clerk before rising to prominence in the 1990s as an outspoken critic of the Clinton administration. Her first book concerned the Bill Clinton impeachment, and sprang from her experience writing legal briefs for Paula Jones's attorneys, as well as columns she wrote about the cases.\n\nCoulter's syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate appears in newspapers, and is featured on conservative websites. Coulter has written 12 best-selling books.\n\nAnn Hart Coulter was born on December 8, 1961, in New York City, to John Vincent Coulter (1926–2008), an FBI agent of Irish–German heritage, who was a native of Albany, New York; and Nell Husbands Coulter (née Martin; 1928–2009), a native of Paducah, Kentucky. Her family later moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where Coulter and her two older brothers, James and John, were raised. She was brought up in a conservative household in Connecticut by Republican parents, with a father who idolized Joseph McCarthy. Coulter says that she has identified as a conservative since kindergarten. To prepare for arguments, she read books like \"The Conscience of a Conservative\" by Barry Goldwater.\n\nAt age 14, Coulter visited her older brother in New York City, where he attended law school. While he was in class, he had his little sister read books by Milton Friedman and William E. Simon. When he got home from class, he quizzed Coulter. As a reward, he and his friends took her out to bars on the Upper East Side. Reading Republican books made Coulter dream about working as a writer. She graduated from New Canaan High School in 1980. Coulter's age was disputed in 2002, while she was arguing that she was not yet 40, yet \"The Washington Post\" columnist Lloyd Grove cited that she provided a birthdate of December 8, 1961, when registering to vote in New Canaan, Connecticut, prior to the 1980 Presidential election. Meanwhile, a driver's license issued several years later purportedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter will not confirm either date, citing privacy concerns.\n\nWhile attending Cornell University, Coulter helped found \"The Cornell Review\", and was a member of the Delta Gamma national sorority. She graduated \"cum laude\" from Cornell in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and received her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1988, where she was an editor of the \"Michigan Law Review\". At Michigan, Coulter was president of the local chapter of the Federalist Society and was trained at the National Journalism Center.\n\nAfter law school, Coulter served as a law clerk, in Kansas City, for Pasco Bowman II of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. After a short time working in New York City in private practice, where she specialized in corporate law, Coulter left to work for the United States Senate Judiciary Committee after the Republican Party took control of Congress in 1994. She handled crime and immigration issues for Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan and helped craft legislation designed to expedite the deportation of aliens convicted of felonies. She later became a litigator with the Center for Individual Rights.\n\nIn 2000, Coulter considered running for Congress in Connecticut on the Libertarian Party ticket to serve as a spoiler in order to throw the seat to the Democratic candidate and see that Republican Congressman Christopher Shays failed to gain re-election, as a punishment for Shays' vote against Clinton's impeachment. The leadership of the Libertarian Party of Connecticut, after meeting with Coulter, declined to endorse her. As a result, her self-described \"total sham, media-intensive, third-party Jesse Ventura campaign\" did not take place. Shays subsequently won the election, and held the seat until 2009.\n\nCoulter's career is highlighted by the publication of twelve books, as well as the weekly syndicated newspaper column that she publishes. She is particularly known for her polemical style, and describes herself as someone who likes to \"stir up the pot. I don't pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do\".\nShe has been compared to Clare Boothe Luce, one of her idols, for her satirical style. She also makes numerous public appearances, speaking on television and radio talk shows, as well as on college campuses, receiving both praise and protest. Coulter typically spends 6–12 weeks of the year on speaking engagement tours, and more when she has a book coming out.\nIn 2010, she made an estimated $500,000 on the speaking circuit, giving speeches on topics of modern conservatism, gay marriage, and what she describes as the hypocrisy of modern American liberalism. During one appearance at the University of Arizona, a pie was thrown at her. Coulter has, on occasion, in defense of her ideas, responded with inflammatory remarks toward hecklers and protestors who attend her speeches.\n\nCoulter is the author of twelve books, many of which have appeared on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, with a combined 3 million copies sold .\n\nCoulter's first book, \"\", was published by Regnery Publishing in 1998 and made the New York Times Bestseller list. It details Coulter's case for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\nHer second book, \"\", published by Crown Forum in 2002, reached the number one spot on \"The New York Times\" non-fiction best seller list. In \"Slander\", Coulter argues that President George W. Bush was given unfair negative media coverage. The factual accuracy of \"Slander\" was called into question by then-comedian and author, later Democratic U.S. Senator from Minnesota, Al Franken; he also accused her of citing passages out of context. Others investigated these charges, and also raised questions about the book's accuracy and presentation of facts. Coulter responded to criticisms in a column called \"Answering My Critics\".\n\nIn her third book, \"\", also published by Crown Forum, she reexamines the 60-year history of the Cold War—including the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Whittaker Chambers-Alger Hiss affair, and Ronald Reagan's challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down this wall\"—and argues that liberals were wrong in their Cold War political analyses and policy decisions, and that McCarthy was correct about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government.\nShe also argues that the correct identification of Annie Lee Moss, among others, as communists was misreported by the liberal media.\n\"Treason\" was published in 2003, and spent 13 weeks on the Best Seller list.\n\nCrown Forum published a collection of Coulter's columns in 2004 as her fourth book, \"How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter\".\n\nCoulter's fifth book, published by Crown Forum in 2006, is \"\".\nIn it, she argues, first, that American liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, and second, that it bears all the attributes of a religion itself.\n\"Godless\" debuted at number one on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. Some passages in the book match portions of others' writings published at an earlier time (including newspaper articles and a Planned Parenthood document), leading John Barrie of iThenticate to assert that Coulter had engaged in \"textbook plagiarism\".\n\nCoulter's \"If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans\" (Crown Forum), published in October 2007, and \"\" (Crown Forum), published on January 6, 2009, both also achieved best-seller status.\n\nOn June 7, 2011, Crown Forum published her eighth book \"\". Coulter said she based this book heavily on the work of French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon, who wrote on mass psychology, and in it she argues that liberals have mob-like characteristics.\n\nHer ninth book, published September 25, 2012, is \"\". It argues that liberals, and Democrats in particular, have taken undue credit for racial civil rights in America.\n\nCoulter's tenth book, \"Never Trust a Liberal Over 3 – Especially a Republican\", was released October 14, 2013. It is her second collection of columns and her first published by Regnery since her first book, \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors\". Coulter published her eleventh book, \"\" on June 1, 2015. The book addresses illegal immigration, amnesty programs, and border security in the United States.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Coulter's weekly (biweekly from 1999–2000) syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate began appearing. Her column is featured on six conservative websites: \"Human Events Online\", WorldNetDaily, Townhall.com, VDARE, \"FrontPage Magazine\", \"Jewish World Review\" and her own website. Her syndicator says, \"Ann's client newspapers stick with her because she has a loyal fan base of conservative readers who look forward to reading her columns in their local newspapers\".\n\nIn 1999, Coulter worked as a regular columnist for \"George\" magazine. Coulter also wrote exclusive weekly columns between 1998 and 2003 and with occasional columns thereafter for the conservative magazine \"Human Events\". In her columns for the magazine, she discusses judicial rulings, Constitutional issues, and legal matters affecting Congress and the executive branch.\n\nIn 2001, as a contributing editor and syndicated columnist for \"National Review Online\" (NRO), Coulter was asked by editors to make changes to a piece written after the September 11 attacks. On the national television show \"Politically Incorrect\", Coulter accused \"NRO\" of censorship and said that she was paid $5 per article. NRO dropped her column and terminated her editorship. Jonah Goldberg, editor-at-large of \"NRO\", said, \"We did not 'fire' Ann for what she wrote... we ended the relationship because she behaved with a total lack of professionalism, friendship, and loyalty [concerning the editing disagreement].\"\n\nCoulter contracted with \"USA Today\" to cover the 2004 Democratic National Convention. She wrote one article that began, \"Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston ...\" and referred to some unspecified female attendees as \"corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons\". The newspaper declined to print the article citing an editing dispute over \"basic weaknesses in clarity and readability that we found unacceptable\". An explanatory article by the paper went on to say \"Coulter told the online edition of \"Editor & Publisher\" magazine that \"USA Today\" doesn't like my \"tone\", humor, sarcasm, etc., which raises the intriguing question of why they hired me to write for them.'\" \"USA Today\" replaced Coulter with Jonah Goldberg, and Coulter published it instead on her website.\n\nIn August 2005, the \"Arizona Daily Star\" dropped Coulter's syndicated column, citing reader complaints: \"Many readers find her shrill, bombastic, and mean-spirited. And those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives\".\n\nIn July 2006, some newspapers replaced Coulter's column with those of other conservative columnists following the publication of her fourth book, \"\". After \"The Augusta Chronicle\" dropped her column, newspaper editor Michael Ryan explained: \"it came to the point where she was the issue rather than what she was writing about\". Ryan also stated that \"pulling Ann Coulter's column hurts; she's one of the clearest thinkers around\".\n\nCoulter made her first national media appearance in 1996 after she was hired by the then-fledgling network MSNBC as a legal correspondent. She later appeared on CNN and Fox News. Coulter went on to make frequent guest appearances on many television and radio talk shows.\n\nCoulter appeared in three films released during 2004. The first was \"Feeding the Beast\", a made-for-television documentary on the \"24-Hour News Revolution\". The other two films were \"FahrenHYPE 9/11\", a direct-to-video documentary rebuttal of Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 911\", and \"Is It True What They Say About Ann?\", a documentary on Coulter containing clips of interviews and speeches. In 2015, Coulter had a cameo as the Vice President in the made-for-TV movie \"\".\n\nCoulter is a Christian and belongs to the Presbyterian denomination. She is a conservative columnist and has described herself as a \"typical, immodest-dressing, swarthy male-loving, friend-to-homosexuals, ultra-conservative.\" She is a registered Republican and former member of the advisory council of GOProud since August 9, 2011.\n\nShe supports the display of the Confederate flag. She came to the defense of Milo Yiannopoulos, of whom she is a friend, for his comments defending pederasty.\n\nCoulter believes \"Roe v. Wade\" should be overturned and left to the states. She is anti-abortion, but believes there should be an exception if a woman is raped. However, in 2015, she prioritized the issue of immigration, stating: \"I don't care if [Trump] wants to perform abortions in White House after this immigration policy paper\".\n\nCoulter was raised by a Catholic father and Protestant mother. At one public lecture she said: \"I don't care about anything else; Christ died for my sins, and nothing else matters.\" She summarized her view of Christianity in a 2004 column, saying, \"Jesus' distinctive message was: People are sinful and need to be redeemed, and this is your lucky day, because I'm here to redeem you even though you don't deserve it, and I have to get the crap kicked out of me to do it.\" She then mocked \"the message of Jesus... according to liberals\", summarizing it as \"something along the lines of 'be nice to people, which, in turn, she said \"is, in fact, one of the incidental tenets of Christianity.\"\n\nConfronting some critics' views that her content and style of writing is unchristian, Coulter said that she is \"a Christian first and a mean-spirited, bigoted conservative second, and don't you ever forget it.\" She also said: \"Christianity fuels everything I write. Being a Christian means that I am called upon to do battle against lies, injustice, cruelty, hypocrisy—you know, all the virtues in the church of liberalism\". In \"\", Coulter characterized the theory of evolution as bogus science, and contrasted her beliefs to what she called the left's \"obsession with Darwinism and the Darwinian view of the world, which replaces sanctification of life with sanctification of sex and death\". Coulter subscribes to intelligent design, an antievolution ideology.\n\nCoulter endorsed the period of NSA warrantless surveillance from 2001 to 2007. During a 2011 appearance on Stossel, she said \"PATRIOT Act, fantastic, Gitmo, fantastic, waterboarding, not bad, though torture would've been better.\" She criticized Rand Paul for \"this anti-drone stuff\".\n\nCoulter opposes hate crime laws, calling them \"unconstitutional\". She also stated that \"Hate-crime provisions seem vaguely directed at capturing a sense of cold-bloodedness, but the law can do that without elevating some victims over others.\"\n\nCoulter has criticized former president George W. Bush's immigration proposals, saying they led to \"amnesty\". In a 2007 column, she claimed that the current immigration system was set up to deliberately reduce the percentage of whites in the population. In it, she said:\n\nCoulter strongly opposes the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Regarding illegal immigration, she strongly opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants, and at the 2013 CPAC said she has now become \"a single-issue voter against amnesty\".\n\nIn June 2018, during the controversy caused by the Trump administration family separation policy, Coulter dismissed immigrant children as \"child actors weeping and crying\" and urged Trump not to \"fall for it\".\n\nCoulter opposes same-sex marriage, opposes \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", and supports federal U.S. constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman. She insists that her opposition to same-sex marriage \"wasn't an anti-gay thing\" and that \"It's genuinely a pro-marriage position to oppose gay marriage\". In an April 1, 2015, column, Coulter declared that liberals had \"won the war on gay marriage (by judicial fiat)\".\n\nCoulter also opposes civil unions and privatizing marriage. When addressed with the issue of rights granted by marriage, she said, \"Gays already can visit loved ones in hospitals. They can also visit neighbors, random acquaintances, and total strangers in hospitals—just like everyone else. Gays can also pass on property to whomever they would like\". She disagreed with the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 \"Lawrence v. Texas\" ruling, stating there was no right to sodomy written in the Constitution and that under federalism each individual state and territory would have to repeal their sodomy laws. She stated she opposed banning same-sex sexual intercourse. She also stated that same-sex sexual intercourse was already protected under the Fourth Amendment, which prevents police from going into your home without a search warrant or court order.\n\nIn regard to \"Romer v. Evans\", in which the United Supreme Court overturned Article II, Section 30b of the Colorado Constitution, which prohibited the \"State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination.\", Coulter described the ruling as \"they couldn't refuse to give affirmative action benefits to people who have sodomy\". She also disagreed with repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, stating that it is not an \"anti-gay position; it is a pro-military position\" because \"sexual bonds are disruptive to the military bond\". She also stated that there is \"no proof that all the discharges for homosexuality involve actual homosexuals.\" On April 1, 2015, in a column, she expressed support for Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act and said it was an \"apocryphal\" assertion to claim the Religious Freedom Restoration Act would be used to discriminate against LGBT people. She expressed her support for the \"Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission\" ruling.\n\nCoulter has expressed her opposition to treatment of LGBT people in the countries of Cuba, People's Republic of China, and Saudi Arabia. Coulter opposes publicly funded sex reassignment surgery. She supports the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act and opposes transgender individuals using bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity. She says her opposition to bathroom usage corresponding to gender identity has nothing to do with transgender people, but cisgendered \"child molesters\" who \"now has the right to go into that bathroom.\" She supports banning transgender military service personnel from the United States military.\n\n\nSince the 1990s, Coulter has had many acquaintances in the LGBT community. She considers herself \"the Judy Garland of the Right\". In the last few years, she has attracted many LGBT fans, namely gay men and drag queens.\n\nAt the 2007 CPAC, Coulter said, \"I do want to point out one thing that has been driving me crazy with the media—how they keep describing Mitt Romney's position as being pro-gays, and that's going to upset the right wingers\", and \"Well, you know, screw you! I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against.\" She added, \"I don't know why all gays aren't Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays make a lot of money and they're victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us.\"\n\nIn Coulter's 2007 book \"If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans\", in the chapter \"Gays: No Gay Left Behind!\", she argued that Republican policies were more pro-gay than Democratic policies. Coulter attended the 2010 HomoCon of GOProud, where she commented that same-sex marriage \"is not a civil right\". On February 9, 2011, in a column, she described the national Log Cabin Republicans as \"ridiculous\" and \"not conservative at all\". She did however describe the Texas branch of Log Cabin Republicans, for whom she's been signing books for years, as \" real conservatives\".\n\nAt the 2011 CPAC, during her question-and-answer segment, Coulter was asked about GOProud and the controversy over their inclusion at the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, \"The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think we should let them. I think they should be on our side\", and \"Gays are natural conservatives\". Later that year, she joined advisory board for GOProud. On Logos she told gay Republican Taylor Garrett that \"The gays have got to be pro-life\", and \"As soon as they find the gay gene, guess who the liberal yuppies are gonna start aborting?\"\n\nCoulter initially supported George W. Bush's presidency, but later criticized its approach to immigration. She endorsed Duncan Hunter and later Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary and the 2012 Republican presidential primary and presidential run. In the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, she endorsed Donald Trump. She has since distanced herself from Trump since his election following arguments over immigration policies, calling for his impeachment on September 14, 2017 and saying \"Put a form in Trump, he's dead\". She now describes herself as a \"former Trumper\".\n\nOther candidates Coulter has endorsed include Greg Brannon, 2014 Republican primary candidate for North Carolinia Senator, Paul Nehlen, 2016 Republican primary candidate for Wisconsin's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, Mo Brooks, 2017 Republican primary candidate for Alabama Senator, and Roy Moore, and 2017 Republican candidate for Alabama Senator.\n\nCoulter strongly supports continuing the War on Drugs. However, she has said that, if there were not a welfare state, she \"wouldn't care\" if drugs were legal. She spoke about drugs as a guest on \"Piers Morgan Live\", when she said that marijuana users \"can't perform daily functions\".\n\nCoulter is as an advocate of the white genocide conspiracy theory. She has compared non-white immigration into the United States with genocide, and claiming that \"a genocide\" is occurring against South African farmers, she has said that the Boers are the \"only real refugees\" in South Africa. Regarding domestic politics, \"Vox\" labelled Coulter as one of many providing a voice for \"the 'white genocide' myth\", and the SPLC covered Coulter's remarks that if the demographic changes occurring in the U.S. were being \"legally imposed on any group other than white Americans, it would be called genocide\".\n\nAnn Coulter has described herself as a \"polemicist\" who likes to \"stir up the pot\" and does not \"pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do\". While her political activities in the past have included advising a plaintiff suing President Bill Clinton as well as considering a run for Congress, she mostly serves as a political pundit, sometimes creating controversy ranging from rowdy uprisings at some of the colleges where she speaks to protracted discussions in the media. \"Time\" magazine's John Cloud once observed that Coulter \"likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether America might be better off if women lost the right to vote\". This was in reference to her statement that \"it would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact. In fact, in every presidential election since 1950—except Goldwater in '64—the Republican would have won, if only the men had voted.\" Similarly, in an October 2007 interview with the \"New York Observer\", Coulter said:\nIn addition to questioning whether women's right to vote is a good thing, Coulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015). This is not a viewpoint widely shared by members of the Republican Party.\n\nCoulter first became a public figure shortly before becoming an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter's friend George Conway had been asked to assist Jones' attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about the Paula Jones case for \"Human Events\", was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.\n\nCoulter later stated that she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to settle, if a favorable settlement could be negotiated. From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement. However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would give the impression that Jones was merely interested in extorting money from the President.\n\nDavid Daley, who wrote the interview piece for \"The Hartford Courant\" recounted what followed:\n\nIn his book, Isikoff also reported Coulter as saying: \"We were terrified that Jones would settle. It was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the President.\" After the book came out, Coulter clarified her stated motives, saying:\n\nThe case went to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her original legal team, and it was dismissed via summary judgment. The judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, \"... plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the governor's alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment.\" The ruling was appealed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.\n\nIn October 2000, Jones revealed that she would pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine, saying she wanted to use the money to pay taxes and support her grade-school-aged children, in particular saying, \"I'm wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund.\" Coulter publicly denounced Jones, calling her \"the trailer-park trash they said she was\" (Coulter had earlier chastened Clinton supporters for calling Jones this name), after Clinton's former campaign strategist James Carville had made the widely reported remark, \"Drag a $100 bill through a trailer park, and you'll never know what you'll find\", and called Jones a \"fraud, at least to the extent of pretending to be an honorable and moral person\".\n\nCoulter wrote:\n\nAs the 2008 presidential campaign was getting under way, Coulter drew criticism for statements she made at the 2007 Conservative Political Action Conference about presidential candidate John Edwards:\n\nThe comment was in reference to \"Grey's Anatomy\" star Isaiah Washington's use of the epithet and his subsequent mandatory \"psychological assessment\" imposed by ABC executives. It was widely interpreted as meaning that Coulter had called Edwards a \"faggot\", but Coulter argued that she did not actually do so, while simultaneously indicating she would not have been wrong to say it. Edwards responded on his web site by characterizing Coulter's words as \"un-American and indefensible\", and asking readers to help him \"raise $100,000 in 'Coulter Cash' this week to keep this campaign charging ahead and fight back against the politics of bigotry\". He also called her a \"she-devil\", adding, \"I should not have name-called. But the truth is—forget the names—people like Ann Coulter, they engage in hateful language.\" Coulter's words also drew condemnation from many prominent Republicans and Democrats, as well as groups such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Three advertisers (Verizon, Sallie Mae and Netbank) also pulled their advertisements from Coulter's web site, and several newspapers dropped her column. Coulter responded in an e-mail to the \"New York Times\", \"C'mon, it was a joke. I would never insult gays by suggesting that they are like John Edwards. That would be mean.\" On March 5, 2007, she appeared on \"Hannity and Colmes\" and said, \"Faggot isn't offensive to gays; it has nothing to do with gays. It's a schoolyard taunt meaning 'wuss.'\" Gay rights advocates were not convinced. \"Ann Coulter's use of this anti-gay slur is vile and unacceptable,\" said Neil G. Giuliano, president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, \"and the applause from her audience is an important reminder that Coulter's ugly brand of bigotry is at the root of the discriminatory policies being promoted at this gathering.\" A spokesman for Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate, called Coulter's comments \"wildly inappropriate\".\n\nAs the campaign waged on, she continued to insert her commentary regarding the candidates, both Democrats and Republicans. In a June 2007 interview, Coulter named Duncan Hunter as her choice for the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination, highlighting his views on immigration and specifically his anti-abortion credentials, saying \"[t]his is a winning issue for us, protecting little babies\". On January 16, 2008, Coulter began endorsing Governor Mitt Romney as her choice for the 2008 Republican nomination, saying he is \"manifestly the best candidate\" (contrasting Romney with Republican candidates John McCain, Mike Huckabee, and Rudy Giuliani). By contrast, Coulter was critical of eventual Republican nominee John McCain. On the January 31, 2008, broadcast of \"Hannity and Colmes\", Coulter claimed that if McCain won the Republican nomination for president, she would support and campaign for Hillary Clinton, stating, \"[Clinton] is more conservative than McCain.\"\n\nRegarding then-presidential-candidate Barack Obama in an April 2, 2008, column, she characterized his book \"Dreams from My Father\" as a \"dimestore \"Mein Kampf\". Coulter writes, \"He says the reason black people keep to themselves is that it's 'easier than spending all your time mad or trying to guess whatever it was that white folks were thinking about you.' Here's a little inside scoop about white people: We're not thinking about you. Especially WASPs. We think everybody is inferior, and we are perfectly charming about it.\"\n\nIn March 2010, Coulter announced that she would be embarking on a speaking tour of three Canadian universities, The University of Western Ontario, the University of Ottawa and the University of Calgary. The tour was organized by the International Free Press Society.\n\nOn the eve of Coulter's first speech at the University of Western Ontario, an e-mail to Coulter from François Houle, provost of the University of Ottawa, was leaked to the media. The e-mail warned that \"promoting hatred against any identifiable group would not only be considered inappropriate, but could in fact lead to criminal charges.\" Coulter released a public statement alleging that by sending her the e-mail, Houle was promoting hatred against conservatives. During her speech at the University of Western Ontario, she told a Muslim student to \"take a camel\", in response to the student's question about previous comments by Coulter that Muslims should not be allowed on airplanes.\n\nOn March 22, the University of Ottawa made international news when liberal protesters conspired to prevent Coulter from speaking. The event was canceled in spite of a massive security presence; Alain Boucher of the Ottawa Police Service said there were ten officers visible at the scene, \"plus other resources\" nearby. Boucher alleged that Coulter's security team decided to call off the event, saying, \"We gave her options,\" including, he said, to \"find a bigger venue.\" But \"they opted to cancel ... It's not up to the Ottawa police to make that decision.\" Boucher claimed there were no arrests. CTV News reported, \"It was a disaster in terms of just organization, which is probably one of the reasons why it was cancelled\", citing the small number of students tasked with confirming who had signed up to attend Coulter's talk.\n\nEvent organizer and conservative activist Ezra Levant blamed the protest on the letter sent to Coulter by Houle. After the cancellation, Coulter called the University of Ottawa \"bush league\", stating:\n\nOn September 14, 2001, three days after the September 11 attacks (in which her friend Barbara Olson had been killed), Coulter wrote in her column:\nThis comment resulted in Coulter's being fired as a columnist by the \"National Review\", which she subsequently referred to as \"squeamish girly-boys\". Responding to this comment, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations remarked in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" that before September 11, Coulter \"would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues\", but \"now it's accepted as legitimate commentary\".\n\nOne day after the attacks (when death toll estimates were higher than later), Coulter asserted that only Muslims could have been behind the attacks:\nCoulter was highly critical in 2002 of the U.S. Department of Transportation and especially its then-secretary Norman Mineta. Her many criticisms include their refusal to use racial profiling as a component of airport screening. After a group of Muslims was expelled from a US Airways flight when other passengers expressed concern, sparking a call for Muslims to boycott the airline because of the ejection from a flight of six imams, Coulter wrote:\nCoulter also cited the 2002 Senate testimony of FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley, who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors for refusing to authorize a search warrant for 9-11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They knew that he was a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the French Intelligence Service had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for Osama bin Laden she asserted \"any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'\" so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England\". Coulter says the poll was \"by \"The Daily Telegraph\"\", actually it was by Sunrise, an \"Asian\" (therefore an Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because \"FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling\", they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. \"The FBI allowed thousands of Americans to be slaughtered on the altar of political correctness. What more do liberals want?\"\n\nCoulter wrote in another column that she had reviewed the civil rights lawsuits against certain airlines to determine which of them had subjected Arabs to the most \"egregious discrimination\" so that she could fly only that airline. She also said that the airline should be bragging instead of denying any of the charges of discrimination brought against them. In an interview with \"The Guardian\" she said, \"I think airlines ought to start advertising: 'We have the most civil rights lawsuits brought against us by Arabs.'\" When the interviewer, Jonathan Freedland, replied by asking what Muslims would do for travel, she responded, \"They could use flying carpets.\"\n\nOne comment that drew criticism from the blogosphere, as well as fellow conservatives, was made during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2006, where she said, referring to the prospect of a nuclear-equipped Iran, \"What if they start having one of these bipolar episodes with nuclear weapons? I think our motto should be, post-9-11: Raghead talks tough, raghead faces consequences.\" Coulter had previously written a nearly identical passage in her syndicated column: \"I believe our motto should be, after 9/11: Jihad monkey talks tough; jihad monkey takes the consequences. Sorry, I realize that's offensive. How about 'camel jockey'? What? Now what'd I say? Boy, you tent merchants sure are touchy. Grow up, would you?\"\n\nIn October 2007, Coulter made further remarks about Arabs—this time, Iraqis—when she stated in an interview with \"The New York Observer\":\nIn a May 2007 article looking back at the life of then recently deceased evangelical Reverend Jerry Falwell, Coulter commented on his (later retracted) statement after the 9/11 attacks that \"the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America ... helped this happen.\" In her article, Coulter stated that she disagreed with Falwell's statement, \"because Falwell neglected to specifically include Teddy Kennedy and 'the Reverend' Barry Lynn\".\n\nIn October 2007, Coulter participated in David Horowitz' \"Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week\", remarking in a speech at the University of Southern California, \"The fact of Islamo-Fascism is indisputable. I find it tedious to detail the savagery of the enemy ... I want to kill them. Why don't Democrats?\"\n\nIn the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, Coulter told \"Hannity\" host Sean Hannity that the wife of bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev should be jailed for wearing a hijab. Coulter continued by saying \"Assimilating immigrants into our culture isn't really working. They're assimilating us into their culture.\"\n\nIn the wake of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting in Paris, Coulter said France \"needs to move to the next step\" in dealing with terror. Coulter said of some immigrants:\n\nCoulter has attributed American gun violence in America to black and Muslim American men, stating that the epidemic of gun-related deaths is \"not a gun problem, it's a demographic problem.\"\n\nWhen asked about the financial crisis in the 2000s, Coulter claimed one reason for it was that \"they gave your mortgage to a less qualified minority\".\n\nOn March 16, 2011, discussing the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, Coulter, citing research into radiation hormesis, wrote that there was \"burgeoning evidence that excess radiation operates as a sort of cancer vaccine.\" Her comments were criticized by figures across the political spectrum, from Fox News' Bill O'Reilly (who told Coulter, \"You have to be responsible ... in something like this, you gotta get the folks out of there, and you have to report worst-case scenarios\") to MSNBC's Ed Schulz (who stated that \"You would laugh at her if she wasn't making light of a terrible tragedy.\").\n\nDuring the Republican Party presidential primaries, she supported Mitt Romney over former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. On an interview during \"The O'Reilly Factor\" on Fox News, she compared Newt Gingrich's attacks on the media to Jesse Jackson \"accusing people of racism\". On her website, she posted a column titled, \"Re-elect Obama: Vote Newt!\" arguing that if Newt Gingrich won the Republican nomination, Barack Obama would win re-election. When asked to respond about her criticism, Newt Gingrich dismissed them as \"the old order\" and cited recent polls showing him ahead of Mitt Romney.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, following a presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Coulter published the following tweet from her official Twitter account: \"I highly approve of Romney's decision to be kind and gentle to the retard\", drawing stiff criticism for her use of a word which some find offensive to describe the president of the United States. The Special Olympics condemned Coulter in a tweet shortly after Coulter's. On \"The Alan Colmes Show\", Coulter stated that she does not regret her use of the word, saying, Retard' had been used colloquially to just mean 'loser' for 30 years. But no, these aggressive victims have to come out and tell you what words to use.\"\n\nAfter the election, in which Barack Obama won, Ann Coulter wrote a column titled \"Romney Was Not the Problem\". In it she argued against the idea that Mitt Romney lost because he failed to get his message across. She also said that Mitt Romney lost because he was running against an incumbent.\n\nIn March 2013, Coulter was one of the keynote speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where she made references to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's weight (\"CPAC had to cut back on its speakers this year about 300 pounds\") and progressive activist Sandra Fluke's hairdo. (Coulter quipped that Fluke didn't need birth control pills because \"that haircut is birth control enough\".) Coulter advocated against a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants because such new citizens would never vote for Republican candidates: \"If amnesty goes through, America becomes California and no Republican will ever win another election.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2015, Coulter appeared on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" and said that of all the declared Republican primary candidates, Donald Trump had the best chance of winning the general election, prompting the studio audience to laugh in disbelief. Coulter later endorsed Donald Trump in the general election, which he went on to win.\n\nCoulter has been a contributor to VDARE since 2006.\n\nVDARE is a right wing website and blog founded by anti-immigration activist and paleo-conservative Peter Brimelow. VDARE is considered controversial because of its alleged ties to white supremacist rhetoric and support of scientific racism and white nationalism.\n\nIn April 2017, \"The New York Times\" reported that the University of California, Berkeley had cancelled Ann Coulter's speech scheduled for April 27. A university spokesman said they had not discussed a specific date with her and only learned about it by reading news reports. The university administrators cited threats of violence and offered to accommodate her on a later date. Coulter said she saw no way forward, telling \"The New York Times\", \"It's a sad day for free speech.\" Both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren publicly called for the university to defend her right to free speech.\n\nCoulter was reportedly invited by UC Berkeley student organization Berkeley Patriot to participate in an event headed by Milo Yiannopoulos, scheduled for September 24–27. Coulter never promoted her participation and after the event was cancelled noted that her speakers bureau agency had never contracted for her to appear at the event.\n\nCoulter was accused of anti-semitism in an October 8, 2007, interview with Donny Deutsch on \"The Big Idea\". During the interview, Coulter stated that the United States is a Christian nation, and said that she wants \"Jews to be perfected, as they say\" (referring to them being converted to Christianity). Deutsch, a practicing Jew, implied that this was an anti-semitic remark, but Coulter said she didn't consider it to be a hateful comment. Coulter's comments on the show were condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee and Bradley Burston, and the National Jewish Democratic Council asked media outlets to cease inviting Coulter as a guest commentator. Talk show host Dennis Prager, while disagreeing with her comments, said that they were not \"anti-semitic\", noting, \"There is nothing in what Ann Coulter said to a Jewish interviewer on CNBC that indicates she hates Jews or wishes them ill, or does damage to the Jewish people or the Jewish state. And if none of those criteria is present, how can someone be labeled anti-Semitic?\" Conservative activist David Horowitz also defended Coulter against the allegation.\n\nCoulter in September 2015 tweeted in response to multiple Republican candidates' references to Israel during a Presidential debate, \"How many f—ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?\" The Anti-Defamation League referred to the tweets as \"ugly, spiteful and anti-Semitic\". In response to accusations of anti-Semitism, she tweeted \"I like the Jews, I like fetuses, I like Reagan. Didn't need to hear applause lines about them all night.\"\n\nIn October 2001, Coulter was accused of plagiarism in her 1998 book \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors\" by Michael Chapman, a columnist for the journal \"Human Events\" who claims that passages were taken from a supplement he wrote for the journal in 1997 titled \"A Case for Impeachment\".\n\nOn the July 5, 2006, episode of \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\" on MSNBC, guest John Barrie, the CEO of iParadigms, offered his professional opinion that Coulter plagiarized in her book \"Godless\" as well as in her columns over the previous year. Barrie ran \"Godless\" through iThenticate, his company's machine which is able to scan works and compare them to existing texts. He points to a 25 word section of the text that exactly matches a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and a 33 word section almost duplicating a 1999 article from the \"Portland Press\" as some examples of evidence.\n\nMedia Matters for America has appealed to Random House publishing to further investigate Coulter's work. The syndicator of her columns cleared her of the plagiarism charges. Universal Press Syndicate and Crown Books also defended Coulter against the charges.\nColumnist Bill Nemitz from the \"Portland Press Herald\" accused Coulter of plagiarizing a very specific sentence from his newspaper in her book \"Godless\", but he also acknowledged that one sentence is insufficient grounds for filing suit.\n\nSometimes referred to as an \"Internet queen\", Coulter has a high public profile.\n\nShe rejects \"the academic convention of euphemism and circumlocution\", and is claimed to play to misogyny in order to further her goals; she \"dominates without threatening (at least not straight men)\". Feminist critics also reject Coulter's opinion that the gains made by women have gone so far as to create an anti-male society and her call for women to be rejected from the military because they are more vicious than men. Like the anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly, Coulter uses traditionally masculine rhetoric as reasoning for the need for traditional gender roles, and she carries this idea of feminized dependency into her governmental policies, according to feminist critics.\n\nCoulter's maternal line in the United States extends back to the American Revolutionary War and earlier, while her father's ancestors are Irish and German immigrants who arrived in the United States in the mid-19th century. She has two older brothers: James, an accountant, and John, an attorney. Coulter has been engaged several times, but she has never married and has no children. She has dated \"Spin\" founder and publisher Bob Guccione, Jr., and conservative writer Dinesh D'Souza. In October 2007, she began dating Andrew Stein, the former president of the New York City Council, a liberal Democrat. When asked about the relationship, Stein told the \"New York Post\", \"She's attacked a lot of my friends, but what can I say, opposites attract!\" On January 7, 2008, however, Stein told the \"New York Post\" that the relationship was over, citing irreconcilable differences. Kellyanne Conway, who refers to Coulter as a friend, told \"New York\" magazine in 2017 that Coulter \"started dating her security guard probably ten years ago because she couldn't see anybody else\".\n\nCoulter owns a house, bought in 2005, in Palm Beach, Florida, a condominium in Manhattan, and an apartment in Los Angeles. She votes in Palm Beach and is not registered to do so in New York or California. She is a fan of several jam bands, such as the Grateful Dead, the Dave Matthews Band, and Phish. Some of her favorite books include the Bible, \"Mere Christianity\", \"Wuthering Heights\", \"Anna Karenina\", true crime stories about serial killers, and anything by Dave Barry.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "744143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=744143", "title": "Bank vault", "text": "Bank vault\n\nA bank vault is a secure space where money, valuables, records, and documents are stored. It is intended to protect their contents from theft, unauthorized use, fire, natural disasters, and other threats, much like a safe. Unlike safes, vaults are an integral part of the building within which they are built, using armored walls and a tightly fashioned door closed with a complex lock.\n\nHistorically, strongrooms were built in the basement of a bank where the ceilings were vaulted, hence the name. Modern bank vaults typically contain many safe deposit boxes, as well as places for teller cash drawers, and other valuable assets of the bank or its customers. They are also common in other buildings where valuables are kept such as post offices, grand hotels, rare book libraries and certain government ministries.\n\nVault technology developed in a type of arms race with bank robbers. As burglars came up with new ways to break into vaults, vault makers found new ways to foil them. Modern vaults may be armed with a wide array of alarms and anti-theft devices. Some nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century vaults were built so well that today they are difficult to destroy. These older vaults were typically made with steel-reinforced concrete. The walls were usually at least 1 ft (0.3 m) thick, and the door itself was typically 3.5 ft (1.1 m) thick. Total weight ran into the hundreds of tons (see the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland). Today vaults are made with thinner, lighter materials that, while still secure, are easier to dismantle than their earlier counterparts.\n\nThe need for secure storage stretches far back in time. The earliest known locks were made by the Egyptians. Ancient Romans used a more sophisticated locking system, called warded locks. Warded locks had special notches and grooves that made picking them more difficult. Lock technology advanced independently in ancient India, Russia, and China, where the combination lock is thought to have originated. In the United States, most banks relied on small iron safes fitted with a key lock up until the middle of the nineteenth century. After the Gold Rush of 1849, unsuccessful prospectors turned to robbing banks. The prospectors would often break into the bank using a pickax and hammer. The safe was usually small enough that the thief could get it out a window, and take it to a secluded spot to break it open.\n\nBanks demanded more protection and safe makers responded by designing larger, heavier safes. Safes with a key lock were still vulnerable through the key hole, and bank robbers soon learned to blast off the door by pouring explosives in this opening. In 1861, inventor Linus Yale Jr. introduced the modern combination lock. Bankers quickly adopted Yale's lock for their safes, but bank robbers came up with several ways to get past the new invention. It was possible to use force to punch the combination lock through the door. Other experienced burglars learned to drill holes into the lock case and use mirrors to view the slots in the combination wheels inside the mechanism. A more direct approach was to simply kidnap the bank manager and force him to reveal the combination.\n\nAfter the inventions of the combination lock, James Sargent—an employee of Yale—developed the \"theft proof lock.\" This was a combination lock that worked on a timer. The vault or safe door could only be opened after a set number of hours had passed, thus a kidnapped bank employee could not open the lock in the middle of the night even under force. Time locks became widespread at banks in the 1870s. This reduced the kidnappings, but set bank robbers to work again at prying or blasting open vaults. Thieves developed tools for forcing open a tiny crack between the vault door and frame. As the crack widened, the thieves levered the door open or poured in gunpowder and blasted it off. Vault makers responded with a series of stair-stepped grooves in the door frame so the door could not be levered open. But these grooves proved ideal for a new weapon: liquid nitroglycerin. Professional bank robbers learned to boil dynamite in a kettle of water and skim the nitroglycerin off the top. They could drip this volatile liquid into the door grooves and destroy the door. Vault makers subsequently redesigned their doors so they closed with a thick, smooth, tapered plug. The plug fit so tightly that there was no room for the nitroglycerin.\n\nBy the 1920s, most banks avoided using safes and instead turned to gigantic, heavy vaults with walls and doors several feet thick. These were meant to withstand not only robbers but also angry mobs and natural disasters. Despite the new security measures, these vaults were still vulnerable to yet another new invention, the cutting torch. Burning oxygen and acetylene gas at about , the torch could easily cut through steel. It was in use as early as 1907, but became widespread with World War I. Robbers used cutting torches in over 200 bank robberies in 1924 alone. Manufacturers learned to sandwich a copper alloy into vault doors. If heated, the high thermal conductivity of copper dissipates the heat to prevent melting or burning. After this design improvement, bank burglaries fell off and were far less common at the end of the 1920s than at the beginning of the decade.\n\nTechnology continues in the race with bank robbers, coming up with new devices such as heat sensors, motion detectors, and alarms. Bank robbers have in turn developed even more technological tools to find ways around these systems. Although the number of bank robberies has been cut dramatically, they are still attempted.\n\nMaterials used in vaults and vault doors have changed as well. The earlier vaults had steel doors, but because these could easily be cut by torches, different materials were tried. Massive cast iron doors had more resistance to acetylene torches than steel. The modern preferred vault door material is the same concrete as used in the vault wall panels. It is usually clad in steel for cosmetic reasons.\n\nBank vaults are built as custom orders. The vault is usually the first aspect of a new bank building to be designed and built. The manufacturing process begins with the design of the vault, and the rest of the bank is built around it. The vault manufacturer consults with the customer to determine factors such as the total vault size, desired shape, and location of the door. After the customer signs off on the design, the manufacturer configures the equipment to make the vault panels and door. The customer usually orders the vault to be delivered and installed. That is, the vault manufacturer not only makes the vault parts, but brings the parts to the construction site and puts them together.\n\nBank vaults are typically made with steel-reinforced concrete. This material was not substantially different from that used in construction work. It relied on its immense thickness for strength. An ordinary vault from the middle of the 20th century might have been 18 in (45.72 cm) thick and was quite heavy and difficult to remove or remodel around. Modern bank vaults are now typically made of modular concrete panels using a special proprietary blend of concrete and additives for extreme strength. The concrete has been engineered for maximum crush resistance. A panel of this material, though only 3 in (7.62 cm) thick, may be up to 10 times as strong as an 18 in-thick (45.72-cm) panel of regular formula concrete.\n\nThere are at least two public examples of vaults withstanding a nuclear blast. The most famous is the Teikoku Bank in Hiroshima whose two Mosler Safe Company vaults survived the atomic blast with all contents intact. The bank manager wrote a congratulatory note to Mosler. A second is a vault at the Nevada National Security Site (formerly the Nevada Test Site) in which an above ground Mosler vault was one of many structures specifically constructed to be exposed to an atomic blast.\n\nThe wall panels are molded first using a special reinforced concrete mix. In addition to the usual cement powder, stone, etc., additional materials such as metal shavings or abrasive materials may be added to resist drilling penetration of the slab. Unlike regular concrete used in construction, the concrete for bank vaults is so thick that it cannot be poured. The consistency of concrete is measured by its \"slump\". Vault concrete has zero slump. It also sets very quickly, curing in only six to 12 hours, instead of the three to four days needed for most concrete.\n\nThe vault door is also molded of special concrete used to make the panels, but it can be made in several ways. The door mold differs from the panel molds because there is a hole for the lock and the door will be clad in stainless steel. Some manufacturers use the steel cladding as the mold and pour the concrete directly into it. Other manufacturers use a regular mold and screw the steel on after the panel is dry.\n\nRound vault doors were popular in the early 20th century and are iconic images for a bank's high security. They fell out of favor due to manufacturing complexities, maintenance issues (door sag due to weight) and cost, but a few examples are still available.\n\nA day gate is a second door inside the main vault door frame used for limited vault protection while the main door is open. It is often made of open metal mesh or glass and is intended to keep a casual visitor out rather than to provide true security.\n\nA vault door, much like the smaller burglary safe door, is secured with numerous massive metal bolts (cylinders) extending from the door into the surrounding frame. Holding those bolts in place is some sort of lock. The lock is invariably mounted on the inside (behind) of the difficult to penetrate door and is usually very modest in size and strength, but very difficult to gain access to from the outside. There are many types of lock mechanisms in use:\n\n\nQuality control for much of the world's vault industry is overseen by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL), in Northbrook, Illinois. Until 1991, the United States government also regulated the vault industry. The government set minimum standards for the thickness of vault walls, but advances in concrete technology made thickness an arbitrary measure of strength. Thin panels of new materials were far stronger than the thicker, poured concrete walls. Now the effectiveness of the vault is measured by how well it performs against a mock break-in. Manufacturers also do their own testing designing a new product to make sure it is likely to succeed in UL trials. Key points include:\n\nAs with the US, Europe has agreed a series of test standards to assure a common view of penetrative resistance to forcible attack. The testing regime is covered under the auspices of Euronorm 1143-1:2012 (also known as BS EN 1143-1: 2012), which can be purchased from approved European standards agencies. \n\nKey points include:\n\nThe manufacturing process itself has no unusual waste or byproducts, but getting rid of old bank vaults can be a problem. Newer, modular bank vaults can be moved if a bank closes or relocates. They can also be enlarged if the bank's needs change. Older bank vaults are quite difficult to demolish. If an old bank building is to be renovated for another use, in most cases a specialty contractor has to be called in to demolish the vault. A vault's demolition requires massive wrecking equipment and may take months of work at a large expense. At least one company in the United States refurbishes old vault doors that are then resold.\n\nIn some cases, the new owner of a former bank building will opt to use the vault. There are cases where, for example, a bank building was renovated into a pub, which then used the vault as a secure storeroom for its liquor supply.\n\nBank vault technology changed rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s with the development of improved concrete material. Bank burglaries are also no longer the substantial problem they were in the late nineteenth century up through the 1930s, but vault makers continue to alter their products to counter new break-in methods.\n\nAn issue in the twenty-first century is the thermal lance. Burning iron rods in pure oxygen ignited by an oxyacetylene torch, it can produce temperatures of 6,600–8,000 °F (3,650–4,430 °C). The thermal lance user bores a series of small holes that can eventually be linked to form a gap. Vault manufacturers work closely with the banking industry and law enforcement in order to keep up with such advances in burglary.\n\n\n"}

It existed in the Second Republic era from 1928 to 1939 and was reestablished in the modern-day Third Republic in 1990, going into operation the following year. During the communist era lasting from 1945 to 1989, the role of the border guard was carried out by the Border Protection Troops (\"Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza\").\n\nThe Straż Graniczna was founded in 1928. During the times of the Second Polish Republic, it was responsible for northern, western and southern border of Poland (with Germany, Free City of Gdańsk, sea border, Czechoslovakia and Romania). Eastern border, often raided by military bands supported by Soviet Union was under the jurisdiction of a separate, military formation (Border Protection Corps, \"Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza\" - KOP).\n\nResponsibilities of Straż Graniczna included:\n\nBorder Guard was organized in a military style, with uniformed and armed agents. It was controlled by the Ministry of Treasury, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Ministry of Military Affairs. The highest level of organizational structure of the agency was Main Headquarters (\"Komenda Glowna\"), based in Warsaw. It was followed by Regional Inspectorates, Border Inspectorates, stations and posts. It carried out actions through patrols, manning border checkpoints, tracking, rouses and intelligence work. It had its own river and sea flotilla, intelligence academy, and the Main School of Border Guard (\"Centralna Szkola Strazy Granicznej\"), which was located firstly in Gora Kalwaria (until 1928), then in Rawa Ruska. The school had a department of training of guard dogs, also located in Rawa Ruska.\n\nEach station of the agency was responsible for some 20 to 25 kilometers of the borderline. The stations oversaw posts of the first line and posts of the second line. In 1938, there were 129 stations of the Border Guard, 419 posts of the first line (these were located right along the border), and 212 posts of the second line (located in the interior of the country, right behind posts of the first line).\n\n\nIn late 1938 and early 1939, following changes of borders of some Eastern European countries, the Border Guard took over protection of the boundary with Lithuania, while Border Defence Corps moved some of its units to the newly established border with Hungary. Furthermore, every station of the Border Guard was strengthened with a platoon of the Polish Army.\n\nMembers of Straż Graniczna, under General Walerian Czuma, participated in the Second World War, fighting in the Polish Army during the invasion of Poland.\n\nDuring the period of the People's Republic of Poland, the role of the border guards was carried out by the military formation of Border Protection Troops (\"Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza\"), being a part of the Polish People's Army and reporting directly to the Ministry of Interior, formerly under the Ministry of National Defense (from 1945-1949 and again from 1965 to 1970 and 1972), just as its 2nd Republic predecessors were assigned.\n\nStraż Graniczna has been reestablished in the Third Polish Republic as a civil, police-type service, with the act of 12 October 1990 and began operations on 16 May 1991. It considers itself the successor to the Second Polish Republic formations of the Straż Graniczna and Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza (plus the military heritage of the Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza of the People's Republic), and thus is one of the only police styled forces to use military style ranks (the Government Protection Bureau, Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego and the Służba Więzienna also use them as well).\n\nFrom 1 May 2004, the day Poland became a member of the European Union, Straż Graniczna performs its responsibility to guard and protect both the Polish and EU borders.\n\n\n\n"}

The organisation evolved from the then-named Campaign Against Foreign Control in New Zealand which began in the early 1970s.\n\nThe organisation was founded by Owen Wilkes.\n\nOne of the main planks of CAFCA is opposition against foreign acquisition of New Zealand assets. In this regard, they criticise the free-market policies which have made such foreign acquisition possible, and the fact that the relevant regulatory authorities (such as the Overseas Investment Office) are amongst the weakest government branches, 'rubber-stamping' investment instead of regulating it.\n\nDirect ownership of New Zealand companies by foreign parties increased from $9.7 billion in 1989 to $83 billion in 2007 (an over 700% increase), while 41% of the New Zealand sharemarket valuation is now overseas-owned, compared to 19% in 1989. Around 7% of all New Zealand agriculturally productive land is also foreign-owned. CAFCA considers that the effect of such takeovers has generally been negative in terms of jobs and wages.\n\nCAFCA are one of the organisers of the Roger Award For The Worst Transnational Corporation operating in New Zealand.\n\n"}
{"id": "3596606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3596606", "title": "Captain-major", "text": "Captain-major\n\nCaptain-major is the English rendering of the Portuguese \"Capitão-mor\", or the \"Capitães dos Donatários\" (\"Captains of the Donataries\"), the colonial officials, placed in charge of a Captaincy (), deemed not (yet) important enough to have its own colonial Governor.\n\nThe term also applied as the rank title of the field officer that was in charge of a captaincy (group of companies) of the \"Ordenanças\", the Portuguese territorial militia that existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries.\n\nDue to the impossibility of exercising direct control and sovereignty over overseas territories, the captain-major was the channel by which the monarch could delegate his powers, with certain restrictions, under the responsibility of peoples he felt he could confide. The \"Donatário\" could administer, in the sovereign's name, the lands for which he was assigned, with all the regalia, rights and obligations, with the exception of certain limits, including military authority over soldiers and detachments of the crown, or the administration of justice.\n\nThe Captains were agents named by the Dontário, and after 1495, by the Crown, to a lifetime title that was passed down by the \"legitimate male heirs\". As administrators, the Captains enjoyed various judicial and economic privileges that provided an incentive to settle and develop their captaincies. They had the authority to administer sentences, with the exception of those involving penalties of death or mutilation. Economically, they had the exclusive authority to mill, bake bread and sell salt, in addition to their entitlement to receive rent paid to the King for lands, fees and taxes due. In addition, they could receive a tithe (the tenth portion) paid to the captaincy directly. In addition to the regalia of office, the captains-major would hold title to the best parcels of lands and be able to contract renters to the donatárias (lands of the Donatários), in the name of the crown. Many of the donatários were hereditary, with a few exceptions, referred in the Salic Laws () of the time; these laws regulated all aspects of life, including crime, taxation, indemnity, and female inheritance. The Captains were less restricted to these conditions.\n\nYet, many of these captains were selected as part of a consolidation of relationships between the Donatários and their vassals. This subjective process usually involved close associations with the royal family or confidants of the Crown: a feudal meritocracy of vassals. This could result from rendering service during the overseas expansion or resulting from some heroism which may have been rewarded with a title. The monarch surrounded himself with \"trustworthy\" men who were existed within a web of relationships, forming a restricted circle of individuals. In some cases precedents were superseded in favour of people they could trust, including setting aside the laws of male inheritance in favour of a daughter, for example (as with the case of the daughter of Jácome de Bruges). Yet, most had to prove themselves, as was the case with Álvaro de Ornelas (captain of Pico), who lost his captaincy due to \"inefficiency\" in its settlement.\n\nThe captaincy system was built on confidence and good faith between the captain and donatário, owing to the distance between each. This weakened the Donatário's control over the officials, resulting in a disparity between actual and perceived function. Some were either incompetent in their roles, power-hungry or just absent. In some cases the inhabitants of certain possessions were often subject to irregularities resulting from judicial or fiscal issues. Some captains appointed overseers, \"ouvidores\" (\"auditors\") to represent them who were unqualified to respond to the issues of their masters.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of some of the captaincies and their first Donatary-Captains:\n\nThere were three captaincies in the archipelago of Madeira, associated with the three principal discoverers of the islands:\n\nFollowing their discovery, Gonçalo Velho Cabral became the first Donatary-Captain of the islands, beginning with the island of Santa Maria, but later including the island of São Miguel when it was discovered. This captaincy, which lasted from 1439 to 1461, was described in 1460 by Henry the Navigator in a letter to Cabral as \"Capitão por mim em minhas ilhas de Santa Maria e São Miguel dos Açores\" (\"Captain for Me in My Islands of Santa Maria and São Miguel in the Azores\"). The progressive discovery of the islands of the archipelago resulted in new captaincies; in total, there have been thirteen unique captaincies in Azores since their discovery:\n\n\n\n\nSuch was the case in the following places:\n(\"see also above for those who later got captains-majors\"):\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The period of compulsory service was at least 18 months, and adult males between 18 and 26 were eligible. Service in the National People's Army (in German abbreviated as NVA), the paramilitary forces of the People's Police and the motorised rifles regiment of the Ministry for State Security fulfilled this service obligation. (In the Federal Republic of Germany, conscription was introduced in 1958.)\n\nIn the first year, despite the possibility of imprisonment or worse, 231 draftees refused to serve. Most were members of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The number increased to 287 when the second year's cohort was conscripted.\n\nThe GDR's socialist government viewed conscientious objectors as enemies of the state, and all 287 were arrested. When the country's influential Protestant Church protested, the government decided to provide a legal means for conscientious objectors to serve as non-combatants in the armed forces. It thus became the only socialist state in history to provide a non-combat alternative for pacifist citizens.\n\nOn 16 September 1964 the GDR government announced the formation of non-combat construction units, or \"Baueinheiten,\" to provide an alternative for conscripts who could not bear arms because of a personal objection to military service. The \"Bausoldaten\" lived in barracks and were subject to military discipline, but did not bear arms or participate in combat training. Their grey uniforms resembled those of the regular infantry with the symbol of a spade on their shoulder boards which had pale green edges. Normally, construction units were isolated from soldiers in regular units to prevent the spread of pacifist ideas.\n\nThough outwardly peaceful in appearance, soldiers in \"Baueinheiten\" were obliged to make a promise of loyalty in which they stated that they would \"fight against all enemies and obey their superiors unconditionally\", though this was replaced by an oath to \"increase defense readiness\" in the 1980s. \n\nThey performed military construction and rear-guard services, repaired tanks and military equipment, as well as some tasks in the industrial and social-service sectors, were subject to military law and disciplinary regulations, were commanded by NVA officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs), and received engineer training and political education. \n\nIn 1983, of the 230,000 soldiers in the NVA, 0.6 percent—about 1,400—were allowed to serve in the construction units. According to one report, however, the number of conscripts electing such service was so high that draft officials claimed the plan was over fulfilled, and in 1983 young East Germans unwilling to bear arms had to join the regular troops. In February 1983, in Schwerin, Dresden, and East Berlin, five young men were sentenced to eighteen months in prison because they tried to exercise their right to join the construction units. Service in the construction troops did, however, have certain consequences.\n\nIn the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former construction soldiers were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere. They were not allowed to enter certain professions or to pursue a university education. In 1984, however, SED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Defense Minister Army General Heinz Hoffmann asserted that construction soldiers no longer suffered such discrimination; like others who had completed their military service, they were given preference in the university admission process.\n\nIn 1968 Warsaw Pact states, with the tacit support but not direct involvement of East Germany, invaded Czechoslovakia and deposed Alexander Dubček in what came to be known as the Prague Spring.\n\nThis invasion appalled people all over the world, but especially East Germans, many of whom felt guilty for letting their government support it. Following the Prague Spring, many young East German men refused to serve even in \"Baueinheiten\", as they felt that something akin to another Prague Spring could be just around the corner, and they wished to play no part in it.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1985, 71,000 East Germans were expelled from the country for participation in civil rights movements. Many people who wished to emigrate from East Germany would do things such as refuse to serve in the NVA to be put on the \"black list\" and expelled.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the vast majority of conscientious objectors was composed of people who wished to emigrate.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1995 by Tom Cross, Robert Costner, Chris Farris, and Robbie Honerkamp, primarily in response to the Communications Decency Act. \n\nOne of the early causes which the organization championed, was reaction to Georgia House Bill 1630, an attempt to ban anonymous speech on the Internet in Georgia. Though the bill was passed into law in the legislature, after a lawsuit from the EFGA, the ACLU, and the national Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the law was deemed unconstitutional.\n\nElectronic Frontiers Georgia began from a suggestion of Stanton McCandlish (mech) of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in email conversations with Atlanta businessman and computer store owner Robert Costner. Robert had expressed concern over a Philip Elmer DeWitt's Time Magazine article claiming pornography was pervasive on the internet. Robert was angered because on its face Robert thought the article was bogus. While DeWitt and Time later apologized for the article, this was a precursor to the Communications Decency Act.\n\nSeeking suitable partners to provide in-kind donations Robert approached the Georgia ACLU for meeting space, and Comstar, an internet hosting company, for rackspace for an internet server from Robert's computer store.\n\nOn local newsgroups Robert announced a public meeting to be held at the ACLU's downtown offices. From this, and similar meetings, other local Georgia residents joined in and became a part of Electronic Frontiers Georgia. Most notably were Tom Cross, Chris Farris, and Robbie Honerkamp. Tom, Chris, and Robbie were instrumental in helping found the organization with Robert. At a later point Andy Dustman and Scott M. Jones joined the organization in significant capacities.\n\nEFGA was founded with the mission to explore the intersection of public policy and technology.\n\nThough often confused with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), EFGA is a separate organization. EFF is the premier civil liberties organization in the online world. A program of EFF was to foster the creation of local activism organizations that while had similar goals and names, were not chapters of EFF, but separate organizations. While seeding these organizations EFF would ask that the Electronic Frontier (singular) name not be used, but that rather the local independent organization use the plural version, Electronic Frontiers. EFF's Stanton McCandlish helped seed these organizations in several states, not just Georgia. The two groups have worked together on many projects.\n\nShari Steele, Executive Director of EFF was even on the same stage as Robert Costner, Executive Director of EFGA for a speaking engagement at Georgia Perimeter College in Clarkston, Georgia. EFF accepted an invitation to participate in the HB1630 lawsuit, and EFGA has signed onto several \"amicus\" briefs along with EFF. EFF is a regular participant in EFGA's Electronic Frontiers Forums.\n\nElectronic Frontiers Georgia has led various projects over the last 20+ years. These include the HB1630 lawsuit concerning internet anonymity, the Georgia Cracker anonymous remailer, Encryption legislation and the S.A.F.E. bill (1997), the DC copyright summit (1996) challenging the Software Publisher's Association's (SPA) copyright enforcement policies, the U-Haul lawsuit (2000), and the defeat of the Georgia \"Super DMCA\" Bill (2004) to ban the sale of DVRs, Television, and related devices not approved by the Cable companies. In 2005 EFGA was involved nationally with the verifiable voting issue.\n\nOther issues EFGA has been involved in include fingerprinting, biometrics in ID cards, Spam, and a yearly report on Georgia technology legislation.\n\nOne of the early projects of EFGA was to deal with the passage of what was known as Georgia HB1630, the Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act. Don Parsons (politician) of the 40th district, a BellSouth employee, sponsored the bill which was passed and went into effect on July 1, 1996. The Georgia computer law made it a crime to falsely identify yourself on the internet, such as by using a handle or screen name in an \"electronic mailbox.\" There were also significant implications about hyperlinks as the law made criminal provisions concerning the use of trade names, registered trademarks, logos, and copyrighted symbols in hyperlinks. While reported as being effectively \"killed\" by being tabled, the bill was passed ten days later by both houses.\n\nEFGA's Executive Director Robert Costner went to the Georgia ACLU to see if they were interested in a legal challenge of the law, but the response from Teresa Nelson was \"no\" stating that it was not a significant issue. After discussions with Rep. Mitchell Kaye, Mr. Costner used his personal funds to engage an attorney, J. Scott McClain of Boundarant, Mixson & Elmore, to frame the case in a way that it would later be of interest to groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The next step would be for EFGA to form a coalition of plaintiffs to oppose the newly passed law.\n\nThe lawsuit was not EFGA's first reaction to the new law. In an attempt to avoid the hassle of a lawsuit and avoid costs on both sides, on July 3, 1996 EFGA send a letter to Attorney General Mike Bowers asking him to issue a ruling to clarify the meaning of the law. On July 16, 1996, Bowers turned down EFGA's request and they proceeded forward with filing the lawsuit.\n\nThis became EFGA's model for dealing with future issues. Try to deal with the matter at the lowest level before escalating it. Always deal with the issues, not the personalities. and finally form a broad coalition of support by engaging diverse groups in the issue. With the help of attorney J. Scott McClain, the local Georgia ACLU was brought on board. They brought in the national ACLU which took over funding of the lawsuit. EFF joined in next with a total of 13 plaintiffs joining together to submit affidavits for the case.\n\nOn September 24, 1996 EFGA, along with the ACLU, EFF, and other plaintiffs filed the lawsuit against the state alleging that the Georgia law barring the use of pseudonyms and anonymous communications on the internet was unconstitutional. EFGA's position was multifaceted alleging unconstitutionality in protection of anonymous speech, free speech for news and satire in web linking, commerce clause violations, and unconstitutional vagueness in the language of the law. \n\nEFGA ultimately prevailed against the state in federal court winning the preliminary injunction in 1997 effectively overturning the Georgia Law against the use of pseudonyms on the internet.\n\nEFGA established and ran the Georgia Cracker anonymous remailer and the Redneck nymserver. Elements of this were featured in a television interview with Robert Costner on a segment on 20/20 about email and privacy.\n\nIn addition to running its own anonymous remailer, EFGA also maintains an automated list of working remailers, updated daily. The EFGA remailer resources are known to be the best available in the world. In the Spring 2003 issue of 2600 Magazine the EFGA website was described as the best and most current source for information about anonymous remailers.\n\nThe Electronic Frontiers Forums is a yearly event held in Atlanta, Georgia over the labor day weekend each year at DragonCon.

It is used in comprehensive community initiatives as well as small-scale settings and is designed to help groups accomplish their goals. According to David Fetterman, \"Empowerment evaluation is the use of evaluation concepts, techniques, and findings to foster improvement and self-determination\". An expanded definition is: \"Empowerment evaluation is an evaluation approach that aims to increase the likelihood that programs will achieve results by increasing the capacity of program stakeholders to plan, implement, and evaluate their own programs.\"\nEmpowerment evaluation has been used in programs ranging from a fifteen million dollar Hewlett-Packard corporate philanthropy effort to accreditation in higher education and from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Mars Mars Rover project to battered women's shelters. Empowerment evaluation has been used by government, foundations, businesses, and non-profits, as well as Native American reservations. It is a global phenomenon, with projects and workshops around the world including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Finland, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A sample of sponsors and clients includes Casey Family Programs, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Family & Children Services, Health Trust, Knight Foundation, Poynter, Stanford University, State of Arkansas, UNICEF and Volunteers of America.\n\nEmpowerment evaluation was introduced in 1993 by David Fetterman during his presidential address at the American Evaluation Association’s (AEA) annual meeting.\n\nThe approach was initially well received by some researchers who commented on the complementary relationship between EE and community psychology, social work, community development and adult education. They highlighted how it inverted traditional definitions of evaluation, shifting power from the evaluator to program staff and participants. Early supporters positively noted the focus on social justice and self-determination. One colleague compared the writings of approach to Martin Luther's 95 Theses.\n\n\"Empowerment Evaluation: Knowledge and Tools for Self-assessment and Accountability\" the first empowerment evaluation book, provided an introduction to theory and practice. It highlighted EE's scope, ranging from its use in a national educational reform movement to its endorsement by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation’s Director of Evaluation. The book presented examples in various contexts, including: federal, state, and local government, HIV prevention and related health initiatives, African American communities and battered women’s shelters. This first volume also provided various theoretical and philosophical frameworks as well as workshop and technical assistance tools. \n\"Foundations of Empowerment Evaluation,\" was the second EE book. The book provided steps and cases. It highlighted the role of the Internet to facilitate and disseminate the approach.\n\nThe third book was titled: \"Empowerment evaluation principles in practice.\" It emphasized greater conceptual clarity by making explicit EE's underlying principles, ranging from improvement and inclusion to capacity building and social justice. In addition, it highlighted its commitment to accountability and outcomes, by stating them as an explicit principle and presenting substantive outcome examples. Cases described include educational reform, youth development programs and child abuse prevention programs.\n\nThe primary theories guiding empowerment evaluation are process use and theories of use and action.\n\nProcess use represents much of the rationale or logic underlying EE in practice, because it cultivates ownership by placing the approach in community and staff members’ hands.\n\nThe alignment of theories of use and action explain how empowerment evaluation helps people produce desired results.\n\nEmpowerment evaluation is designed to be used by people. It places evaluation in the hands of community and staff members. The more that people are engaged in conducting their own evaluations the more likely they are to believe in them, because the evaluation findings are theirs. In addition, a byproduct of this experience is that they learn to think lucratively. This makes them more likely to make decisions and take actions based on their evaluation data. This way of thinking is at the heart of process use.\n\nEmpowerment evaluation is guided by 10 principles. These principles help evaluators and community members align decisions with the larger purpose or goals associated with capacity building and self-determination.\n\n\nKey concepts include: critical friends, cultures of evidence, cycles of reflection and action, communities of learners, and reflective practitioners. A critical friend, for example, is an evaluator who provide constructive feedback. They help to ensure the evaluation remains organized, rigorous and honest.\n\nEE's three-step approach includes:\n\n\nThis approach is popular in part due to its simplicity, effectiveness and transparency.\n\nA second approach is the 10-step Getting to Outcomes (GTO). GTO helps participants answer 10 questions using relevant literature, methods and tools. The 10 accountability questions and literature to address them are:\n\n\nA manual with worksheets addresses how to answer the questions. While GTO has been used primarily in substance abuse prevention, customized GTOs have been developed for preventing underage drinking and promoting positive youth development. Several books are downloadable. In addition, EE can employ photo journalism, online surveys, virtual conferencing and self-assessments.\n\nConventional and innovative evaluation tools monitor outcomes, including online surveys, focus groups and interviews, as well as the use of quasi-experimental designs. In addition, program specific metrics are developed, using baselines, benchmarks, goals and actual performance. For example, a minority tobacco prevention program in Arkansas established:\n\n\nThese metrics help the community monitor implementation, by comparing performance with benchmarks. It also enables them to make mid-course corrections.\n\nStanford University School of Medicine applied the technique to curricular decision making. EE contributed to improvements in course and clerkship ratings. For example, the average student ratings for required courses improved significantly (P = .04; Student’s one-sample t test).\n\nEE guided Hewlett-Packard’s $15 million Digital Village Initiative. The initiative was designed to help bridge the digital divide in communities of color. Outcomes ranged from Native American’s building one of the largest unlicensed wireless systems in the country to creating a high-resolution digital printing press.\n\nThe State of Arkansas used EE in academically distressed schools and tobacco prevention. Outcomes include improving test scores, upgrading school-level performance and preventing and reducing tobacco consumption.\n\nA school district in South Carolina invested millions of their own dollars to provide each student with a personalized computing device as an educational tool. EE was used to support large scale implementation of the initiative and monitor outcomes associated with teacher and student behavior change.\n\nEE is conducted by an internal group, not an external individual. Programs are dynamic, not static and thus require more fluid, responsive, and continual assessment. The evaluator becomes a coach, rather than the expert. Investigating worth and merit is not sufficient. The focus should also be on program improvement. Empowerment evaluation, as a group activity, builds in self-checks on bias. Internal and external forms of evaluation are compatible and reinforcing. However, the Joint Committee's standards were applied and empowerment evaluation was found to be consistent with the spirit of the standards. Empowerment evaluation is not a threat to traditional evaluation. It may instead help to revitalize it.\n\nEmpowerment evaluation is part of an emancipatory research stream. Its unique contribution is its focus on fostering self-determination and building capacity. Empowerment evaluation is guided by process use. Additional effort could be made to further distinguish empowerment from collaborative, participatory, stakeholder, and utilization forms of evaluation. Empowerment evaluation should be limited or focused on the disenfranchised and issues of liberation. Empowerment evaluation has become a part of the evaluation landscape.\n\nEmpowerment evaluation is part of a worldwide movement. It is now part of the evaluation field. However, empowerment evaluation needs to focus on the consumer, rather than staff members. In addition, the definition of empowerment evaluation has changed. Bias in evaluation can be removed by distancing oneself from the group or program being assessed. Internal and external forms of evaluation are needed. Empowerment evaluators serve as evaluation consultants.\n\nThe definition of empowerment is the same as when the approach was first defined and introduced to the field. However, it has been expanded to further clarify the purpose of the approach. Fetterman and Wandersman agree that empowerment evaluation is part of an emancipatory stream of research. It also relies on process use to guide it. They also believe that greater effort is needed to further distinguish empowerment from other forms of stakeholder involved approaches. However, empowerment evaluation can be viewed along a continuum from less empowering to more empowering in nature. Empowerment evaluation is designed to help the disenfranchised. However, the boundaries are much broader and inclusive. Everyone can benefit from self-assessment and becoming more self-determined.<br>\nFetterman advocated that evaluation be shared with a broader population.\n\nEmpowerment evaluation challenged the status quo concerning who is in control of an evaluation and what it means to be an evaluator. Conventionally, evaluations are conducted by a specialist. In EE, the group or community performs the evaluation, guided by an empowerment evaluator or “critical friend.”\n\nShufflebeam claimed that evaluation should be left in the hands of professionals who objectively investigate the worth or merit of an object and that EE violates the (as yet unadopted) Joint Committee's Program Evaluation Standards.\n\nFetterman and Scriven agreed on the value of both internal and external evaluations. They also agree on a focus on the consumer. However, staff members, sponsors, and policy makers also have important roles to play in evaluation. Scriven however claimed that the evaluator must maintain distance from program participants to avoid bias.\n\nChelimsky re-framed the discussion between Fetterman, Patton and Scriven, explaining that evaluations serve multiple purposes: 1) accountability; 2) development; and 3) knowledge. Scriven, and to a lesser extent Patton, focused on accountability, while Fetterman focused on development.\n\nThe second wave of debate and discussion emerged between 2005-2007. The primary critiques focused on conceptual and methodological clarity:\n\nCousins attempted to differentiate between similar approaches, e.g. collaborative, participatory, and empowerment evaluation. Cousins asked whether EE is practical (focusing on decision making), or transformative (focusing on self-determination) and viewed self-evaluation as more likely to have a self-serving bias. This critic noted the variability in attempts at empowerment evaluation.\n\nMiller and Campbell conducted a systematic literature review of empowerment evaluation. They highlighted types or modes of EE, as well as settings, reasons for use, selection process and degree of participation. The highlighted practice variants depending on the size of the evaluation. They suggested that clients were selecting it for appropriate reasons, such as capacity building, self-determination, accountability, cultivating ownership and institutionalization of evaluations. However, they also found that approximately 25% were empowerment in name only. In addition, they argued for additional conceptual clarity.\n\nPatton accepted EE as part of the evaluation field and proposed that given its established status, additional clarity distinguishing collaborative, participatory, utilization and empowerment evaluation would be fruitful. He acknowledged improvements ranging improved definitions and added the 10 principles. He was concerned that self-determination was not on the list. Patton applauded and recommended process use for empowerment evaluation. He accepted the contributors' commitment to forthrightly describing problems. Patton proposed greater emphasis on outcomes or results in EE.\n\nScriven believes that self-evaluation is flawed, because it is inherently self-serving, and rejected its use for professional development. He questioned the ability of EE to actually empower people and recommended a neutral evaluator role. He suggested that internal and external evaluations are not compatible. He also suggests that empowerment as well as randomized controls are merely forms of ideology.\n\nFetterman and Wandersman responded by attempting to enhance conceptual clarity, provide greater methodological specificity and highlight EEs commitment to accountability and outcomes. They acknowledged and applauded Miller and Campbell's systematic review of EE projects, while noting neglected or omitted case examples and questioning some of their methodology.\n\nThey claimed that the 10 principles contributed to conceptual clarity and that people empower themselves. They asserted that evaluations are inherently subjective and are shaped by culture and political context, and that EE is committed to honesty and rigor. EE is more inclusive than traditional evaluations, placing cross-checks on data and decisions. Participants often know more about problems than outsiders and have a vested interest in making their programs work. They claimed that internal and external evaluations can operate together effectively as additional cross-checks.\n\nWhile the similarities among collaborative, participatory and empowerment evaluation were described in the first and second empowerment evaluation books, they recommended Cousins' tool to highlight the differences, focusing on depth of participation and control of evaluation technical decision making\n\nThe most significant response to the critiques focused on outcomes. Fetterman & Wandersman argued that outcomes and results were important to EE. They highlighting specific project outcomes including:\n\n\nScriven agreed that external evaluators sometimes miss problems obvious to program staff members. He also stated they have less credibility with them than an internal evaluator. As a result, he concluded, it is less likely their recommendations will be implemented.\n\nScriven agreed that EE contributed to improvements in internal staff program evaluations and that empowerment evaluation could make a contribution to evaluation if combined with third-party evaluation.\n\nEmpowerment evaluation was a catalyst for the creation of the American Evaluation Association's Collaborative, Participatory, and Empowerment Evaluation topical interest group. Approximately 20% of the American Evaluation Association membership is affiliated with the topical interest group. SAGE Publications, a social science textbook publisher, cited an empowerment evaluation book as one of their \"classic titles in research methods.\" Four empowerment evaluators received honors from the association: Margret Dugan, David Fetterman, Shakeh Kaftarian, and Abraham Wandersman.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7921409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7921409", "title": "Fiscus Judaicus", "text": "Fiscus Judaicus\n\nThe (Latin for \"Jewish tax\") or was a tax-collecting agency instituted to collect the tax imposed on Jews in the Roman Empire after the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple in AD 70. Revenues were directed to the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome.\n\nModern knowledge of the fiscus Judaicus is found in four primary sources:\n\nThe tax was initially imposed by Roman Emperor Vespasian as one of the measures against Jews as a result of the First Roman-Jewish War of 66–73 AD (first Jewish revolt) (Josephus \"BJ\" 7. 218; Dio Cassius 66.7.2). The tax was imposed on all Jews throughout the empire, not just on those who took part in the revolt against Rome. The tax was imposed after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD in place of the levy (or Tithe) payable by Jews towards the upkeep of the Temple. The amount levied was two denarii, equivalent to the one-half of a shekel that observant Jews had previously paid for the upkeep of the Temple of Jerusalem (). The tax was to go instead to the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter, the major center of ancient Roman religion. The \"fiscus Iudaicus\" was a humiliation for the Jews. In Rome, a special procurator known as \"procurator ad capitularia Iudaeorum\" was responsible for the collection of the tax. Only those who had abandoned Judaism were exempt from paying it.\n\nWhile the tax paid for the Temple of Jerusalem was payable only by adult men between the ages of 20 and 50, the \"fiscus Iudaicus\" was imposed on all Jews, including women, children, and elderly—and even Jewish slaves. In Egypt, the documentary evidence (in the form of receipts) confirms the payment of the tax by women and children. The oldest person known from these receipts to have paid the \"fiscus Iudaicus\" was a 61-year-old woman, which led Sherman LeRoy Wallace to conjecture that the tax was levied only until the age of 62, as was the regular Roman poll tax paid by individuals throughout the Empire.\n\nThe tax was continued even after the completion of the reconstruction of the Capitoline temple for its upkeep.\n\nDomitian, who ruled between 81 and 96 AD, expanded the \"fiscus Iudaicus\" to include not only born Jews and converts to Judaism, but also on those who concealed the fact that they were Jews or observed Jewish customs. Suetonius relates that when he was an old man of 90 he was examined to see whether he was circumcised, which shows that during this period the tax was levied even on those above the age of 62. Louis Feldman argues that the increased harshness was caused by the success of the Jewish (and possibly Christian) proselytism.\n\nDomitian applied the tax even to those who merely \"lived like Jews\":\n\nDomitian's ruling opened the door to possibilities of blackmail in Rome and in all Italy. Charges of following Judaism were easily made, but difficult to disprove, not least because the practices of certain philosophical sects resembled some Jewish customs. As a result, many people chose to settle with the accusers out of court rather than risk the uncertainties of judicial hearings, thus effectively encouraging the blackmailers.\nTitus Flavius Clemens was put to death for \"living a Jewish life\" or \"drifting into Jewish ways\" in the year 95 AD, which may well have been related to the administration of the \"fiscus Judaicus\" under Domitian.\n\nThe \"fiscus Iudaicus\" was originally imposed on Jews. At the time neither the Romans nor, probably, the Early Christians considered Christianity to be a separate religion from Judaism. If anything they would have considered themselves as a sect within Judaism, which historians refer to as Jewish Christianity. However, whether that was the intention or not, it did not take long for Christians to petition the Emperor to distinguish the Christians for the purpose of the payment of the \"fiscus Iudaicus\". As the tax only applied to practising Jews, if they could be recognised as a separate religion, they would escape the impost.\n\nAfter the murder of Domitian in 96 AD, Nerva relaxed the rules of collection, limiting the tax to those who openly practised Judaism. By this measure, the Christians (and perhaps Jewish Christians) escaped the tax , but they were not officially recognized as a legal religion until the much later Edict of Milan in 313. The coins of Nerva bear the legend \"fisci Iudaici calumnia sublata\" \"abolition of malicious prosecution in connection with the Jewish tax,\" in reference to his reform of the harsh policies of Domitian\n\nIt remains unclear when exactly the \"fiscus Iudaicus\" was abolished. Documentary evidence confirms the collection of the tax in the middle of the 2nd century, and literary sources indicate that the tax was still in existence in the early 3rd century. It is not known when the tax was formally abolished. Some historians credit the emperor Julian the Apostate with its abolition in about 361 or 362.\n\nThe tax was revived in the Middle Ages in 1342 under the name of Opferpfennig by the Holy Roman Emperors. The Opferpfennig (originally Guldenpfennig) tax was introduced in 1342 by Emperor Louis IV the Bavarian, who ordered all Jews above the age of 12 and possessing 20 gulden to pay one gulden annually for protection. The practice was justified on the grounds that the emperor, as the legal successor of the Roman emperors, was the rightful recipient of the Temple tax which Jews paid to the Romans after the destruction of the Second Temple. The Opferpfennig was collected on Christmas day.\n\nEmperor Charles IV later ordered the income of the Opferpfennig tax to be delivered to the archbishop of Trier. This tax was at some places replaced by an overall communal tax.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28999061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28999061", "title": "Forced circumcision", "text": "Forced circumcision\n\nForced circumcision refers to circumcision of males who have not given their consent to the procedure. In a biblical context, the term is used especially in relation to Paul the Apostle and his polemics against the forced circumcision of gentile Christians. Among adults, forced circumcisions have occurred in a wide range of situations, most notably in the compulsory conversion of non-Muslims to Islam and the forced circumcision of Teso, Turkana and Luo men in Kenya, as well as the abduction of South African teenage boys to so-called circumcision schools (\"bush schools\"). In South Africa, custom allows uncircumcised Xhosa-speaking men past the age of circumcision (i.e., 25 years or older) to be overpowered by other men and forcibly circumcised.\n\n1 Maccabees relates the story of how Mattathias (ca. 166 BC) forcibly circumcised the sons of Jewish parents who had abandoned the rite. Forced circumcision of Gentiles by Jews is attested from the second century BC onwards. In 125 BC John Hyrcanus conquered Edom, which the Romans called Idumea; and the Idumeans were converted to Judaism. As reported by Josephus, circumcision was required of the Idumeans as a token of their acceptance of Judaism:\n\nScholars disagree on the interpretation of the sources. For example, Steven Weitzman believes the Idumeans were forcibly circumcised for political, not religious, reasons. According to Shaye J. D. Cohen, \"Ptolemy's claim, that the Idumaeans were compelled to be circumcised and to adopt Jewish ways, is a simplified account of what these urban Idumaeans experienced.\"\nDuring the short reign of Hyrcanus' eldest son, Aristobulus I (104-103 BC), the Hasmoneans gained control of Galilee. In this case, too, sources indicate that the residents were subjected to forced circumcision. Archaeological evidence suggests that, during this period, Gentiles fled from Galilee to avoid being forcibly circumcised.\n\nGreeks and Romans regarded circumcision as a mutilation of the male genitalia, but the practice is little discussed in Roman literary sources until the second century of the Christian era. There was a circumcision controversy in Early Christianity but this was resolved at the Council of Jerusalem c.50 which made it clear that circumcision of gentile converts to Christianity was not required. Josephus (who changed his allegiance from the Jews to the Roman Flavians) reports that two Roman officers who had taken refuge with Galileans during the war with Rome (early 67 AD) were put under pressure to convert to Judaism. Josephus, declaring that \"every one should worship God in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience,\" claims to have saved the two Gentiles from forced circumcision. After the First Roman-Jewish War, a head tax, the Fiscus Judaicus, was levied against all Jews. According to Suetonius, Domitian (c.90) also applied this tax to those who were circumcisied, even if they claimed they were not Jews. Titus Flavius Clemens (consul) was put to death in 95 for adopting Jewish customs. In 96 Nerva relaxed the Jewish tax as applying only to those who professed to be Jews. Sometime between 128 and 132 AD, the emperor Hadrian seems to have temporarily banned circumcision, on pain of death. Antoninus Pius exempted Jews from the ban, as well as Egyptian priests, and Origen (d. \"ca.\" 253) says that in his time only Jews were permitted to practice circumcision. Legislation under Constantine, the first Christian emperor, freed any slave who was subjected to circumcision; in the year 339, circumcising a slave became punishable by death.\n\nAlthough Greco-Roman writers view circumcision as an identifying characteristic of Jews, they believed the practice to have originated in Egypt, and recorded it among peoples they identified as Arab, Syrian, Phoenician, Colchian, and Ethiopian; circumcision was a marker of \"the Other\". Diaspora Jews might circumcise their male slaves as well as adult male converts and Jewish male infants. According to Catherine Hezser, it is an open question whether Jews of late antiquity refrained from forcibly circumcising their Gentile slaves and whether Romans avoided selling their slaves to Jews in reaction to the prohibition. The Mishnah (compiled about 200 AD) is silent on this point, whereas the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (written at the end of the fourth century or later) suggests that Jews might indeed possess uncircumcised slaves.\n\nForced conversions, involving forced circumcision, are echoed in a vast body of scholarly literature spanning the entire history of Islam. Scholars conclude that, during the Islamic conquest of the Middle East and North Africa, forced conversion to Islam through violence or threat of violence did not play a key role. However, taxes and regulations requiring the holders of prestigious positions to become Muslims have been regarded as a form of forced conversion.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1780 Battle of Pollilur, 7,000 British soldiers were held imprisoned by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, more than 300 were forcibly circumcised. Cromwell Massey, who kept a secret diary during his captivity, wrote: \"I lost with the foreskin of my yard all those benefits of a Christian and Englishman which were and ever shall be my greatest glory.\" Adolescent captives were, in addition to being circumcised, made to wear female clothes. James Bristow, a teenage artilleryman, revenged himself by circumcising dogs, believing that this would harm the religious feelings of the Muslim warders. The prospect of punishment did not deter him, because \"compelling us to undergo an abhorred operation [was] so base and barbarous an act of aggression, that it was impossible to reflect on it with temper.\" James Scurry, also a prisoner of war, confirms in his book, \"The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry\" (1824), that English soldiers, Mangalorean Catholics, and other prisoners were forcibly circumcised.\nIn 1784, when Tipu returned from Mangalore, he brought back tens of thousands of Mangalorean Catholics from Kanara and subjected them to forced circumcision. A Hindi idiom 'Mar-mar ke Musalman bana' (meaning 'make Muslim by repeated beating') can be traced to originate from forcible conversion of Hindus.\n\nAccording to Kativa Daiya, during the 1947 partition of India \"[f]orced circumcision, shaving facial and head hair (for Sikh men), and shaving off the Hindu Brahmin's traditional, short, plaited hair (on an otherwise bald head) were routine Muslim conversion tactics for men and boys.\" \"Asia News\" reported in 2004 that the Justice and Peace Commission of Lahor spoke out against young non-Muslim men in Pakistan being converted and circumcised against their will. In 2005, the \"Gulf Times\" discussed a case of forced circumcision of Nepalese boys in Mumbai in the context of sex trade in large Indian cities.\n\nIraqi Mandaeans, residing almost exclusively in Baghdad and Basra, do not circumcise. However, their religious sensitivity on this issue has not prevented hostile rulers from subjecting Mandaean men and boys to forced circumcision. Mandaean communities, especially after the invasion of Iraq, have been subject to \"murder, kidnapping, rape, forced conversion, forced circumcision and destruction of religious property.\"\n\nIn Iraq in 2003, shortly after the fall of the Saddam regime, the thirty-five families who made up the Mandean community in Fallujia were ordered at gunpoint to adopt Islam; the men were forcibly circumcised.\n\nIn 2007 the US Committee on International Religious Freedom heard testimony reporting: \"Forced conversion is happening in an alarming degree. Boys are being kidnapped, forcibly circumcised - a major sin in the Mandaean religion - and forcibly converted to Islam.\"\n\nIn 2014, after the exodus of the Christians from Mosul and the Yazidi's from Mount Sinjar, it was reported that forced circumcisions were taking place conducted by the Islamic State \n\nThere are accounts of Christian boys abducted and forcibly circumcised even in the nineteenth century. In 1829, 9 year old Greek boy Alexandros Kitos and other young boys were kidnapped by Ottoman soldiers and sold into slavery in Egypt, all were circumcised against their will.\n\nIt is well established that, before and during the Armenian Genocide, forced conversions (involving forced circumcisions) of Armenian boys and men were frequent. \"In many cases young Armenian children were spared from deportation by local Turks who took them from their families. The children were coerced into denouncing Christianity and becoming Muslims, and were then given new Turkish names. For Armenian boys the forced conversion meant they each had to endure painful circumcision as required by Islamic custom.\"\n\nDuring the Istanbul Pogrom in September 1955, \"many Greek men, including at least one priest, were subjected to forced circumcision.\" As a result of the pogrom, the Greek minority eventually emigrated from Turkey. In 2002 there was a report that non-Muslim army recruits in Turkey had been threatened with forced circumcision. Cases are documented where Syro-Orthodox men serving in the Turkish military forces have been threatened with forced circumcision. In 1991, a young Christian Turk, fleeing from forced circumcision in the Turkish military forces, was granted asylum in Germany.\n\nThe Yazidi (not all of whom are circumcised) in Turkey have for years been subjected to direct state persecution, including compulsory religious instruction at school, forced conversion, forced circumcision, and mistreatment during military service. In 1999 there was a report of the forced circumcision of Yedizi men in Turkish Kurdistan.\n\nJohn Rawlins had sailed for 23 years without incident when, in 1621, he and his crew were kidnapped by pirates from the Barbary Coast of North Africa. Rawlins later reported that, after being taken to Algiers, two younger men were \"by force and torment ... compelled ... to turn Turks,\" which means that they were forcibly circumcised. By organizing a successful mutiny, he was able to return home in 1622.\nThe Portuguese Friar Jaono dos Sanctos claimed that, annually in Algiers in the 1620s, more than nine hundred Christian slaves were converted to Islam, \"besides about fifty boys yearly circumcised against their wills.\"\n\nThousands of Christians were forcibly circumcised in the Moluccas from December 1999 to January 2001. The Sydney Morning Herald reported in detail on this, stating that \"almost all\" of 3,928 villagers forced to convert to Islam were circumcised. Razors and knives were reused, causing infections. One of those circumcised, Kostantinus Idi, reported: \"I could not escape,\" he said. \"One of them held up my foreskin between pieces of wood while another cut me with a razor ...the third man held my head back, ready to pour water down my throat if I screamed. But I couldn't help but scream and he poured the water. I kept screaming aloud and vomited. I couldn't stand the pain.\" He further reported that one of the clerics urinated on his wound, saying it would stop infection. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the forced conversions and forced circumcisions had been condemned by moderate Muslim leaders who said they were contrary to Islamic teachings. The local governor had also investigated the incidents.\n\nMarco Polo, in his \"Travels\", relates how a Christian king of Ethiopia took revenge on the Sultan of Aden, who had forcibly circumcised a bishop.\n\nIn Kenya, most tribes circumcise. Luo men from Western Kenya are a significant exception, for which reason they have regularly been subjected to forced circumcision. In August 2002, following a violent incident in Butere/Mumias District, a district commissioner instructed the police to \"crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision.\"\n\nIn November 2005, the Kenyan Human Rights Commission announced that it would seek prosecutions against politicians for inciting such violence. In one instance, a cabinet minister had said, \"Those who are not circumcised should be taken for a circumcision ceremony.\" The Commission said this amounted to an incitement to violence.\n\nIn late January 2008, a disputed election in which circumcision became an issue between President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu and opposition candidate Raila Odinga, a Luo, \"the fact that Odinga was uncircumcised became an issue: He was seen by some Kikuyus as a 'child' unfit to rule because he had not passed through circumcision and initiation.\" Post-election violence reportedly \"focused on tribal animosities\", and included several cases of forced circumcision. AFP reported one Kenyan man's experience: \"A group of eight men with pangas (machetes) entered. They asked for my ID [to determine what tribe he belonged to] They slashed me and they circumcised me by force. I screamed a lot and cried for help...' He complained that police left him in a pool of blood, taking weapons left behind by the Kikuyu gang.\n\nIn September 2010, at Malaba, West Kenya, a 21-year-old Teso man was lured to a hotel, drugged, smeared with fermented millet flour and was being led away by several Bukusu to be circumcised when the police intervened. The Teso man, who agreed to a medical circumcision, condemned the Bukusu youths for trying to impose their culture on the Teso. Three weeks previously, village neighbours in Aedomoru sub location in Teso north armed themselves with clubs and prevented a 35-year-old man from being forcibly circumcised.\n\nIn 1999, a woman who was feared throughout the Vaal Triangle district of South Africa, controlled a gang of kidnappers that abducted young people, forcibly circumcising the boys and extorting ransoms from their parents for their release. A local police officer said as many as 10 teenagers had been snatched every day.\n\nIn 2004, a 22-year-old Rastafari convert was seized by relatives and forcibly circumcised by group of Xhosa tribal elders and relatives.\n\nIn December 2004, 45-year-old Nceba Cekiso was caught and circumcised against his will. The report in the \"Cape Argus\" noted, \"Xhosa culture allows people to forcibly circumcise boys deemed to be past the age of initiation... Forcing people do undergo the ancient ritual ... has, in recent times, caused concern among human rights organisations... (In) one instance two Rastafarians objected to the procedure on religious grounds. The incident has sparked a debate on whether or not traditionalists should still be allowed to force people against their will into the bush to undergo initiation.\n\nDespite being medically circumcised, a Christian Xhosa was forcibly recircumcised by his father and community leaders in 2007. He laid a charge of unfair discrimination on the grounds of his religious beliefs, seeking an apology from his father and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. In the settlement that was reached, and which was made an order of the Equality Court, the Congress of Traditional Leaders accepted the right of adult males to choose whether to attend traditional circumcision schools according to their religious beliefs. It apologised for the comments made by its former chairman encouraging the ostracism of teenagers who refused to undergo traditional circumcision. The judge declared, \"What is important in terms of the Constitution and law is that no one can be forced to submit to circumcision without his consent.\"\n\nAccording to South African newspapers, the subsequent trial became \"a landmark case around forced circumcision.\" In October 2009, the Bhisho Equality Court (High Court) ruled that, in South Africa, circumcision is unlawful unless done with the full consent of the initiate. According to Thembela Kepe, traditional leaders allege that the ban on forced circumcision is \"a violation of cultural rights enshrined in the Constitution.\"\n\nThere is ample evidence that, for years, Christians of Khartoum and elsewhere in Sudan have been forcefully converted to Islam, and that Christian men and boys have been forcibly circumcised. Examples of Dinka boys having been forcibly circumcised in the 1990s and 2000s are known from the context of traditional slavery, still endemic in Sudan.\n\nIn 1885, Kabaka Mwanga ordered the murders of Bishop James Hannington and many local Christians. During the following period, Islamization led to several Christians being forcibly circumcised.\n\nAs discussed by anthropologist Suzette Heald and other scholars, the Gisu (alternatively, Bagishu) of Uganda \"take pride in not tolerating uncircumcised men.\" For this reason, in Gisu society, any boy or man who has been able to escape ritual circumcision (called \"imbalu\") faces the prospect of being forcibly circumcised. Voice of America, referring to the same practice, reports: \"Among the Bagishu, uncircumcised men are treated with contempt; they are not allowed in society and in most cases they are seen as failing to get local women for marriage. This is supported by all the Bagishu including women who often report uncircumcised men to tribal elders. It's considered traditional that no male is to escape the ritual regardless of where he lives, what he does or what kind of security he has.\"\nIn 2004 a father of seven was seized and forcibly circumcised after his wife told Bagishu tribal circumcisers that he was uncircumcised. A local official said the authorities could not intervene in a cultural ritual. Other forced circumcisions occurred in September 2006 and June 2008. In all these cases, family members of the victims approved of the forced circumcision. Other tribal groups in Uganda and the Ugandan Foundation for Human Rights Initiative regard forced circumcision as a human rights abuse. The Ugandan Government and the President of the Ugandan Law Society condemned the incident, but the victim refused to press charges.\n\nTraditional circumcision is still practised in some tribal areas of Australia. Linguist and anthropologist Peter Sutton, commenting on forced circumcision and the absence of law enforcement in remote settlements, claims that Australian law has been applied in a patchy way: \"Involuntary circumcision has long been widely accepted as being de facto outside the scope of Australian law.\" Late in 1996, 34-year-old Irwin Brookdale was drinking with a group of Australian Aborigines on the banks of a river in far north Queensland. After he passed out, a woman in the group felt down his pants, found that he was not circumcised and called on her companions to \"make a man out of him.\" They attempted to circumcise him with a broken beer bottle. Brookdale ended up in hospital, one of his assailants was convicted of unlawful wounding and Brookdale was awarded A$10,000 compensation for nervous shock.\n\nThe breakup of Yugoslavia, according to Milica Z. Bookman, \"was extremely violent, producing some two million refugees, over 100,000 killed, and evidence of gang rape, impaling, dismemberment and forced circumcision.\"\n\nThe US Department of State reported that Muslim and Mujahedin irregular troops \"had routinely performed crude, disfiguring, nonmedical circumcisions on Bosnian Serb soldiers.\" One 18-year-old Bosnian Serb soldier \"was so brutally circumcised that eventually the entire organ required amputation.\"\n\n\n"}

It was intended to reverse the results of a Second-Republic election of deputies to the Constituent Assembly. It is difficult to say, with any precision, whether this phenomenon should be called a \"demonstration\", a \"riot\", an \"invasion\", or an \"attempted coup d'état\". Nonetheless, it seems to have been largely unplanned, not particularly bloody, and indisputably a failure.\n\nThe election results of 23 April 1848, which chose deputies to serve in the national Constituent Assembly, were very unfavorable to republican progressives, a party that held strong socialistic views such as wanting the government to be the \"supreme regulator of production\" and led by the \"utopian socialist\" Louis Blanc. Universal male suffrage, applied for the first time since 1792, resulted in the election of an Assembly with a majority composed of a group calling themselves \"tomorrow's republicans\". A new government was elected by the Assembly, called the \"Commission exécutive de la République française\" (Executive Committee of the French Republic), which was composed largely of moderate Republicans who were opposed to the socialistic agenda enacted by the provisional government that had been in place since the February 1848 revolution. \n\nOnce assembled, the deputies tried to insulate themselves from the inevitable popular pressure engendered by meeting in Paris. Nonetheless, on 10 May, the new assembly spurned the proposal of Louis Blanc concerning the establishment of a \"Ministry of Labor and Progress\", a bold measure that aimed to implement Blanc's socialist agenda. Blanc was opposed to the free markets and market competition and wanted the \"Ministry of Labor and Progress\" to establish communal \"workshops\" in various industries that all supported each other. The goal was to have government backed labor \"workshops\" so everyone could have a job and make government the \"supreme regulator of production\". Blanc claimed that \"in destroying competition we strangle at the same time the evils which it brings forth\", to which Blanc believed would lead to the downfall of capitalism. The urban laborers behind Blanc were unnerved by the measures taken against him. On 12 May, the Assembly banned political parties and special-interest groups from sending delegations to read petitions to the Assembly, an old practice from revolutionary Paris (1792–1794) and the so-called Sans-culottes, which had been resumed in February 1848. This action was seen by Parisians as undemocratic.\n\nThe progressives in the Assembly were also unhappy about the inaction of the Department of Foreign Affairs and its provisional minister, Jules Bastide, who refused to help the Poles then under the occupation of Prussian and Austrian troops. The newly elected government, it seemed, was only continuing the foreign policy of the provisional government, a timid and feckless platform, which, under the leadership of Alphonse de Lamartine, had, on 4 March, passed a resolution denying support to \"all\" popular revolutions (in Italy, Poland, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe.) The progressive Republicans had difficulty in understanding this passivity when, within human memory, France had been a \"great nation\" which marched to the aid of those \"oppressed by their rulers.\" This was the standard of greatness established by the Revolution of 1792, and many 1848 progressives found France's current passivity painfully disconcerting.\n\nA ceremony of flags had been scheduled for 14 May 1848, and Paris was full of National Guards, many from the provinces. The ceremony had been suddenly canceled because of the refusal of the delegation of workers sitting in the Luxembourg Palace to participate in the ceremony. Delegates from Poland (specifically, Poznań and Lemberg, now known as Lviv) prevailed upon a sympathetic deputy from the department of the Seine, a naturalized Pole, Louis Wolowski, to have the Assembly discuss the Polish question on 15 May. Also on 15 May, Parisian militants, mostly progressive Republicans and socialists, held a demonstration in support of the Polish cause. This happened despite the reluctance of Republican leaders, such as François-Vincent Raspail, Armand Barbès, and Louis Auguste Blanqui, to support it.\n\nThe event started at the Bastille and headed through the boulevards toward the Place de la Concorde, at the western end of the Tuileries Gardens. Many foreign delegations (Irish, Italian, Polish) participated. Provocative behavior by fiery old revolutionaries, like , and a general failure by Courtois, the commander of the National Guard, to respond appropriately caused the situation to degenerate.\n\nProtesters headed for the Palais Bourbon, where the Assembly was meeting, and forced their way into the chamber. In the hubbub, someone read the petition in favor of Poland. Then Aloysius Huber exclaimed: \"The National Assembly is dissolved.\" The crowd then marched to the City Hall of Paris, where it proclaimed an \"insurrectionary government\" with Blanqui, Ledru-Rollin, Alexandre Martin, Louis Blanc, , Thoré, Pierre Leroux, and Raspail to serve as ministers. However, elements of the National Guard, joined by Lamartine, Ledru-Rollin, and members of the five-day-old Executive Committee, besieged the city hall and dislodged the protesters.\n\nThe Assembly and the Executive Committee resumed control of the situation. The Republican leaders were arrested. They were brought before the High Court of Justice of Bourges on 7 March to 3 April 1849. Marc Caussidière was dismissed from his position as prefect of police, and he was replaced by a banker from Le Mans, Ariste Jacques Trouvé-Chauvel. General de Courtois, commandant of the National Guard of Paris, who had shown some sympathy for the protesters, was arrested and replaced by General . Jules Favre tried in vain to get the Assembly to indict Louis Blanc. Philippe Buchez, who had shown no reaction to the demonstrators, lost the presidency of the Assembly, and he was succeeded by the former attorney, Antoine Sénard. The Conservatives were, after these events, free to carry on the offensive against their great nemesis: the national workshops associated with Louis Blanc.\n\n"}
{"id": "47246185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47246185", "title": "History of socialism", "text": "History of socialism\n\nThe history of socialism has its origins in the 1789 French Revolution and the changes which it wrought, although it has precedents in earlier movements and ideas. \"The Communist Manifesto\" was written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848 just before the Revolutions of 1848 swept Europe, expressing what they termed \"scientific socialism\". In the last third of the 19th century, social democratic parties arose in Europe, drawing mainly from Marxism. The Australian Labor Party was the world's first elected socialist party when it formed government in the Colony of Queensland for a week in 1899.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the Soviet Union and the communist parties of the Third International around the world mainly came to represent socialism in terms of the Soviet model of economic development and the creation of centrally planned economies directed by a state that owns all the means of production, although other trends condemned what they saw as the lack of democracy. In the United Kingdom, Herbert Morrison said that \"socialism is what the Labour government does\" whereas Aneurin Bevan argued that socialism requires that the \"main streams of economic activity are brought under public direction\", with an economic plan and workers' democracy. Some argued that capitalism had been abolished. Socialist governments established the mixed economy with partial nationalisations and social welfare.\n\nBy 1968, the prolonged Vietnam War (1959–1975) gave rise to the New Left, socialists who tended to be critical of the Soviet Union and social democracy. Anarcho-syndicalists and some elements of the New Left and others favored decentralized collective ownership in the form of cooperatives or workers' councils. At the turn of the 21st century in Latin America, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez championed what he termed socialism of the 21st century, which included a policy of nationalisation of national assets such as oil, anti-imperialism and termed himself a Trotskyist supporting permanent revolution.\n\nThe Book of Acts describes an early Christian socialist community that shared a common purse:\nMazdak (died c. 524 or 528 CE) preached and instituted a religion-based socialist or proto-socialist system in the Zoroastrian context of Sassanian Persia.\n\nIn Britain, Thomas Paine proposed a detailed plan to tax property owners to pay for the needs of the poor in \"Agrarian Justice\" (1797), while Charles Hall wrote \"The Effects of Civilization on the People in European States\" (1805), denouncing capitalism's effects on the poor of his time. The English word \"socialist\" in its modern sense dates from at least 1822.\n\nChartism, which flourished from 1838 to 1858, \"formed the first organized labour movement in Europe, gathering significant numbers around the People's Charter of 1838, which demanded the extension of suffrage to all male adults. Prominent leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first trade unions and consumers’ cooperative societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement, as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands\".\n\nBy 1842, socialism \"had become the topic of a major academic analysis\" by a German scholar, Lorenz von Stein, in his \"Socialism and Social Movement\". According to an 1888 volume of \"A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles\", the word \"socialism\" first appeared on 13 February 1832 in \"Le Globe\", a liberal French newspaper of Pierre Leroux. Leroux returned to the theme of \"socialism\" in 1834 and Louis Reybaud (1799–1879) published \"Études sur les réformateurs contemporains ou socialistes modernes\" in 1842 in France. In England, Robert Owen (1771–1858) was also using the term \"socialism\" independently around the same time. Owen is considered the father of the cooperative movement.\n\nThe first modern socialists were early 19th-century Western European social critics. In this period socialism emerged from a diverse array of doctrines and social experiments associated primarily with British and French thinkers—especially Robert Owen, Charles Fourier (1772–1837), Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865), Louis Blanc (1811–1882) and Saint-Simon (1760–1825). Early-19th-century followers of the utopian theories of such thinkers as Robert Owen, Claude Henri de Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier used the term \"associationism\" to describe their beliefs. These social critics criticized the excesses of poverty and inequality of the Industrial Revolution, and advocated reforms such as the egalitarian distribution of wealth and the transformation of society into small communities in which private property was to be abolished. Outlining principles for the reorganization of society along collectivist lines, Saint-Simon and Owen sought to build socialism on the foundations of planned, utopian communities. According to Sheldon Richman, \"[i]n the 19th and early 20th centuries, 'socialism' did not exclusively mean collective or government ownership of the means or production but was an umbrella term for anyone who believed labor was cheated out of its natural product under historical capitalism\",\n\nAccording to some accounts, the use of the words \"socialism\" or \"communism\" related to the perceived attitude toward religion in a given culture. Continental Europeans considered \"communism\" more atheistic than \"socialism\". In England, \"communism\" sounded too close to communion – with Catholic overtones; hence atheists preferred to call themselves socialists.\nBy 1847, according to Frederick Engels \"Socialism\" was \"respectable\" on the continent of Europe while \"Communism\" was the opposite as the Owenites in England and the Fourierists in France were considered Socialists, while working-class movements which \"proclaimed the necessity of total social change\" termed themselves \"Communists\". This latter trend was \"powerful enough\" to produce the communism of Étienne Cabet in France and of Wilhelm Weitling in Germany. In the post-revolutionary period right after the French Revolution of 1789, activists and theorists like François-Noël Babeuf, Filippo Buonarroti and Auguste Blanqui influenced the early French labour and socialist movements.\n\nJosiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, \"The Peaceful Revolutionist\", was the first anarchist periodical published. Anarchist Peter Sabatini reports that in the United States of early to mid-19th century, \"there appeared an array of communal and 'utopian' counterculture groups (including the so-called free love movement). William Godwin's anarchism exerted an ideological influence on some of this, but more so the socialism of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798–1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist\". \n\nFor American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews ... William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\". There were also currents inspired by dissident Christianity of Christian socialism \"often in Britain and then usually coming out of left liberal politics and a romantic anti-industrialism\", which produced theorists such as Edward Bellamy (1850–1898), Frederick Denison Maurice and Charles Kingsley.\n\nHenri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), who is called the founder of French socialism, argued that a brotherhood of man must accompany the scientific organization of industry and society. He proposed:\n\nFrançois Marie Charles Fourier (1772–1837) was a French utopian socialist and philosopher. Modern scholars credit Fourier with having originated the word \"féminisme\" in 1837. As early as 1808, he had argued in the \"Theory of the Four Movements\" that the extension of the liberty of women was the general principle of all social progress, though he disdained any attachment to a discourse of \"equal rights\". Fourier inspired the founding of the communist community called La Reunion near present-day Dallas, Texas as well as several other communities within the United States, such as the North American Phalanx in New Jersey and Community Place and five others in New York State. Fourierism manifested itself \"in the middle of the 19th century (where) literally hundreds of communes (phalansteries) were founded on fourierist principles in France, N. America, Mexico, S. America, Algeria, Yugoslavia, \"etc\"\".\n\nRobert Owen (1771–1858) advocated the transformation of society into small, local collectives without such elaborate systems of social organization. Owen managed mills for many years. He transformed life in the village of New Lanark with ideas and opportunities which were at least a hundred years ahead of their time. Child labor and corporal punishment were abolished, and villagers were provided with decent homes, schools and evening classes, free health-care, and affordable food.\n\nThe UK government's Factory Act of 1833 attempted to reduce the hours adults and children worked in the textile industry. A fifteen-hour working day was to start at 5.30 a.m. and to cease at 8.30 p.m. Children of nine to thirteen years could work no more than 9 hours, and workers of a younger age were prohibited. There were, however, only four factory inspectors, and factory owners flouted this law. In the same year Owen stated: \n\nLeaving England for the United States, Robert Owen and his sons began an experiment with a socialist community in New Harmony, Indiana in 1825. Advertisements announced the experiment for the cooperative colony, bringing various people to attempt an 8-hour work-day of which Owen was a proponent. The town banned money and other commodities for trade, using \"labour tickets\" denominated in the number of hours worked.\n\nOwen's son, Robert Dale Owen, would say of the failed socialism experiment that the people at New Harmony were \"a heterogeneous collection of radicals, enthusiastic devotees to principle, honest latitudinarians, and lazy theorists, with a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in\". The larger community lasted only until 1827, at which time smaller communities were formed, which led to further subdivision, until individualism replaced socialism in 1828. New Harmony dissolved in 1829 due to constant quarrels as parcels of land and property were sold and returned to private use.\n\nIndividualist anarchist Josiah Warren, who was one of the original participants in the New Harmony Society, saw the community as doomed to failure due to a lack of individual sovereignty and private property. He wrote of the community: \n\nIn a \"Paper Dedicated to the Governments of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, France, Prussia and the United States of America\" written in 1841, Owen wrote: \"The lowest stage of humanity is experienced when the individual must labor for a small pittance of wages from others\".\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) pronounced that \"property is theft\" and that socialism was \"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\". Proudhon termed himself an anarchist and proposed that free association of individuals should replace the coercive state. Proudhon himself, Benjamin Tucker, and others developed these ideas in a mutualist direction, while Mikhail Bakunin (1814–1876), Piotr Kropotkin (1842–1921), and others adapted Proudhon's ideas in a more conventionally socialist direction. In a letter to Marx in 1846, Proudhon wrote:\n\nMikhail Bakunin (1814–1876), the father of modern anarchism, was a libertarian socialist, a theory by which the workers would directly manage the means of production through their own productive associations. There would be \"equal means of subsistence, support, education, and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity, and equal resources and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor.\"\n\nWhile many socialists emphasized the gradual transformation of society, most notably through the foundation of small, utopian communities, a growing number of socialists became disillusioned with the viability of this approach and instead emphasized direct political action. Early socialists were united in their desire for a society based on cooperation rather than competition.\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote, \"abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property\". The French Revolution was preceded and influenced by the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose \"Social Contract\" famously began: \"Man is born free, and he is everywhere in chains\". Rousseau is credited with influencing socialist thought, but it was François-Noël Babeuf, and his \"Conspiracy of Equals\", who is credited with providing a model for left-wing and communist movements of the 19th century.\n\nMarx and Engels drew from these socialist or communist ideas born in the French revolution, as well as from the German philosophy of GWF Hegel, and English political economy, particularly that of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Marx and Engels developed a body of ideas which they called scientific socialism, more commonly called Marxism. Marxism comprised a theory of history (historical materialism) as well as a political, economic and philosophical theory.\n\nIn the \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\", written in 1848 just days before the outbreak of the revolutions of 1848, Marx and Engels wrote, \"The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property\". Unlike those Marx described as utopian socialists, Marx determined that \"[t]he history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\". While utopian socialists believed it was possible to work within or reform capitalist society, Marx confronted the question of the economic and political power of the capitalist class, expressed in their ownership of the means of producing wealth (factories, banks, commerce – in a word, \"Capital\"). Marx and Engels formulated theories regarding the practical way of achieving and running a socialist system, which they saw as only being achieved by those who produce the wealth in society, the toilers, workers or \"proletariat\", gaining common ownership of their workplaces, the means of producing wealth.\n\nMarx believed that capitalism could only be overthrown by means of a revolution carried out by the working class: \"The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority.\" Marx believed that the proletariat was the only class with both the cohesion, the means and the determination to carry the revolution forward. Unlike the utopian socialists, who often idealised agrarian life and deplored the growth of modern industry, Marx saw the growth of capitalism and an urban proletariat as a necessary stage towards socialism.\n\nFor Marxists, socialism or, as Marx termed it, the first phase of communist society, can be viewed as a transitional stage characterized by common or state ownership of the means of production under democratic workers' control and management, which Engels argued was beginning to be realised in the Paris Commune of 1871, before it was overthrown. Socialism to them is simply the transitional phase between capitalism and \"higher phase of communist society\". Because this society has characteristics of both its capitalist ancestor and is beginning to show the properties of communism, it will hold the means of production collectively but distributes commodities according to individual contribution. When the socialist state (the dictatorship of the proletariat) naturally withers away, what will remain is a society in which human beings no longer suffer from alienation and \"all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly\". Here \"society inscribe[s] on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\" For Marx, a communist society entails the absence of differing social classes and thus the end of class warfare. According to Marx and Engels, once a socialist society had been ushered in, the state would begin to \"wither away\" and humanity would be in control of its own destiny for the first time.\n\nIn Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt. The International Workingmen's Association (IWA), also known as the First International, was founded in London in 1864. Victor Le Lubez, a French radical republican living in London, invited Karl Marx to come to London as a representative of German workers. The IWA held a preliminary conference in 1865, and had its first congress at Geneva in 1866. Marx was appointed a member of the committee, and according to Saul Padover, Marx and Johann Georg Eccarius, a tailor living in London, became \"the two mainstays of the International from its inception to its end\". The First International became the first major international forum for the promulgation of socialist ideas. In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the \"First International\") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats.\n\nIn 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF). They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.\n\nThe Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany was founded in 1869 under the influence of Marx and Engels. In 1875, it merged with the General German Workers' Association of Ferdinand Lassalle to become what is known today as the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). Socialism became increasingly associated with newly formed trade unions. In Germany, the SPD founded unions. In Austria, France and other European countries, socialist parties and anarchists played a prominent role in forming and building up trade unions, especially from the 1870s onwards. This stood in contrast to the British experience, where moderate New Model Unions dominated the union movement from the mid-nineteenth century, and where trade unionism was stronger than the political labour movement until the formation and growth of the Labour Party in the early twentieth century.\n\nAt first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as centralist and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against. In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.\n\nIn 1871, in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War an uprising in Paris established the Paris Commune. The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. The 92 members of the \"Communal Council\" included a high proportion of skilled workers and several professionals. Many of them were political activists, ranging from reformist republicans, various types of socialists, to the Jacobins who tended to look back nostalgically to the Revolution of 1789. The \"reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised...Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the \"implementation of the binding mandate\" in 1848...and for federation of communes). George Woodcock manifests that \"a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elisée Reclus and Louise Michel\". \n\nThe veteran leader of the Blanquist group of revolutionary socialists, Louis Auguste Blanqui, was hoped by his followers to be a potential leader of the revolution, but he had been arrested on 17 March and was held in prison throughout the life of the Commune. The Commune unsuccessfully tried to exchange him, first against Georges Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, then against all 74 hostages it detained, but Thiers flatly refused. Some women organized a feminist movement, following on from earlier attempts in 1789 and 1848. Thus, Nathalie Lemel, a socialist bookbinder, and Élisabeth Dmitrieff, a young Russian exile and member of the Russian section of the First International (IWA), created the \"Union des femmes pour la défense de Paris et les soins aux blessés\" (\"Women's Union for the Defense of Paris and Care of the Wounded\") on 11 April 1871. The Women's Union also participated in several municipal commissions and organized cooperative workshops.\n\nAccording to Marx and Engels, for a few weeks the Paris Commune provided a glimpse of a socialist society before it was brutally suppressed by the French government.\n\nFollowing the 1871 Paris Commune, the socialist movement, as the whole of the workers' movement, was decapitated and deeply affected for years.\n\nAs the ideas of Marx and Engels took on flesh, particularly in central Europe, socialists sought to unite in an international organisation. In 1889, on the centennial of the French Revolution of 1789, the Second International was founded, with 384 delegates from 20 countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organizations. Anarchists were ejected and not allowed in mainly because of the pressure from marxists.\n\nJust before his death in 1895, Engels argued that there was now a \"single generally recognised, crystal clear theory of Marx\" and a \"single great international army of socialists\". Despite its illegality due to the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878, the Social Democratic Party of Germany's use of the limited universal male suffrage were \"potent\" new methods of struggle which demonstrated their growing strength and forced the dropping of the Anti-Socialist legislation in 1890, Engels argued. In 1893, the German SPD obtained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of votes cast. However, before the leadership of the SPD published Engels' 1895 Introduction to Marx's \"Class Struggles in France 1848–1850\", they removed certain phrases they felt were too revolutionary.\n\nMarx believed that it was possible to have a peaceful socialist transformation in England, although the British ruling class would then revolt against such a victory. America and the Netherlands might also have a peaceful transformation, but not in France, where Marx believed there had been \"perfected... an enormous bureaucratic and military organisation, with its ingenious state machinery\" which must be forcibly overthrown. However, eight years after Marx's death, Engels argued that it was possible to achieve a peaceful socialist revolution in France, too.\n\nThe SPD was by far the most powerful of the social democratic parties. Its votes reached 4.5 million, it had 90 daily newspapers, together with trade unions and co-ops, sports clubs, a youth organization, a women's organization and hundreds of full-time officials. Under the pressure of this growing party, Bismarck introduced limited welfare provision and working hours were reduced. Germany experienced sustained economic growth for more than forty years. Commentators suggest that this expansion, together with the concessions won, gave rise to illusions amongst the leadership of the SPD that capitalism would evolve into socialism gradually.\n\nBeginning in 1896, in a series of articles published under the title \"Problems of socialism\", Eduard Bernstein argued that an evolutionary transition to socialism was both possible and more desirable than revolutionary change. Bernstein and his supporters came to be identified as \"revisionists\" because they sought to revise the classic tenets of Marxism. Although the orthodox Marxists in the party, led by Karl Kautsky, retained the Marxist theory of revolution as the official doctrine of the party, and it was repeatedly endorsed by SPD conferences, in practice the SPD leadership became increasingly reformist.\n\nBernstein coined the aphorism: \"The movement is everything, the final goal nothing\". But the path of reform appeared blocked to the Russian Marxists while Russia remained the bulwark of reaction. In the preface to the 1882 Russian edition to the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels had saluted the Russian Marxists who, they said, \"formed the vanguard of revolutionary action in Europe\". But the working class, although many were organised in vast modern western-owned enterprises, comprised no more than a small percentage of the population and \"more than half the land is owned in common by the peasants\". Marx and Engels posed the question: How was Russia to progress to socialism? Could Russia \"pass directly\" to socialism or \"must it first pass through the same process\" of capitalist development as the West? They replied: \"If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development.\"\n\nIn 1903, the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party began to split on ideological and organizational questions into Bolshevik ('Majority') and Menshevik ('Minority') factions, with Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin leading the more radical Bolsheviks. Both wings accepted that Russia was an economically backward country unripe for socialism. The Mensheviks awaited the capitalist revolution in Russia. But Lenin argued that a revolution of the workers and peasants would achieve this task. After the Russian revolution of 1905, Leon Trotsky argued that unlike the French revolution of 1789 and the European Revolutions of 1848 against absolutism, the capitalist class would never organise a revolution in Russia to overthrow absolutism, and that this task fell to the working class who, liberating the peasantry from their feudal yoke, would then immediately pass on to the socialist tasks and seek a \"permanent revolution\" to achieve international socialism. Assyrian nationalist Freydun Atturaya tried to create regional self-government for the Assyrian people with the socialism ideology. He even wrote the Urmia Manifesto of the United Free Assyria. However, his attempt was put to an end by Soviet Secret Police.\n\nIn 1877, the Socialist Labor Party of America was founded. This party, which advocated Marxism and still exists today, was a confederation of small Marxist parties and came under the leadership of Daniel De Leon. In 1901, a merger between opponents of De Leon and the younger Social Democratic Party joined with Eugene V. Debs to form the Socialist Party of America. In 1905, the Industrial Workers of the World formed from several independent labor unions. The IWW opposed the political means of Debs and De Leon, as well as the craft unionism of Samuel Gompers. In 1910, the Sewer Socialists, the main group of American socialists, elected Victor Berger as a socialist Congressman and Emil Seidel as a socialist mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, most of the other elected city officials being socialist as well. This Socialist Party of America grew to 150,000 in 1912 and polled 897,000 votes in the presidential campaign of that year, 6 percent of the total vote. Socialist mayor Daniel Hoan, was elected in 1916 and stayed in office until 1940. The final Socialist mayor, Frank P. Zeidler, was elected in 1948 and served three terms, ending in 1960. Milwaukee remained the hub of Socialism during these years. The Socialist Party declined after the First World War. By the 1880s anarcho-communism was already present in the United States as can be seen in the publication of the journal \"Freedom: A Revolutionary Anarchist-Communist Monthly\" by Lucy Parsons and Lizzy Holmes. Around that time these American anarcho-communist sectors entered in debate with the individualist anarchist group around Benjamin Tucker.\n\nFrench socialism was beheaded by the suppression of the Paris commune (1871), its leaders killed or exiled. But in 1879, at the Marseille Congress, workers' associations created the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France. Three years later, Jules Guesde and Paul Lafargue, the son-in-law of Karl Marx, left the federation and founded the French Workers' Party.\n\nThe Federation of the Socialist Workers of France was termed \"possibilist\" because it advocated gradual reforms, whereas the French Workers' Party promoted Marxism. In 1905 these two trends merged to form the French Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière (SFIO), led by Jean Jaurès and later Léon Blum. In 1906 it won 56 seats in Parliament. The SFIO adhered to Marxist ideas but became, in practice, a reformist party. By 1914 it had more than 100 members in the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nWhen World War I began in 1914, many European socialist leaders supported their respective governments' war aims. The social democratic parties in the UK, France, Belgium and Germany supported their respective state's wartime military and economic planning, discarding their commitment to internationalism and solidarity.\n\nLenin, in his April Theses, denounced the war as an imperialist conflict, and urged workers worldwide to use it as an occasion for proletarian revolution. The Second International dissolved during the war, while Lenin, Trotsky, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, together with a small number of other Marxists opposed to the war, came together in the Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915.\n\nAnarchism as a social movement has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the 19th century and the Spanish Civil War-era struggles against fascism.\nIn 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the \"First International\") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats. Proudhon's followers, the mutualists, opposed Marx's state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.\n\nThe anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to \"replace the privilege and authority of the State\" with the \"free and spontaneous organization of labor\".\n\nIn 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). The Federación Obrera Regional Española (Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region) in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. Federación Anarquista Ibérica\n\nSome anarchists, such as Johann Most, advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because \"we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.\" Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement. For example, U.S. President McKinley's assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine. There, in the Free Territory, they fought in the civil war against the Whites (a Western-backed grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state.\n\nIn Spain, the CNT initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists.\n\nA surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international Anarchist conference in Carrara in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France, the Italian and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile. In the United Kingdom this was associated with the punk rock movement, as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged.\n\nAround the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight, and the World Economic Forum. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police, and the confrontations were selectively portrayed in mainstream media coverage as violent riots. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as \"black blocs\"; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A landmark struggle of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999.\n\nInternational anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers' Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels emphasised the Communist Manifesto's emphasis on winning, as a first step, the \"battle of democracy\". Since the 1866 introduction of universal male franchise the SPD had proved that old methods of, \"surprise attacks, of revolutions carried through by small conscious minorities at the head of masses lacking consciousness is past\". Marxists, Engels emphasised, must \"win over the great mass of the people\" before initiating a revolution.\n\nMarx believed that it was possible to have a peaceful socialist revolution in England, America and the Netherlands, but not in France, where he believed there had been \"perfected ... an enormous bureaucratic and military organisation, with its ingenious state machinery\" which must be forcibly overthrown. However, eight years after Marx's death, Engels regarded it possible to achieve a peaceful socialist revolution in France, too.\n\nIn 1896, Eduard Bernstein argued that once full democracy had been achieved, a transition to socialism by gradual means was both possible and more desirable than revolutionary change. Bernstein and his supporters came to be identified as \"revisionists\", because they sought to revise the classic tenets of Marxism. Although the orthodox Marxists in the party, led by Karl Kautsky, retained the Marxist theory of revolution as the official doctrine of the party, and it was repeatedly endorsed by SPD conferences, in practice the SPD leadership became more and more reformist.\n\nIn Europe most Social Democratic parties participated in parliamentary politics and the day-to-day struggles of the trade unions. In the UK, however, many trade unionists who were members of the Social Democratic Federation, which included at various times future trade union leaders such as Will Thorne, John Burns and Tom Mann, felt that the Federation neglected the industrial struggle. Along with Engels, who refused to support the SDF, many felt that dogmatic approach of the SDF, particularly of its leader, Henry Hyndman, meant that it remained an isolated sect. The mass parties of the working class under social democratic leadership became more reformist and lost sight of their revolutionary objective. Thus the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), founded in 1905, under Jean Jaurès and later Léon Blum adhered to Marxist ideas, but became in practice a reformist party.\n\nIn some countries, particularly Britain and the British dominions, labour parties were formed. These were parties largely formed by and controlled by the trade unions, rather than formed by groups of socialist activists who then appealed to the workers for support. In Britain, the Labour Party, (at first the Labour Representation Committee) was established by representatives of trade unions together with affiliated socialist parties, principally the Independent Labour Party but also for a time the avowedly Marxist Social Democratic Federation and other groups, such as the Fabians. On 1 December 1899 Anderson Dawson of the Australian Labor Party became the Premier of Queensland, Australia, forming the world's first parliamentary socialist government . The Dawson government, however, lasted only one week, being defeated at the first sitting of parliament.\n\nThe British Labour Party first won seats in the House of Commons in 1902. It won the majority of the working class away from the Liberal Party after World War I. In Australia, the Labor Party achieved rapid success, forming its first national government in 1904. Labour parties were also formed in South Africa and New Zealand but had less success. The British Labour Party adopted a specifically socialist constitution (‘Clause four, Part four’) in 1918.\n\nThe strongest opposition to revisionism came from socialists in countries such as the Russian Empire where parliamentary democracy did not exist. Chief among these was the Russian Vladimir Lenin, whose works such as \"Our Programme\" (1899) set out the views of those who rejected revisionist ideas. In 1903, there was the beginnings of what eventually became a formal split in the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party into revolutionary Bolshevik and reformist Menshevik factions.\n\nIn 1914, the outbreak of World War I led to a crisis in European socialism. The parliamentary leaderships of the socialist parties of Germany, France, Belgium and Britain each voted to support the war aims of their country's governments, although some leaders, like Ramsay MacDonald in Britain and Karl Liebknecht in Germany, opposed the war from the start. Lenin, in exile in Switzerland, called for revolutions in all the combatant states as the only way to end the war and achieve socialism. Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, together with a small number of other Marxists opposed to the war, came together in the Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915. This conference saw the beginning of the end of the uneasy coexistence of revolutionary socialists with the social democrats, and by 1917 war-weariness led to splits in several socialist parties, notably the German Social Democrats.\n\nThe Russian Revolution of October 1917 led to a withdrawal from World War I, one of the principal demands of the Russian revolution, as the Soviet government immediately sued for peace. Germany and the former allies invaded the new Soviet Russia, which had repudiated the former Romanov regime's national debts and nationalized the banks and major industry. Russia was the only country in the world where socialists had taken power, and it appeared to many socialists to confirm the ideas, strategy and tactics of Lenin and Trotsky.\n\nThe Russian Revolution of October 1917 brought about the definitive ideological division between Communists as denoted with a capital \"C\" on the one hand and other communist and socialist trends such as anarcho-communists and social democrats, on the other. The Left Opposition in the Soviet Union gave rise to Trotskyism which was to remain isolated and insignificant for another fifty years, except in Sri Lanka where Trotskyism gained the majority and the pro-Moscow wing was expelled from the Communist Party.\n\nIn 1922, the fourth congress of the Communist International took up the policy of the United Front, urging Communists to work with rank and file Social Democrats while remaining critical of their leaders, who they criticised for \"betraying\" the working class by supporting the war efforts of their respective capitalist classes. For their part, the social democrats pointed to the dislocation caused by revolution and later the growing authoritarianism of the Communist Parties. When the Communist Party of Great Britain applied to affiliate to the Labour Party in 1920 it was turned down.\n\nAfter three years, the First World War, at first greeted with enthusiastic patriotism, produced an upsurge of radicalism in most of Europe and also as far afield as the United States (\"see Socialism in the United States\") and Australia. In the Russian revolution of February 1917, workers' councils (in Russian, \"soviets\") had been formed, and Lenin and the Bolsheviks called for \"All power to the Soviets\". After the October 1917 Russian revolution, led by Lenin and Trotsky, consolidated power in the Soviets, Lenin declared \"Long live the world socialist revolution!\". Briefly in Soviet Russia socialism was not just a vision of a future society, but a description of an existing one. The Soviet regime began to bring all the means of production (except agricultural production) under state control, and implemented a system of government through the workers' councils or soviets.\n\nThe initial success of the Russian Revolution inspired other revolutionary parties to attempt the same thing unleashing the Revolutions of 1917-23. In the chaotic circumstances of postwar Europe, with the socialist parties divided and discredited, Communist revolutions across Europe seemed a possibility. Communist parties were formed, often from minority or majority factions in most of the world's socialist parties, which broke away in support of the Leninist model.\n\nThe German Revolution of 1918 overthrew the old absolutism and, like Russia, set up Workers' and Soldiers' Councils almost entirely made up of SPD and Independent Social Democrats (USPD) members. The Weimar republic was established and placed the SPD in power, under the leadership of Friedrich Ebert. Ebert agreed with Max von Baden that a social revolution was to be prevented and the state order must be upheld at any cost. In 1919 the Spartacist uprising challenged the power of the SPD government, but it was put down in blood and the German Communist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were assassinated. Communist regimes briefly held power under Béla Kun in Hungary and under Kurt Eisner in Bavaria. There were further revolutionary movements in Germany until 1923, as well as in Vienna, and also in the industrial centres of northern Italy.\n\nIn this period few Communists doubted, least of all Lenin and Trotsky, that successful socialist revolutions carried out by the working classes of the most developed capitalist counties were essential to the success of the socialism, and therefore to the success of socialism in Russia in particular. In March 1918, Lenin said: \"We are doomed if the German revolution does not break out\". In 1919, the Communist Parties came together to form a 'Third International', termed the Communist International or Comintern. But the prolonged revolutionary period in Germany did not bring a socialist revolution.\n\nA marxist current critical of the bolcheviks emerged and as such \"Luxemburg's workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period – Pannekoek, Roland Holst, and Gorter in the Netherlands, Sylvia Pankhurst in Britain, Gramsci in Italy, Lukacs in Hungary. In these formulations, the dictatorship of the proletariat was to be the dictatorship of a class, \"not of a party or of a clique\". However, within this line of thought \"[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity...The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and Lukacs...The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form.\" In the emerging Soviet state there appeared Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks which were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks led or supported by left wing groups including Socialist Revolutionaries, Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists. Some were in support of the White Movement while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the Russian Civil War and after until 1922. In response the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force.\n\nWithin a few years a bureaucracy developed in Russia as a result of the Russian Civil War, foreign invasion, and Russia's historic poverty and backwardness. The bureaucracy undermined the democratic and socialist ideals of the Bolshevik Party and elevated Stalin to their leadership after Lenin's death. In order to consolidate power, the bureaucracy conducted a brutal campaign of lies and violence against the Left Opposition led by Trotsky.\n\nBy the mid 1920s, the impetus had gone out of the revolutionary forces in Europe and the national reformist socialist parties had regained their dominance over the working-class movement in most countries. The German Social Democrats held office for much of the 1920s, the British Labour Party formed its first government in 1924, and the French Socialists were also influential. In the Soviet Union, from 1924 Stalin pursued a policy of \"socialism in one country\". Trotsky argued that this approach was a shift away from the theory of Marx and Lenin, while others argued that it was a practical compromise fit for the times.\n\nThe postwar revolutionary upsurge provoked a powerful reaction from the forces of conservatism. Winston Churchill declared that Bolshevism must be \"strangled in its cradle\". The invasion of Russia by the Allies, their trade embargo and backing for the White forces fighting against the Red Army in the civil war in the Soviet Union was cited by Aneurin Bevan, the leader of the left-wing in the Labour Party, as one of the causes of the Russian revolution's degeneration into dictatorship. A \"Red scare\" in the United States was raised against the American Socialist Party of Eugene V. Debs and the Communist Party of America which arose after the Russian revolution from members who had broken from Debs' party. In Europe, fascist movements received significant funding, particularly from industrialists in heavy industry, and came to power in Italy in 1922 under Benito Mussolini, and later in Germany in 1933, in Spain (1937) and Portugal, while strong fascist movements also developed in Hungary and Romania.\n\nAfter 1929, with the Left Opposition legally banned and Trotsky exiled, Stalin led the Soviet Union into a what he termed a \"higher stage of socialism.\" Agriculture was forcibly collectivised, at the cost of a massive famine and millions of deaths among the resistant peasantry. The surplus squeezed from the peasants was spent on a program of crash industrialisation, guided by the Communist Party through the Five Year Plan. This program produced some impressive results, though at enormous human costs. Russia raised itself from an economically backward country to that of a superpower. Later Soviet development, however, particularly after the Second World War, was no faster than it was in Japan or the United States under capitalism. The use of resources, material and human, in the Soviet Union became very wasteful. Stalin's industrialization policy was geared towards the development of heavy industry, an emphasis that facilitated Soviet military action in its defence against Hitler's invasion during the Second World War in which the USSR stood on the side of the Allies of World War II. For \"many Marxian libertarian socialists, the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The Bordigists and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return “behind Marx” to the anti-positivist programme of German idealism. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy... Karl Korsch... remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of practice in a theory’s truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx’s Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes. \"\n\nThe Soviet achievement in the 1930s seemed hugely impressive from the outside, and convinced many people, not necessarily Communists or even socialists, of the virtues of state planning and authoritarian models of social development. This was later to have important consequences in countries like China, India and Egypt, which tried to copy some aspects of the Soviet model. It also won large sections of the western intelligentsia over to a pro-Soviet view, to the extent that many were willing to ignore or excuse such events as Stalin's Great Purge of 1936-38, in which millions of people died.\n\nThe Great Depression, which began in 1929, seemed to socialists and Communists everywhere to be the final proof of the bankruptcy, literally as well as politically, of capitalism. But socialists were unable to take advantage of the Depression to either win elections or stage revolutions. Labor governments in Britain and Australia were disastrous failures. In the United States, the liberalism of President Franklin D. Roosevelt won mass support and deprived socialists of any chance of gaining ground. And in Germany it was the fascists of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party who successfully exploited the Depression to win power, in January 1933.\n\nHitler's regime swiftly destroyed both the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, the worst blow the world socialist movement had ever suffered. This forced Stalin to reassess his strategy, and from 1935 the Comintern began urging a Popular Front against fascism. The socialist parties were at first suspicious, given the bitter hostility of the 1920s, but eventually effective Popular Fronts were formed in both France and Spain. After the election of a Popular Front government in Spain in 1936 a fascist military revolt led to the Spanish Civil War. The crisis in Spain also brought down the Popular Front government in France under Léon Blum. Ultimately the Popular Fronts were not able to prevent the spread of fascism or the aggressive plans of the fascist powers. Trotskyists considered Popular Fronts a \"strike breaking conspiracy\" and considered them an impediment to successful resistance to fascism.\n\nWhen Stalin consolidated his power in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s, Trotsky was forced into exile, eventually residing in Mexico. He maintained active in organizing the Left Opposition internationally, which worked within the Comintern to gain new members. Some leaders of the Communist Parties sided with Trotsky, such as James P. Cannon in the United States. They found themselves expelled by the Stalinist Parties and persecuted by both GPU agents and the political police in Britain, France, the United States, China, and all over the world. Trotskyist parties had a large influence in Sri Lanka and Bolivia. \n\nIn 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded a new international organisation of dissident communists, the Fourth International. In his \"Results and Prospects\" and \"Permanent Revolution\" Trotsky developed a theory of revolution uninterrupted by the stagism of Stalinist orthodoxy. He argued that Russia was a bureaucratically degenerated workers state in his work \"The Revolution Betrayed\", where he predicted (?) that if a political revolution of the working class did not overthrow Stalinism, the Stalinist bureaucracy would resurrect capitalism. Trotsky's \"History of the Russian Revolution\" is considered a work of primary importance by Trotsky's followers. \n\nOnce the world's most powerful nation, Britain avoided a revolution during the period of 1917–1923 but was significantly affected by revolt. The Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, had promised the troops in the 1918 election that his Conservative-led coalition would make post-war Britain \"a fit land for heroes to live in\". But many demobbed troops complained of chronic unemployment and suffered low pay, disease and poor housing.\n\nIn 1918, the Labour Party adopted as its aim to secure for the workers, \"the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange\". In 1919, the Miners Federation, whose Members of Parliament pre-dated the formation of the Labour Party and were since 1906 a part of that body, demanded the withdrawal of British troops from Soviet Russia. The 1919 Labour Party conference voted to discuss the question of affiliation to the Third (Communist) International, \"to the distress of its leaders\". A vote was won committing the Labour Party committee of the Trades Union Congress to arrange \"direct industrial action\" to \"stop capitalist attacks upon the Socialist Republics of Russia and Hungary.\" The threat of immediate strike action forced the Conservative-led coalition government to abandon its intervention in Russia.\n\nIn 1914 the unions of the transport workers, the mine workers and the railway workers had formed a Triple Alliance. In 1919, Lloyd George sent for the leaders of the Triple Alliance, one of whom was miner's leader Robert Smillie, a founder member of the Independent Labour Party in 1889 who was to become a Labour Party MP in the first 1924 Labour government. According to Smillie, Lloyd George said: \n\n\"From that moment on\", Smillie conceded to Aneurin Bevan, \"we were beaten and we knew we were\". When the UK General Strike of 1926 broke out, the trade union leaders, \"had never worked out the revolutionary implications of direct action on such a scale\", Bevan says. Bevan was a member of the Independent Labour Party and one of the leaders of the South Wales miners during the strike. The TUC called off the strike after nine days. In the North East of England and elsewhere, \"councils of action\" were set up, with many rank and file Communist Party members often playing a critical role. The councils of action took control of essential transport and other duties. When the strike ended, the miners were locked out and remained locked out for six months. Bevan became a Labour MP in 1929.\n\nIn January 1924, the Labour Party formed a minority government for the first time with Ramsay MacDonald as prime minister. The Labour Party intended to ratify an Anglo-Russian trade agreement, which would break the trade embargo on Russia. This was attacked by the Conservatives and new elections took place in October 1924. Four days before polling day the \"Daily Mail\" published the Zinoviev letter, a forgery that claimed the Labour Party had links with Soviet Communists and was secretly fomenting revolution. The fears instilled by the press of a Labour Party in secret Communist manoeuvres, together with the half-hearted \"respectable\" policies pursued by MacDonald, led to Labour losing the October 1924 general election. The victorious Conservatives repudiated the Anglo-Soviet treaty.\n\nThe leadership of the Labour Party, like social democratic parties almost everywhere, (with the exception of Sweden and Belgium), tried to pursue a policy of moderation and economic orthodoxy. At times of depression this policy was not popular with the Labour Party's working class supporters. The influence of Marxism grew in the Labour Party during the inter-war years. Anthony Crosland argued in 1956 that under the impact of the 1931 slump and the growth of fascism, the younger generation of left-wing intellectuals for the most part \"took to Marxism\" including the \"best-known leaders\" of the Fabian tradition, Sidney and Beatrice Webb. The Marxist Professor Harold Laski, who was to be chairman of the Labour Party in 1945-6, was the \"outstanding influence\" in the political field.\n\nThe Marxists within the Labour Party differed in their attitude to the Communists. Some were uncitical and some were expelled as \"fellow travellers\", while in the 1930s others were Trotskyists and sympathisers working inside the Labour Party, especially in its youth wing where they were influential.\n\nIn the general election of 1929 the Labour Party won 288 seats out of 615 and formed another minority government. The depression of that period brought high unemployment and Prime Minister MacDonald sought to make cuts in order to balance the budget. The trade unions opposed MacDonald's proposed cuts and he split the Labour government to form the National Government of 1931. This experience moved the Labour Party leftward, and at the start of the Second World War an official Labour Party pamphlet written by Harold Laski argued that, \"the rise of Hitler and the methods by which he seeks to maintain and expand his power are deeply rooted in the economic and social system of Europe... economic nationalism, the fight for markets, the destruction of political democracy, the use of war as an instrument of national policy\": \n\nAfter embracing anarchism, Albert Parsons turned his activity to the growing movement to establish the 8-hour day. In January 1880, the Eight-Hour League of Chicago sent Parsons to a national conference in Washington, D.C., a gathering which launched a national lobbying movement aimed at coordinating efforts of labor organizations to win and enforce the 8-hour workday. In the fall of 1884, Parsons launched a weekly anarchist newspaper in Chicago, \"The Alarm.\" The first issue was dated October 4, 1884, and was produced in a press run of 15,000 copies. The publication was a 4-page broadsheet with a cover price of 5 cents. \"The Alarm\" listed the International Working People's Association as its publisher and touted itself as \"A Socialistic Weekly\" on its page 2 masthead. On May 1, 1886, Parsons, with his wife Lucy Parsons and two children, led 80,000 people down Michigan Avenue, in what is regarded as the first-ever May Day Parade, in support of the eight-hour work day. Over the next few days 340,000 laborers joined the strike. Parsons, amidst the May Day Strike, found himself called to Cincinnati, where 300,000 workers had struck that Saturday afternoon. On that Sunday he addressed the rally in Cincinnati of the news from the \"storm center\" of the strike and participated in a second huge parade, led by 200 members of The Cincinnati Rifle Union, with certainty that victory was at hand. In 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard. In response, unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day on 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday. Albert Parsons is best remembered as one of four Chicago radical leaders convicted of conspiracy and hanged following a bomb attack on police remembered as the Haymarket affair. Emma Goldman, the activist and political theorist, was attracted to anarchism after reading about the incident and the executions, which she later described as \"the events that had inspired my spiritual birth and growth.\" She considered the Haymarket martyrs to be \"the most decisive influence in my existence\". Her associate, Alexander Berkman also described the Haymarket anarchists as \"a potent and vital inspiration.\" Others whose commitment to anarchism crystallized as a result of the Haymarket affair included Voltairine de Cleyre and \"Big Bill\" Haywood, a founding member of the Industrial Workers of the World. Goldman wrote to historian, Max Nettlau, that the Haymarket affair had awakened the social consciousness of \"hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people\".\n\nIn the Presidential election of 1912, Eugene V. Debs received 5.99% of the popular vote (a total of 901,551 votes), while his total of 913,693 votes in the 1920 campaign, although smaller percentage-wise, remains the all-time high for a Socialist Party candidate in the United States.\n\nIn the United States, the Communist Party USA was formed in 1919 from former adherents of the Socialist Party of America. One of the founders, James Cannon, later became the leader of Trotskyist forces outside the Soviet Union. The Great Depression began in the US on Black Tuesday, October 29, 1929. Unemployment rates passed 25%, prices and incomes fell 20–50%, but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. 9,000 banks failed during the decade of the 30s. By 1933, depositors saw $140 billion of their deposits disappear due to uninsured bank failures.\n\nIn 1921 occurred the largest armed, organized uprising in American labor history: the Battle of Blair Mountain. Ten to fifteen thousand coal miners rebelled in West Virginia, assaulting mountain-top lines of trenches established by the coal companies and local sheriff's forces.\n\nWorkers organized against their deteriorating conditions and socialists played a critical role. In 1934 the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike led by the Trotskyist Communist League of America, the West Coast Longshore Strike led by the Communist Party USA, and the Toledo Auto-Lite Strike led by the American Workers Party, played an important role in the formation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the USA.\n\nIn Minnesota, the General Drivers Local 574 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters struck, despite an attempt to block the vote by AFL officials, demanding union recognition, increased wages, shorter hours, overtime rates, improved working conditions and job protection through seniority. In the battles that followed, which captured country-wide media attention, three strikes took place, martial law was declared and the National Guard was sent in. Two strikers were killed. Protest rallies of 40,000 were held. Farrell Dobbs, who became the leader of the local, had at the outset joined the \"small and poverty-stricken\" Communist League of America, founded by James P. Cannon and others in 1928 after their expulsion from the Communist Party USA for Trotskyism.\n\nSuccess for the CIO quickly followed its formation. In 1937, one of the founding unions of the CIO, the United Auto Workers, won union recognition at General Motors Corporation after a tumultuous forty-four-day sit-down strike, while the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, which was formed by the CIO, won a collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Steel. The CIO merged with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1955 becoming the AFL-CIO.\n\nIn 1928, the Communist International, now fully under the leadership of Stalin, turned from the united front policy to an ultra-left policy of the Third Period, a policy of aggressive confrontation of social democracy. This divided the working class at a critical time.\n\nLike the Labour Party in the UK, the Social Democratic Party in Germany, which was in power in 1928, followed an orthodox deflationary policy and pressed for reductions in unemployment benefits in order to save taxes and reduce budget deficits. These policies did not halt the recession and the government resigned.\n\nThe Communists described the Social Democratic leaders as \"social fascists\" and in the Prussian Landtag they voted with the Nazis to bring down the Social Democratic government. Fascism continued to grow, with powerful backing from industrialists, especially in heavy industry, and Hitler was invited into power in 1933.\n\nHitler's regime swiftly destroyed both the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, the worst blow the world socialist movement had ever suffered. This forced Stalin to reassess his strategy, and from 1935 the Comintern began urging the formation of Popular Fronts, which were to include not just the Social Democratic parties but critically also \"progressive capitalist\" parties which were wedded to a capitalist policy.\n\nAfter the election of a Popular Front government in Spain in 1936 a fascist military revolt led to the Spanish Civil War. The crisis in Spain brought down the Popular Front government in France under Léon Blum. Ultimately the Popular Fronts were not able to prevent the spread of fascism or the aggressive plans of the fascist powers. Trotskyists considered Popular Fronts a \"strike breaking conspiracy\", an impediment to successful resistance to fascism due to their inclusion of pro-capitalist parties which demanded policies of opposition to strikes and workers’ actions against the capitalist class.\n\nThe Swedish Socialists formed a government in 1932. They broke with economic orthodoxy during the depression and carried out extensive public works financed from government borrowing. They emphasised large-scale intervention and the high unemployment they had inherited was eliminated by 1938. Their success encouraged the adoption of Keynesian policies of deficit financing pursued by almost all Western countries after World War II.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, anarchists set up different forms of cooperative and communal arrangements, especially in the rural areas of Aragon and Catalonia. However, these communes were disbanded by the Popular Front government.\n\nJewish Zionists established utopian socialist communities in Palestine, which were known as kibbutzim, a small number of which still survive.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), a reformist socialist political party that was up to then based upon revisionist Marxism, began a transition away from Marxism towards liberal socialism beginning in the 1930s. After the party was banned by the Nazi regime in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the Sopade. In 1934 the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism. Sopade member Curt Geyer was a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, and declared that Sopade represented the tradition of Weimar Republic social democracy—liberal democratic socialism, and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism. After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, The SPD's Godesberg Program in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist-aligned policies. The SPD then became officially based upon \"freiheitlicher Sozialismus\" (liberal socialism). West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has been identified as a liberal socialist.\n\nIn 1945, the world's three great powers met at the Yalta Conference to negotiate an amicable and stable peace. UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined USA President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee. With the relative decline of Britain compared to the two superpowers, the USA and the Soviet Union, however, many viewed the world as \"bi-polar\"a world with two irreconcilable and antagonistic political and economic systems.\n\nAs a result of the failure of the Popular Fronts and the inability of Britain and France to conclude a defensive alliance against Hitler, Stalin again changed his policy in August 1939 and signed a non-aggression pact, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, with Nazi Germany. Shortly afterwards World War II broke out, and within two years Hitler had occupied most of Europe, and by 1942 both democracy and social democracy in central Europe fell under the threat of fascism. The only socialist parties of any significance able to operate freely were those in Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. But the entry of the Soviet Union into the war in 1941 marked the turning of the tide against fascism, and as the German armies retreated another great upsurge in left-wing sentiment swelled up in their wake. The resistance movements against German occupation were mostly led by socialists and communists, and by the end of the war the parties of the left were greatly strengthened.\n\nOne of the great postwar victories of democratic socialism was the election victory of the British Labour Party led by Clement Attlee in June 1945. Socialist (and in some places Stalinist) parties also dominated postwar governments in France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Norway and other European countries. The Social Democratic Party had been in power in Sweden since 1932, and Labour parties also held power in Australia and New Zealand. In Germany, on the other hand, the Social Democrats emerged from the war much weakened, and were defeated in Germany's first democratic elections in 1949. The united front between democrats and the Stalinist parties which had been established in the wartime resistance movements continued in the immediate postwar years. The democratic socialist parties of Eastern Europe, however, were destroyed when Stalin imposed so-called \"Communist\" regimes in these countries.\n\nThe Second International, which had been based in Amsterdam, ceased to operate during the war. It was refounded as the Socialist International at a congress in Frankfurt in 1951. Since Stalin had dissolved the Comintern in 1943, as part of a deal with the imperialist powers, this was now the only effective international socialist organisation. The Frankfurt Declaration took a stand against both capitalism and the Communism of Stalin: Anarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day. Anarcho-pacifism became a \"basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.\" The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's , \"Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)\".\n\nThe first socialist government of Canada and one of the most influential came to power in the province of Saskatchewan in 1944. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation of Tommy Douglas won an overwhelming victory toppling the age old Liberal regime which had dominated Saskatchewan politics since the founding of the province in 1905. Douglas and the CCF won five consecutive electoral victories. During his time in office he created the Saskatchewan Power Corp. which extended electricity services to the many rural villages and farms who before did without, created Canada's first public automobile insurance agency, created a substantial number of Crown Corporations (government and public owned businesses) many of which still exist today in Saskatchewan, allowed the unionization of the public service, created the first system of Universal Health Care in Canada (which would later be adopted nationally in 1965), and created Saskatchewan's Bill of Rights, the first such charter in Canada. This preceded the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as the previous Canadian Bill of Rights.\n\nThe New Democratic Party (as the CCF became known in 1962) went on to dominate the politics of Saskatchewan and form governments in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and the Yukon Territory. Nationally the NDP would become very influential during four minority governments, and is today by far Canada's most successful left-wing political party.\nIn 2004 Canadians voted Tommy Douglas in as \"The Greatest Canadian\" as part of a nationwide contest organized by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).\n\nThe social democratic governments in the post war period introduced measures of social reform and wealth redistribution through state welfare and taxation policy. For instance the newly elected UK Labour government carried out nationalisations of major utilities such as mines, gas, coal, electricity, rail, iron and steel, and the Bank of England. France claimed to be the most state controlled capitalist country in the world, carrying through many nationalisations. In the UK the National Health Service was established bringing free health care to all for the first time. Social housing for working-class families was provided in council housing estates and university education was made available for working-class people through a grant system.\n\nHowever, the parliamentary leadership of the social democracies in general had no intention of ending capitalism, and their national outlook and their dedication to the maintenance of the post-war 'order' prevented the social democracies from making any significant changes to the economy. They were termed 'socialist' by all in 1945, but in the UK, for instance, where Social Democracy had a large majority in Parliament, \"The government had not the smallest intention of bringing in the 'common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange'\" as written in Clause 4 of the Labour Party constitution. In Germany, the Social Democratic Party of Germany adopted the Godesberg Program in 1959, which rejected class struggle and Marxism.\n\nIn the UK, cabinet minister Herbert Morrison famously argued that, \"Socialism is what the Labour government does\", and Anthony Crosland argued that capitalism had been ended. However many socialists within the social democracy, at rank and file level as well as in a minority in the leadership such as Aneurin Bevan, feared the 'return of the 1930s' unless capitalism was ended, either directly or over a definite period of time. They criticised the government for not going further to take over the commanding heights of the economy. Bevan demanded that the \"main streams of economic activity are brought under public direction\" with economic planning, and criticised the Labour Party's implementation of nationalisation for not empowering the workers in the nationalised industries with democratic control over their operation. In the post war period, many Trotskyists expected at first the pattern of financial instability and recession to return. Instead the capitalist world, now led by the United States, embarked on a prolonged boom which lasted until 1973. Rising living standards across Europe and North America alongside low unemployment, was achieved, in the view of the socialists, by the efforts of trade union struggle, social reform by social democracy, and the ushering in of what was termed a \"mixed economy\".\n\nSocial democracy at first took the view that they had begun a \"serious assault\" on the five \"Giant Evils\" afflicting the working class, identified for instance by the British social reformer William Beveridge: \"Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness\".\n\nAt the same time, the wartime alliance between the Soviet Union and the west broke down from 1946 onwards, and relations between the Communist parties and the democratic socialist parties broke down in parallel. Once the Stalinists helped stabilize the capitalist governments in the immediate upheavals of 1945, as per the agreements betweens Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill, the capitalist politicians had no more use for them. The French, Italian and Belgian Communists withdrew or were expelled from post-war coalition governments, and civil war broke out in Greece. The imposition of Stalinist regimes in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia not only destroyed the socialist parties in those countries, it also produced a reaction against socialism in general. The Australian and New Zealand Labour governments were defeated in 1949, and the British Labour government in 1951. As the Cold War deepened, conservative rule in Britain, Germany and Italy became more strongly entrenched. Only in the Scandinavian countries and to some extent in France did the socialist parties retain their positions. But in 1958 Charles de Gaulle seized power in France and the French socialists (SFIO) found themselves cast into opposition.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the new social forces, introduced, the social democrats argued, by their 'mixed economy' and their many reforms of capitalism, began to change the political landscape in the western world. The long postwar boom and the rapid expansion of higher education produced, as well as rising living standards for the industrial working class, a mass university-educated white collar workforce, nevertheless began to break down the old socialist-versus-conservative polarity of European politics. This new white-collar workforce, some claimed, was less interested in traditional socialist policies such as state ownership and more interested expanded personal freedom and liberal social policies. The proportion of women in the paid workforce increased and many supported the struggle for equal pay, which, some argued, changed both the composition and the political outlook of the working class. Some socialist parties reacted more flexibly and successfully to these changes than others, but eventually the leaderships of all social democracies in Europe moved to an explicitly pro-capitalist stance. Symbolically in the UK, the socialist clause, Clause four, was removed from the Labour Party constitution, in 1995. A similar change took place in the German SDP.\n\nHowever, particularly after the coming to power of British Premier Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and US President Ronald Reagan in 1981, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, many social democratic party leaders were won to the ideological offensive which argued that capitalism had \"won\" and that, in the words of Francis Fukuyama's essay, capitalism had reached \"the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\". Some parties reacted to these changes by engaging in a new round of revisionist re-assessment of socialist ideology, and adopting a neo-liberal outlook. Some critics argue that in practice the Social Democratic parties, and the Labour Party in particular, can no longer be described as socialist. On Prime Minister Tony Blair's departure in June 2007, left wing trade union leader Bob Crow, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers union (RMT), argued that Blair will be remembered for \"seamlessly continuing the neo-liberal economic and social policies of Margaret Thatcher\".\n\nAnother manifestation of this changing social landscape was the rise of mass discontent, including the radical student movement, both in the United States – where it was driven mainly by opposition to the Vietnam War, and in Europe. Aside from the Civil Rights Movement, in which socialists participated, the anti-war movement was the first left-wing upsurge in the United States since the 1930s, but neither there nor in Europe did the traditional parties of the left lead the movement. In the mid-20th century some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with Trotskyism which presented itself as leninist anti-stalinism. As such the French group \"Socialisme ou Barbarie\" emerged from the Trotskyist Fourth International, where Castoriadis and Claude Lefort constituted a Chaulieu–Montal Tendency in the French Parti Communiste Internationaliste in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\", leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that \"the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German \"left\" of the 1920s\". Instead Trotskyist, Maoist and anarchist groups arose. They became particularly influential in 1968, when riots amounting almost to an insurrection broke out in Paris in May 1968. Between eight and ten million workers struck, challenging the view becoming popular amongst socialists at the time that the working class were no longer a force for change. There were also major disturbances such as the 1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity in Chicago, the Columbia University protests of 1968 in New York, the embryonic Red Army Faction in Berlin, and in other cities. In the short-term these movements provoked a conservative backlash, seen in De Gaulle's 1968 election victory and the election of Richard Nixon in the United States. But in the 1970s, as particularly the far left Trotskyist groups continued to grow, the socialist and Communist parties again sought to channel people's anger back into safe confines, as they did in 1945.\n\nThe British Labour Party had already returned to office under Harold Wilson in 1964, and in 1969 the German Social Democrats came to power for the first time since the 1920s under Willy Brandt. In France François Mitterrand buried the corpse of the old socialist party, the SFIO, and founded a new Socialist Party in 1971, although it would take him a decade to lead it to power. Labour governments were elected in both Australia and New Zealand in 1972, and the Austrian Socialists under Bruno Kreisky formed their first post-war government in 1970.\n\nThe emergence of the New Left in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in libertarian socialism. The New Left's critique of the Old Left's authoritarianism was associated with a strong interest in personal liberty, autonomy (see the thinking of Cornelius Castoriadis) and led to a rediscovery of older socialist traditions, such as left communism, council communism, and the Industrial Workers of the World. The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like \"Radical America\" and \"Black Mask\" in America, \"Solidarity\", \"Big Flame\" and \"Democracy & Nature\", succeeded by \"The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy\", in the UK, introduced a range of left libertarian ideas to a new generation. Social ecology, autonomism and, more recently, participatory economics (parecon), and Inclusive Democracy emerged from this.\nThe New Left in the United States also included anarchist, countercultural and hippie-related radical groups such as the Yippies who were led by Abbie Hoffman, The Diggers and Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers. By late 1966, the Diggers opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art. The Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers led by Gerrard Winstanley and sought to create a mini-society free of money and capitalism. On the other hand, the Yippies employed theatrical gestures, such as advancing a pig (\"Pigasus the Immortal\") as a candidate for President in 1968, to mock the social status quo. They have been described as a highly theatrical, anti-authoritarian and anarchist youth movement of \"symbolic politics\". Since they were well known for street theater and politically themed pranks, many of the \"old school\" political left either ignored or denounced them. According to ABC News, \"The group was known for street theater pranks and was once referred to as the 'Groucho Marxists'.\"\nAutonomist Marxism, Neo-Marxism and Situationist theory are also regarded as being anti-authoritarian variants of Marxism that are firmly within the libertarian socialist tradition. For libcom.org \"In the 1980's and 90's, a series of other groups developed, influenced also by much of the above work. The most notable are Kolinko, Kurasje and Wildcat in Germany, \"Aufheben\" in England, Theorie Communiste in France, TPTG in Greece and Kamunist Kranti in India. They are also connected to other groups in other countries, merging autonomia, operaismo, Hegelian Marxism, the work of the JFT, Open Marxism, the ICO, the Situationist International, anarchism and post-68 German Marxism.\" Related to this were intellectuals who were influenced by Italian left communist Amadeo Bordiga but who disagreed with his leninist positions; these included the French publication \"Invariance\" edited by Jacques Camatte, published since 1968, and Gilles Dauve who published \"Troploin\" with Karl Nesic.\n\nAfter the Stonewall Rebellion, the New York Gay Liberation Front based their organization in part on a reading of Murray Bookchin's anarchist writings.\". In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France, the Italian and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile. During the events of May 68 the anarchist groups active in France were Fédération anarchiste, Mouvement communiste libertaire, Union fédérale des anarchistes, Alliance ouvrière anarchiste, Union des groupes anarchistes communistes, Noir et Rouge, Confédération nationale du travail, Union anarcho-syndicaliste, Organisation révolutionnaire anarchiste, \"Cahiers socialistes libertaires\", \"À contre-courant\", \"La Révolution prolétarienne\", and the publications close to Émile Armand.\n\nThe early 1970s were a particularly stormy period for socialists, as capitalism had its first world wide slump of 1973-4, suffered from rising oil prices, and a crisis in confidence. In southern Europe, for example, the Portuguese Carnation Revolution of 1974 threatened the existence of capitalism for a while due to the insurrection and the occupations which followed. A \"New York Times\" editorial on February 17, 1975, stated \"a communist takeover of Portugal might encourage a similar trend in Italy and France, create problems in Greece and Turkey, affect the succession in Spain and Yugoslavia and send tremors throughout Western Europe.\" The Greek military dictatorship fell in Greece, PASOK arose at first with a strong socialist outlook, and in Spain, the Franco dictatorship fell in a period of rising struggle. In Italy there was continual unrest, and governments fell almost annually. The Italian workers won and defended the \"scala mobile\", the sliding scale of wages linked to inflation. However, as before, neither the Communists nor the social democracy had any plans to abolish capitalism, and the occupations in Portugal, variously estimated to have taken between 70 - 90% of the economy, were gradually rolled back. The UK saw a state of emergency and the three-day week, with 22 million days lost in strike action in 1972, leading to the fall of the Heath government. The Trotskyist Militant, an entryist group active in the Labour Party, became the \"fifth most important political party\"in the UK for a period in the mid-1980s, according to the journalist Michael Crick.\n\nIn Indonesia within the Indonesian killings of 1965–66 a right wing military regime killed between 300,000 and one million people mainly to cruch the growing influence of the Communist Party of Indonesia and other leftist sectors In Latin America in the 1960s a socialist tendency within the catholic church appeared which was called Liberation theology\n\nImmediately after the Second World War, a period known as the Cold War began. It represented a period of conflict, tension and competition between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies. Throughout the period, the rivalry between the two superpowers was played out in multiple arenas: military coalitions; ideology, psychology, and espionage; military, industrial, and technological developments, including the space race; costly defense spending; a massive conventional and nuclear arms race; and many proxy wars.\n\nThe term \"Cold War\" was introduced in 1947 by Americans Bernard Baruch and Walter Lippmann to describe emerging tensions between the two former wartime allies. There never was a direct military engagement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but there was a half-century of military buildup, and political battles for support around the world, including significant involvement of allied and satellite nations. Although the U.S. and the Soviet Union had been allied against Nazi Germany, the two sides differed on how to reconstruct the postwar world even before the end of World War II. Over the following decades, the Cold War spread outside Europe to every region of the world, as the U.S. sought the \"containment\" of communism and forged numerous alliances to this end, particularly in Western Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 1946, speaking at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, former British prime minister Winston Churchill warned that, \"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.\"\n\nIn the months that followed, Josef Stalin continued to solidify a Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe. For example, Bulgaria received its new Communist premier, Georgi Dimitrov, in November 1946, a Communist government under Bolesław Bierut had been established in Poland already in 1945, and by 1947, Hungary and Romania had also come under full communist rule. The last democratic government in the eastern bloc, Czechoslovakia, fell to a Communist coup in 1948, and in 1949 the Soviets raised their occupation zone in Germany to become the German Democratic Republic under Walter Ulbricht.\n\nTo coordinate their new empire, the Soviets established a number of international organizations, first the Cominform to coordinate the policies of the various Communist parties, then the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), in 1948, to control economic planning, and finally (in response to the entry of the Federal Republic of Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) the Warsaw Pact in 1955, which served as a military alliance against the west.\n\nBut one crack within that sphere of influence emerged after 1948, when Marshal Josip Broz Tito became the president of Yugoslavia. Initial disagreement was over the level of independence claimed by Tito as the only East European Communist ruler commanding a strong domestic majority. Later the gap widened when Tito's government initiated a system of decentralized profit-sharing workers' councils, in effect a self-governing, somewhat market-oriented socialism, which Stalin considered dangerously revisionist.\n\nStalin died in 1953. In the power struggle that followed Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev emerged triumphant. In 1956, at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he denounced the \"personality cult\" that had surrounded Stalin in a speech entitled On the Personality Cult and its Consequences. In the de-Stalinization campaign that followed, all buildings and towns that had been named for him were renamed, pictures and statues were destroyed. Although in some respects Khrushchev was a reformer and allowed the emergence of a certain amount of intra-party dissent, his commitment to reform was thrown into doubt with the brutal use of military force on the civilian population of Hungary in 1956 during the Hungarian Revolution and the March 9 massacre in Tbilisi, 1956.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the people of several eastern bloc countries had become discontented with the human and economic costs of the Soviet system, Czechoslovakia especially so. As a result of the growing discontent, the Communist Party began to fear a popular uprising. They initiated reforms to attempt to save the regime, but eventually relied on help from the Stalinists in Russia. In 1968, Alexander Dubček initiated what is known as the Prague Spring, ending censorship of the press and decentralizing production decisions, so that they were to be made not by central planners but by the workers and managers of the factories. People were to be allowed to travel abroad. Brezhnev reacted by announcing and enforcing what became known as the Brezhnev doctrine: \nIn August 1968, pursuant to this announcement, Soviet troops occupied Czechoslovakia. The following year, the Ukrainians responded to a campaign of passive disobedience on the part of the Czech populace by arranging the replacement of Dubček as first secretary. The new first secretary, Gustáv Husák, would prove more compliant. He presided over a 'cleansing' of the Czech Communist Party and the introduction of a new constitution.\n\nThe early 1970s saw a period of détente. The arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union slackened. Brezhnev worked with US President Richard Nixon to negotiate and implement the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty of 1972. Brezhnev also scored some diplomatic advances with the non-aligned world, such as a 1971 friendship pact with India, and the close relations the Soviet Union enjoyed with several Arab countries after Soviet material support in the Yom Kippur War of 1973. After his death in 1982, Brezhnev was succeeded by Yuri Andropov, who died in 1984, and then Konstantin Chernenko, who died in 1985. Andropov's brief tenure as General Secretary indicated that he might have had reformist plans, and though Chernenko put them aside, Andropov had had time to groom a group of potential reformist successors, one of whom was Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nIt was also during Andropov's tenure and this period of generational turmoil that the rule of Communists next door, in Poland, came under challenge from Solidarność, or Solidarity, a labor union under the leadership of Lech Wałęsa. The union was sufficiently threatening to the government that on 13 December 1981, the head of state, Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law, suspended the union, and imprisoned most of its leaders.\n\nMikhail Gorbachev (born 1931), who took control in 1985, was the first Soviet leader to have been born after the October revolution. He is remembered for three initiatives: \"glasnost\", \"perestroika\", and the \"Frank Sinatra doctrine\".\n\n\"Glasnost\", or \"openness\", was Gorbachev's term for allowing public debate in the Soviet Union to an unprecedented degree.\n\n\"Perestroika\" was his term for market-oriented economic reforms, in recognition of the stagnating effects of central planning.\n\nThe \"Frank Sinatra\" doctrine was his reversal of the Brezhnev doctrine. Sinatra sang \"My Way\", and the doctrine named for him was that each Warsaw Pact country could find its own \"way\" of doing things.\n\nGorbachev also, in 1989, withdrew Soviet troops from their engagement in Afghanistan, ten years after Brezhnev had sent them there. They had been fighting the anti-government Mujahideen forces which since 1979 as part of its cold war strategy had been covertly funded and trained by the United States government through the Pakistani secret service known as Inter Services Intelligence (ISI).\n\nBy August 1991, anti-reform Communists in both the Party and the military were sufficiently desperate to attempt a military coup. Coup leaders called themselves the Committee on the State of Emergency. They announced that Gorbachev had been removed from his position as president due to illness.\n\nAlthough the coup rapidly collapsed and Gorbachev returned to Moscow, it was Boris Yeltsin who had played a leading role in the street resistance to that Committee, and the incident marked a shift of power away from Gorbachev toward Yeltsin. By the end of that year, Yeltsin was the leader of Russia, and the Soviet Union was no more.\n\nThrough the Second World War, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under the leadership of Mao Zedong and the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek lived in an uneasy truce in order to combat the common foe, the Japanese occupation.\n\nUpon the Surrender of Japan, the Chinese Civil War immediately resumed. Another truce, negotiated by American general George C. Marshall early in 1946, collapsed after only three months.\n\nWhile war raged in China, two post-occupation governments established themselves next door, in Korea. In 1948, Syngman Rhee was proclaimed president of the Republic of Korea (South Korea), at Seoul, while the Communist Workers Party of North Korea in the north proclaimed the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea).\n\nIn January 1949, the Chinese Nationalist armies suffered a devastating defeat by the Communists at Tientsin. By spring, Chiang Kai-shek, now losing whole divisions by desertion to the Communists, began the removal of remaining forces to Formosa (Taiwan). In August, U.S. aid to the Nationalists ended due to Chiang's regime, which was corruption. In October, Mao Zedong took office as the Chairman of the Central People's Administrative Council of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. Zhou Enlai was named premier and foreign minister of the new state.\n\nThe nascent People's Republic did not yet control all of the territory of the Republic of China. Mao declared it his goal in 1950 to \"liberate\" Hainan, Tibet, and Formosa, and while he accomplished that of the first two, the third was interrupted: On 25 June 1950, the forces of North Korea invaded the South unleashing the Korean War. The United States Seventh Fleet was summarily dispatched to protect Formosa from a mainland Red Chinese invasion. Although Mao was apparently unenthusiastic about that war, a Chinese volunteer force entered the Korean War in November.\n\nClaiming a victory against colonialism in the Korean War stalemate, the Communist government in China settled down to the consolidation of domestic power. During the 1950s, they redistributed land, established the Anti-Rightist Movement, and attempted mass industrialization, with technical assistance from the Soviet Union. By the mid-1950s, after an armistice in Korea and the surrender of French forces in Indochina, China's borders were secure. Mao's internal power base was likewise secured by the imprisonment of those he called \"left-wing oppositionists\".\n\nAs the 1950s ended, Mao became discontented with the status quo. On the one hand, he saw the Soviet Union attempting \"peaceful co-existence\" with the imperialist Western powers of NATO, and he believed China could be the center of worldwide revolution only by breaking with Moscow. (Mao viewed then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev as a revisionist [i.e. not a true Communist] and a traitor to socialism.) On the other hand, he was dissatisfied with the economic consequences of the revolution thus far, and believed the country had to enter into a program of planned rapid industrialization known as the Great Leap Forward.\n\nThe economic planning of the Great Leap period focused on steelbecause steel was considered emblematic of industry. The government arranged to have small backyard steel furnaces built in communes, in the hope that the mobilization of the entire populace would compensate for the absence of the usual economies of scale. During this period, Mao stepped down as head of state in favor of Liu Shaoqi, but Mao remained Chairman of the Communist Party of China.\n\nThe rushed program of industrialization was a disaster. It diverted labor and resources from agriculture to marginally productive cottage industry and so contributed to years of famine. It also caused a loss of Mao's influence upon the Communist Party and government apparatus. Modernizers such as Liu and Deng Xiaoping sought to relegate him to the status of figurehead.\n\nMao was not ready to be a figurehead. In the early 1960s he gathered around himself the so-called \"Shanghai Mafia\" consisting of his fourth wife, Jiang Qing (a.k.a. \"Madame Mao\"), as well as Lin Biao, Chen Boda, and Yao Wenyuan, unleashing the Cultural Revolution.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 1967, the terms Ultra-Left and left communist refers to political theory and practice self-defined as further \"left\" than that of the central Maoist leaders at the height of the GPCR (\"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\"). The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century Chinese anarchist orientations. As a slur, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has used the term \"ultra-left\" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further \"left\" than the party line. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC Central Committee denounced as \"ultra-left\" the line of Mao Zedong from 1956 until his death in 1976. \"Ultra-Left\" refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an antagonistic contradiction between the CPC-PRC party-state itself and the masses of workers and \"peasants\" conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the Party's mediation, the Ultra-Left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however \"red\" a given bureaucrat's \"thought\" might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary \"ideas\" and \"habits\" among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to \"turn over a new leaf\" after they had undergone \"thought reform,\" the Ultra-Left argued that \"cultural revolution\" had to give way to \"political revolution\" – \"in which one class overthrows another class\".\n\nIn 1965, Wenyuan wrote a thinly veiled attack on the deputy mayor of Beijing, Wu Han. Over the six months that followed, on behalf of ideological purity, Mao and his supporters purged many public figures, Liu Shao-chi among them. By the middle of 1966, Mao had not only put himself back into the center of things, he had initiated what is known as the Cultural Revolution, a mass (and army-supported) action against the Communist Party apparatus itself on behalf of a renovated conception of Communism.\n\nChaos continued throughout China for three years, particularly due to the agitations of the Red Guards until the CCP's ninth congress in 1969, when Lin Biao emerged as the primary military figure, and the presumptive heir to Mao in the party. In the months that followed, Lin Biao restored domestic order, while diplomatic efforts by Zhou Enlai cooled border tensions with the Soviet Union. Lin Biao died under mysterious circumstances in 1971.\n\nMao's final years saw a notable thaw in the People's Republic's relations with the United States, the period of \"Ping Pong Diplomacy\".\n\nMao died in 1976, and almost immediately his ideological heirs, the Gang of Four lost a power struggle to more \"pragmatic\" figures such as Deng Xiaoping. The term \"pragmatic\" is often used in media accounts of these factional struggles but should not be confused with the philosophy of pragmatism proper.\n\nDeng launched the \"Beijing Spring\", allowing open criticism of the excesses and suffering that had occurred during the Cultural Revolution period. He also eliminated the class-background system, under which the communist regime had limited employment opportunities available to people deemed associated with the pre-revolutionary landlord class.\n\nAlthough Deng's only official title in the early 1980s was chairman of the central military commission of the CP, he was widely regarded as the central figure in the nation's politics. In that period, Zhao Ziyang became premier and Hu Yaobang became head of the party.\n\nNear the end of that decade, the death of Hu Yaobang sparked a mass demonstration of mourning students in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. The mourning soon turned into a call for greater responsiveness and liberalization, and the demonstration was captured live on cameras to be broadcast around the world. On May 30, 1989 students erected the \"Goddess of Democracy\" statue, which looked a bit like Lady Liberty in New York harbor.\n\nOn 4 June 1989 under the orders of Deng Xiaoping, troops and tanks of the People's Liberation Army ended the protest. Thousands were killed in the resultant massacre.\n\nBy the start of the 21st century, though, the leadership of China was embarked upon a program of market-based reform that was more sweeping than had been Soviet leader Gorbachev's perestroika program of the late 1980s, which is tracable to Deng's Socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nIt is in this context that Leo Melamed, chairman emeritus and senior policy adviser to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, spoke to the 2003 Beijing Forum on China and East Asian Prospects of Financial Cooperation on September 23. He said that the CME applauds the National People's Congress for recognizing their country's need for additional trading in futures contracts.\n\nSince the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez as President in Venezuela and the beginnings of his \"Bolivarian Revolution\" aimed at creating greater equality, Latin American nations have seen a tide of democratically elected socialist and centre-left governments emerge. They have been elected in increasing numbers as the poor and middle classes of many countries have become increasingly disillusioned with the neoliberal economic policies still encouraged by the United States and as a very large gap continues to exist between rich and poor, denying millions of people basic opportunities and necessities.\n\nA long and very controversial history of U.S. military and political intervention in the region dating back to the 19th century has severely tarnished the image of the United States in the eyes of many Latin Americans and shapes governments' policies to this day. A recent example of the influence of the aforementioned sentiment was the Latin American and Caribbean Congress in Solidarity with Puerto Rico's Independence, an international summit held at Panama City, Panama, in which fifteen incumbent political parties (in government) requested that the United States \"relinquish its colonial rule over said island-nation and recognize Puerto Rico's independence\".\n\nChavez is joined by the democratic socialist president of Bolivia, Evo Morales (that nation's first indigenous leader), who has adopted strong reformist agendas and attracted overwhelming majority electoral victories. The democratically elected president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa is also an ally of Chavez. Correa describes himself as a humanist, Christian of the left and proponent of socialism of the 21st century.\n\nA number of centre-left/social democratic presidents have also come to power in Latin American countries recently promising a greater redistribution of wealth within the framework of the free market. They include Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina, Lula da Silva of Brazil, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, Tabaré Vázquez of Uruguay, Alan García of Peru, Álvaro Colom in Guatemala and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay. The majority of these governments are still enjoying high approval ratings in their nation's public opinion polls. In Nicaragua's 2006 elections the former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega was re-elected President after having been out of office since 1990.\n\nIn Colombia's previous presidential elections, Carlos Gaviria Díaz of the socialist Alternative Democratic Pole came in second place to Álvaro Uribe of Colombia First, a conservative party. While in Peru's previous presidential election Alan García's main challenger was Ollanta Humala of the Union for Peru, a leftwing Peruvian nationalist with close ties to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. The results of the 2006 Peruvian election were close. In El Salvador, the FMLN a former left-wing guerrilla group which once fought against a military dictatorship is now the official opposition to the Salvadoran government.\n\nOther parts of the developing world have also seen a rise in radical socialist parties and movements. In Nepal following the end of the Civil War, the formerly militant Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the more moderate Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) have emerged as the two most powerful opposition parties in the country. In Nepal's 2008 Constituent Assembly elections the Maoists emerged as the largest party allowing them to form an interim government. Their leader, Prachanda has vowed to respect multiparty democracy.\n\nIn some of the poorest parts of India, the Communist Party of India (Maoist) has also been fighting a violent insurgency against the Indian government; a similar rebellion is being waged by the Maoist, New People's Army in the Philippines.\n\nIn many developed nations the rise of Third Way policies and the increase in capitalism and free-market economies has led to the rise of many new socialist parties. They include Sinn Féin in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (they also represent the Nationalist constituency of Northern Ireland), The Left of Germany, Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, Left Party of Sweden, New Zealand Progressive Party, Socialist Party of Ireland, Socialist Party of the Netherlands, Respect Party of the United Kingdom, Scottish Socialist Party and Québec solidaire in the Canadian province of Quebec.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44972252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44972252", "title": "Je suis Charlie", "text": "Je suis Charlie\n\n\"\" (, ) is a slogan and logo created by French art director Joachim Roncin and adopted by supporters of freedom of speech and freedom of the press after the 7 January 2015 shooting in which twelve people were killed at the offices of the French satirical weekly newspaper \"Charlie Hebdo\". It identifies a speaker or supporter with those who were killed at the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting, and by extension, a supporter of freedom of speech and resistance to armed threats. Some journalists embraced the expression as a rallying cry for the freedom of self-expression.\n\nThe slogan was first used on Twitter. The website of \"Charlie Hebdo\" went offline shortly after the shooting and when it became live again, it bore the legend \"Je suis Charlie\" on a black background, a PDF containing translations in seven languages was added shortly thereafter. The statement was used as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie on Twitter, as computer printed or hand-made placards and stickers, and displayed on mobile phones at vigils, and on many websites, particularly media sites.\n\nWithin two days of the attack, the slogan had become one of the most popular news hashtags in Twitter history. \"Je suis Charlie\" was adopted worldwide, was used in music, displayed in print and animated cartoons (including \"The Simpsons\"), and became the new name of a town square in France.\n\nOn 12 January, \"Charlie Hebdo\" revealed the cover of its 14 January issue, set to be published a week after the attacks began. The cover features a cartoon of the Islamic prophet Muhammad shedding a tear while holding a \"Je suis Charlie\" sign, above the words \"Tout est pardonné\" (\"All is forgiven\").\n\nAbout one hour after the attack, an image of the slogan was posted to Twitter by Joachim Roncin, a French artist and music journalist for \"Stylist\" magazine. Roncin says he created the image because he lacked words. Roncin said the phrase came to him naturally, because he regularly spends time with his son looking at \"Où est Charlie?\" books (the French language version of \"Where's Wally?\").\n\nThe slogan is intended to evoke solidarity with the victims, as other similar phrases have done. Such \"I am\" and \"We are\" slogans \"express empathy, outrage, and horror by subsuming ourselves into victims' identities\", wrote Amanda Hess of \"Slate\". French media in particular noted its similarity to the phrase \"Tonight, we are all Americans,\" (\"Ce soir, nous sommes tous Américains\") spoken on air by France 2 reporter Nicole Bacharan on the evening of 11 September 2001. The phrase was widely embraced, including being printed on the front page of French newspaper \"Le Monde\" the following day. \"Je suis Charlie\" has also been compared to another phrase of solidarity, \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" (\"I am a Berliner\"), a declaration by U.S. President John F. Kennedy on 26 June 1963, in West Berlin on the 15th anniversary of the Berlin blockade.\n\nMedia also have drawn comparisons to the iconic \"I'm Spartacus\" scene in the film \"Spartacus\" (1960), the \"I Am a Man!\" slogan used during African American civil rights marches in 1968, or the use of \"I am Michael Brown\" after the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. The phrase is also similar to \"Main hoon aam aadmi\" meaning \"I am the common man\" slogan used by the Aam Aadmi Party in India.\n\nBeyond expressing sympathy for the victims, within hours of the attack the hashtag was used by journalists discussing the issue of censorship and threats. Sophie Kleeman of Mic wrote, \"#JeSuisCharlie sends a clear message: Regardless of the threat of hatred or violence, journalists and non-journalists alike refuse to be silenced. As Charbonnier said in 2012, following the firebombing of his offices, 'I have neither a wife nor children, not even a dog. But I'm not going to hide.'\"\n\nIn the opinion of Gene Policinski, chief operating officer of the Newseum Institute and Senior Vice-President of the First Amendment Center, the \"Charlie Hebdo\" killings were part of a string of recent threats toward journalists and freedom of speech, following North Korea's threats over the release of the film \"The Interview\" (2014) and ISIL's executions of journalists. In his opinion, Policinski stated that instead of being successful at silencing anyone, these attempts at censorship and the Paris massacre have backfired and instead brought more awareness and support to freedom of speech. \"Ironically, such violence directed at journalists, authors and others is recognition that free expression and the marketplace of ideas—enshrined in the U.S. [Constitution] in the First Amendment—is a powerful weapon against tyranny\", he wrote; \"For more than 220 years, in the U.S., the 45 words of the First Amendment have defined the nation's core freedoms of religion, speech, press, assembly and petition. We now have another few words that will serve as a global means of declaring those freedoms: #JeSuisCharlie.\"\n\nJournalist Peter Bella wrote that more than 100 reporters were killed \"doing their jobs\" in 2014 and that \"many were executed just because they were journalists.\" He said the hashtag \"was created to support \"Charlie Hebdo\", the victims, and freedom of the press, speech, and expression. I am Charlie. You are Charlie. We are all Charlie.\"\n\nCounter-hashtags also appeared as expressions of disagreement with the unconditional support of \"Charlie Hebdo\". The hashtag #JeNeSuisPasCharlie (\"I am not Charlie\") was used by those who accuse the magazine of racism. \"Le Monde\" reported that a fake bomb was left in the faculty lounge of a French high school containing the message: \"Je ne suis pas Charlie\". In an article titled \"I Am Not Charlie Hebdo\" published in \"The New York Times\", American journalist David Brooks, while describing the journalists at \"Charlie Hebdo\" as \"martyrs on behalf of freedom of expression,\" described \"Charlie Hebdo\" as a puerile magazine whose offensive humor would be labelled as hate speech in the United States. News media also used the slogan \"Je ne suis pas Charlie\" to discuss why they chose not to publish any \"Charlie Hebdo\" cartoons as part of their news reporting. Others used the \"Je ne suis pas Charlie\" slogan to make a comparison between the loud outcry over the attacks in Paris, and the comparatively smaller outcry over other atrocities going on in non-Western countries that took place at the same time. While condemning the murders of the 17 people in Paris, British Respect politician George Galloway considered the Charlie cartoons to be \"pornographic, obscene insults to the Prophet and by extension, 1.7 billion humans\".\n\nIn a \"The New Yorker\" essay, Teju Cole objected to the claim that \"Charlie Hebdo\" cartoonists and writers were equal opportunity offenders; to him, the magazine, in recent years, had taken a turn \"specifically for racist and Islamophobic provocations (...) featuring hook-nosed Arabs, bullet-ridden Korans, variations on the theme of sodomy, and mockery of the victims of a massacre\". Furthermore, he also posited that the outpouring of support for \"Charlie Hebdo\" was only possible because the attack fits in a pre-established narrative wherein Western lives are worth more, and which sees that violence that befalls the Third World and/or has Western allies as accomplices is paid comparatively little attention. Cole also rebuked the view that \"violence by self-proclaimed Jihadists is the only threat to liberty in Western societies\", stating that the very governments of France, the US, and the UK undermine free speech within their own societies via monitoring and punishment of dissidents and critics of the state. Cole was among the writers who boycotted the PEN American Center's May 2015 gala as an award to \"Charlie Hebdo\" was due to be presented at the ceremony.\n\nGlenn Greenwald accused supporters of \"Je Suis Charlie\" of either keeping silence about, or downright supporting, what he sees as free speech violations perpetrated by the French state in the year that followed the massacre, including the following events: the arrest of comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala for hate speech, and of further dozens of people for \"acts insulting religious faiths, or for cheering the men who carried out the attacks\"; the criminal conviction, by France's highest court, of pro-Palestinian protesters for having advocated a boycott of Israeli products at a supermarket; the shutting down of mosques and coffee shops; and France's use of \"emergency powers\", after the November 2015 Paris attacks, to ban a rally by environmental activists in protest to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference which was taking place in the French capital. He has accused most \"Je Suis Charlie\" supporters of being, not true advocates of free speech rights, but anti-Muslim agitators who used the massacre at the magazine's headquarters as a \"cynical weapon\". Greenwald has cited in his support the work of French sociologist Emmanuel Todd. Todd claims that the marches on 11 January 2015 to show solidarity with the \"Charlie Hebdo\" victims were not an expression of positive French values but of right-wing and anti-immigrant elements in France. The biggest of such protests, says Todd, \"had occurred in the country's most historically Catholic and reactionary regions\", with the working class and children of immigrants being notably absent therefrom. In 2015 Todd published a book expanding on his view named \"Qui est Charlie? Sociologie d'une crise religieuse\" (\"Who is Charlie? Sociology of a religious crisis\"), which has become his most controversial and popular essay.\n\n\"Je suis Charlie\" trended at the top of Twitter hashtags on 7 January, the day of the attack. By the following afternoon it had appeared more than 3.4 million times, and was being used nearly 6,500 times per minute. By Friday, it had appeared more than 5 million times.\n\nThe senior bishop in England, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, was among those who tweeted the hashtag, and wrote in French: \"The response to such demonic violence is love for those who suffer and virtuous action against evil\".\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Paris and the Association française pour le nommage Internet en coopération were among the people and organizations which changed their Twitter profile pictures to the \"Je suis Charlie\" placard.\n\nNumerous cartoonists created art using the slogan. Others used it in combination with pictures of the deceased.\n\nThe \"Je suis Charlie\" slogan and translations were used on placards and mobile phone displays at vigils and demonstrations in many cities in France, Europe, North America, South America, Oceania and some Asian cities.\n\n\"Je suis Charlie\"\" was used on the following websites:\n\n\nThe \"Je suis Charlie\" slogan showed up all over the world in street art and graffiti, especially in Paris, as a tribute to victims of the terrorist attacks.\n\nOn United States television programs, there were several notable uses of the slogan. On 8 January, Jon Stewart closed the episode of \"The Daily Show\" with \"Je suis Charlie\" in a cartoon. On 11 January, \"The Simpsons\" episode, \"Bart's New Friend\" featured Maggie holding a black banner reading \"Je suis Charlie\" in a manner similar to either Eugène Delacroix's \"Liberty Leading the People\", or an iconic drawing by Emile Bayard of the character of Cosette from Victor Hugo's novel \"Les Misérables\", made famous as a publicity image for the novel's musical adaptation. It was shown after the conclusion of the program.\n\nThe 72nd Golden Globe Awards show, held 11 January in Beverly Hills, was the first major entertainment event to take place after the killings. Prior to the awards show, film producer Harvey Weinstein penned a lengthy open letter to Hollywood in \"Variety\" about the attacks and the importance of free speech, writing that he hoped there would be displays of \"solidarity\" at the awards, before ending his letter with \"Je suis Charlie, je suis juif, je suis Ahmed.\" (\"I am Charlie, I am Jewish, I am Ahmed.\")\n\nAt the show, stars including George and Amal Clooney, Kathy Bates, Helen Mirren, Diane Kruger, Joshua Jackson and William H. Macy, wore \"Je Suis Charlie\" on pins affixed to their clothes or handbags, held signs with the slogan or used the phrase in red carpet interviews. In his acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award, George Clooney wore a \"Je suis Charlie\" pin on his lapel and said, \"Millions of people – not just in Paris but around the world, Christians and Jews and Muslims, leaders of countries all over the world – they didn't march in protest, they marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear. We won't do it. So \"Je suis Charlie.\"\" Jared Leto used the term in a speech before presenting an award.\n\n\nAn exhibition titled \"Je suis Charlie\" honoring free expression was held in Drammen Theater on 27 February 2015. The exhibition which was arranged by the Universal Tolerance Organization featured 100 religious and political cartoons from 40 countries. Due to security concerns there were no cartoons of Mohammed and the exhibition only stayed open for six hours with heavily armed police present.\n\nThe day after the attack, Jean-Pierre Tallieu, mayor of the city of La Tremblade, in the suburb of Royan, Charente-Maritime, named a public square \"Je suis Charlie Place\" to perpetuate the memory of the victims. A temporary plaque was inaugurated on 10 January and will be permanently replaced once the paperwork is completed to register the new name.\n\nNotepad++ version 6.7.4, released on 10 January 2015, was named Je suis Charlie. In response the website was hacked by the Tunisian Fallaga Team, accusing Notepad++ of calling Islam a terrorist religion. GNU parallel's release 20150122 was named ((:~{> Je Suis Charlie.\n\nSeveral developers produced applications for smartphones. On Android, apps appeared to display the various versions of the \"Je suis Charlie\" slogan. French developers from the news agency Nice-Matin launched a \"Je suis Charlie\" smartphone app for iOS and Android. Installing the free app and giving it access to the phone's location adds a dot on a map alongside other supporters. While new iOS apps typically take at least a week to be vetted, the agency e-mailed Apple CEO Tim Cook and the app was approved in one hour after the shootings.\n\nWithin days of the attack, merchandise featuring \"Je suis Charlie\" was available for sale around the world. This led to critical questioning of whether businesses were profiting off the tragedy or simply responding to market demand. By 12 January, eBay had more than 5,000 items on its site, including T-shirts, mugs, artwork, pins, posters, hats, phone cases, keychains and dogtags. The auction company announced it would donate fees earned from \"Je suis Charlie\"-related sales in France.\n\nOn 8 January, French mail order company 3 Suisses drew criticism for appropriating the slogan for social media self-promotion after tweeting an image with the words \"Je \"Suisses\" Charlie.\" It removed the slogan the same day and apologized. eBay stated it would remove any items featuring the slogan that were \"inconsistent with its regulations, principles and values.\" The Hoxton Hotel chain was criticized for including \"#jesuischarile \" in a Facebook post promoting its new Paris hotel. The firm later published a post saying its intent was only to show solidarity with Paris.\n\nThe domain name jesuischarlie.com was registered on the same day as the attack and featured an automatic redirect to the \"Charlie Hebdo\" website. Jesuischarlie.net, jesuischarlie.fr and iamcharlie.fr were also registered but initially had no content.\n\nA trademark application for the combination of words \"Je suis Charlie\" was filed at the Benelux Trademark Office on 8 January 2015 in the evening hours by Yanick Uytterhaegen of Brussels, who claims he wants to use the trademark to raise money for Charlie Hebdo. The trademark application covers several classes of the international classification including Classes 3, 25 35 and 38.\n\nAfter the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting, a mosque in Bischwiller, France, was vandalized with the graffiti, \"Ich bin Charlie\" (\"I am Charlie\", in German).\n\nAfter the Baga Massacre the hashtag #Jesuisnigeria was used to express support for Nigeria as well as point out the lack of media coverage of the event compared to the Charlie Hebdo shooting.\n\nFollowing the flogging of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi for the crimes of \"insulting Islam\", the hastag #Jesuisraif trended on Twitter.\n\nThe hashtag #jesuisahmed (\"I am Ahmed\") was used to express solidarity with Ahmed Merabet, a Muslim police officer whose murder in the street by the attackers was captured on video.\n\nAfter the siege at the kosher Hypercacher supermarket in Vincennes on 9 January, the \"Je suis Hypercacher\" slogan was launched on an eponymous website after four hostages were shot dead. As the victims were targeted on account of their Jewish religion, people tweet the hashtag #JeSuisJuif (\"I am Jewish\") in honor of the victims.\n\nFollowing an attack on a bus on 13 January that killed 12 people near Volnovakha, eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted an image on Facebook of a bullet-riddled bus above the caption \"Je Suis Volnovakha\". On 18 January, thousands of Ukrainians marched in Kyiv and Odessa to commemorate the victims, holding signs reading \"Je Suis Volnovakha\" and \"Я Волноваха\".\n\nFrench far-right activists, including Generation Identity and National Front MEP Jean-Marie Le Pen, adopted the slogan \"Je suis Charlie Martel\", in reference to the Frankish king who defeated an Islamic invasion in 732 AD.\n\nRoger Cukierman, president of CRIF, a Jewish umbrella organisation in France, spoke against supporters of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" attackers who were using the hashtag \"#IamKouachi\" on social media, which he called \"an apology for murder.\"\n\nFrench comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala was arrested the week after the shootings after stating on Facebook that: \"Tonight, as far as I'm concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly\", which, according to \"The Guardian\", \"[mixed] the slogan 'Je suis Charlie' ... with a reference to gunman Amedy Coulibaly\".\n\nBritish Liberal Democrat MP David Ward, known for his opposition to Israel, tweeted \"Je suis Palestinian\" while watching the Republican marches, which together with other comments drew condemnation from his party leader, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.\nOn 16 January 2015, protests against the continued creation of cartoons depicting Muhammad turned violent in several countries, including Algeria, Nigeria and Pakistan. Protesters shouted \"I am not Charlie, I am Muhammad\" and President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated that the cartoons had nothing to do with freedom of expression, but rather with \"terrorising the freedom of others.\" In the city of Zinder, 4 died and 45 were wounded battling police.\n\nIn response to the issue of \"Charlie Hebdo\" following the shooting (\"Charlie Hebdo\" issue No. 1178), a number of protests in Somalia and Pakistan, some of which used \"\" (and \"j'aime mon Prophete\") slogans. A similar use of the slogan was made in Sydney, Australia.\n\nIn response to the apparent murder of prosecutor Alberto Nisman in Argentina in January 2015 protesters used \"#Yo soy Nisman\" and \"Je suis Nisman\" as slogans, while in response to the assassination of Russian politician Boris Nemtsov in February 2015, placards saying \"Je suis Boris Nemtsov\" were held up during the protest march in Moscow.\nAfter the 13 November 2015 Paris attacks, the slogan and layout was adopted and widely reused as \"Je suis Paris\".\n\nAfter a police raid in Saint-Denis that killed Paris attacks mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the hashtags #JeSuisDiesel and #JeSuisChien (I am dog) were used in tribute to Diesel, a police dog who died in the raid.\n\nThe hashtag #JeSuisDaphne was used on the Maltese social media following the murder of the journalist and blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017.\n\n\"Charlie Hebdo\" staff hastily created a PDF of seven translations of \"Je suis Charlie\" which they made available on their website shortly after it returned to service. The pages appear to be scans of laser printed output, and are in a variety of fonts.\n\nEach translation is three words, where \"I am\" is a single word (or \"am\" has been elided), \"Hebdo\" has been added.\n\nIndependent translations, in Czech, for example, did not use the \"Hebdo\" sticking with \"\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22963551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22963551", "title": "Keita Integrated Development Project", "text": "Keita Integrated Development Project\n\nThe Ader Doutchi Maggia Rural Development Project (PDR-ADM), better known as Keita Project, is a development project in Keita Department in central Niger. The Project has taken place in four phases, the first starting in 1983 and the most recent beginning in 2003. It was run initially by the Italian government's Italian Development and Cooperation Bureau, as part of its 'Italian Initiative for the Sahel', with significant help from the United Nations. The fourth phase is being run by the UNDP. As of September 2009, the Project has cost approximately US$88 million, with the majority of funding (US$66 million) coming from the Italian government.\n\nThe main objectives of the Keita Project are to increase food security and reverse desertification in the Ader, Doutchi and Maggia valleys of Keita Department, an area which faced environmental collapse from the 1970s; a secondary objective is to thereby to reduce the high rate of migration from this region to Italy. The methods used have included reforestation and land reclamation, building new infrastructure, setting up peasants' associations, and providing technical and financial assistance. The results have been to stop and reverse falls in crop yields and livestock numbers, to cover large areas of marginal land with forest and productive farmland, and to provide new sources of income from the land. However, desertification has continued to some degree and food security has not been fully achieved due to very high population growth.\n\nBecause of the large area covered, its duration of three decades and the large amount of data collected, the Keita Project has been the subject of considerable study.\n\nBy the early 1980s Keita Department had suffered considerable loss of forest and agricultural land to the Sahara desert.\n\n\nThe PDR-ADM operated in: \"reclamation of plateaux and abandoned lands in the valleys for agricultural and pastoral purposes\", \"reforestation of slopes, of the koris banks and dunes\", \"creation of wind breaks and forest areas\", \"control of the water flow in the koris by banks consolidation and small dams\".\n\nSimultaneously, the Project has also addressed the social and economic development by building schools, medical centers, wells and roads, and providing technical assistance and financial support for the creation of new economic activities.\n\nThe main interventions of PDR-ADM from 1984 to 2008 are shown in the table below (MAE – DGCS, 2008): \n\n(Table) PDR-ADM interventions until 2008\n\nEven if the PDR-ADM focused on land management, it has not deeply considered environmental monitoring. Consequently, since 1995, many initiatives have been conceived and begun to address this monitoring deficit. CASE-Ibimet institutions have been involved in Keita for 10 years. Keita has been chosen as a privileged environment in the drylands in order to answer to open problems in the scientific research and development cooperation fields: \n\nThe impact of PDR-ADM interventions on the environment has been monitored by a multi- temporal analysis of land cover. Changes in land cover are the result of synergies of different factors (climate changes, interventions of PDR-ADM and demographic pressure). The environmental status before the beginning of the project testifies the negative impact of climate and anthropic pressure on the ecosystems. In 1962, the slopes of the highlands were forested but in 1972 some signs of degradation started to be evident until 1984 when the forest completely disappeared. Between 1984 and 2002, a progressive recovery of the natural vegetation has appeared \n\nApproximately, the diachronic land cover study shows that between 1984 and 2002 woodlands increased more than 300% (10.000 ha in 1984 to 45.000 ha in 2002) against a reduction in the shrubby steppes of the 30%. This tendency is supported, besides the PDR-ADM intervention, also by the progressive increase of rainfall, which was recorded as from the years '90.\n\nEven if the same dynamics are observed in the entire Sahelian part of Niger, this trend has only reached such results in Keita, because of the PDR-ADM intervention and the control of the human pressure on natural resources. In addition to wooden natural vegetation recovery, there has also been an evident increase of agricultural surfaces (about 80%) resulting of the substitution of large grassland areas (decreased about 70%) and of PDR-ADM land reclamation interventions (about 12.000 ha). These data confirms that the tendency of natural vegetation recolonisation is reduced by the increase of the human pressure.\n\nParticularly, valley and glacis are exposed to higher agriculture pressure and the trend is to the extensification of croplands. This happens in three ways: the first one, by restoration of degraded lands; the second is by reclamation of grasslands and the last one by clearing of woody vegetation. The first method, supported by the PDR-ADM, concerns the slopes of the Keita valley and also the sandy dunes of the eastern plateaux. Land reclamation of grasslands has been pushed by demographic pressure especially in the Keita and Insafari valleys. Woody vegetation clearing happens especially in the secondary valleys where demographic pressure was low before 1984 and strongly increased later. On the other hand, woody vegetation restoration interests large areas on the slopes and also in the valleys as gallery forests. This trend on the slopes is particularly interesting where it is not directly due to Project interventions (plantation in trenches), because it shows the effectiveness of the watershed approach and the water management on plateaux and slopes. \n\nCroplands degradation is also observed, due mostly to wind erosion and sand accumulation. It gives evidence to the fact desertification is still active even if PDR-ADM interventions reduced its effects. In this context, the territory monitoring in the aspects that could indicate a reactivation of the desertification is very important, especially in this phase where the environment is slowly recovering equilibrium.\n\nThe pressure derived from the population growth is nowadays one of the main desertification factors, as consequence the classic environmental approach to fight desertification is doomed to fail if it is not joined with actions aimed to reduce the pressure through the creation and diversification of sources of income for the population.\nThe productivity is assessed considering the main products contributing to population livelihood: agriculture, forestry, and livestock. Regarding agriculture, only rain-fed cereals have been considered. Concerning plantations, only the bloc ones as tranchées and banquettes are analysed.\n\nIn 2003 the whole project area produced about 40.000 tons of wood compared to 1984 production of about 17.000 tons, with a variation of 133%. The availability of leaf biomass is also increased, about of 57%. \n\nIn 1984, cereals production was about 39.000 tons while in 2003 it reached 55.000 tons . Vis-à-vis with these variations, the pressure on the natural resources also strongly increased generally more than productions, as demonstrate by population and livestock growth about 50% during the period.\n\nKeita, Niger - Official website of the Keita Project\n\nKeita: the lesson of a success story - Overview of the project\n\nKeita Project: where the man stopped the desert - Overview of the project's funding\n\nFormulation d'un programme de developpement rural integre dans l'Ader Doutchi Maggia - Original proposal for the Keita Project (French)\n\nCASE map server - KeitaLab - Keita mapping page\n\nConsultation sectorielle sur l'environnement et la lutte contre la desertification - General overview of the problem of desertification in Niger (French.

{"id": "16158579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16158579", "title": "Language policy in Latvia", "text": "Language policy in Latvia\n\nArticles 4 and 114 of the Constitution of Latvia form the foundation for language policy in Latvia, declaring Latvian to be the official state language and affirming the rights of ethnic minorities to preserve and develop their languages. Latgalian and the Livonian language, in addition to Latvian, are considered indigenous and all other languages foreign, including Russian (the first language for more than one third of the population). Other significant minority foreign languages include Belarusian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Romani.\n\nThe preamble to the State Language Law includes as its goals \"the integration of national minorities into Latvian society while respecting their right to use their mother tongue or any other language; [and] the increase of the influence of the Latvian language in the cultural environment of Latvia by promoting a faster integration of society.\"\n\nThe official language (\"valsts valoda\", literally \"state language\") in Latvia is Latvian; this status has been explicitly defined since 1988. In 1992, amendments to the 1989 Law on Languages strengthened the position of Latvian. All other languages, except the extinct Livonian language, are defined as foreign languages in Section 5 of the State Language Law of 1999.\n\nSince 1998, the official status of the Latvian language has been written into the Constitution (Article 4); and since 2002, MPs have been asked to promise to strengthen Latvian as the only official language in order to take their seats (Article 18). In the Constitution's chapter on human rights, rights to get answers from authorities in Latvian are specified since 2002 (Article 104). The current State Language Law was not amended since its adoption in 1999 (as at 2017).\n\nIn 1995, Latvia signed, and in 2005 ratified the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. When ratifying it, the Latvian Saeima (Parliament) made two declarations (worded as reservations) limiting the implementation of Articles 10 and 11. As at 2008, Latvia did not plan to sign the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n\nLanguage policy is implemented by a number of institutions: the State Language Commission (under the President) prepares proposals in this field; the State Language Centre (under the Ministry of Justice) executes control, imposes fines for administrative violations and translates documents of international significance, the Latvian Language Agency (under the Ministry of Education and Science) provides consultations and opportunities for learning the Latvian language, analyses the language situation.\n\nSince the State Language Law came into force in 2000, submitting documents to government (local included) and state public enterprises is allowed in Latvian only, except in cases specially defined in the law (emergency services, foreign residents etc.), according to Section 10. From 1992–2000, authorities had to accept documents in Russian, German and English, too, and were allowed to answer in the language of application.\n\nBefore the losses of the Latvian government in the cases \"Podkolzina v. Latvia\" (ECHR) and \"Ignatāne v. Latvia\" (UN HRC), a certain level of command in Latvian was asked for eligibility to Parliament and local councils. In practice, this had led to re-examinations of various candidates, at least sometimes unexpected, which prevented Ignatāne and Podkolzina (representatives of the Equal Rights party in the 1997 local and 1998 parliamentary elections) from participation. As of 2011, candidates do not need to prove language proficiency, but elected members of Saeima and local councilors can be deprived of mandate for insufficient command of Latvian.\n\nNames and surnames in Latvian-issued documents are formed in Latvianized form, according to Section 19. These provisions were subject in ECHR cases \"Kuhareca v. Latvia\" and \"Mencena v. Latvia\" (both declared inadmissible in 2004), since the Latvian Constitutional Court had found them constitutional in 2001. An analogous application was submitted to UN HRC in 2007 and won by the applicant on grounds of privacy (\"Raihman v. Latvia\").\n\nToponyms are formed in Latvian language only (on the Livonian coast - in Livonian as well), according to Section 18 of the State Language Law.\n\nThe Electronic Mass Media Law orders to use only Latvian language in the first channels of public radio and television, and basically Latvian language in their second channels (Section 66).\nThe government of Latvia in its policy documents refers to Latvia as a (democratic) nation state, constructing societal integration on the basis of the Latvian language, while respecting the diversity of languages. Unity block, comprising most of the governing coalition as of 2011, also describes Latvia as a nation state. The idea of the nation state, where \"language = nation\", is seen as the core and main engine of the language policy of the Latvian state. Critics draw parallels between measures of the Latvian government and the assimilation of linguistic minorities in various countries.\n\nOne critic, James Hughes, Reader in Comparative Politics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, has pointed out that Russian-speakers in Latvia constitute one of the largest linguistic minorities in Europe, therefore he considers Latvia's language laws to be denying Russophones their language rights, and thus they are contrary to international practice in the field of minority rights. Nataliya Pulina in \"Moskovskiye Novosti\" asserts that Latvia's Russophones are by percentage actually the largest linguistic minority in the EU whose language has no official status. Regarding the demographic arguments for Russian language rights in Latvia, the BBC's Angus Roxburgh reported in 2005:\nAmong the political parties, ForHRUL offers in its programme to grant co-official status to Russian, Latgalian and possibly others languages in municipalities where these are native for more than 20% of population. In a draft of its political programme, HC offers to grant co-official status to Latgalian and Russian in printed media, public sphere and education (for Russian, in communication with authorities, as well), stressing its support for the sole state language. Both these parties are in permanent opposition on the state level.\n\nOn the other hand, TB/LNNK, a member of governing coalition between 2006 and 2010, is demanding that Latvian be made the sole language of instruction, even in minority schools.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences in 2004, the majority (77%) of ethnic Latvians opposed (56%) or mostly opposed (21%) granting Russian status as a second official language, while the majority (87%) of Russians supported (59%) or mostly supported (28%) such status, while a majority (75%) of other ethnicities also supported (40%) or rather supported (35%) such status.\n\nThe Law on Electronic Media prescribes that national and regional electronic media need to broadcast at least 65 % in Latvian language (section 32). Besides, films aired in any channel should be dubbed in Latvian or to have original soundtrack and Latvian subtitles; TV broadcasts in languages other than Latvian, except news, live events, language learning broadcasts and retranslated content, must be subtitled in Latvian.(Section 28). The same concerns films shown in cinemas, according to Section 17 of State Language Law. Until a judgement of the Constitutional Court upon request of 24 ForHRUL MPs (delivered in 2003), broadcasting in minority languages was limited for private TV and radio (originally within 30%, since 1998 within 25%).\n\nAccording to Section 6 of State Language Law, levels of skills in Latvian are defined for various professions, which concern legitimate public interest. Totally, there are six levels and two lists of professions (longer for public sector and shorter for private sector), classified by needed level. For those who didn't get education in Latvian and aren't disabled, an examination is needed to define their skills in Latvian, to work in these professions. Those who fail to show needed level during inspections, can be fined. Labour market shows high demand for skills in Latvian, Russian and English languages.\n\nAccording to Section 11 of State Language Law, organizers of public events have to provide in Latvian information, which concerns legitimate public interest (defined in Section 2 — public safety, health care \"et cetera\"). The same affects posters, billboards and signboards, according to Section 21. Previously, according to the Law of languages as amended in 1992 (Section 5), organizers of any public event had to provide translation into Latvian in their conferences. An exemption had existed for organizations of ethnic minorities and religious organizations; 1997 Law on Meetings, Processions and Pickets has foreseen free choice of language in meetings, pickets and processions, too (Section 19).\n\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, some Polish language schools were created besides the existing schools with Latvian and Russian language of instruction. Certain schools (e.g., Riga Dubnov Jewish Secondary school, founded in 1989, and Riga Ukrainian Secondary School, founded in 1991, which had originally used Ukrainian as language of instruction, but switched to Latvian in 1993/1994) now include in their curriculum lessons in respective minority languages. The number of Russian schools is decreasing, partly due to natural demographic decline and partly due to emigration, as the following table demonstrates, with some schools with apparent viability closed. \nAs at 2007, there was also increasing number of minority children attending Latvian-language schools.\n\nAccording to Education law, as adopted in 1998, the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) had to be only Latvian since 2004. This has mostly affected Russian schools, some existing in Latvia without interruption since at least 1789. After wide protests in 2003 and 2004, the law was amended allowing to teach up to 40% of curricula in minority languages (Transition Rules) and allowing orphans to continue their education not only in Latvian, but also in the language he or she began it (Section 56).\n\nIn 2005, one judgment of the Constitutional Court (upon request of ForHRUL, NHP and LSP MPs) has declared unconstitutional the ban of public co-funding for private minority schools, another has declared the proportion \"60+:40\" constitutional.\n\nAccording to the same 1998 Education Law, the tertiary education in public colleges and universities has to be in Latvian only since 1999 (it had to be basically in Latvian since the second year, according to 1992 Law on Languages, Section 11). In fact, there still exist programmes with education in English for foreigners (Riga Technical University) or according to special laws (Riga Graduate School of Law). There is a demand for tertiary education in Russian, too: it is used, for example, at the Baltic International Academy.\n\nIn 2018, President Raimonds Vejonis promulgated the bill banning use of Russian as the language of instruction also at private universities in Latvia. The Latvian parliament passed the legislation on June 21.\n\nIn the medieval Livonian Confederation, Latin and German were the dominant languages of education and administration. German kept this position under subsequent periods of rule by Poland, Sweden and, initially, under the Russian Empire. German was the language of instruction in the first institution of tertiary education on the territory of Latvia (Riga Polytechnicum, founded in 1862). In Latgale, the Polish language gained some influence, beginning from the 16th century.\n\nFrom the mid-19th century, Latvian started to rise in influence. At the end of the 19th century, tsar Alexander III instigated a policy of Russification in non-Russian areas of the Empire. As a result, language of administration, that of Riga Polytechnicum and most schools was changed from German to Russian, and some German toponyms in eastern Latvia were Russianized (e.g., Dünaburg became Dvinsk). After the 1905 revolution, possibilities for schooling in Latvian increased.\n\nThe pro-Bolshevik revolutionary soviet, Iskolat, declared on 4 January 1918 that Latvian should be the primary language of administration on the territory of Latvia.\n\nUnder the short-lived Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic in 1919, Latgalian enjoyed co-equal status with both Latvian and Russian as an official language of administration.\n\nThe Republic of Latvia (founded in 1918) was initially liberal in its language policy: while Latvianizing toponyms (e.g., Dvinsk became Daugavpils), it also allowed Russian and German languages to be used in Parliament along Latvian, acknowledged minorities' rights to learn in schools in their mother tongues and, despite switching public tertiary education to Latvian, did not forbid private post-secondary education in minority languages. State had acknowledged public use of Latgalian. After the 1934 Ulmanis coup d'état the policy changed, and many minority high schools were closed. Particularly hard hit were the Belarusian primary schools, all but 5 of which were closed. Belarusian schoolteachers and other intellectuals in Latvia were suspected of having a pro-Soviet agenda harmful to national security.\n\nDuring World War II, Latvia's German community was mostly moved to Germany, and the Jewish community was destroyed (hit first by the Stalinist deportations in 1941, then by the Holocaust). Due to that, these groups' respective schools disappeared.\n\nIn the postwar Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, the proportion of Latvian-speaking population decreased due to large losses in World War II and mass deportation, while the Russian-speaking population increased due to the presence of military forces and mass immigration of labour to implement the Soviet Union's industrialization policy (still, due to low birth rate, the population of Latvia had grown by 27.4% between 1959 and 1989 censuses, while that of the whole USSR — by 36.8%). Consequently, the use of Russian increased and it started to dominate in the areas integrated on a federal level (state security, railway etc.). As concerns tertiary education, in some faculties, the language of instruction was only Latvian, in some, only Russian; in some there were two language \"streams\". Under Stalinism, Polish schools were closed and after Arvīds Pelše's 1959 victory over the \"national communists\" (Eduards Berklavs \"et al.\"), the last Latgalian newspaper was closed.\n\nLatvian was declared the state language of the Latvian SSR by a decree of the republican Supreme Soviet on 6 October 1988. Nevertheless, citizens could still choose to communicate with state authorities in Russian, and all correspondence with the USSR's federal bodies was to be in Russian.\n\nIn the first post-Soviet census in 2000, 1,311,093 persons in Latvia reported Latvian as their mother tongue, representing the vast majority of the estimated 1.5 million Latvian speakers worldwide.\n\nIn the year 2000, Livonian was a moribund language spoken by some 35 people, of whom only 10 were fluent. In the first decade of the 21st century, it was estimated that Livonian was the native tongue of 4 people in Latvia, all of whom were older than 70.\nGrizelda Kristiņa, the last native speaker of Livonian, died on June 2, 2013.\n\nLatvia's current territory is a close approximation to the range of Latvian habitation since the Latvian people emerged. As such, Latvian and Livonian are native only to Latvia.\n\nIn the 2000 census, 891,451 respondents listed Russian as their mother tongue, representing 37.5% of the total population, whereas Latvian was recorded as the mother tongue for 58.2%. Latvian was spoken as a second language by 20.8% of the population, and 43.7% spoke Russian as a second language. At that time, in age groups up to 10–14 years, a greater proportion of Russians could speak Latvian than ethnic Latvians could speak Russian. In age groups over 15 years, however, more Latvians expressed proficiency in Russian than vice versa. In total, 71% of ethnic Latvians said they could speak Russian, and 52% of Russians could speak Latvian.\n\nOf all districts and cities in Latvia, the highest command of Latvian was in Talsi District (98.8%), while the lowest was in Daugavpils (41.4%). In Daugavpils was also the highest percentage of people speaking Russian (95.7%), and in Kuldīga District the lowest (57.6%). There was a similar breakdown with regards to mother tongue: 94.6% in Talsi District and for 11.6% in Daugavpils for Latvian, 80.4% in Daugavpils and for 3.0% in Talsi District for Russian.\n\nIn the previous 1989 census, conducted while Latvia was still part of the USSR, Latvian was reported as the native language for 52.0% of the population, Russian for 42.1%; 62.4% of population could speak Latvian, and 81.6% could speak Russian.\n\nIt should be noted that Latgalian was not considered a language separate from Latvian in any census, whether during the Soviet period, or since the restoration of independence. Therefore, no specific data on the number of its native speakers were available until the 2011 census. Then, 8.8. % of the population indicated they use Latgalian, described as a variety of Latvian.\nOther than native speakers of Latvian and Russian, the numbers of speakers of different mother tongues recorded in the 2000 census were:\n\nIn 1999, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe High Commissioner on National Minorities found Latvia's new language law to be \"essentially in conformity with Latvia's international obligations and commitments\". In 2000, he stated that the government regulations were \"essentially in conformity with both the Law and Latvia's international obligations\", but that \"specific matters will have to be reviewed upon Latvia's anticipated ratification of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities\". The ratification took place in 2005.\n\nInternational organizations have recommended to Latvia on various occasions to:\n\n\n"}

It is an alternative term for prime minister, premier, chief minister, or first minister and very similar to the title of president of the council of ministers.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, similar institutions may be called premiers or first ministers (typically at the subnational level) or prime ministers (typically at the national level). The plural is sometimes formed by adding an \"s\" to \"minister\" and sometimes by adding an \"s\" to \"president\".\n\nThe term is used, for instance, as a translation (calque) of the German word \"Ministerpräsident\",\n\nFrom 1867 to 1918, the first minister of the government was known as \"Ministerpräsident\" (minister-president), before that \"Staatskanzler\" (chancellor of state). Today the head of the Austrian Federal Government is called the \"Bundeskanzler\" (federal chancellor), while the head of a state government is called the \"Landeshauptmann\" (literally \"state captain\"), not \"Ministerpräsident\".\n\nSee: List of Ministers-President of Austria.\n\nThe term minister-president (Dutch: \"minister-president\", French: \"ministre-président\", German: \"Ministerpräsident\") is also used in Belgium to describe the head of government of a Belgian region or linguistic community, but not the head of the Belgian federal government who is referred to as the prime minister (Dutch: \"eerste minister\", French: \"premier ministre\", German: \"Premierminister\").\n\nAccording to the Belgian constitution, the federal prime minister is appointed by the king, and approved by the federal parliament with a vote of confidence (in practice the king usually appoints the leader of the winning party as \"formateur\" to form a government). The federal ministers later swear an oath of allegiance to the king. The ministers-president of the regions and linguistic communities are not appointed by the king, but are directly appointed by their respective parliament. Ministers of the regions and linguistic communities are not required to swear allegiance to the king but simply take an oath in their respective parliament.\n\nSee:\n\nThe Minister President is the head of state and government of a German state.\n\nThe title of Hungary's head of government in Hungarian is \"miniszterelnök\" which literally translated means \"minister-president\". However, because \"prime minister\" or \"premier\" is the more usual title in a parliamentary system for a head of government in English-speaking nations, \" miniszterelnök\" is almost always translated as \"prime minister.\"\n\nIn the Netherlands the prime minister is officially referred to as \"minister-president\", although the informal term \"premier\" is also frequently used. His responsibilities are defined in the constitution of 1848 as the \"voorzitter van de ministerraad\" (chair of the council of ministers). The title of minister-president has been in use since 1945 and officially added to the constitution in 1983.\n\nIn Norway, Vidkun Quisling, head of the collaborationist government from 1942 to 1945 during the German occupation in World War II, held the title of Minister-President (in Norwegian, \"ministerpresident\").\n\nIn Spain, the head of government is known as \"presidente del gobierno\" or President of the Government but in English, he is more commonly referred to as the prime minister.\n"}

The thesis of the book is that people are more likely to sin as members of groups than as individuals. Niebuhr wrote the book in a single summer. He drew the book's contents from his experiences as a pastor in Detroit, Michigan prior to his professorship at UTS. The book attacks liberalism, both secular and religious, and is particularly critical of John Dewey and the Social Gospel. \"Moral Man and Immoral Society\" generated much controversy and raised Niebuhr's public profile significantly. Initial reception of the book by liberal Christian critics was negative, but its reputation soon improved as the rise of fascism throughout the 1930s was seen as having been predicted in the book. Soon after the book's publication, Paul Lehmann gave a copy to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who read it and was impressed by the book's thesis but disliked the book's critique of pacifism. The book eventually gained significant readership among American Jews because, after a period of considerable anti-theological sentiment among Jews in the United States, many Jews began to return to the study of theology and, having no Jewish works of theology to read, turned to Protestant theological works.\n\n"}

At its height it consisted of 50 to 100 loosely confederated groups, with a total membership that may have been as high as five or six million. Members were typically white, middle class, middle aged Christian women.\n\nThey organised petitions and demonstrations, published propaganda, and were active in political campaigns. They are credited with having delayed US assistance to the Allies. Their activity declined after the of 1944, but their leaders' opposition to the war continued.\n\nThe movement originated in 1939 in Los Angeles, California, with the National League of Mothers of America. It gradually grew into a loose confederation of 50 to 100 groups that developed on the west coast, midwest, and east coast. The members of these groups were largely white, middle-aged, middle class Christian women; their leaders were exclusively college-educated upper middle class Christians. The groups published books, pamphlets, and newsletters opposed to the war. The members testified before congress, picketed the White House, collected petitions, and participated in political campaigns. The leaders most likely learned their organizing experience from women's clubs, political parties, or movements led by men.\n\nThe mother's movement was involved in the Great Sedition Trial of 1944, in which the government charged an assortment of 30 heterogeneous individuals with violations of the Smith Act of 1940 and the Sedition Act of 1917; the defendants were held to be pro-fascist participants in a Nazi conspiracy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle to indict these activists for sedition. Some of the leaders that were called to testify before the grand jury were Elizabeth Dilling, Cathrine Curtis, and Lyrl Clark Van Hyning. A mistrial was declared on November 29, 1944, some time after the death of the trial judge, ex-congressman Edward C. Eicher.\n\nThe Mother's Movement failed to accomplish its main goal of ending involvement in World War II, which led to the declining enthusiasm for the cause. The movement slowly diminished after World War II was over. The leaders of the movement mostly dispersed into different paths and most of them lost the distinction they once had during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\n"}

During the North Yemen Civil War, fighting spilled over into South Yemen as the British attempted to establish an autonomous colony known as the Federation of South Arabia. Following the exit of the British armed forces, the NLF seized power from its rival, the Arab nationalist Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY). In the aftermath of the Emergency, the NLF reorganized itself into the Yemeni Socialist Party and established a single-party Marxist-Leninist government, known as the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.\n\nIn the late 50s Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser's Pan-Arabism had spread to the region and threatened Britain and the traditional Emirs of the region's control. In response the British were able to convince the feuding Emirs to merge into the Federation of South Arabia. In the federation the Aden Trade Union Congress had a large influence in the new assembly and to prevent it seizing control of the Federation in 1962 the Colony of Aden joined the Federation so that Aden's pro-British assembly members could counter the ATUC's influence. The day after Aden joined the Federation Muhammad al-Badr of the Yemenese monarchy was overthrown and civil war ensued between forces backed by Nassar like the National Liberation Front (NLF) and monarchist forces backed by the Saudis and British. This conflict spread throughout the region becoming what the British would term as the Aden Emergency which officially began when a state of emergency was declared in the State of Aden.\n\nThe anti-Royalist campaign for power spread to the \"Federation of South Arabia\" in 1964 when the NLF announced the start of their revolution. In 1964 there was a new British government headed by the Labour Party after they won the United Kingdom general election. They attempted to grant independence to the \"Federation of South Arabia\" by giving Abdullah al Asnag's FLOSY control of the country. This proposal was annulled by the American President Johnson who didn't want Britain to withdraw while the Americans were escalating the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1965 the British suspended the \"Federation of South Arabian\" government and imposed direct colonial rule. Realizing that the British weren't going to give him control Asnag fled the country and joined the NLF. However elements of the NLF become more radical Marxist and they split from the Egyptians. Asnag formed his own military organization, FLOSY, in order to counter the NLF. The NLF quickly denounced Asnag and FLOSY as Imperialist forces under control of Nasser and in addition to attacking the British also engaged FLOSY in combat. By February 1967 the British could no longer control or protect its bases in Aden and announced it was leaving the country, against American wishes.\n\nIn January 1967, there were mass riots by NLF and FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town, which continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops. During the period there were many attacks on the troops, and an Aden Airways Douglas DC-3 plane was destroyed in the air with no survivors. At the same time, the members of FLOSY and the NLF were also killing each other in large numbers. On 20 June 1967, there was a mutiny in the Federation of South Arabia Army, which also spread to the police. Order was restored by the British, mainly due to the efforts of the 1st Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, under the command of Lt-Col. Colin Campbell Mitchell.\n\nNevertheless, deadly guerrilla attacks particularly by the NLF soon resumed against British forces. Nasser threw its weight behind FLOSY and arrested the head of the NLF who was living at the time in Egypt. Officially FLOSY and the NLF refused to talk to the leaving British forces as they didn't want to be seen as agents of British Imperialism. However unofficial secret talks were held between the British and the NLF who conspired to defeat FLOSY so that the much hated Nasser supported FLOSY would be defeated. With the British withdrawing from Aden by the end of November 1967, earlier than had been planned by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and without an agreement on the succeeding governance. When the last governor of Aden, Sir Humphrey Trevelyan, left the country he had no one to give the keys to but as a point of respect had the government house repainted for whomever emerged victorious.\n\nOn November 30, 1967 the \"Federation of South Arabia\" ceased to exist when the People's Republic of South Yemen was proclaimed. In 1967 Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War thus obliging Egypt to evacuate its troops from Yemen. FLOSY, now without any military support from its Egyptian ally, continued fighting the NLF. However FLOSY's fate was sealed when the NLF managed to persuade the Yemen's Federal army to join the fight against FLOSY. On November 7, 1967 FLOSY tried to attack a federal army base but the army defeated FLOSY with the NLF's help, inflicting heavy losses on FLOSY. After the defeat FLOSY´s fighting force disbanded although some cadres and leaders remained outside the country. Most of the opposing leaders reconciled by 1968, in the aftermath of a final royalist siege of San'a'.\n\nQahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi held the presidency until 22 June 1969, when a hard-line Marxist group from within his own NLF seized control. Salim Rubai Ali (Salmin) replaced al-Shaabi. After the civil war in 1970, Saudi Arabia recognized the Yemen Arab Republic and a ceasefire against remaining belligerents was put in place. The NLF changed the name of South Yemen on 1 December 1970 to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). The NLF changed its name to the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) in 1978. All other political parties were amalgamated into the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), which became the only legal party.\n\n\n"}

OFID was conceived at the Conference of the Sovereigns and Heads of State of OPEC Member Countries, which was held in Algiers, Algeria, in March 1975. A Solemn Declaration of the Conference \"reaffirmed the natural solidarity which unites OPEC countries with other developing countries in their struggle to overcome underdevelopment\", and called for measures to strengthen cooperation between these countries.\n\nOFID's objective is to reinforce financial cooperation between OPEC Member Countries and other developing countries, by providing financial support to the latter for their socioeconomic development. The institution's central mission is to foster South-South Partnership with fellow developing countries worldwide with the aim of eradicating poverty. OFID's headquarters are located in Vienna, Austria. The current Director-General is Dr Abdulhamid Alkhalifa of Saudi Arabia. He assumed office as Director-General and Chief Executive Officer of OFID on November 1, 2018.\n\nThe OFID Headquarters (located in Vienna's first district, on the Ringstraße) was the residential palace of the Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz Karl. Built between 1864 and 1868 to the architectural design of Theophil von Hansen, the palace was sold to the German Order of Knights (Teutonic Order) in 1870 and used as headquarters of the Grand Master, the last of whom was Archduke Eugen. From 1894, it served as the palace of both the Grand and German Masters, acquiring the name, \"Deutschmeister-Palais\". In 1938 following the dissolution of the German Order of Knights, the building was seized by National Socialist (Nazi) Germany and, in 1942, it was handed over to the police authorities. Between 1945 and 1975, it served as headquarters of the Vienna police. After an interregnum, the building became the property of OFID.\n\nFollowing the First OPEC Summit in Algiers, Algeria, in 1975, Member Countries expressed their commitment to assist the developing countries through a collective financial facility. As a result, in 1976, the Finance Ministers of Member Countries met and established the OPEC Special Fund, through which Member Countries would channel aid to developing countries. The OPEC Special Fund started its operations in 1976, with initial resources of about $800 million. By the end of 1977 it had extended 71 loans to 58 developing countries, and had channeled donations from its Member Countries to other development institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Trust Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nAs a result of its successful performance, member countries decided in 1980 to convert the temporary facility into a permanent legal entity called the OPEC Fund for International Development; it became a permanent international development agency in May 1980.\n\nOFID has 13 member countries: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Ecuador reactivated its membership in June 2014 after a 22-year absence.\n\nOFID provides financial assistance in a number of ways, with the distribution between the different types of aid changing over time as conditions in recipient countries evolve and needs alter. The methods of funding have included:\n\nOFID's resources consist of voluntary contributions made by its member countries and the accumulated reserves derived from the institution's various operations. A replenishment of US$1 billion was approved in June 2011 by the institution's supreme authority, the Ministerial Council, as a direct response to the increasing needs of developing countries and the negative impact of the financial crisis on their economies.\n\nAll developing countries are, in principle, eligible for OFID assistance, although the least developed countries are given higher priority and have received more than one-half of the institution’s cumulative commitments to date. Also eligible are international institutions whose activities benefit the developing countries. OFID Member Countries are excluded from benefiting from assistance, except in the case of disaster relief or within the context of a regional program. Over the years, OFID has spread its presence to 134 countries, of which 53 are in Africa, 43 in Asia, 31 in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 7 in Europe.\n\nOFID's operations are organized into 10 focus areas:\n\nOFID’s Energy for the Poor initiative (EPI) emerged from the Solemn Declaration of the Third OPEC Summit, which took place in Riyadh in November 2007. The Declaration called for the complete eradication of energy poverty as a global priority and urged OFID to intensify its efforts in support of this goal. The EPI was launched by King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia in June 2008 and subsequently adopted by OFID as its flagship program.\n\nSince 2008, OFID has worked tirelessly to push energy poverty to the top of the international agenda and was responsible for the universal acceptance of energy poverty eradication as the “missing” Millennium Development Goal.\n\nIn June 2012, OFID Member Countries issued a Ministerial Declaration on Energy Poverty and dedicated a revolving minimum sum of US$1bn to finance the EPI. OFID is boosting the volume of its operations in the energy sector accordingly, in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders.\n\nOFID has Permanent Observer status at the United Nations. As a result of its high-profile advocacy efforts, OFID is a key partner in Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL), which has three goals: to achieve universal access to sustainable energy, to double energy efficiency, and to double the share of renewables, all by the year 2030. \nOFID considers its own EPI as complementary to the objectives of SE4ALL. In 2011, OFID’s Director-General Suleiman Jasir Al-Herbish was invited to join the UN Secretary-General’s High-level Group on SE4ALL, which was charged with developing the Action Agenda that was presented to the 2012 Rio+20 Summit.\n\nPublic sector lending forms the central pillar of OFID’s operations, accounting for more than two-thirds of total, cumulative commitments. These operations are carried out in direct cooperation with the governments of partner countries in support of their national development strategies.\nOFID’s public sector loans are concessional, with low interest rates and long repayment periods. Lending terms are based on several factors, including the per capita gross national income (GNI) of each Partner Country. \nAlso included under the public sector is OFID’s contribution to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.\n\nThe Private sector facility (PSF) was established in 1998 in response to growing demand among partner countries for investment in private enterprise, which is increasingly seen as the engine of economic and social growth. The Facility is a market-oriented financing window that responds to the demand for financing in developing countries in support of their private sector development strategies.\nThe PSF seeks to promote economic development by encouraging the growth of productive private enterprise in developing countries and supporting the development of local capital markets. Successful interventions stimulate economic growth, generating jobs and income and thereby reduce poverty.\n\nOFID’s Trade Finance Facility (TFF) was established in 2006 to broaden the means available to OFID to alleviate poverty and promote economic development. It is a distinct, additional window for supporting eligible developing countries in their efforts to achieve growth and prosperity. The Facility seeks out transactions that are developmentally, environmentally and socially sound, applying credit principles in line with standard practices and setting reasonable market-based return targets.\nTFF financing has been used to support the import/export of a diverse range of goods/sectors, including oil, cotton, steel, strategic food products, garments and equipment.\n\nGrants are awarded largely on the basis of the type of project and its expected outcomes; the number of beneficiaries; and the recipient country’s socio-economic situation. The Grants Program includes the following sub-programs:\n\nThe Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) is an autonomous intergovernmental financial institution established within the framework of the United Nations. Since 1981 OFID has supported the CFC, having made available a total of US$83.6 million in support of the institution. The First Account of US$37.2 million enabled 38 least developed member countries to complete their subscriptions to the CFC First Account Capital. By the end of 2014, OFID had signed agreements with 37 of these countries.\n\nUnder the Framework of Financial Support and within the context of the Second Account totalling US$46.4 million, the amount of US$37.9 million has been committed in support of 57 commodity projects in 52 countries; 32 in Africa, 14 in Asia and six in Latin America. Projects eligible for financial support are commodity-focused covering the value chain from production to consumption and benefiting the poor.\n\nOFID played a significant role in the establishment of IFAD, channeling US$861.1 million in contributions from OPEC member countries towards the agency’s initial capital and first replenishment. Since IFAD's creation, OPEC member states have maintained their firm support of the agency, contributing to additional replenishments of its resources. In addition, OFID itself has given a further US$20 million as a special contribution from its own resources.\n\nVia OFID, financial resources valued at US$110 million were transferred by a number of OPEC member states to the IMF-administered Trust Fund which was established in May 1976. Representing profits accruing to seven of these countries from the sale of gold held on their behalf by the IMF, these resources were allocated to provide concessional balance of payments assistance to eligible low-income IMF member countries.\n\n"}
{"id": "755284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=755284", "title": "Passive obedience", "text": "Passive obedience\n\nPassive obedience is a religious and political doctrine, which states that people have a moral duty to obey the law, in particular accepting punishment as part of this obedience.\n\nThe most notable publication describing this doctrine was Bishop George Berkeley's \"A Discourse on Passive Obedience\" (1712). The tract is considered Berkeley's major contribution to moral and political philosophy.\n\nIn \"A Discourse on Passive Obedience\", Berkeley defends the thesis that people have \"a moral duty to observe the negative precepts (prohibitions) of the law, including the duty not to resist the execution of punishment.\" However, Berkeley does make exceptions to this sweeping moral statement, stating that we need not observe precepts of \"usurpers or even madmen\" and that people can obey different supreme authorities if there are more than one claims to the highest authority (§52). On the other hand, Berkeley also insists that disobedience to a tyrant remains wrong, even when the tyrant's violation of moral law is a worse violation than rebellion would be; when such immoral tyranny becomes insufferable, rebellion is predictable, and violates no rights of the tyrant, yet may still violate moral law (§44). In some places, Berkeley's argument for blind obedience to a de facto authority resembles Thomas Hobbes's argument in Leviathan, on the grounds that rebellion can lead to anarchic violence and chaos which is worse than the worst tyranny (§§16, 47, 51), although Berkeley disagrees with Hobbes's idea that moral and political obligation ultimately rests on the law of self-perservation (§33).\n\nIn Calvinism, salvation depends on Christ's active obedience, obeying the laws and commands of God the Father, and passive obedience, enduring the punishment of the crucifixion suffering all the just penalties due to men for their sins. The two are seen as distinct but inseparable; passive obedience on its own only takes men back to the state of Adam before the Fall. Reformed theologian, Louis Berkhof helpfully wrote: \"His active obedience consists in all that He did to observe the law in behalf of sinners, as a condition for obtaining eternal life; and His passive obedience in all that He suffered in paying the penalty of sin and thus discharging the debt of all his people.\"(Manual of Christian Doctrine 215)\n\nThe Scottish theologian John Cameron's support for passive obedience at the start of the 17th century meant that he was principal of the University of Glasgow for less than a year in 1622.\n\nAt a human level a similar contrast distinguished between actively obeying the \"de facto\" power and law even when it conflicted with God's law or laws of nature, and passively obeying (not resisting) when it came to punishment for not actively obeying. \n\nIt was usually associated with the seventeenth-century Church of England and the Scottish Episcopal Church of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and was central to the ideology of the Tory Party and the Jacobites. It is most generally seen in reference to Tory opposition to the Glorious Revolution, which saw Parliamentary determination of the succession of the English crown against primogeniture and the wishes of James II. \n\nPassive obedience appears twice in Victor Hugo's \"Les Miserables\", first as a scene heading \"The Heroism of Passive Obedience\" when the bishop entertains Valjean, and later in the text on the impact of armies when describing French intervention in Spain in 1823.\n\nDuring his coup d'état of 2 December 1851, the then French president Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte reminded officers and soldiers of their pledge and duty of passive obedience to his orders as chief of the government, since he individually was responsible to the French people and posterity.\n\n"}

The Pledge to America was written by Rep. Kevin McCarthy's staffer Brian Wild at the behest of House Republican leaders. The Pledge to America was publicly released on September 23, 2010, at a hardware store in Sterling, Virginia.\n\nThe pledge criticized the Obama administration, stating that \"An arrogant and out-of-touch government of self-appointed elites makes decisions, issues mandates, and enacts laws without accepting or requesting the input of the many\". It lists a number of issues, along with the Republican plan to solve them.\n\nIn the pledge, Republicans call for:\n\n\nThe pledge has generally received support from Republicans. National Review called it bolder than the Contract with America and a \"shrewd political document.\" Political strategist and former President George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove called it \"important\" and \"practical.\" Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh defended the Pledge to America, arguing, \"There's nothing crazy about any of this.\"\n\nSome conservative commentators, however, were critical. Erick Erickson, managing editor of Redstate.com called it \"perhaps the most ridiculous thing to come out of Washington since George McClellan.\" Republican-affiliated columnist David Frum interpreted the document as \"a GOP pledge to do nothing.\" Some social conservatives, such as Family Research Council president Tony Perkins and Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission president Richard Land, believed the document could have made a stronger commitment to moral issues.\n\nDemocrats and \"The Daily Show\"'s Jon Stewart have criticized the proposals as recycled ideas from the Bush administration. Economist Paul Krugman criticized the document for denouncing deficits but calling for tax cuts (which he notes would add $3.7 trillion over the first ten years after its enactment) without specific spending cuts: \"In essence, what [the Republicans] say is, 'Deficits are a terrible thing. Let's make them much bigger.'\" Other commentators agreed that \"the numbers don't remotely add up\" and that the Pledge \"should be read as a plan to explode debt through the ceiling.\" Keith Boykin cited a lack of ethnic diversity in the photographs accompanying the Pledge to America, calling it a pledge \"to White America.\"\n\nIn a \"Washington Post\" editorial, pollster Frank Luntz, who polled Republican proposals in 1994 before Republicans drafted the Contract with America, found the Pledge to America more partisan-oriented, more anti-government, and lacked a \"detailed course of action,\" but concluded it was a justifiable effort.\n\nThe Republicans' campaign tactics were effective, as Boehner's handpicked National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Pete Sessions encouraged incumbents to raise money themselves rather than relying upon the NRCC for funding. Kevin McCarthy, one of the founders of the Young Guns Program, had also implemented strategies used by former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Rahm Emanuel back in 2006, such as aggressively recruiting Republican candidates to challenge Democrats in districts considered safe and running ads attacking incumbent Democrats before the campaign began to weaken or persuade them to retire.\n\nThe Republicans made a net gain of 63 seats from Democrats and retook control of the chamber which they lost in the 2006 midterm elections. This number is the highest of any House victory for a single party since 1948, and the highest of any midterm election since 1938.\n\nSeveral powerful Democrats were defeated, including several who were chairman of standing committees, including Ike Skelton of the House Armed Services Committee, John Spratt of the House Budget Committee, and James Oberstar of the House Transportation Committee. Other congressional veterans including Paul Kanjorski, Chet Edwards, and Earl Pomeroy were also not returned to Congress. House Appropriations Committee chairman David Obey had dropped out of his re-election race.\n\n none of the items in the pledge have been enacted into law.

{"id": "10506838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10506838", "title": "Political history of medieval Karnataka", "text": "Political history of medieval Karnataka\n\nThe political history of medieval Karnataka spans the 4th to the 16th centuries, when the empires that evolved in the Karnataka region of India made a lasting impact on the subcontinent. Before this, alien empires held sway over the region, and the nucleus of power was outside modern Karnataka. The medieval era can be broadly divided into several periods: The earliest native kingdoms and imperialism; the successful domination of the Gangetic plains in northern India and rivalry with the empires of Tamilakam over the Vengi region; and the domination of the southern Deccan and consolidation against Muslim invasion. The origins of the rise of the Karnataka region as an independent power date back to the fourth-century birth of the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi, the earliest of the native rulers to conduct administration in the native language of Kannada in addition to the official Sanskrit. This is the historical starting point in studying the development of the region as an enduring geopolitical entity and of Kannada as an important regional language.\n\nIn the southern regions of Karnataka, the Western Gangas of Talakad were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas and Gangas were followed by the imperial dynasties of the Badami Chalukya Empire, the Rashtrakuta Empire, the Western Chalukya Empire, the Hoysala Empire and the Vijayanagara Empire, all patronising the ancient Indic religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from the west of the subcontinent. The Muslim invasion of the Deccan resulted in the breaking away of the feudatory Sultanates in the 14th century. The rule of the Bahamani Sultanate of Bidar and the Bijapur Sultanate from the northern Deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. The hereditary ruling families and clans ably served the large empires and upheld the local culture and traditions. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 brought about a slow disintegration of Kannada-speaking regions into minor kingdoms that struggled to maintain autonomy in an age dominated by foreigners until unification and independence in 1947.\n\nPrior to and during the early centuries of the first millennium, large areas of the Karnataka region was ruled by such imperial powers as the Mauryas of Maghada and later the Satavahanas, empires whose centres of power were in the Gangetic plains and Central India respectively. With the weakening of the Satavahanas, the Pallavas of Kanchi took control for a brief duration. In the 4th century, the rise to power of the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi identified the Karnataka region as an independent political entity and Kannada as an administrative language from the middle of the 5th century. The Kadambas were natives of the Talagunda region (in modern Shivamogga district) as proven by inscriptions. Mayurasharma, a Brahmin native of Talagunda who was humiliated by a Pallava guard, rose in rage against the Pallava control of the Banavasi region and declared his independence in 345. After many wars, the Pallava king had to accept the sovereignty of the Kadambas and Mayurasharma, the founding king, crowned himself at Banavasi (in the present day Uttara Kannada district).\n\nThe fact that the Kadambas cultivated marital ties with the imperial Vakatakas and Gupta dynasties attests to their power. Kakusthavarma, the most powerful ruler of the dynasty whom inscriptions describe as \"ornament of the Kadamba family\" and \"Sun among the kings of wide spread flame\", gave one daughter in marriage to Vakataka Narendrasena and another to Skandagupta, grandson of Chandragupta II of the Gupta dynasty. Historians trace their rise to political power through the examination of the contemporaneous Sanskrit writing, \"Aichitya Vichara Charcha\" by Kshemendra, which quotes portions of a writing \"Kunthalesvara Dautya\" by the famous poet Kalidasa. Here Kalidasa describes his visit to the Kadamba kingdom as an ambassador where he was not offered a seat in the court of the Kadamba king and had to sit on the ground. Historians view this act as one of assertion by the Kadambas who considered themselves equal to the imperial Gupta dynasty.\n\nFamily feuds and conflicts ended the Kadamba rule in the middle of the 6th century when the last Kadamba ruler Krishna Varma II was subdued by Pulakeshin I of the Chalukya feudatory, ending their sovereign rule. The Kadambas would continue to rule parts of Karnataka and Goa for many centuries to come but never again as an independent kingdom. Some historians view the Kadambas as the originators of the Karnataka architectural tradition although there were elements in common with the structures built by the contemporaneous Pallavas of Kanchi. The oldest surviving Kadamba structure is one dating to the late 5th century in Halsi in modern Belgaum district. The most prominent feature of their architectural style, one that remained popular centuries later and was used by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar kings, is the \"Kadamba Shikara\" (Kadamba tower) with a \"Kalasa\" (pot) on top.\n\nThe Western Ganga Dynasty, contemporaries of the Kadambas, came to power from Kolar but in the late 4th century - early 5th century moved their capital to Talakad in modern Mysore district. They ruled the region historically known as Gangavadi comprising most of the modern southern districts of Karnataka. Acting as a buffer state between the Kannada kingdoms of Karnataka region and the Tamil kingdoms of Tamilakam, the Western Ganga architectural innovations show mixed influences. Their sovereign rule ended around the same time as the Kadambas when they came under the Badami Chalukya control. The Western Gangas continued to rule as a feudatory till the beginning of the eleventh century when they were defeated by the Cholas of Tanjavur. Important figures among the Gangas were King Durvinita and Shivamara II, admired as able warriors and scholars, and minister Chavundaraya who was a builder, a warrior and a writer in Kannada and Sanskrit. The most important architectural contributions of these Gangas are the monuments and basadis of Shravanabelagola, the monolith of Gomateshwara termed as the mightiest achievement in the field of sculpture in ancient Karnataka and the \"Panchakuta\" basadi ( five towers) at Kambadahalli. Their free standing pillars (called \"Mahasthambhas\" and \"Brahmasthambhas\") and Hero stones (\"virgal\") with sculptural detail are also considered a unique contribution.\n\nThe Chalukya dynasty, natives of the Aihole and Badami region in Karnataka, were at first a feudatory of the Kadambas.\n\nThese victories earned him the title \"Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy\" (lord of the south). Pulakeshin II continued his conquests in the east where he conquered all kingdoms in his way and reached the Bay of Bengal in present-day Orissa. A Chalukya viceroyalty was set up in Gujarat and Vengi (coastal Andhra) and princes from the Badami family were dispatched to rule them. Having subdued the Pallavas of Kanchipuram, he accepted tributes from the Pandyas of Madurai, Chola dynasty and Cheras of the Kerala region. Pulakeshin II thus became the master of India, south of the Narmada River. Pulakeshin II is widely regarded as one of the great kings in Indian history. Hiuen-Tsiang, a Chinese traveller visited the court of Pulakeshin II at this time and Persian emperor Khosrau II exchanged ambassadors. However, the continuous wars with Pallavas took a turn for the worse in 642 when the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I avenged his father's defeat, conquered and plundered the capital of Pulakeshin II who may have died in battle. A century later, Chalukya Vikramaditya II marched victoriously into Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital and occupied it on three occasions, the third time under the leadership of his son and crown prince Kirtivarman II. He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a Kannada inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple. He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the Pandyas, Cholas and Keralas in addition to subduing a Kalabhra ruler.\n\nThe Kappe Arabhatta record from this period (700) in \"tripadi\" (three line) metre is considered the earliest available record in Kannada poetics. The most enduring legacy of the Chalukya dynasty is the architecture and art that they left behind. More than one hundred and fifty monuments attributed to them, built between 450 and 700, have survived in the Malaprabha basin in Karnataka. The constructions are centred in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland. The structural temples at Pattadakal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the cave temples of Badami, the temples at Mahakuta and early experiments in temple building at Aihole are their most celebrated monuments. Two of the famous paintings at Ajanta cave no. 1, \"The Temptation of the Buddha\" and \"The Persian Embassy\" are also credited to them.\n\nIn the middle of the 8th century the Chalukya rule was ended by their feudatory, the Rashtrakuta family rulers of Berar (in present-day Amravati district of Maharashtra). Sensing an opportunity during a weak period in the Chalukya rule, Dantidurga trounced the great Chalukyan \"Karnatabala\" (power of Karnata). Having overthrown the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas made Manyakheta their capital (modern Malkhed in Gulbarga district). Although the origins of the early Rashtrakuta ruling families in central India and the Deccan in the 6th and 7th centuries is controversial, during the eighth through the tenth centuries they emphasised the importance of the Kannada language in conjunction with Sanskrit in their administration. Rashtrakuta inscriptions are in Kannada and Sanskrit only. They encouraged literature in both languages and thus literature flowered under their rule.\nThe Rashtrakutas quickly became the most powerful Deccan empire, making their initial successful forays into the doab region of Ganges River and Jamuna River during the rule of Dhruva Dharavarsha. The rule of his son Govinda III signaled a new era with Rashtrakuta victories against the Pala Dynasty of Bengal and Gurjara Pratihara of north western India resulting in the capture of Kannauj. The Rashtrakutas held Kannauj intermittently during a period of a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich Gangetic plains. Because of Govinda III's victories, historians have compared him to Alexander the Great and Pandava Arjuna of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.\nThe Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank the icy water of the Himalayan stream and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges River. Amoghavarsha I, eulogised by contemporary Arab traveller Sulaiman as one among the four great emperors of the world, succeeded Govinda III to the throne and ruled during an important cultural period that produced landmark writings in Kannada and Sanskrit. The benevolent development of Jain religion was a hallmark of his rule. Because of his religious temperament, his interest in the arts and literature and his peace-loving nature, he has been compared to emperor Ashoka. The rule of Indra III in the tenth century enhanced the Rashtrakuta position as an imperial power as they conquered and held Kannauj again. Krishna III followed Indra III to the throne in 939. A patron of Kannada literature and a powerful warrior, his reign marked the submission of the Paramara of Ujjain in the north and Cholas in the south.\n\nAn Arabic writing \"Silsilatuttavarikh\" (851) called the Rashtrakutas one among the four principle empires of the world. \"Kitab-ul-Masalik-ul-Mumalik\" (912) called them the \"greatest kings of India\" and there were many other contemporaneous books written in their praise. The Rashtrakuta empire at its peak spread from Cape Comorin in the south to Kannauj in the north and from Banaras in the east to Broach (Bharuch) in the west.\nWhile the Rashtrakutas built many fine monuments in the Deccan, the most extensive and sumptuous of their work is the monolithic Kailasanatha temple at Ellora, the temple being a splendid achievement. In Karnataka their most famous temples are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal. All of the monuments are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nIn the late 10th century, the Western Chalukyas, also known as the Kalyani Chalukyas or 'Later' Chalukyas rose to power by overthrowing the Rashtrakutas under whom they had been serving as feudatories. Manyakheta was their capital early on before they moved it to Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan). Whether the kings of this empire belonged to the same family line as their namesakes, the Badami Chalukyas is still debated. Whatever the Western Chalukya origins, Kannada remained their language of administration and the Kannada and Sanskrit literature of their time was prolific. Tailapa II, a feudatory ruler from Tardavadi (modern Bijapur district), re-established the Chalukya rule by defeating the Rashtrakutas during the reign of Karka II. He timed his rebellion to coincide with the confusion caused by the invading Paramara of Central India to the Rashtrakutas capital in 973. This era produced prolonged warfare with the Chola dynasty of Tamilakam for control of the resources of the Godavari River-Krishna River doab region in Vengi. Someshvara I, a brave Chalukyan king, successfully curtailed the growth of the Chola Empire to the south of the Tungabhadra River region despite suffering some defeats while maintaining control over his feudatories in the Konkan, Gujarat, Malwa and Kalinga regions. For approximately 100 years, beginning in the early 11th century, the Cholas occupied large areas of South Karnataka region (Gangavadi).\n\nIn 1076, the ascent of the most famous king of this Chalukya family, Vikramaditya VI, changed the balance of power in favour of the Chalukyas. His fifty-year reign was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to as the \"Chalukya Vikrama era\". His victories over the Cholas in the late 11th and early 12th centuries put an end to the Chola influence in the Vengi region permanently. Some of the well-known contemporaneous feudatory families of the Deccan under Chalukya control were the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuri. At their peak, the Western Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the Narmada River in the north to the Kaveri River in the south. Vikramaditya VI is considered one of the most influential kings of Indian history. Important architectural works were created by these Chalukyas, especially in the Tungabhadra river valley, that served as a conceptual link between the building idioms of the early Badami Chalukyas and the later Hoysalas. With the weakening of the Chalukyas in the decades following the death of Vikramaditya VI in 1126, the feudatories of the Chalukyas gained their independence.\n\nThe Kalachuris of Karnataka, whose ancestors were immigrants into the southern deccan from central India, had ruled as a feudatory from Mangalavada (modern Mangalavedhe in Maharashtra). Bijjala II, the most powerful ruler of this dynasty, was a commander (\"mahamandaleswar\") during the reign of Chalukya Vikramaditya VI. Seizing an opportune moment in the waning power of the Chalukyas, Bijjala II declared independence in 1157 and annexed their capital Kalyani. His rule was cut short by his assassination in 1167 and the ensuing civil war caused by his sons fighting over the throne ended the dynasty as the last Chalukya scion regained control of Kalyani. This victory however, was short-lived as the Chalukyas were eventually driven out by the Seuna Yadavas.\n\nThe Hoysalas had become a powerful force even during their rule from Belur in the 11th century as a feudatory of the Chalukyas (in the south Karnataka region). In the early 12th century they successfully fought the Cholas in the south, convincingly defeating them in the battle of Talakad and moved their capital to nearby Halebidu. Historians refer to the founders of the dynasty as natives of Malnad Karnataka, based on the numerous inscriptions calling them \"Maleparolganda\" or \"Lord of the Male (hills) chiefs\" (\"Malepas\"). With the waning of the Western Chalukya power, the Hoysalas declared their independence in the late twelfth century.\n\nDuring this period of Hoysala control, distinctive Kannada literary metres such as \"Ragale\" (blank verse), \"Sangatya\" (meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), \"Shatpadi\" (seven line) etc. became widely accepted. The Hoysalas expanded the Vesara architecture stemming from the Chalukyas, culminating in the Hoysala architectural articulation and style as exemplified in the construction of the Chennakeshava Temple at Belur and the Hoysaleshwara Temple at Halebidu. Both these temples were built in commemoration of the victories of the Hoysala Vishnuvardhana against the Cholas in 1116. Veera Ballala II, the most effective of the Hoysala rulers, defeated the aggressive Pandya when they invaded the Chola kingdom and assumed the titles \"Establisher of the Chola Kingdom\"\n(\"Cholarajyapratishtacharya\"), \"Emperor of the south\" (\"Dakshina Chakravarthi\") and \"Hoysala emperor\" (\"Hoysala Chakravarthi\"). The Hoysalas extended their foothold in areas known today as Tamil Nadu around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near Srirangam a provincial capital. This gave them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the southern Deccan.\n\nIn the early 13th century, with the Hoysala power remaining unchallenged, the first of the Muslim incursions into South India began. After over two decades of waging war against a foreign power, the Hoysala ruler at the time, Veera Ballala III, died in the battle of Madurai in 1343. This resulted in the merger of the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire with the areas administered by Harihara I, founder of the Vijayanagara Empire, located in the Tungabhadra region in present-day Karnataka. The new kingdom thrived for another two centuries with Vijayanagara as its capital.\n\nThe Vijayanagara Empire quickly rose to imperial status as early as the late 14th century. During the reign of Bukka Raya I, the island of Lanka paid tributes and ambassadors were exchanged with the Ming Dynasty of China. The empire's most famous rulers were Deva Raya II and the Tuluva king Krishnadevaraya. Deva Raya II (known as \"Gajabetekara\" or hunter of elephants) ascended the throne in 1424 and was the most effective of the Sangama dynasty rulers. He quelled rebelling feudal lords, the Zamorin of Calicut and the Quilon in the south, and invaded the island of Lanka while becoming overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and Tanasserim. After a brief decline, the empire reached its peak in the early 16th century during the rule of Krishnadevaraya when the Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south.\n\nMany important monuments at Hampi were either completed or commissioned during the reign of Krishnadevaraya. The enduring legacy of this empire is the vast open-air theatre of monuments at the regal capital, Vijayanagara, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Vijayanagara architecture is a vibrant blend of the preceding Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola styles. Literature in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit languages found royal patronage. Telugu attained its height in popularity and reached its peak under Krishnadevaraya. The Kannada Haridasa movement contributed greatly to Carnatic music and fostered a strong Hindu sentiment across South India. With the defeat of the Vijayanagara Empire in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the Deccan sultanates, the Karnataka region and South India in general became fragmented and subsumed under the rule of various former feudatories of the empire. A diminished Vijayanagara Empire moved its capital to Penukonda in modern Andhra Pradesh and later to Chandragiri and Vellore before disintegrating. In the south and coastal Karnataka region, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Keladi Nayaka of Shimoga held sway while the northern regions were under the control of the Bijapur Sultanate. The Nayaka kingdom lasted into the 18th century before merging with the Kingdom of Mysore which remained a princely state until Indian independence in 1947, though they came under the British Raj (rule) in 1799 following the defeat and death of the last independent Mysore king, Tipu Sultan.\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate, a contemporary of the Vijayanagara Empire, was founded in 1347 by Alla-ud-din-Hasan, a breakaway commander of the armies of the northern invaders led by Mohammed-bin-Tughlaq. The capital was Gulbarga but was later moved further north to Bidar in 1430. The first of the Muslim invasions of the Deccan came in the early decades of the 14th century. At its peak, the Bahamani kingdom extended from the Krishna River in the south to Penganga River in the north, thus covering the regions of northern parts of modern Karnataka, parts of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. The most famous of the Bahamani Kings was Firuz Shah (also known as Taj Ud Din Firuz), who ruled from 1397 to 1422. Militarily, the rule of Firuz Shah had uneven success against the Vijayanagara kings while he was more convincingly successful against the Kherla rulers of Madhya Pradesh and the Vema Reddies of Rajamundry, areas that he annexed in 1417. His last encounter with the Vijayanagara armies in 1417 was disastrous and led to his defeat, ill health and ultimate death in 1422.\n\nContemporary writers such as Tabataba, in his writings have heaped praise on Firuz Shah. Tabataba wrote of the king as, \"[a]n impetuous, mighty monarch who patronised learned men, Sheiks and hermits\", while Shirazi described him as \"a just, pious and generous king and one without equal\". He has earned the honorific \"Sultan-i-ghazian\" for his bravery, tolerant nature and patronage of the fine arts. In the opinion of one historian, Firuz Shah was one of the most notable Sultans to rule in India. Another well-known figure from this kingdom was Kwaja Mahamud Gavan, the prime minister, who served under several kings and regents. He rose above the kings and princess of the dynasty by virtue of his ministerial, administrative, martial, literary and philanthropic abilities. A Persian by descent and a visitor to Bidar in 1445, he impressed the ruling Sultan Alla-ud-din II and was chosen to become a minister in his court. As a commander he was able to extend the kingdom from Hubli in the south to Goa in the west and Kondavidu and Rajamahendri in the east. He soon rose to the position of prime minister (\"Vakil-Us-Sultanat\").\n\nThe Bahamanis introduced the large-scale use of paper in administration and began the Indo-Sarasenic architectural style, designed and constructed by Persian architects and artisans, (also known as \"Deccani\" architecture) with its local influences in Karnataka. The Sultanate monuments of Bidar and Gulbarga are testimony to their interest in architecture. The Bande Nawaz tombs and a Jama Masjid in Gulbarga which exhibits a Spanish influence are well known. In Bidar, their buildings have Persian, Turkish, Arabic and Roman influences (the Solah Khamba mosque being an example). Rangin Mahal, Gangan Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Chini Mahal, Nagina Mahal and the Taqk Mahal are some of the palaces built by them that have retained their beauty. The Ahmad Shah Wali tombs are noted for their decor, and the school of learning (\"madrasa\") built by Gavan in Bidar (1472), with its lecture halls, library, mosque and residential houses are also famous. In the later part of the 15th century, with a growing rift between the local Deccani Muslims and the \"Pardeshi\" Muslims (foreign) who occupied influential positions in the kingdom, the execution of Gavan under dubious circumstances in 1481, and constant wars with the Vijayanagara kings weakened the Bahamani Kingdom eventually bringing about its end in 1527.\n\nThe Bijapur Sultanate (or Adilshahi Kingdom) emerged towards the end of the 15th century with the weakening of the Bahmani Sultanate . The main sources of information about this kingdom comes from contemporaneous inscriptions and writings in Persian and Kannada, travelogues of European visitors to the Deccan and inscriptions of neighbouring kingdoms. In 1489, Yusuf Adilkhan, a Turkic general in the Bahmani army, broke away to found the kingdom from modern Bijapur . Throughout his rule, the Sultanate was at war with the Vijayanagara Empire over the strategic Raichur doab, with the Portuguese over Goa, with the Barid Shahis of Bidar and later with the erstwhile feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire who had gained independence after 1565. The Italian writer Varathema wrote about the founder Adilkhan and Bijapur, \"A powerful and prosperous king\", \"the city was encircled by many fortifications and contained beautiful and majestic buildings\".\n\nInter-Sultanate marriages normalised relations and Ali I (1557–1580) joined a confederacy of Sultanates who eventually inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565. The most notable ruler of the dynasty was Ibrahim II (1580–1626) who ascended the throne as a nine-year-old with Chandbibi, the king's aunt acting as the regent. Later when Ibrahim II was defeated by the first of the Moghul incursions into the Deccan, he gave his daughter in marriage to Daniyal, a son of Emperor Akbar, but managed to collect tributes from the former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire. According to a historian, the rule of Ibrahim II was the high point of the Bijapur Sultanate. A tolerant king inclined to the fine arts, the earliest book on music in Urdu language called \"Kitab-e-Nauras\" is ascribed to him. The opening song in the book is an invocation of the Hindu Goddess Saraswati. During the rule of his son Muhammad, Shahji Bhosle from Ahmadnagar joined the Bijapur army and along with commander Ranadullah Khan conducted many successful campaigns in the southern Deccan collecting tribute from local rulers there. The final end of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Vellore came during these campaigns.\n\nHowever, the rise of Maratha Shivaji and constant invasions by the Mughals from the north took its toll on the kingdom, eventually bringing it to an end in the later part of the 17th century. The contributions of the Bijapur Sultanate in the Indo-Saracenic idiom to the architectural landscape of Karnataka is noteworthy. Their most famous monuments are the mausoleums called Ibrahim Rauza and the Gol Gumbaz apart from many other palaces and mosques. The elegance, finish and beauty of Mehtar Mahal is claimed by a historian to be equal to anything in Cairo. Their Kali Masjid at Lakshmeshwar is a synthesis of Hindu and Muslim styles. The Ibrahim Rauza built by Ibrahim II is a combination of a mausoleum and a mosque and is called the \"Taj Mahal of the Deccan\". The Gol Gumbaz built by Muhammad is the largest dome in India and the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia with an impressive \"whispering gallery\". Some historians consider this one of the architectural marvels of the world. Persian language was given state patronage while the use of the local languages, Kannada and Marathi was popularised in local affairs.\n\nThe fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota started a slow disintegration of the Kannada speaking region into many short-lived \"palegar\" chiefdoms, and the better known Kingdom of Mysore and the kingdom of Keladi Nayakas, which were to later become important centres of Kannada literary production. These kingdoms and the Nayakas (\"chiefs\") of Tamil country continued to owe nominal support to a diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Penukonda (1570) and later from Chandragiri (1586) in modern Andhra Pradesh, followed by a brief period of independence. By the mid-17th century, large areas in north Karnataka came under the control of the Bijapur Sultanate who waged several wars in a bid to establish a hegemony over the southern Deccan. The defeat of the Bijapur Sultanate at the hands of the Mughals in late 17th century added a new dimension to the prevailing confusion. The constant wars of the local kingdoms with the two new rivals, the Mughals and the Marathas, and among themselves, caused further instability in the region. Major areas of Karnataka came under the rule of the Mughals and the Marathas. Under Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, the Mysore Kingdom reached its zenith of power but had to face the growing English might who by now had a firm foothold in the subcontinent. After the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799 in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war, the Mysore Kingdom came under the British umbrella. More than a century later, with the dawn of India as an independent nation in 1947, the unification of Kannada speaking regions as modern Karnataka state brought four centuries of political uncertainty (and centuries of foreign rule) to an end.\n\n\n"}

The raid, the fifth South African attack on a neighbouring country since 1981, killed 12 people including women and children; only five of the victims were members of the African National Congress.\n\nIn the 1980s, relations between Botswana and South Africa were strained. Anti-apartheid groups like the African National Congress (ANC) used Botswana and other countries in Southern Africa as refuge. The ANC set up bases in Gaborone that issued crash courses for guerilla attacks; under the guise of weekend tourists, new recruits would receive training on grenade handling and a list of targets to attack. Despite Botswana's non-alignment policy, the South African Defence Force conducted several cross-border raids to stop the groups.\n\nIn 1981, the Botswana Defence Force (BDF) purchased Soviet weaponry. President Quett Masire justified the deal as a way to allow BDF to better prevent groups like the ANC from crossing into South Africa. Shots were fired across the Botswana-South African border in April 1982. Grenade attacks earlier in the week outside Cape Town that killed two South Africa members of Parliament and news of an expected attack on Pretoria in July 1985 pushed General Constand Viljoen to launch the attack.\n\nThe following locations were identified as MK safe houses in Gaborone by the SADF:\n\nAround 1:30 am on 14 June, South African soldiers crossed the border into Botswana. To lead the attack, the SADF employed former operatives of the Selous Scouts, a special regiment of the Rhodesian Security Forces. General Viljoen stated that the soldiers used megaphones to urge the residents of Gaborone to hide in their houses while the raid occurred. According to Manuel Olifant, a policeman involved in the raid, the SADF readied around 50 tanks, helicopters, and jet fighters in Zeerust for use if Botswana retaliated, but they were not needed.\n\nTwelve people were killed in the attack. A partial list follows:\n\nWitnesses say that civilians were killed despite what SADF reports said at the time. Muff Andersson, a former member of MK, said that instead of attacking legitimate targets, the SADF instead arbitrarily picked ANC sympathisers to \"teach the ANC a lesson\". She asserts that the SADF \"did not care who was killed.\"\n\n\nOn 17 June 1985, the United Nations representative of Botswana sent a letter to the President of the United Nations Security Council asking for help to deal with the raid. The representative from South Africa sent a letter on the same day stating that Botswana had been warned about harbouring groups like the ANC, citing that \"a State had a right to take appropriate steps to protect its own security and territorial integrity against such attacks.\" The Botswana Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the evidence of terrorist activities starting in Botswana was fabricated. South Africa responded that since Botswana did not sign the Nkomati Accord, a non-aggression pact with South Africa, the ANC was able to use Botswana as a base for its attacks. Resolution 568 was drafted on 21 June 1985 that ordered South Africa to pay Botswana for damages, allowed Botswana to house refugees, and encouraged other countries to help Botswana and condemn South Africa.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5378000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5378000", "title": "Replicas of the Statue of Liberty", "text": "Replicas of the Statue of Liberty\n\nHundreds of replicas of the Statue of Liberty (\"Liberty Enlightening the World\") have been created worldwide.\n\nOn the occasion of the Exposition Universelle of 1900, Frédéric Bartholdi crafted a smaller version of \"Liberty Enlightening the World\", which he subsequently gave to the Musée du Luxembourg. In 1905, the statue was placed outside the museum in the Jardin du Luxembourg, where it stood for over a century, until 2014. It currently stands within the entrance hall to the Musée d'Orsay, and a newly constructed bronze replica stands in its place in the Jardin du Luxembourg.\n\nThis statue was given in 1889 to France by U.S. citizens living in Paris to celebrate the French Revolution three years after the main statue in New York was inaugurated. In 1937, the statue was turned from looking east to looking west straight to the direction of the New York's statue.\n\nThe statue is near the Grenelle Bridge on the Île aux Cygnes, a man-made island in the Seine (). It is high and weighs 14 tons. Inaugurated on July 4, 1889, it looks southwest, downriver along the Seine. Its tablet bears two dates: \"IV JUILLET 1776\" (July 4, 1776: the United States Declaration of Independence) like the New York statue, and \"XIV JUILLET 1789\" (July 14, 1789: the storming of the Bastille) associated with an equal sign. This statue is shown in the film \"\" as a historic location.\n\nThe tall original plaster maquette finished in 1878 by Auguste Bartholdi that was used to make the statue in New York is in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. This original plaster was bequeathed by the artist's widow in 1907, together with part of the artist's estate.\n\nOn the square outside the Musée des Arts et Métierss entrance is a bronze copy made from the plaster maquette, number 1 from an original edition of 12, made by the museum and cast by Susse Fondeur Paris.\n\nA life-size copy of the torch, \"Flame of Liberty\", can be seen above the entrance to the Pont de l'Alma tunnel near the Champs-Élysées in Paris. It was given to the city as a return gift in honor of the centennial celebration of the statue's dedication. Since it is above the Pont de l'Alma car tunnel in which Princess Diana died, the torch became an unofficial memorial to the princess.\n\nThere is a replica in the northwest of France, in the small town of Barentin near Rouen. It was made for a French movie, \"Le Cerveau\" (\"The Brain\"), directed by Gérard Oury and featuring actors Jean-Paul Belmondo and Bourvil.\n\nAnother replica is a statue in the city of Bordeaux. The first Bordeaux statue was seized and melted down by the Nazis in World War II. The statue was replaced in 2000 and a plaque was added to commemorate the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks. On the night of March 25, 2003, unknown vandals poured red paint and gasoline on the replica and set it on fire. The vandals also cracked the pedestal of the plaque. The mayor of Bordeaux, former prime minister Alain Juppé, condemned the attack.\n\nA replica of the Statue of Liberty in Colmar, the city of Bartholdi's birth, was dedicated on July 4, 2004, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his death. It stands at the north entrance of the city. The Bartholdi Museum in Colmar contains numerous models of various sizes made by Bartholdi during the process of designing the statue.\n\nFrédéric Bartholdi donated a copy of the Statue of Liberty to the town square of Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer.\n\nOther \"Liberty Enlightening the World\" statues are displayed in Poitiers and Lunel. The Musée des beaux-arts de Lyon owns a terracotta version.\n\nNear Chaumont, Haute Marne, is a miniature replica in the flag plaza of the former Chaumont Air Base. This was the home of the US 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, now based at Lakenheath, England, with its own statue at the flag plaza. The 48th TFW is the only USAF wing with a name: \"The Statue of Liberty Wing\".\n\nAnother example is of a \"Liberty Enlightening the World\" replica in Châteauneuf-la-Forêt, near the city of Limoges in the area of Haute-Vienne, Limousin. There is another \"original\" Bartholdi replica at Roybon (near Grenoble)\n\nThere is a small replica on Boulevard des Anglais in Nice.\n\nIn Minimundus, a miniature park located at the Wörthersee in Carinthia, Austria, is another replica of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nIn Graz, standing between the Opera House and the NextLiberty Theater, stands a steel structure built out of steel beams, that depict the original size of the statue of liberty, before the plates of the final form were being put into place. Instead of torch of flame, this depiction is holding a sword in extended left arm and a sphere in the right arm representing the world.\n\nA small replica in lego is situated in Legoland in Billund.\n\nA copy is in the German \"Heidepark Soltau\" theme park, located on a lake with cruising Mississippi steamboats. It weighs 28 metric tons (31 short tons), is made of plastic foam on a steel frame with polyester cladding, and was designed by the Dutch artist Gerla Spee.\n\nA green painted replica of the Statue of Liberty can be found near Mulnamina More, County Donegal, Ireland.\n\nA replica stands atop the Hotel Victory in Pristina, Kosovo.\n\nA 33 ft (10 m) replica has its temporary location in the Dutch city of Assen. The statue bears characteristic features that represent the culture and landscape of the region, like a can of beans instead of the original torch. The replica, by sculptor Natasja Bennink, is on display for the duration of an exhibition on American Realism in the Drents Museum until 27 May 2018.\n\nA smaller replica is in the Norwegian village of Visnes, where the copper used in the original statue was mined. A replica is also on the facade of a pub in Bleik, county of Nordland\n\n\nThere is a unique \"sitting\" Statue of Liberty in the Ukrainian city of Lviv. It is a sculpture on a dome of the house (15, Freedom Avenue) built by architect Yuriy Zakharevych and decorated by sculptor Leandro Marconi in 1874–91.\n\nA , 9,200 kg (9.2 tons) replica stood atop the Liberty Shoe factory in Leicester, England, until 2002 when the building was demolished. The statue was put into storage while the building was replaced. The statue, which dates back to the 1920s, was initially going to be put back on the replacement building, but was too heavy, so in December 2008 following restoration, it was placed on a pedestal near Liberty Park Halls of Residence on a traffic island, \"Liberty Circus\", close to where it originally stood.\n\nA replica is in the stairwell of a bowling alley building in Warrington, England. It used to be above the entrance of a restaurant nearby.\n\nThere is also a small replica located at RAF Lakenheath, England, at the base flag plaza, made from leftover copper from the original.\n\nIn Coquitlam, British Columbia a small replica stands on Delestre Avenue just east of North Road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Buenos Aires there is a small iron replica in Barrancas de Belgrano Square, cast by Bartholdi from the same mould as those cast in Paris; although it is much smaller. It was inaugurated on October 3, 1886, 25 days before the one in New York. Another replica was bought by the government and placed in a school, Colegio Nacional Sarmiento, about the same date.. There is another replica in Plaza Libertad (Liberty Square) in the city of Villa Aberastain, San Juan. This one arrived at the city in 1909 due to a confusion since it had to be shipped to San Juan, Puerto Rico instead. There are also two cheaper non-metallic replicas; one is 6 m tall, located in the \"New York\" Casino in San Luis and the other crowns a commercial gallery, \"Galería de Fabricantes\", in Munro, a city in the northeast suburbs of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn Bangu, Rio de Janeiro exists a nickel replica made by Bartholdi in 1899. Bartholdi was commissioned by José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco to make a replica in order to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Republic of Brazil. Until 1940, the statue was Paranhos family property. In 1940 the statue was passed to Guanabara State. In January 20, 1964 Carlos Lacerda, governor of Guanabara State, placed the statue in Miami Square, Bangu.\nA small-scale cast metal replica can be found in Maceió, the capital of Alagoas State, in northeast Brazil. The replica is in front of a building constructed in 1869 as the seat of the \"Conselho Provincial\" (Provincial Council), and which today is the Museu da Imagem e do Som de Alagoas (Museum of Image and Sound of Alagoas). This replica is possibly a casting produced by the in France, as in the Praça Lavenere Machado (formerly Praça Dois Leões) on the opposite side of the museum, there are four somewhat larger-than-life size cast metal statues of wild animals, at least one of which is embossed with the name of the foundry. These castings and the replica all appear to be made of similar material and to be of similar age. It is also probable that they are near contemporaries of the actual Statue of Liberty.\nA large modern replica stands in front of the New York City Center, a shopping center constructed in 1999 in Barra da Tijuca in the State of Rio de Janeiro.\nThe Havan department store chain has replicas in many of their stores. The largest one of these, 57 meters tall, is allegedly in the Barra Velha branc, in the state of Santa Catarina. There is another large replica the parking area of a Havan Department Store on the outskirts of Curitiba, in the State of Paraná, opened in 2000.\nAlso, there is a small replica of the statue in Belém, in front of a Belém Importados store, near the city's port.\n\nIn Guayaquil, a little replica gives the name of \"New York\" to a neighborhood in the Valle Alto area.\n\nIn Lima the New York Casino in the Jesús María District has a small replica in the main entrance. The casino is a tribute to the state of New York and the USA.\n\nA small replica can be found in Vardhaman Fantasy, an amusement park in Mira Road, Mumbai along with other six wonders of the world.\nThe 7 wonders of the world are made in Eco Park, Kolkata, West Bengal\n\nA large replica can be found in Genting Highlands in the state of Pahang.\n\nA small replica can be found in Haw Par Villa, a theme park.\n\nSet on top of the memorial tomb of \"72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang\" (see Huanghuagang Uprising). The current one was re-built in 1981.\n\nDuring the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989, Chinese student demonstrators in Beijing built a 10 m (33 ft) image called the \"Goddess of Democracy\", which sculptor Tsao Tsing-yuan said was intentionally \"dissimilar\" to the Statue of Liberty to avoid being \"too openly pro-American.\" (See article for a list of replicas of that statue.)\n\nA replica can be found in Window of the World Park.\n\nA 15 foot high replica of the Statue of Liberty is at the western entrance of the village of Arraba in Israel, near a local restaurant.\n\nAt a highway intersection in Jerusalem called \"New York Square,\" there is an abstract skeletal replica of the statue.\n\nThe French Statue of Liberty from the Île aux Cygnes came to Odaiba, Tokyo, from April 1998 to May 1999 in commemoration of \"The French year in Japan\". Because of its popularity, in 2000 a replica of the French Statue of Liberty was erected at the same place. Also in Japan, a small Statue of Liberty is in the Amerika-mura (\"American Village\") shopping district in Osaka, Japan. Another replica is in Oirase near the town of Shimoda south of Misawa in Aomori Prefecture, where the United States has an 8,000-person U.S. Air Force base. A replica of the Statue of Liberty in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, was damaged by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. There is also a replica in Oyabe, Toyama. \n\nThere are replicas of the Statue of Liberty in Bahria Town, Lahore, and also in Bahria Town Phase 8, Islamabad.\n\nAs early as January 1945, there were already news of a campaign that would help erect a Statue of Liberty replica in the Philippines. The said monument was supposed to be sponsored by The Chicago Daily Times whose goal was “to commemorate one of the great epics in the struggle for human freedom–the liberation of the Philippines.”\n\nFast forward to 1950, the Boy Scouts of America was celebrating its 40th anniversary. Jack P. Whitaker, then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council, had earlier suggested the creation and distribution of several Statue of Liberty replicas to all American states and territories, including the Philippines.\n\nThe eight-foot statues, which were cast in bronze, were distributed all over the U.S. and the world from 1949 to 1951. Almost 200 replicas were delivered to the 39 states of the U.S. and countries such as Panama and Puerto Rico. The Boy Scouts of the Philippines, on the other hand, received its own replica in the early part of 1950.\n\nThe statues were donated by the Boy Scouts of America as “an expression of scout brotherhood and goodwill.” Not surprisingly, their 40th anniversary theme was “Strengthen the Arm of Liberty.”\n\nMiniature versions of the statue were also given as gifts. In fact, the Philippines became the first independent nation to receive one of the 4,000 eight-inch statues from the Boy Scouts of America. In April 1950, the said statue was officially given by Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck to Carlos P. Romulo, then chief of the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.\n\nIn the Philippines, several places were suggested as the site where the eight-foot bronze replica would be erected. The task of choosing the perfect site was delegated to the National Urban Planning Commission, and among those it considered were “Engineer Island, atop the proposed reviewing stand on the Rizal Park, and on the center island rotunda between the Old Legislative building and Manila City Hall.”\n\nIn the end, the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (BSP) erected the statue just outside Intramuros. As the icon of the United States, the replica of Lady Liberty would survive several attacks by student protesters in the 1960s. It remained standing until the early 1970s, when the BSP decided to transfer it to the Scout Reservation in Mt. Makiling which would serve as the statue’s home for two decades or so.\n\nIn a 2002 article published by the Philippine Star, then BSP PR head Nixon Canlapan revealed that the Statue of Liberty was eventually moved and stored at the BSP headquarters on Concepcion Street (now Natividad Almeda-Lopez) in Ermita, Manila.\n\nTurns out, the American-sponsored replica was not the first Lady Liberty in Manila. In the 1930s, one of Manila’s biggest shopping stores at that time became the talk of the town not just for its products but also for its unique multi-story building. Located in Juan Luna Street, the L.R. Aguinaldo’s Emporium had an Art Deco facade featuring two contrasting statues: Andres Bonifacio on the right and the Statue of Liberty on the left.\n\nEstablished by Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the store would later become known as the Aguinaldo’s Department Store. After the war, Leopoldo’s son Francisco took over the business and the store was moved to Echague.\n\nThe Echague branch in the 1950s was known for introducing its customers to quality products both from the Philippines and abroad. It also commissioned young interior designers to update the store’s furniture section. Thus, the store catapulted the careers of famous designers like Myra Cruz, Edgar Ramirez, and Bonnie Ramos, among others. Aguinaldo’s succumbed to the competition and closed in the 1960s. The original building in Juan Luna Street still stands, along with both the Bonifacio and the Liberty statues.\n\nSince the creation of the Liberty statues in Intramuros and Juan Luna Street, other Philippine provinces soon followed suit. Statue of Liberty replicas in can be found in Pangasinan and as far as Camp John Hay amphitheater in Baguio City.\n\n\nThere are at least two Statue of Liberty replicas (greater than 30 feet in height) in Taiwan. These two statues are in the cities of Keelung and Taipei.\n\nFrom 1887 to 1945, Hanoi was home to another copy of the statue. Measuring tall, it was erected by the French colonial government after being sent from France for an exhibition. It was known to locals unaware of its history as \"\" (\"Statue of the madame saux\"). When the French lost control of French Indochina during World War II, the statue was toppled on August 1, 1945, after being deemed a vestige of the colonial government along with other statues erected by the French.\n\nA 30-foot replica can also be seen at the Westfield Marion shopping complex in Adelaide, South Australia.\n\n"}

{"id": "46325189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46325189", "title": "Socialist-leaning countries", "text": "Socialist-leaning countries\n\nIn the political terminology of the former Soviet Union, the socialist-leaning countries () were the post-colonial Third World countries which the Soviet Union recognized as adhering to the ideas of socialism in the Marxist–Leninist understanding. As a result, these countries received significant economic and military support. In Soviet press, these states were also called \"countries on the path of the construction of socialism\" () and countries on the path of the socialist development\" (). All these terms meant to draw a distinction from the true socialist states (in Marxist–Leninist understanding).\n\nThe use of the term was partly a result of a reassessment of national liberation movements in the Third World following World War II, widespread decolonization and the emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement as well as Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the \"de-Stalinization\" of Soviet Marxism. The discussion of anti-colonial struggle at the Second Congress of the Comintern in 1920 had been formulated in terms of a debate between those for an alliance with the anti-imperialist national bourgeoisie (initially advocated by Vladimir Lenin) and those for a pure class line of socialist, anti-feudal as well as anti-imperialist struggle (such as M. N. Roy). The revolutions of the post-war decolonization era (excepting those led by explicitly proletarian forces, such as the Vietnamese Revolution), e.g. the rise of Nasserism, were initially seen by many communists as a new form of bourgeois nationalism and there were often sharp conflicts between nationalists and communists. However, the adoption of “leftist” economic programs (such as nationalization and/or land reform) by many of these movements and governments as well as the international alliances between the revolutionary nationalists and the Soviet Union obliged communists to reassess their nature. These movements were now seen as neither classical bourgeois nationalists nor socialist per se, but rather offering the possibility of \"non-capitalist development\" as a path of \"transition to socialism\".\n\nAt various times, these states included Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Egypt, India, Libya, Ethiopia, South Yemen and many others. As a major embarrassment to the Soviets, emperor and alleged cannibal Jean-Bédel Bokassa of what had been (and later again became) the Central African Republic had at one time had declared his adherence to \"scientific socialism\" in order to secure the free Soviet economic assistance.\n\nIn Soviet political science, \"socialist orientation\" was defined to be an initial period of the development in countries which rejected capitalism, but did not yet have the prerequisites for the socialist revolution or development. Along these lines, a more cautious synonym was used, namely \"countries on the path of non-capitalist development\". A 1986 Soviet reference book on Africa claimed that about one third of African states followed this path.\n\nIn some countries designated \"socialist-leaning\" by the Soviet Union such as India, this formulation was sharply criticized by emerging Maoist or Chinese-leaning groups, such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist), who considered the doctrine class collaborationist as part of the larger Sino-Soviet split and the Maoist struggle against so-called Soviet revisionism.\n\nSome of these countries had communist governments while others (italicized) did not.\n\n"}
{"id": "10786853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10786853", "title": "Speedy Trial Act", "text": "Speedy Trial Act\n\nThe Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 2080, as amended August 2, 1979, 93 Stat. 328, ), establishes time limits for completing the various stages of a federal criminal prosecution.\n\nThe Act establishes time limits for completing the various stages of a federal criminal prosecution. The information or indictment must be filed within 30 days from the date of arrest or service of the summons. Trial must commence within 70 days from the date the information or indictment was filed, or from the date the defendant appears before an officer of the court in which the charge is pending, whichever is later.\n\nMoreover, in order to ensure that defendants are not rushed to trial without an adequate opportunity to prepare, Congress amended the Act in 1979 to provide a minimum time period during which trial may not commence. Thus, the Act provides that trial may not begin less than 30 days from the date the defendant first appears in court, unless the defendant agrees in writing to an earlier date. In \"United States v. Rojas-Contreras\", 474 U.S. 231 (1985), the Supreme Court held that this 30-day trial preparation period is not restarted upon the filing of a substantially similar superseding indictment.\n\nIf the indictment is dismissed at the defendant's request, the Act's provisions apply anew upon reinstatement of the charge. If the indictment is dismissed at the request of the government, the 70-day clock is tolled during the period when no indictment is outstanding, and begins to run again upon the filing of the second indictment. If trial ends in a mistrial, or the court grants a motion for a new trial, the second trial must begin within 70 days \"from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final.\"\n\nCertain pretrial delays are automatically excluded from the Act's time limits, such as delays caused by pretrial motions. In \"Henderson v. United States\", 476 U.S. 321, 330 (1986), the Supreme Court held that excludes \"all time between the filing of a motion and the conclusion of the hearing on that motion, whether or not a delay in holding that hearing is 'reasonably necessary.'\" The Act also excludes a reasonable period (up to 30 days) during which a motion is actually \"under advisement\" by the court. Other delays excluded from the Act's time limits include delays caused by the unavailability of the defendant or an essential witness (); delays attributable to a co-defendant (); and delays attributable to the defendant's involvement in other proceedings, including delay resulting from an interlocutory appeal. (Note, however, that the 30-day defense preparation period provided for in is calculated without reference to Section exclusions).\n\nA defendant may not expressly waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act. However, if the trial judge determines that the \"ends of justice\" served by a continuance outweigh the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, the delay occasioned by such continuance is excluded from the Act's time limits. The judge must set forth, orally or in writing, his or her reasons for granting the continuance.\n\nThe Act provides a sanction of dismissal for violation of its time limits that may be with or without prejudice to reprosecution. In assessing whether dismissal should be with prejudice, the court must consider the seriousness of the offense, the circumstances leading to dismissal, and the impact that reprosecution would have on the administration of the Act and on the administration of justice. In \"United States v. Taylor\", 487 U.S. 326 (1988), the Supreme Court held that a trial court must examine each statutory factor in deciding to dismiss charges with prejudice. The Court in Taylor found that a minor violation of the time limitations of the act that did not prejudice the defendant's trial preparation did not justify the dismissal with prejudice of an indictment charging serious drug offenses.\n\nWhile a defendant cannot unilaterally waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act, he can forfeit his right to obtain a dismissal of the case for a claimed violation of the Act by failing to move for dismissal prior to trial. The statute provides that \"[f]ailure of the defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial...shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under this section.\"\n\nThe Speedy Trial Act is inapplicable to juvenile delinquency proceedings, which have their own speedy trial provision. Furthermore, the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) provides its own time limits for persons incarcerated in other jurisdictions. In such a case, the government must comply with both the time limits of the IAD and the Speedy Trial Act.\n\nA defendant's right to a speedy trial has constitutional and statutory underpinnings in addition to the Speedy Trial Act. Federal statutes of limitations provide a time frame within which charges must be filed. Moreover, Rule of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, grants trial courts discretion to dismiss cases that are not brought to trial promptly.\n\nEven if a charge is brought within the period provided by the statute of limitations, a defendant may be able to show that preaccusation delay has violated his or her Fifth Amendment due process rights. To obtain a dismissal of the charges by reason of pre-indictment delay, a defendant has the burden of establishing that the government engaged in intentional delay to gain a tactical advantage, and that he suffered actual prejudice.\n\nA defendant's rights under the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment are triggered by \"either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge.\" (As noted above, any delay before this time must be scrutinized under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, not the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause. In \"Barker v. Wingo\", 407 U.S. 514 (1972), the Supreme Court set out a four-factor test for determining whether delay between the initiation of criminal proceedings and the beginning of trial violates a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The test requires the court to consider the length of the delay, the cause of the delay, the defendant's assertion of his or her right to a speedy trial, and the presence or absence of prejudice resulting from the delay.\n\nIn \"United States v. Loud Hawk\", 474 U.S. 302 (1986), where the reason for the 90-month delay (interlocutory appeals) did not weigh against the government, the Supreme Court held that the possibility of prejudice occasioned by the delay was not sufficient to establish a Sixth Amendment speedy trial violation. Moreover, the courts of appeals routinely reject Sixth Amendment speedy trial challenges in the absence of a showing of prejudice. However, in \"Doggett v. United States\", 505 U.S. 647 (1992), the Supreme Court held that an \"extraordinary\" eight-and-one-half-year delay between the defendant's indictment and arrest, which resulted from the government's \"egregious persistence in failing to prosecute [him],\" violated his right to a speedy trial even in the absence of \"affirmative proof of particularized prejudice.\"\n\nWhere there are successive state and federal prosecutions, the general rule is that the federal constitutional speedy trial right does not arise until a federal accusation against the defendant is made. Thus, a prior state arrest based on the same facts as the subsequent federal charge does not implicate the federal constitutional guarantee.\n\n"}
{"id": "2055706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055706", "title": "Statism in Shōwa Japan", "text": "Statism in Shōwa Japan\n\nThis statist movement dominated Japanese politics during the first part of the Shōwa period (reign of Hirohito). It was a mixture of ideas such as Japanese ultranationalism, militarism and state capitalism, that were proposed by a number of contemporary political philosophers and thinkers in Japan.\n\nWith a more aggressive foreign policy, and victory over China in the First Sino-Japanese War and over Imperial Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan joined the imperialist powers. The need for a strong military to secure Japan's new overseas empire was strengthened by a sense that only through a strong military would Japan earn the respect of Western nations, and thus revision of the \"unequal treaties\" imposed in the 1800s.\n\nThe Japanese military viewed itself as \"politically clean\" in terms of corruption, and criticized political parties under a liberal democracy as self-serving and a threat to national security by their failure to provide adequate military spending or to address pressing social and economic issues. The complicity of the politicians with the \"zaibatsu\" corporate monopolies also came under criticism. The military tended to favor dirigisme and other forms of direct state control over industry, rather than free market capitalism, as well as greater state-sponsored social welfare to reduce the attraction of socialism and communism in Japan.\n\nThe special relation of militarists and the central civil government with the Imperial Family supported the important position of the Emperor as Head of State with political powers, and the relationship with the nationalist right-wing movements. However, Japanese political thought had relatively little contact with European political thinking until the 20th century.\n\nUnder this ascendancy of the military, the country developed a very hierarchical, aristocratic economic system with significant state involvement. During the Meiji Restoration, there had been a surge in the creation of monopolies. This was in part due to state intervention, as the monopolies served to allow Japan to become a world economic power. The state itself owned some of the monopolies, and others were owned by the zaibatsu. The monopolies managed the central core of the economy, with other aspects being controlled by the government ministry appropriate to the activity, including the National Central Bank and the Imperial family. This economic arrangement was in many ways similar to the later corporatist models of European fascists.\n\nDuring the same period, certain thinkers with ideals similar to those from shogunate times developed the early basis of Japanese expansionism and Pan-Asianist theories. Such thought later was developed by writers such as Saneshige Komaki into the \"Hakkō ichiu\", Yen Block, and Amau doctrines.\n\nThe 1919 Treaty of Versailles did not recognize the Empire of Japan's territorial claims, and international naval treaties between Western powers and the Empire of Japan, (Washington Naval Treaty and London Naval Treaty), imposed limitations on naval shipbuilding which limited the size of the Imperial Japanese Navy at a 10:10:6 ratio. These measures were considered by many in Japan as refusal of by the Occidental powers to consider Japan an equal partner. The latter brought about the May 15 Incident.\n\nOn the basis national security, these events released a surge of Japanese nationalism and resulted in the end of collaboration diplomacy which supported peaceful economic expansion. The implementation of a military dictatorship and territorial expansionism were considered the best ways to protect the Yamato-damashii.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Ministry of Home Affairs began arresting left-wing political dissidents, generally in order to exact a confession and renouncement of anti-state leanings. Over 30,000 such arrests were made between 1930 and 1933. In response, a large group of writers founded a Japanese branch of the International Popular Front Against Fascism, and published articles in major literary journals warning of the dangers of statism. Their periodical, \"The People's Library\" (人民文庫), achieved a circulation of over five thousand and was widely read in literary circles, but was eventually censored, and later dismantled in January 1938.\n\nIkki Kita was an early 20th-century political theorist, who advocated a hybrid of state socialism with \"Asian nationalism\", which thus blended the early ultranationalist movement with Japanese militarism. His political philosophy was outlined in his thesis ( ') of 1908 and ( ') of 1928. Kita proposed a military coup d'état to replace the existing political structure of Japan with a military dictatorship. The new military leadership would rescind the Meiji Constitution, ban political parties, replace the Diet of Japan with an assembly free of corruption, and would nationalize major industries. Kita also envisioned strict limits to private ownership of property, and land reform to improve the lot of tenant farmers. Thus strengthened internally, Japan could then embark on a crusade to free all of Asia from Western imperialism.\n\nAlthough his works were banned by the government almost immediately after publication, circulation was widespread, and his thesis proved popular not only with the younger officer class excited at the prospects of military rule and Japanese expansionism, but with the populist movement for its appeal to the agrarian classes and to the left wing of the socialist movement.\n\nShūmei Ōkawa was a right-wing political philosopher, active in numerous Japanese nationalist societies in the 1920s. In 1926, he published , among other works, which helped popularize the concept of the inevitability of a clash of civilizations between Japan and the west. Politically, his theories built on the works of Ikki Kita, but further emphasized that Japan needed to return to its traditional \"kokutai\" traditions in order to survive the increasing social tensions created by industrialization and foreign cultural influences.\n\nSadao Araki was a noted political philosopher in the Imperial Japanese Army during the 1920s, who had a wide following within the junior officer corps. Although implicated in the February 26 Incident, he went on to serve in numerous influential government posts, and was a cabinet minister under Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe.\n\nThe Japanese Army, already trained along Prussian lines since the early Meiji period, often mentioned the affinity between \"yamato-damashii\" and the \"Prussian Military Spirit\" in pushing for a military alliance with Italy and Germany along with the need to combat Soviet communism. Araki's writing are imbued with nostalgia towards the military administrative system of former shogunate, in a similar manner to which the Fascist Party of Italy looked back to the ancient ideals of the Roman Empire or the NSDAP in Germany recalled an idealized version of First Reich and the Teutonic Order.\n\nAraki modified the interpretation of the \"bushido\" warrior code to \"seishin kyōiku\" (\"spiritual training\"), which he introduced to the military as Army Minister, and to the general public as Education Minister, and in general brought the concepts of the Showa Restoration movement into mainstream Japanese politics.\n\nSome of the distinctive features of this policy were also used outside Japan. The puppet states of Manchukuo, Mengjiang, and the Wang Jingwei Government were later organized party in accordance with Araki's ideas. In the case of Wang Jingwei's state, he himself had some German influences—prior to the Japanese invasion of China, he met with German leaders and picked up some fascist ideas during his time in the Kuomingtang. These, he combined with Japanese militarist thinking. Japanese agents also supported local and nationalist elements in Southeast asia and White Russian residents in Manchukuo before war broke out.\n\nSeigō Nakano sought to bring about a rebirth of Japan through a blend of the samurai ethic, Neo-Confucianism, and populist nationalism modeled on European fascism. He saw Saigō Takamori as epitomizing the 'true spirit' of the Meiji \"ishin\", and the task of modern Japan to recapture it.\n\nIkki Kita and Shūmei Ōkawa joined forces in 1919 to organize the short-lived Yūzonsha (猶存社), a political study group intended to become an umbrella organization for the various right-socialist movements. Although the group soon collapsed due to irreconcilable ideological differences between Kita and Ōkawa, it served its purpose in that it managed to join the right-wing anti-socialist, Pan-Asian militarist societies with centrist and left-wing supporters of state socialism.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, these supporters of Japanese statism used the slogan , which implied that a new resolution was needed to replace the existing political order dominated by corrupt politicians and capitalists, with one which (in their eyes), would fulfill the original goals of the Meiji Restoration of direct Imperial rule via military proxies.\n\nHowever, the Shōwa Restoration had different meanings for different groups. For the radicals of the \"Sakurakai\", it meant violent overthrow of the government to create a national syndicalist state with more equitable distribution of wealth and the removal of corrupt politicians and \"zaibatsu\" leaders. For the young officers it meant a return to some form of \"military-shogunate in which the emperor would re-assume direct political power with dictatorial attributes, as well as divine symbolism, without the intervention of the Diet or liberal democracy, but who would effectively be a figurehead with day-to-day decisions left to the military leadership.\n\nAnother point of view was supported by Prince Chichibu, a brother of Emperor Shōwa, who repeatedly counseled him to implement a \"direct imperial rule\", even if that meant suspending the constitution.\n\nIn principle, some theorists proposed Shōwa Restoration, the plan of giving direct dictatorial powers to the Emperor (due to his divine attributes) for leading the future overseas actions in mainland Asia. This was the purpose behind the February 26 Incident and other similar uprisings in Japan. Later, however, these previously mentioned thinkers decided to organize their own political clique based on previous radical, militaristic movements in the 1930s; this was the origin of the Kodoha party and their political desire to take direct control of all the political power in the country from the moderate and democratic political voices.\n\nFollowing the formation of this \"political clique\", there was a new current of thought among militarists, industrialists and landowners that emphasized a desire to return to the ancient shogunate system, but in the form of a modern military dictatorship with new structures. It was organized with the Japanese Navy and Japanese Army acting as clans under command of a supreme military native dictator (the \"shōgun\") controlling the country. In this government, the Emperor was covertly reduced in his functions and used as a figurehead for political or religious use under the control of the militarists.\n\nThe failure of various attempted coups, including the League of Blood Incident, the Imperial Colors Incident and the February 26 Incident, discredited supporters of the Shōwa Restoration movement, but the concepts of Japanese statism migrated to mainstream Japanese politics, where it joined with some elements of European fascism.\n\nEarly Shōwa statism is sometimes given the retrospective label \"fascism\", but this was not a self-appellation and it is clear that the comparison is inaccurate. When authoritarian tools of the state such as the Kempeitai were put into use in the early Shōwa period, they were employed to protect the rule of law under the Meiji Constitution from perceived enemies on both the left and the right.\n\nSome ideologists, such as Kingoro Hashimoto, proposed a single party dictatorship, based on egalitarian populism, patterned after the European fascist movements. \"An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus\" shows the influence clearly.\n\nThese geopolitical ideals developed into the Amau Doctrine (天羽声明, an Asian Monroe Doctrine), stating that Japan assumed total responsibility for peace in Asia, and can be seen later when Prime Minister Kōki Hirota proclaimed justified Japanese expansion into northern China as the creation of \"a special zone, anti-communist, pro-Japanese and pro-Manchukuo\" that was a \"fundamental part\" of Japanese national existence.\n\nAlthough the reformist right wing, kakushin uyoku, was interested in the concept, the idealist right wing, or kannen uyoku, rejected fascism as they rejected all things of western origin. \n\nBecause of the mistrust of unions in such unity, the Japanese went to replace them with \"councils\" in every factory, containing both management and worker representatives to contain conflict. Like the Nazi councils they were copying, this was part of a program to create a classless national unity.\n\nThe \"Kokuhonsha\" was founded in 1924 by conservative Minister of Justice and President of the House of Peers Hiranuma Kiichirō. It called on Japanese patriots to reject the various foreign political \"-isms\" (such as socialism, communism, Marxism, anarchism, etc.) in favor of a rather vaguely defined \"Japanese national spirit\" (\"kokutai\"). The name \"\"kokuhon\" was selected as an antithesis to the word \"minpon\"\", from \"minpon shugi\", the commonly-used translation for the word \"democracy\", and the society was openly supportive of totalitarian ideology.\n\nOne particular concept exploited was a decree ascribed to the mythical first emperor of Japan, Emperor Jimmu, in 660 BC: the policy of hakkō ichiu (八紘一宇, all eight corners of the world under one roof).\n\nThis also related to the concept of kokutai or national polity, meaning the uniqueness of the Japanese people in having a leader with spiritual origins. The pamphlet \"Kokutai no Hongi\" taught that students should put the nation before the self, and that they were part of the state and not separate from it. \"Shinmin no Michi\" injoined all Japanese to follow the central precepts of loyalty and filial piety, which would throw aside selfishness and allow them to complete their \"holy task.\"\n\nThe bases of the modern form of kokutai and hakkō ichiu were to develop after 1868 and would take the following form:\n\n\nThe concept of the divine Emperors was another belief that was to fit the later goals. It was an integral part of the Japanese religious structure that the Tennō was divine, descended directly from the line of Ama-Terasu (or Amaterasu, the Sun Kami or Goddess).\n\nThe final idea that was modified in modern times was the concept of Bushido. Bushido was the warrior code and laws of feudal Japan, that while having cultural surface differences, was at its heart not that different from the code of chivalry or any other similar system in other cultures. In later years, the code of Bushido found a resurgence in belief following the Meiji Restoration. At first, this allowed Japan to field what was considered one of the most professional and humane militaries in the world, one respected by friend and foe alike. Eventually, however, this belief would become a combination of propaganda and fanaticism that would lead to the Second Sino-Japanese War of the 1930s and World War II.\n\nIt was the third concept, especially, that would chart Japan's course towards several wars that would culminate with World War II.\n\nDuring 1940, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe proclaimed the \"Shintaisei\" (New National Structure), making Japan into a \"National Defense State\". Under the National Mobilization Law, the government was given absolute power over the nation's assets. All political parties were ordered to dissolve into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, forming a one-party state based on totalitarian values. Such measures as the National Service Draft Ordinance and the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement were intended to mobilize Japanese society for a total war against the West.\n\nAssociated with government efforts to create a statist society included creation of the \"Tonarigumi\" (residents' committees), and emphasis on the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" (\"Japan's Fundamentals of National Policy\"), presenting a view of Japan's history, and its mission to unite the East and West under the \"Hakkō ichiu\" theory in schools as official texts. The official academic text was another book, \"Shinmin no Michi\" (The Subject's Way), the \"moral national Bible\", presented an effective catechism on nation, religion, cultural, social, and ideological topics.\n\nJapan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1933, bringing it closer to the Third Reich, which also left that year, and Fascist Italy, which was dissatisfied with the League. During the 1930s Japan drifted further away from Western Europe and America. American and French films were increasingly censored, and in 1937 Japan froze all American assets throughout its empire.\n\nIn 1940, the three countries formed the Axis powers, and became closer linked. Japan imported Nazi propaganda films such as \"Ohm Krüger\" (1941), advertising them as narratives showing the suffering caused by Western imperialism.\n\nJapanese statism was discredited and destroyed by the utter failure of Japan's military in World War II. After the surrender of Japan, Japan was put under allied occupation. Some of its former military leaders were tried for war crimes before the Tokyo tribunal, the government educational system was revised, and the tenets of liberal democracy written into the post-war Constitution of Japan as one of its key themes.\n\nThe collapse of statist ideologies in 1945–46 was paralleled by a formalisation of relations between the Shinto religion and the Japanese state, including disestablishment: termination of Shinto's status as a state religion. In August 1945, the term State Shinto (\"Kokka Shintō\") was invented to refer to some aspects of statism. On 1 January 1946, Emperor \"Shōwa\" issued an imperial rescript, sometimes referred as the \"Ningen-sengen\" (\"Humanity Declaration\") in which he quoted the Five Charter Oath (\"Gokajō no Goseimon\") of his grandfather, Emperor Meiji and renounced officially \"the false conception that the Emperor is a divinity\". However, the wording of the Declaration – in the court language of the Imperial family, an archaic Japanese dialect known as \"Kyūteigo\" – and content of this statement have been the subject of much debate. For instance, the renunciation did not include the word usually used to impute the Emperor's divinity: \"arahitogami\" (\"living god\"). It instead used the unusual word \"akitsumikami\", which was officially translated as \"divinity\", but more literally meant \"manifestation/incarnation of a \"kami\" (\"god/spirit\")\". Hence, commentators such as John W. Dower and Herbert P. Bix have argued, Hirohito did not specifically deny being a \"living god\" (\"arahitogami\").\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48343", "title": "Tripartite Pact", "text": "Tripartite Pact\n\nThe Tripartite Pact, also known as the Berlin Pact, was an agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan signed in Berlin on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Galeazzo Ciano and Saburō Kurusu. It was a defensive military alliance that was eventually joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Bulgaria (1 March 1941) and Yugoslavia (25 March 1941), as well as by the German client state of Slovakia (24 November 1940). Yugoslavia's accession provoked a \"coup d'état\" in Belgrade two days later, and Italy and Germany responded by invading Yugoslavia (with Bulgarian, Hungarian and Romanian assistance) and partitioning the country. The resulting Italo-German client state known as the Independent State of Croatia joined the pact on 15 June 1941.\n\nThe Tripartite Pact was directed primarily at the United States. Its practical effects were limited, since the Italo-German and Japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests. Some technical cooperation was carried out, and the Japanese declaration of war on the United States propelled, although it did not require, a similar declaration of war from all the other signatories of the Tripartite Pact.\n\nAlthough Germany and Japan technically became allies with the signing of Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936, the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union came as a surprise to Japan. In November 1939, Germany and Japan signed the \"Agreement for Cultural Cooperation between Japan and Germany\", which restored the \"reluctant alliance\" between them.\n\nIn a ceremonial speech following the signing of the pact on 27 September, Ribbentrop may have suggested that the signatories were open to accepting new signatories in the future. The \"Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung\" (DAZ) reported his words as follows:\n\nThe purpose of the Pact is, above all things, to help restore peace to the world as quickly as possible. Therefore any other State which wishes to accede to this bloc (\"der diesem Block beitreten will\"), with the intention of contributing to the restoration of peaceful conditions, will be sincerely and gratefully made welcome and will participate in the economic and political reorganisation.\n\nThe official \"Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro\" (DNB), however, as well as most of the press, reported a slightly different version, in which the words \"having good will towards the pact\" (\"der diesem Pakt wohlwollend gegenübertreten will\") instead of \"accede to\" were used. It is likely that initially it was not envisaged that other nations would join the treaty, and that Ribbentrop misspoke. The official record in the DNB therefore corrected his words to remove any reference to \"accession\" by other states, but produced an awkward wording in the process.\n\nThe Italian foreign minister, Ciano, was resolutely opposed to the idea of adding smaller states to the pact as late as 20 November 1940, arguing in his diary that they weakened the pact and were useless bits of diplomacy.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hungary was the fourth state to sign the pact and the first to join it after 27 September 1940. The Hungarian ambassador in Berlin, Döme Sztójay, telegraphed his foreign minister, István Csáky, immediately after news of the signing and of Ribbentrop's speech had reached him. He urged Csáky to join the pact, even claiming that it was the expectation of Germany and Italy that he would do so. He considered it especially important that Hungary sign the pact before Romania did. In response, Csáky asked Sztójay and the ambassador in Rome, Frigyes Villani, to make enquiries regarding Hungary's accession and its potential obligations under the pact. On 28 September, the German secretary of state for foreign affairs, Ernst von Weizsäcker, informed Hungary that Ribbentrop had meant not a \"formal accession\" but merely \"an attitude in the spirit of the Pact\". The Italian answer was similar. Nonetheless, within the week the Hungarian government had sent out formal notice of its \"spiritual adherence\" to the pact.\n\nIn the week after Hungary's \"spiritual adherence\", the Balkan situation changed. Germany granted a Romanian request to send troops to guard the Ploiești oil fields, and Hungary granted a German request to allow its troops to transit Hungary to get to Romania. On 7 October 1940, the first German troops arrived in Ploiești. It is probable that Romania's accession to the pact had been delayed until the German troops were in place, lest the Soviets take preemptive action to secure the oil fields for themselves. In turn, Hungary's accession had been delayed until Romania's had been negotiated. On 9 October or thereabouts, Weizsäcker delivered a message from Ribbentrop to Sztójay informing him that Hitler now wanted \"friendly states\" to join the pact. In a telephone conversation with Ciano on 9 or 10 October, Ribbentrop claimed that Hungary had sent a second request to join the pact. Mussolini reluctantly consented. On 12 October, Ribbentrop informed Sztójay that both Italy and Japan had consented to Hungary's accession. Since the Hungarian regent, Miklós Horthy, had specifically instructed Sztójay to ask that Hungary be the first new state to accede to the pact, Ribbentrop granted the request.\n\nThe Kingdom of Romania had joined the Allied Powers in World War I and had received Transylvania from Austria–Hungary. After Germany and Italy awarded parts of Transylvania back to Hungary and Southern Dobruja back to Bulgaria and after the Soviet Union had taken Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, the Fascist Iron Guard party came to power and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact on November 23, 1940. This was due to the Romanian desire for protection against the Soviet Union.\n\nIn Marshal Ion Antonescu's affidavit read out at the IG Farben Trial (1947–48), he stated that the agreement on entering the pact had been concluded before his visit to Berlin on 22 November 1940.\n\nOn 14 March 1939, the Slovak Republic was declared in the midst of the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Hitler invited Monsignor Jozef Tiso to be the new nation's leader. Soon after it was formed, Slovakia was involved in a war with neighboring Hungary. Although Slovakia had signed a \"Protection Treaty\" with Nazi Germany, Germany refused to intervene. The war resulted in territorial gains by Hungary at Slovakia's expense. Even so, Slovakia supported the German invasion of Poland in 1939.\n\nShortly after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, following the Hungarian lead, Slovakia sent messages of \"spiritual adherence\" to Germany and Italy.\n\nOn 24 November 1940, the day after Romania signed the pact, the Slovak prime minister and foreign minister, Vojtech Tuka, went to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop. There, he signed Slovakia's accession to the Tripartite Pact. The purpose of this was to increase Tuka's standing in Slovakia relative to that of his rival, Tiso, although the Germans had no intention of permitting Tiso to be removed.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bulgaria had been an ally of Germany and on the losing side in World War I. From the beginning, the Germans pressured Bulgaria to join the Tripartite Pact. On 17 November 1940, Tsar Boris III and Foreign Minister met with Adolf Hitler in Germany. According to Hermann Neubacher, Germany's special envoy to the Balkans, Bulgaria's relation to the Axis powers was completely settled at this meeting. On 23 November, however, the Bulgarian ambassador in Berlin, Peter Draganov, informed the Germans that while Bulgaria had agreed in principle to join the pact, it wished to delay its signing for the time being.\n\nThe meeting with Hitler precipitated a visit to Bulgaria by the Soviet diplomat Arkady Sobolev on 25 November. He encouraged the Bulgarians to sign a mutual assistance pact that had first been discussed in October 1939. He offered Soviet recognition of Bulgarian claims in Greece and Turkey. The Bulgarian government, however, was disturbed by the subversive actions of the Bulgarian Communist Party in response to these talks, apparently at Soviet urging.\n\nOn 26 December 1940, the far-right politician Alexander Tsankov introduced a motion in the National Assembly urging the government to immediately accede to the Tripartite Pact. It was voted down.\n\nBulgaria's hand was finally forced by Germany's desire to intervene in the Italo-Greek War. This would require moving troops through Bulgaria. With no possibility of resisting Germany militarily, Prime Minister Bogdan Filov signed Bulgaria's accession to the pact in Vienna on 1 March 1941. He announced that this was done partly in gratitude for Germany's assistance to Bulgaria in obtaining the Treaty of Craiova with Romania, and that it would not affect Bulgaria's relations with Turkey or the Soviet Union. Later that day, Ribbentrop promised Filov that after the fall of Greece, Bulgaria would obtain an Aegean coastline between the Struma and Maritsa rivers.\n\nAccording to Article 17 of the Tarnovo Constitution, treaties had to be ratified by the National Assembly. In the case of the Tripartite Pact, the government sought to have the treaty ratified without debate or discussion. Seventeen opposition deputies submitted an interpellation and one, Ivan Petrov, asked why the Assembly had not been consulted in advance and whether the pact involved Bulgaria in war. They were ignored. The pact was ratified by a vote of 140 to 20.\n\nOn 25 March 1941 in Vienna, Dragiša Cvetković, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, signed the Tripartite Pact. On 27 March, the regime was overthrown in a military \"coup d'état\" with British support. Seventeen-year-old King Peter was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under Prime Minister and General Dušan Simović, refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with Great Britain and the Soviet Union. The enraged Hitler issued Directive 25 as an answer to the coup, and then simultaneously attacked Yugoslavia and Greece starting on 6 April. The German Air Force bombed Belgrade for three days and nights. German ground troops moved in, and Yugoslavia capitulated on 17 April.\n\nThe Independent State of Croatia (\"Nezavisna Država Hrvatska\", or NDH) signed the Tripartite Pact on 15 June 1941.\n\nJust prior to the formation of the Tripartite Pact, the Soviet Union was informed of its existence, and the potential of its joining. Vyacheslav Molotov was thus sent to Berlin to discuss the pact and the possibility of the Soviet Union joining it. The Soviets considered joining the Tripartite Pact to be an update of existing agreements with Germany. During the visit to Berlin, Molotov agreed in principle to the Soviet Union joining the pact so long as some details, such as Soviet annexation of Finland, could be worked out. The Soviet government sent a revised version of the pact to Germany on 25 November. To demonstrate the benefits of partnership, the Soviet Union made large economic offerings to Germany.\n\nHowever, the Germans had no intention of allowing the Soviets to join the pact. They were already making preparations for their invasion of the Soviet Union and were committed to doing so regardless of any action the Soviets took.\n\nWhen they received the Soviet proposal in November, they simply did not reply. They did, however, accept the new economic offerings, and signed an agreement for such on 10 January 1941.\n\nMilitary co-operation between Finland and Nazi Germany started in late 1940 after Finland had lost a significant amount of her territory to Soviet aggression in the Winter War. Finland joined Operation Barbarossa on 25 June 1941, starting the Continuation War. In November, Finland signed the Anti-Comintern Pact (an anti-communist agreement directed against the Soviet Union) with many other countries allied with Germany. Soon after this Germany suggested Finland sign the Tripartite Pact. However, the Finnish government refused, because Finland saw its war as a \"separate war\" from the Second World War, and it saw its objectives as different from those of Nazi Germany. Finland also wanted to maintain diplomatic relations with the Allied Powers, the United States in particular. During the Second World War, Germany asked Finland several times to sign the pact, but always the Finnish government declined the offer. Diplomatic relations between Finland and the United States were maintained until June 1944, although the US ambassador had already been recalled earlier. The United Kingdom, however, declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941 in support of its ally, the Soviet Union.\n\nAt the request of the German command, the Finns established a winter warfare school in Kankaanpää. It began its first two-month course for German officers and NCOs in December 1941. In the summer of 1942, the German-speaking Finnish instructors taught a course on forest warfare. General Waldemar Erfurth, the German liaison to the Finnish general headquarters, considered the school an outstanding success. It was also attended by some Hungarian officers.\n\nJapan attacked Thailand at 02:00 local time on 8 December 1941. The Japanese ambassador, Teiji Tsubokami, told the Thai foreign minister, Direk Jayanama, that Japan only wanted permission for its troops to pass through Thailand to attack the British in Malaya and Burma. At 07:00, Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram (Phibun) held an emergency cabinet meeting in Bangkok and soon after a ceasefire was ordered. Phibun then met with Tsubokami, who offered him four options: to conclude a defensive–offensive alliance with Japan, to join the Tripartite Pact, to cooperate in Japanese military operations, or to agree to the joint defence of Thailand. Military cooperation was chosen, the Tripartite Pact rejected.\n\nAccording to the post-war memoires of Direk Jayanama, Phibun planned to later sign the pact, but Direk's opposition prevented this.\n\nThe \"joint technical commissions\" required by the pact were established by an agreement of 20 December 1940. They were to consist of a general commission in each capital, consisting of the host foreign minister and the other two partners' ambassadors. Under the general commission were to be military and economic commissions. On 15 December 1941 the first meeting of all three commissions in one capital, Berlin, took place, labelled a \"Tripartite Pact Conference\". It was decided there to form a \"Permanent Council of the Tripartite Pact Powers\", but nothing happened for two months. Only the Italians, whom the Japanese mistrusted, pushed for greater collaboration.\n\nOn 18 January 1942, the German and Italian governments signed two secret operational agreements, one with the Imperial Japanese Army and another with the Imperial Japanese Navy. These agreements divided the world along longitude 70° east into two major operational zones, but it had almost no military significance. Chiefly, it committed the powers to cooperation in matters of commerce, intelligence and communication.\n\nOn 24 February 1942 the Permanent Council met under the chairmanship of Ribbentrop, who announced that \"the propaganda effect is one of the main reasons for our meetings\". The representatives set up a propaganda commission and then adjourned indefinitely. The military commission in Berlin met only two or three times by 1943, and there were no trilateral naval talks at all. Germany and Japan conducted separate naval discussions, and Italy consulted the Japanese independently for its planned assault on Malta in 1942.\n\nThe economic relationship between the Tripartite powers was fraught with difficulty. Japan would not grant economic concessions to Germany in 1941, lest they ruin its negotiations with the United States. In January 1942 negotiations on economic cooperation began, but an agreement was not signed until 20 January 1943 in Berlin. Italy was invited to sign a similar agreement in Rome at the same time, for propaganda purposes, but none of the supplementary Berlin protocols applied to Italo-Japanese relations.\n\nJapan first pressed Germany to join the war with the United States on 2 December 1941, only two days after notifying Berlin of its intention to go to war. Receiving no response, Japan approached Italy. At 04:00 on the morning of 5 December, Ribbentrop gave the Japanese ambassador a proposal—which had already been approved by Italy—to join the war and prosecute it jointly. On 11 December 1941, the same day as the German declaration of war against the United States and the Italian declaration, the three powers signed an agreement—already hammered out on 8 December—barring any separate peace with the United States or Britain. It was \"intended as a propaganda accompaniment to the declaration of war\".\n"}

While only five people were individually named within the subpoena, according to lawyer Mark Stephens the order effectively entailed the collection in relation to criminal prosecution of the personal identifying information of over six hundred thousand Twitter users, principally those who were followers of WikiLeaks. The U.S. government also sent Twitter a subpoena for information about Julian Assange and several other WikiLeaks-related persons, including Chelsea Manning. Twitter appealed against the accompanying gag order in order to be able to disclose its existence to its users, and was ultimately successful in its appeal. Subsequent reactions included the discussion of secret subpoenas in the U.S., criticism of the particular subpoena issued, an immediate, temporary 0.5 percent reduction in the number of Twitter followers of WikiLeaks, and calls for the recognition and emulation of Twitter's stance.\n\nPrior to the December 2010 subpoena relating to the WikiLeaks, Twitter had received at least one subpoena for information about its users. Just after the Attorney-General of the US state of Pennsylvania Tom Corbett was elected as governor of Pennsylvania, it was revealed that he had issued a subpoena against Twitter to demand personal information on two users who criticised him. The sub-poena included phone numbers, email addresses, banking info, and internet accounts. It also ordered Twitter to produce the information without informing the users. \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" claimed that the subpoena was issued because of the two users' criticisms of Corbett. Corbett's spokesperson said that the subpoena was issued as \"part of an ongoing criminal investigation\". The organizations Public Citizen and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) provided legal aid to the users. The subpoena was later dropped by the Attorney-General's office. On 11 March, a U.S. judge upheld the request of the federal prosecutor.\n\nOn 14 December 2010 the U.S. Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information in accordance with USC 18 2703(d). The order additionally directed that Twitter should not disclose the existence of the subpoena without prior authorization. Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning, Rop Gonggrijp, Jacob Appelbaum and Birgitta Jonsdottir were named in the subpoena. The requested information included their user names, addresses, telephone numbers, bank account details, and credit card numbers.\n\nAssange's lawyer Mark Stephens argued that since the application also extended to destination email addresses and IP addresses for any communication stored for the named accounts, personal identifying information was to be collected for some six hundred and thirty-four thousand followers of WikiLeaks's Twitter feed.\n\nWikiLeaks alleged it had evidence suggesting similar subpoenas had been issued to Google and Facebook, and lawyer Mark Stephens said that similar information had been sought not only from Google and Facebook but also from eBay's Skype unit. WikiLeaks called for Google and Facebook to unseal the subpoenas if they had received them, but no spokespeople were available to comment.\n\nTwitter applied to notify its users of the issue of the subpoena. On 5 January 2011 it was notified of the success in its appeal, allowing the company to inform its users and to give them ten days in turn in which to appeal. After Twitter informed Jonsdottir, she released a tweet stating \"USA government wants to know about all my tweets and more since november 1st 2009. Do they realize I am a member of parliament in Iceland?\"\n\nAden Fine of the ACLU said that \"Twitter's e-mail indicated that it had not yet turned over to the U.S. government any records that prosecutors requested.\"\n\nAmong those specifically named by the subpoena, Assange, Jonsdottir, Appelbaum and Gonggrijp all stated that they would oppose it. Lawyer Aden Fine of the ACLU participated in defending those subpoenaed. Jonsdottir stated that she had contacted the Icelandic Minister of Justice and Human Rights and commented that the \"U.S. government is trying to criminalize whistleblowing and publication of whistleblowing material.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" observed that the US government issues over fifty thousand such requests for information each year, typically accompanied by the so-called gag order, linking the case to how \"1986 Privacy Law is Outrun by the Web\". Nicholas Merrill, the first to file a constitutional challenge against the use of national security letters, describes this as \"a perfect example of how the government can use its broad powers to silence people\". Lawmakers in Iceland criticised the subpoena as an instance of overreach. Assange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, has interpreted the subpoena as a sign that US authorities were desperate to develop a criminal case against Assange. He stated that the subpoena was an attempt to \"shake the electronic tree in the hope some kind of criminal charge drops out the bottom of it.\"\n\nJuan Cole, a historian of the modern Middle East and South Asia, described the subpoena as \"a fishing expedition and legally fishy in that regard\" that \"is being pursued by the Obama administration out of terror that further massive leaks will be made public.\" He contrasted the legal action against people associated with WikiLeaks with the lack of legal actions against \"Bush administration officials, such as Dick Cheney, who ordered people tortured [and] have not been in any way inconvenienced by Mssrs. Obama and Holder.\" Cole suggested that users of social media should shift from Facebook and Twitter that have \"internet monopolies\" and \"are in turn tools of US government control\" to social media based in Europe or the Global South. WikiLeaks's list of 637,000 followers on Twitter dropped by 3,000 in the hours following the announcement of the US Department of Justice action.\n\nProfessor of Law Ben Saul argued that the US had been compelled to attempt to obtain information on citizens of other countries through action against its own companies due to its lack of overseas law enforcement powers, suggesting that \"the real question is how will other countries react … will other governments try to do things to shut down this kind of investigation?\" Members of the European Parliament from the Netherlands, Romania and the UK have questioned whether US 'snooping' on the Twitter accounts of those linked with WikiLeaks is in violation of European privacy laws.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation has since, comparing their law enforcement policies, stressed \"how important it is that social media companies do what they can to protect the sensitive data they hold from the prying eyes of the government\".\" Wired\" staff writer Ryan Singel said that Twitter's \"action in asking for the gag order to be overturned sets a new precedent that we can only hope that other companies begin to follow\" and summarised his point of view by saying \"Twitter beta-tested a spine\" and that Twitter's response should become an \"industry standard\".\n\n"}
