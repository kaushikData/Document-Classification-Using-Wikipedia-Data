The protesters demanded that the president honour the 1992 constitution, and demanding that he step down immediately. Gnassingbé offered the protesters the option of enacting the two-term limit set in the constitution effective from 2018, thus ensuring that he could stay in power until 2030. This has been rejected by the opposition. As the protests continued, the opposition started focusing more on protesting Gnassingbé's rule.\n\nStarting in August 2017, the opposition has held protests on a near-weekly basis. The scale of the protests have been enormous, with some estimates claiming 800,000 present at one protest in a country of 6.6 million. The demonstrations are also taking place all over the country, even in the north, the traditional power base for the Gnassingbé family. The Togolese government has responded to these protests by shutting down the internet, or block various apps, such as WhatsApp. The protesters have utilised social media, using the hashtag #togodebut for publicity. The protests and police response have resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people, including two soldiers. , Gnassingbé has offered some concessions to the opposition, but has held onto power due to his crackdown on activists.\n\nOn 19 August, thousands of protesters took to the streets, mostly in the city of Sokodé. Some protesters chanted \"50 years is too long\". Protests also occurred in Lomé, Bafilo, Anié, and Kara. Security forces shot and killed two civilians while dispersing protesters. Other civilians burned security vehicles and killed seven security men. Photographs of the violence spread on social media. About 27 people were arrested, and 15 protesters identified as supporters of the Pan African National Party were given jail sentences of 5–9 months. Some of those arrested later said they were tortured at the headquarters of Togo's secret police, and placed in Lomé's central prison.\n\nOpposition parties called for a general strike to take place on 25 August, which slowed business and caused Lomé to enter a security lockdown. Togolese minister Gilbert Bawara criticized the strike, calling it \"the campaign of terror, intimidation and threats\". Togolese Prime Minister Komi Sélom Klassou led a pro-government counter-protest in Lomé on 29 August. Ghanaian immigration officers increased security of the Ghana–Togo border for Togolese fleeing to Ghana because of the unrest.\n\nOn 5 September, in an effort to disrupt planned protests, the Toglose government cut off the internet, blocked the use of WhatsApp, and filtered international calls. Despite this, the opposition parties CAP 2015 and the Pan-African National Party started a large three-day protest in Lomé. Amnesty International estimated that about 100,000 people participated in a protest on 6 September. At least 80 protesters were arrested on 7 September for \"preparing to commit violent acts, vandalise shops.\" Security forces in Lomé fired tear gas to disperse the protesters. Normal access to the internet was restored on 11 September.\n\nTogo's National Assembly introduced a bill meant to reform the country's electoral system and introduce presidential term limits of two five-year terms. The opposition objected to the bill's wording, saying that the term limits would not be retroactive. The opposition boycotted the National Assembly's vote on the bill on 18 September, making it subject to a referendum. The next day, the Togolese government slowed down the country's internet as the opposition prepared for more protests. According to Amnesty International, security forces used batons, bullets, and tear gas against protesters in Mango, killing a 9-year-old boy. Security minister Damehane Yark blamed the opposition for the boy's death, saying the protesters were using weapons. A picture of a cow killed by the military in the village Kparatao spread online and became a symbol of the protests. The next day, opposition leaders blamed the government for repressing protests in Northern Togo, and thousands of Togolese participated in anti-government demonstrations.\n\nOn 3 October, the United States embassy in Togo issued a security warning concerning transportation issues that could arise because of upcoming protests. On 4 and 5 October, thousands of protesters marched through Lomé and some created barricades. In response, the Togolese government shut down internet communication and mobile access to the internet. The Togolese government announced a ban on weekday protests on 10 October, though opposition parties said they would defy this ban.\n\nAlpha Alassane, an imam affiliated with the opposition movement, was arrested in Sokodé on 16 October for allegedly inciting violence with his followers. The arrest fueled tension between the Togolese government and the opposition. A two-day protests started on 18 October throughout Togo. On the first day, four people—one in Lomé and three in Sokodé—were reportedly killed during clashes between protesters and security forces. Yark Damehame, Togo's security minister, denied the reported deaths, saying that nobody was killed in Sokodé on this day. Some protesters in Lomé formed barricades, and police fired tear gas to disperse them. About 300 Togolese nationals attempted to participate in a protest in Accra, Ghana, but the police ruled the demonstration was unlawful and arrested 26 protesters.\n\nGambia's Foreign Minister Ousainou Darboe called on Gnassingbe to resign, although he retracted the statement a few days later and said it was a matter for the Togolese people. U.S. Department of State spokesperson Heather Nauert called on the Togolese government to protect its citizens' rights and engage in dialogue with the protesters.\n\nThe Togolese government lifted its ban on weekday protests on 4 November. On 7 November the Togolese government released 42 of the protesters who were arrested in September and dropped arson charges against opposition leader Jean-Pierre Fabre. Opposition parties saw this as an attempt to appease their demands. Thousands of protesters participated in three protests during this week, with the last one on 10 November.\n\nGnassingbé blamed the opposition for violence at its protests. Opposition leaders called this a \"declaration of war\" against the Togolese people. Gnassingbé visited Sokodé in late November 2017, saying, \"My exchanges with the imams and senior figures left me reassured that our country remains indivisible.\"\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held its 2017 summit on 16 December in Abuja, Nigeria instead of in Togo, likely because of political tension between the government and opposition. Around the time of this summit, thousands of protesters held anti-government marches. In Accra, Ghana, police arrested twelve members of the Ghana–Togo Solidarity movement, including Bernard Mornah, the chairman of the People's National Convention, for protesting the situation in Togo.\n\nThe opposition held demonstrations on 28 December, and the police arrest of a young man was filmed. Tens of thousands of opposition supporters protested peacefully in Lomé on 31 December.\n\nOn 3 January 2018, Gnassingbé called for the opposition to participate in government talks to resolve their differences. Thousands of people in Togo participated in an anti-government protest on 13 January 2018, the 55th anniversary of the Sylvanus Olympio's assassination. Counter-protesters held demonstrations in support of the government. Supporters of the Togolese opposition also protested in Berlin and Washington, DC.\n\nOn 20 January 2018, the same day as the 2018 Women's March, the opposition held an anti-government demonstration focused on female involvement. During the protest, thousands of Togolese women mostly dressed in black marched through Lomé, accompanied by male opposition supporters. Starting on 31 January 2018, Togolese healthcare workers went on a two-day strike to demand that the government provide better health services.\n\nOn 15 February, Amnesty International, Front Line Defenders and Africans Rising issued a joint statement criticising Togo's treatment of activists involved in the protests.\n\nIn early February 2018, the opposition agreed to stop holding protests while mediators from Guinea and Ghana visited Togo. However, on 4 February 2018, the day after these mediators suggested that Togo hold talks on constitutional reform, thousands of protesters marched through Lomé. Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo and Guinean President Alpha Condé started mediating talks between the Togolese government and opposition on 19 February in Lomé. The next day, Ghanaian mediators announced that the Togolese government would released 45 of the 92 people imprisoned for participating in the protests.\n\nOn 6 March, Togo's opposition coalition announced it would resume protests, despite the previous agreement to suspend protests while government talks were underway. Eric Dupuy, the coalition spokesman, said this was because the Togolese government failed to prepare for upcoming parliamentary elections. Ghanaian President Akufo-Addo met with 14 Togolese opposition leaders on the next day at The Flagstaff House in Accra, Ghana. Two days later, this opposition coalition accepted the Akufo-Addo's request to continue suspending protests for the next week while the talks continued. These talks resumed on 23 March.\n\nThe opposition coalition planned protests in Lomé and other towns on 11–12 April, and the Togolese government said this would violate their agreement with Akufo-Addo. On the first day of this demonstration, the police fired tear gas on the protesters. On 14 April 2018, security forces in Lomé fired tear gas near the headquarters of the Democratic Convention of African Peoples About 25 people were injured during these three days of protest, and one person died from his injuries. Security forces also prevented people from protesting in Kpalimé. Heads of state in ECOWAS held talks in Lomé on this day, and they called on Akufo-Addo and Condé to step up their reform efforts and end political violence.\n\nThe opposition coalition parties announced on 8 May that they were calling off protests planned in the coming days, citing the lack of security and progress with their objectives. On 17 June, the coalition called for its supporters to participate in a sit-at-home general strike the next day, and the government urged people to boycott this protest.\n\nThe Togolese government and opposition coalition held talks on 27 June, and Akufo-Addo and Condé, the co-facilitators of these talks, called for continued dialogue and suspended street protests. The government banned street protests from 23 July to 1 August while Togo hosted an ECOWAS summit. On November 3, 2018, over a thousand people protested in Lomé to demand the release of imprisoned protesters.\n"}

It was founded in October 2002 by a group of U2 fans who were inspired by frontman Bono's May 2002 visit to poor sections of Africa along with former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill. The organization was inspired by Bono's charitable work throughout Africa, but is not directly connected to the band.\n\nThe organization is partnered with Africare, and is staffed entirely by volunteers to minimize overhead.\n\nAlthough most of the donations come from North Americans and Western Europeans that are not actually there to observe the people benefiting from their help, leaps towards progress occurred in African communities due to global concern and global participation, as well as cooperation and understanding amongst the people.\n\nTake one of the first well projects that cost a mere one thousand dollars. Access to water in southern Uganda in 2002 was limited due to the Great African War. It must have been a terrifying place to go out to get water for your mother, and your siblings. Children or their mothers in the village of Ntungamo had to travel long distances through the district to collect water for bathing and cooking. But, the water sources were stagnant, just holes in the ground. People often bathed in them, and children just cleaned the algae off of the surface of the water when collecting it. This spread disease in an area of the world where HIV/AIDS is often a taboo topic of discussion, and people are not always properly educated about the severity of the issue because of this.\n\nThe construction of a well with running water actually helped bring people together, and Africare water experts were able to educate people about the issue of HIV/AIDS, as well as how important it is to do their part in maintaining the well.\n\nBy donating money and spreading awareness about issues that people may be struggling with far away, people often feel more connected with the people they're trying to help. For Bono's 50th birthday, U2 fans attempted to raise 50,000 dollars for the Buhara District in Zimbabwe. \n\n\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43967110/Global_Networks.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1511301257&Signature=0i1YHrJpx%2FowYQTa9PIES93gZW0%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCelebrity_Humanitarianism_Transnational.pdf\n"}

He was the Vice-President (External) of the Hong Kong University Students' Union.\n\nHe was one of the main organizers of the Occupy Central campaign. On 1 July 2014, following an annual pro-democracy rally, he organised a sit-in on Chater Road in central Hong Kong which was forcibly dispersed by police. 511 people were arrested. He was quoted as saying at the time that \"It’s not enough to repeat the march and the assembly every year. We have to upgrade it to a civil disobedience movement.\" He later wrote that \"In the past 30 years, the democracy movement has been too slow and too painstaking. The power of civil disobedience lies … in the blood and tears of everyone who is behind the struggle.\"\n\nIn the early stages of the Umbrella Movement, he was an influential organiser and speaker. He was reported as announcing to protesters, \"This is not a student movement; this is a Hong Kongers' movement\"; he warned the \"New York Times\" that \"residents may occupy various government departments\". On 5 October, when the Federation of Students agreed to enter into dialogue with the government, Chow announced that the talks would be called off if attempts were made to forcefully remove protesters. In a speech at the main protest camp, he explained, \"A dialogue is not a compromise. We will start arranging talks with the government, because we understand that there are people in both the government and here who want to solve society’s problems. We will not back down.\"\n\nHaving attempted and failed to organise meetings with officials through local channels, Chow and two other students were prevented from travelling to China to petition mainland government officials when they attempted to leave on 15 November. The group, consisting of Chow, Nathan Law and Eason Chung, learned from airline officials that mainland authorities had revoked their Home Return Permits, effectively banning them from boarding the flight for Beijing.\n\nChow and two other prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy student leaders, Nathan Law and Joshua Wong, were convicted on 21 July 2016 of unlawful assembly (incitement in Chow's case) at the Civic Square, Central Government Complex at Tamar, during a protest that triggered the 79-day Occupy sit-ins of 2014. After initially being sentenced to three weeks' imprisonment (suspended) on 15 August 2016, his term was increased a year later to seven months on appeal to the High Court by the government. The conviction, if not overturned on appeal, would result in disqualification from standing for election to the Legislative Council until July 2021.\n\nChow began a master's degree at the London School of Economics in 2016.\n\nOn 1 February 2018, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers, led by Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) Chair US Senator Marco Rubio and co-chair US Representative Chris Smith announced they had nominated Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Chow and the entire Umbrella Movement for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, for \"their peaceful efforts to bring political reform and protect the autonomy and freedoms guaranteed Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration\".\n\n"}

The group was originally known as Die Bruecke (The Bridge). \"Aufbau\" was also the name of a periodical it brought out. \n\nAccording to Michael Kellogg, the Aufbau Vereinigung was a vital influence on the development of Nazi ideology in the years before the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 as well as financing NSDAP with, for example, funds from Henry Ford. It gave Hitler the idea of a vast Jewish conspiracy, involving a close alliance between international finance and Bolshevism and threatening disaster for mankind. Recent research on Hitler's early years in Vienna (1905-1913) appears to have shown that his antisemitism was at that time far less developed than it became under the new influences.\n\nAufbau members became involved in terrorist activities, including the assassination of Walther Rathenau and that of Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov (both in 1922).\n\nAfter the death of Scheubner-Richter in the putsch, Aufbau rapidly declined, and notions of Lebensraum and Slavic inferiority, naturally unpopular with the Russians, gained a stronger hold on the Nazi movement. \n\nThe long-term influence of Aufbau has been traced in the implementation of the final solution and in Hitler's disastrous decision to divert troops away from Moscow towards the Ukraine in 1941.\n\nProminent members of Aufbau included:\n\n"}

On 1 October 2018 ALA was also registered as state party in Victoria. . Senator Fraser Anning (QLD) attended the party's Victorian campaign launch as keynote speaker .\n\nIn May 2016 the party endorsed Angry Anderson as a candidate for the Senate representing New South Wales at the 2016 federal election. Anderson was the second name for the party on the NSW ballot paper. The party fielded 13 senate candidates in all six states and 10 candidates in three states for seats in the House of Representatives in the 2016 election. The party won 0.74% of the primary vote (102,982 votes) in the Senate and 0.19% of the primary vote (25,337 votes) in the House of Representatives. Their best Senate result was in Western Australia, where they polled 1.11%. Their best result in the House of Representatives was the seat of Farrer, where they polled 6.08%.\n\nAt the 2017 Bennelong by-election the party polled 0.85%. At the 2018 Batman by-election they polled 1.39%, and in the 2018 Perth by-election they polled 1.18%. At the Wentworth by-election ALA polled 0.20%, third last out of the 16 candidates.

Yemini is a controversial figure in the Jewish community because of his support for the far right causes. In August 2018, Facebook deleted Avi Yemini's page for hate speech. Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) and Jewish Community Council of Victoria (JCCV) have publicly shunned Yemini.\n\nThe party polled 0.03% in the lower house and 0.58% in the upper house.

However, the party has focused most of its efforts on its criticism of Islam. That includes the party's policy to \"stop the Islamisation of Australia\", and their efforts to bring noted anti-Islamic speakers such as Geert Wilders. \n\nThe party is focused on stopping Muslim immigration to Australia, and its policy calls for only non-Muslims to be allowed in to the country. The party wants Australia to focus its refugee efforts to assist white South African farmers, even though there is no evidence that they are in need of assistance or that they would qualify as refugees. It also calls for restrictions to be placed on Islamic organisations including mosques and Islamic schools in Australia, that are there to service Australia's sizable existing Muslim population.\n\nThe party has also had to fend off accusations of being climate skeptics, and while they claim they believe that humans have had an effect on the environment, they also raise doubts about the competency of the scientists and that their studies \"are not based on scientific fact, but on computerised speculations and consent amongst special interest groups\", and about climate change in general with their claim that \"extreme natural events were described in Australian poetry a century before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change created hysteria about rising sea levels.\"\n\nOne of their stated goals is to prevent any Sharia court system from being established, although they make no comment about similar structures in place for other religions, such as the Beth Din structures for the Jewish community.\n\n\n"}

It was acquired by Magnolia and Participant Media.\n\nThe film took five years to make because of struggles to secure funding, get interviews, and uncover archival footage.\n\nThe film examines the ten televised debates between Buckley and Vidal in August 1968 that were moderated by anchorman Howard K.

The \"black boards\" were installed at entrances to a settlement and identified the residents that were accused of counter-revolutionary activity and who were the enemies of the people, allegedly trying to undermine the process of collectivization. The fact of nominating of such settlements was published in the oblast newspapers listing the names of collective farms that resisted collectivization and the Soviet regime.\n\nHowever some of the archives reflect that \"black boards\" were used precisely as a repressive element in the fight not only against the collectivization resistance, but also against the nationality factor of the local population. For example, in 1932 the Vinnytsia Oblast Communist Party Committee suggested the local village of Mazurivka to be nominated to \"black boards\", because there was born one of the Petlyura's generals Khmara, while the village of Karpivtsi (Chudniv Raion) in Volyn was known as one of the Petlyura's. The village of Turbiv (Lypovets Raion), for example, deserved such a penalty for its \"high infestation of the Petlyura element and participation in the Plyskiv affair in spring\". Each settlement or an administrative unit with black boards was encircled by armed squads and was subjected to complete food requisitioning.\n\nSuch repressions were conducted towards the half of all raions and municipalities of the Ukrainian SSR except for the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast where such regime occupied territories of all administrative units without exception.

Three major crises led to radical changes in all areas of society: demographic collapse, political instabilities and religious upheavals.\n\nA series of famines and plagues, beginning with the Great Famine of 1315–17 and especially the Black Death of 1347-1351, reduced the population perhaps by half or more as the Medieval Warm Period came to a close and the first century of the Little Ice Age began. It took 150 years for the European population to regain the levels of 1300.\n\nPopular revolts in late-medieval Europe and civil wars between nobles within countries such as the Wars of the Roses were common—with France fighting internally nine times—and there were international conflicts between kings such as France and England in the Hundred Years' War. The unity of the Roman Catholic Church was shattered by the Western Schism. The Holy Roman Empire was also in decline; in the aftermath of the Great Interregnum (1247–1273), the Empire lost cohesion and politically the separate dynasties of the various German states became more important than their common empire.\n\nThe expression \"Crisis of the Late Middle Ages\" is used commonly in western historiography, especially in English and German, and somewhat less among other western European scholarship to refer individually or collectively to different crises besetting Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. The expression often carries a modifier to refer more specifically to one or another aspect of Late Middle Age crisis, such as the \"Urban\" Crisis of the Late Middle Ages, or the \"Cultural\", \"Monastic\", \"Religious\", \"Social\", \"Economic\", \"Intellectual\", or \"Agrarian\" crisis of the Late Middle Ages, or a national or regional modifier, e.g. \"Catalan\" or \"French\" crisis. It is sometimes pluralized (\"The Crises...\") but more often is found in the singular as a collective term for the various crises.\n\nBy 1929, French historian Marc Bloch was already writing about the effects of the crisis of the Late Middle Ages, and by mid-century there were academic debates being held about it.\nIn his 1981 article \"Late Middle Age Agrarian Crisis or Crisis of Feudalism?\", Peter Kriedte reprises some of the early works in the field from historians writing in the 1930s, including Marc Bloch, Henri Pirenne, Wilhelm Abel, and Michael Postan. Referred to in Italian as the \"Crisis of the 14th Century\", Giovanni Cherubini alluded to the debate that already by 1974 had been going on \"for several decades\" in French, British, American, and German historiography.\n\nArno Borst (1992) says that it \"is a given that fourteenth century Latin Christianity was in a crisis\", and goes on to say that the intellectual aspects and how universities were affected by the crisis is underrepresented in the scholarship hitherto: \"When we discuss the crisis of the Late Middle Ages, we consider intellectual movements beside religious, social, and economic ones\", and gives some examples.\n\nSome question whether \"crisis\" is the right expression for the period at the end of the Middle Ages and the transition to Modernity. In his 1981 article \"The End of the Middle Ages: Decline, Crisis or Transformation?\" Donald Sullivan addresses this question, claiming that scholarship has neglected the period and viewed it largely as a precursor to subsequent climactic events such as the Renaissance and Reformation.\n\nIn his \"Introduction to the History of the Middle Ages in Europe\", Mitre Fernández wrote in 2004 that \"[t]o talk about a general crisis of the Late Middle Ages is already a commonplace in the study of medieval history.\" \n\nHeribert Müller, in his 2012 book on the religious crisis of the late Middle Ages, discussed whether the term itself was in crisis, saying,No doubt the thesis of the crisis of the late Middle Ages has itself been in crisis for some time now, and hardly anyone considered an expert in the field would still profess it without some ifs and buts, and especially so in the case of German Medieval historians.\n\nIn his 2014 historiographical article about the crisis in the Middle Ages, Peter Schuster quotes historian Léopold Genicot's 1971 article \"Crisis: From the Middle Ages to Modern Times\" where Genicot wrote, \"Crisis is the word which comes immediately to the historian's mind when he thinks of the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries.\"\n\nSome scholars contend that at the beginning of the 14th century, Europe had become overpopulated. By the 14th century frontiers had ceased to expand and internal colonization was coming to an end, but population levels remained high.\n\nThe Medieval Warm Period ended sometime towards the end of the 13th century, bringing the \"Little Ice Age\" and harsher winters with reduced harvests. In Northern Europe, new technological innovations such as the heavy plough and the three-field system were not as effective in clearing new fields for harvest as they were in the Mediterranean because the north had poor, clay-like soil. Food shortages and rapidly inflating prices were a fact of life for as much as a century before the plague. Wheat, oats, hay and consequently livestock, were all in short supply.\n\nTheir scarcity resulted in malnutrition, which increases susceptibility to infections due to weakened immune systems. In the autumn of 1314, heavy rains began to fall, which were the start of several years of cold and wet winters. The already weak harvests of the north suffered and the seven-year famine ensued. In the years 1315 to 1317 a catastrophic famine, known as the Great Famine, struck much of North West Europe. It was arguably the worst in European history, perhaps reducing the population by more than 10%.\n\nMost governments instituted measures that prohibited exports of foodstuffs, condemned black market speculators, set price controls on grain and outlawed large-scale fishing. At best, they proved mostly unenforceable and at worst they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad: from France because of the prohibition, and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by pirates or looters to be sold on the black market.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their treasury and exacerbating inflation. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what became known as the Hundred Years' War. This situation was worsened when landowners and monarchs such as Edward III of England (r. 1327–1377) and Philip VI of France (r. 1328–1350), raised the fines and rents of their tenants out of a fear that their comparatively high standard of living would decline.\n\nThe European economy entered a vicious circle in which hunger and chronic, low-level debilitating disease reduced the productivity of labourers, and so the grain output was reduced, causing grain prices to increase. Standards of living fell drastically, diets grew more limited, and Europeans as a whole experienced more health problems.\n\nWhen a typhoid epidemic emerged, many thousands died in populated urban centres, most significantly Ypres (now in Belgium). In 1318 a pestilence of unknown origin, sometimes identified as anthrax, targeted the animals of Europe, notably sheep and cattle, further reducing the food supply and income of the peasantry.\n\nAs Europe moved out of the Medieval Warm Period and into the Little Ice Age, a decrease in temperature and a great number of devastating floods disrupted harvests and caused mass famine. The cold and the rain proved to be particularly disastrous from 1315 to 1317 in which poor weather interrupted the maturation of many grains and beans and flooding turned fields rocky and barren. Scarcity of grain caused price inflation, as described in one account of grain prices in Europe in which the price of wheat doubled from twenty shillings per quarter in 1315 to forty shillings per quarter by June of the following year. Grape harvests also suffered, which reduced wine production throughout Europe. The wine production from the vineyards surrounding the Abbey of Saint-Arnould in France decreased as much as eighty percent by 1317. During this climatic change and subsequent famine, Europe's cattle were struck with Bovine Pestilence, a pathogen of unknown identity (although some modern interpretations cite anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, or rinderpest). The pathogen began spreading throughout Europe from Eastern Asia in 1315 and reached the British Isles by 1319. Manorial accounts of cattle populations in the year between 1319 and 1320, places a sixty-two percent loss in England and Wales alone. In these countries, some correlation can be found between the places where poor weather reduced crop harvests and places where the bovine population was particularly negatively affected. It is hypothesized that both low temperatures and lack of nutrition lowered the cattle populations' immune systems and made them vulnerable to disease. The proliferation of dead or unhealthy cattle drastically affected dairy production, and the output did not return to its pre-pestilence amount until 1331. Much of the medieval peasants' protein was obtained from dairy, and milk shortages likely caused nutritional deficiency in the European population. Famine and pestilence, exacerbated with the prevalence of war during this time, led to the death of an estimated ten to fifteen percent of Europe's population.\n\nThe Black Death was a particularly devastating epidemic in Europe during this time, and is notable due to the number of people who succumbed to the disease within the few years the disease was active. It was fatal to an estimated thirty to sixty percent of the population where the disease was present. While there is some question of whether it was a particularly deadly strain of Yersinia pestis that caused the Black Death, research indicates no significant difference in bacterial phenotype. Thus environmental stressors are considered when hypothesizing the deadliness of the Black Plague, such as crop failures due to changes in weather, the subsequent famine, and an influx of host rats into Europe from China. The Black Death was so devastating that a comparable plague in terms of virulence had not been seen since the Justinian plague, prior to the Medieval warm period. This gap in plague activity during the Medieval Warm Period contributes to the hypothesis that climate conditions would have affected Europe's susceptibility to disease when the climate began to cool during the arrival of the Little Ice Age in the 13th century.\n\nBefore the 14th century, popular uprisings were not unknown, for example, uprisings at a manor house against an unpleasant overlord, but they were local in scope. This changed in the 14th and 15th centuries when new downward pressures on the poor resulted in mass movements and popular uprisings across Europe. To indicate how common and widespread these movements became, in Germany between 1336 and 1525 there were no less than sixty phases of militant peasant unrest.\n\nThe unity of the Roman Catholic Church was shattered by the Western Schism. The Holy Roman Empire was also in decline in the aftermath of the Great Interregnum (1247–1273); the Empire lost cohesion, and politically the separate dynasties of the various German states became more important than their common empire.\n\n\n\nScholars such as David Herlihy and Michael Postan use the term Malthusian limit to express and explain some tragedies as resulting from overpopulation. In his 1798 \"Essay on the Principle of Population\", Thomas Malthus asserted that eventually humans would reproduce so greatly that they would go beyond the limits of necessary resources; once they reach this point, catastrophe becomes inevitable. In his book, \"The Black Death and the Transformation of the West\", professor David Herlihy explores this idea of plague as an inevitable crisis imposed on humanity to control the population and human resources. In the book \"The Black Death; A Turning Point in History?\" (ed. William M. Bowsky) he \"implies that the Black Death's pivotal role in late medieval society ... was now being challenged. Arguing on the basis of a neo-Malthusian economics, revisionist historians recast the Black Death as a necessary and long overdue corrective to an overpopulated Europe.\"\n\nHerlihy also examined the arguments against the Malthusian crisis, stating \"if the Black Death was a response to excessive human numbers it should have arrived several decades earlier\" in consequence of the population growth of years before the outbreak of the Black Death. Herlihy also brings up other, biological factors that argue against the plague as a \"reckoning\" by arguing \"the role of famines in affecting population movements is also problematic. The many famines preceding the Black Death, even the 'great hunger' of 1315 to 1317, did not result in any appreciable reduction in population levels\". Herlihy concludes the matter stating, \"the medieval experience shows us not a Malthusian crisis but a stalemate, in the sense that the community was maintaining at stable levels very large numbers over a lengthy period\" and states that the phenomenon should be referred to as more of a deadlock, rather than a crisis, to describe Europe before the epidemics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6654842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6654842", "title": "Euergetism", "text": "Euergetism\n\nEuergetism (or evergetism, from the Greek , \"doing good deeds\") was the ancient practice of high-status and wealthy individuals in society distributing part of their wealth to the community. This was evident in the patron-client relations in ancient Rome. The modern term was coined by French historian André Boulanger and subsequently used in the works of Paul Veyne.\n\nDuring the second half of the 4th century BC, profound changes occurred in the financing of public institutions. Without the backing or funding from the wealthy, at least symbolically, the legitimacy of these institutions could be called into question by the city. The idea emerged that the rich people were not contributing unless required or compelled to do so. At the same time, around 355 BC, Demosthenes mentioned the lack of funding from the wealthy in the \"Against Leptines\" and Xenophon in \"Poroi\".\n\nAt the end of the century, Demetrius Phalereus abolished the two most important Athenian liturgies. The trierarchy was no longer necessary because Athens withdrew from the international arena after his defeat at 322, and choregy, was replaced by a judiciary elective, \"the presidential contest (agonothésie), whose funding was supported by the State\".\n\nHowever, many honorary degrees in \"honor agonothetai\" were available, showing that the amounts incurred by them voluntarily to supplement those supported by the city far exceeded the cost of the former choregy. Thus, in 284/3, the agonothetai elected, the poet Philippides, ceased to be reimbursed by the city money it advanced. Similarly, some old magistrates were often funded by their owner: Athens, priests generally provided the victims of sacrifice, when the cosmetic and continues to oversee the ephebia in the Hellenistic period, that is now on his own money that finances most of the sacrifices, prizes for competitions, and routine maintenance of equipment and buildings. Although no document mentions as such that the holder of the office shall assume the financial cost of its charge, entries published annually in his honor shows that oversees the flow of the institution, some emphasizing that this city does not have to spend this year.\n\nThus gradually it was chosen to operate close to the philanthropy, which, like Aristotle wrote, \"to safeguard the oligarchs\" for the most important [...], magistrates must attach their public expenditure, so that people do not agree to participate and have the same indulgence to the judges that they must pay their judiciaries of a large sum. Therefore, \"at their facility, judges will make magnificent sacrifices, and build some monuments and the people, then taking part in the banquets and feasts, and seeing the city splendidly decorated temples and buildings, wish to maintain the constitution and it will be for the rich as many beautiful testimonies of items they made.\n\nHowever, until the middle of the 2nd century BC., the Greek philanthropy did not match the definition in Veyne. As demonstrated Philip Gauthier, this is a philanthropy that takes place most often \"exclusively in official and civil (judicial and official business)\". Moreover, in the 4th century BC and perhaps even the high Hellenistic period, the city did not create for his benefactors (benefactors) of separate status, superior to other citizens, and it recognizes their quality and not the title of benefactor. She thanked them and \"get up with his service as any other citizen, but with higher average\", the same way that voluntary contributions (epidoseis) enabled everyone, in proportion to his income, to demonstrate its commitment to the city by a gift of many talents or just a few pence.\n\nThe Euergetism, as they developed next to a liturgical system \"which is both a continuation and denial\", allowed the city to direct its service expenditures of the richest of its members with greater emphasis before the official honors due to them in thanks. The latter could thus be obtained, whenever necessary, that funding is assured for the most urgent of needs, without incurring unnecessary costs, and without giving the feeling of stress to members of its elite, which retain the ability to book their wealth to their personal use.\n\nThe gradual disappearance of the liturgies occurred in the shift of the vocabulary of the Hellenistic period: the name - and the verb - loses its meaning strictly \"expenditure imposed by the city\" to mean \"any part taken in an expenditure of public interest\", including in conjunction with a public office (Judicial or priesthood).\n\nThis dilution of the immune system in a Liturgy of Euergetism will be consumed as part of low Hellenistic period. Financing Cities can then be compared to that in force throughout the Roman Empire at that time, the full Euergetism analyzed by Veyne in his book \"Bread and Circuses\".\n\nHellenistic generosity is a social practice where rich people help out poor ones, and it appeared in the Hellenistic world for the first time. This soon became a moral obligation for the wealthy citizens when seeking high magistrate positions, such as consul or aedile. Hellenistic generosity not only benefited , but also public buildings and roads, which bore the inscription (, \"done with his own money\"), along with the name of the donator.\n\nFrom the 3rd century AD on, economic pressures made euergetism more difficult to practice. It eventually disappeared after Justinian's death and was replaced by the churches' redistribution action.\n\n\n"}

FPP works with forest peoples in South America, Africa, and Asia, to help them secure their rights, build up their own organisations and negotiate with governments and companies as to how economic development and conservation are best achieved on their lands.\n\nForests cover 31% of total land area of the planet. Of that, 12% are designated for the conservation of biological diversity and nearly all are inhabited. Many of the peoples, who live in and have customary rights to their forests, have developed ways of life and traditional knowledge that are attuned to their forest environments. Yet, forest policies commonly treat forests as empty lands controlled by the state and available for ‘development’ – colonisation, logging, plantations, dams, mines, oil wells, gas pipelines and agribusiness. These encroachments often force forest peoples out of their forest homes. Many conservation schemes to establish wilderness reserves also deny forest peoples’ rights.\n\nForest Peoples Programme (FPP) was founded in 1990 in response to the forest crisis, specifically to support indigenous forest peoples’ struggles to defend their lands and livelihoods. It registered as a non-governmental human rights Dutch Stichting in 1997, and then later, in 2000, as a UK charity, No. 1082158 and a company limited by guarantee (England & Wales) Reg. No. 3868836, with a registered office in the UK.\n\nFPP’s focus, in the beginning, came from the expertise and relationships that the small founding team had with specific communities, primarily in the Guyanas and in South and South East Asia. Forest Peoples Programme has grown into a respected and successful organisation that now operates right around the tropical forest belt where it serves to bridge the gap between policy makers and forest peoples. Through advocacy, practical projects and capacity building, FPP supports forest peoples to deal directly with the outside powers, regionally, nationally, and internationally that shape their lives and futures.

{"id": "43612230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43612230", "title": "Franklin Community", "text": "Franklin Community\n\nThe Franklin Community was the first American Owenite community established in New York state. Founded in 1826 two miles from the Hudson River near the town of Haverstraw in Rockland County, the enterprise stumbled in its first year of existence and was terminated later that same year.\n\nThe arrival of Welsh social reformer Robert Owen on American shores in the fall of 1824 was met with public curiosity and expectation. Owen's ideas about the relationship between human behavior and happiness and the material conditions of their existence were familiar to intellectuals in the United States from about 1817, when they were publicized in various British reviews. In response, those favoring the communitarian ideal had established an organization called the New York Society for Promoting Communities, a group headed by a Quaker apothecary named Cornelius C. Blatchly. It would be Blatchly and his associates who would welcome Owen to New York on November 4, 1824, presenting the visitor with a copy of the group's 1822 publication extracting Owen's writings, \"Essay on Common Wealths.\"\n\nA great popular interest surrounded Owen's arrival and subsequent announcement that he had purchased an entire established community in the state of Indiana from the Harmony Society for $140,000, with a view to establishing a model community to test his social theories in the crucible of practice. Despite — or perhaps due to — the distance between New York and the Owenite example on the American frontier in Indiana, interest grew in establishment parallel communities elsewhere.\n\nDespite the existence of the New York Society for Promoting Communities, it would not be the formal authority behind the creation of an Owenite colony; instead it would be a group of committed freethinkers from the New York City area, including atheist leader George Houston, who had previously suffered imprisonment in England for his anti-deist writings.\n\nIn the spring of 1826 the Franklin Community was founded, with a preparatory constitution approved in March and a site selected the following month. The site selected was located about two miles from the Hudson River near the town of Haverstraw in Rockland County, New York. Included were 120 or 130 acres of farmland, with a purchase price of $16,000 or $18,000 stipulated. The enterprise was named in honor of Benjamin Franklin (1709-1790), one of the founding fathers of the American republic.\n\nGeorge Houston was named secretary of the new Owenite community. Families began to move in immediately, beginning to farm the land early in May 1826. Many believed that their so-called \"sweat equity\" (to borrow a modern phrase) would be sufficient to attain membership in the community. Deprived of access to Robert Owen's purse, the fledgling community found it difficult to raise funds, only managing to raise the necessary one-third downpayment on June 23, 1826. A financial restructuring was required and the constitution was altered shortly thereafter to require a cash payment in exchange for community membership — a change which resulted in the great unhappiness of early participants, who felt themselves cheated and robbed of their pioneering labor.\n190 years later the house stands today in the town of Haverstraw on the outskirts of the village of West Haverstraw. An article exists in the local paper titled \"The short and unhappy life of a backwoods Utopia\" by Isabelle Savell\n\nAdding to the discord was the arrival of Houston and his atheist associates, who immediately set about secularizing the community's schools, encouraging Sunday labor in violation of Biblical precepts, and establishing a \"Church of Reason\" — backing their actions with anti-religious quotations from Robert Owen's written works.\n\nUnderfinanced and wracked with discord, the Franklin Community failed about five months after the launch of the venture.\n\nFormer secretary of the Franklin Community George Houston would found a new rationalist journal in January 1827, called \"The Correspondent.\" Houston would be joined in his editorial task by Abner Kneeland, whose subsequent trial for blasphemy would prove to be one of the landmark political events of the decade of the 1830s. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "14300289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14300289", "title": "Green job", "text": "Green job\n\nGreen jobs or green-collared jobs are, according to the United Nations Environment Program, \"work in agricultural, manufacturing, research and development (R&D), administrative, and service activities that contribute(s) substantially to preserving or restoring environmental quality. Specifically, but not exclusively, this includes jobs that help to protect ecosystems and biodiversity; reduce energy, materials, and water consumption through high efficiency strategies; de-carbonize the economy; and minimize or altogether avoid generation of all forms of waste and pollution.\" The environmental sector has the dual benefit of mitigating environmental challenges as well as helping economic growth.\n\nGreen jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, are classified as, \"jobs in business that produce goods or services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources\" or \"jobs in which workers' duties involve making their establishment's production processes more environmentally friendly or use fewer natural resources\". The Bureau of Labor Statistics categorizes Green Jobs into the following: Water conservation, Sustainable forestry, Biofuels, Geothermal energy, Environmental Remediation, Sustainability, Energy auditors, Recycling, Electric Vehicles, Solar power, and Wind energy.\n\nThese definitions include jobs which seek to use or develop renewable forms of energy (i.e. wind, hydropower, geothermal, wind, landfill gas and municipal solid waste) as well as increase their efficiency. Under the green jobs domain education, training, and public awareness are also included. These jobs seek to enforce regulations, support education, and increase public influence for the benefit of the environment.\n\nEco-innovation drives the creation of environmental jobs worldwide. Innovation simultaneously increases labor productivity and wages while increasing energy and environmental production efficiency.\n\nAccording to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in 2016, Brazil has 934,000 renewable energy jobs, making it the second highest in the world. Brazil is the global leader in liquid biofuels with a total of 845,000 jobs produced. Brazil has 41,000 jobs in solar, 36,000 jobs in wind, and 12,000 jobs in small hydro power. In 2011, green employment accounted for 3.1 million jobs or 2.4% of total employment in 2010 and 3.4 million jobs or 2.6% of total US employment\n\nThe Thought Leadership Series by the Copenhagen Climate Council published a report in 2009, stating that Japanese solar PV manufacturers represent 26% of the global market and that the solar industry is able to operate without dependence on subsidies. According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, Japanese Solar PV jobs increased by 28% in 2014. In 2016, Japan was listed as the third largest employer of solar PV jobs with 377,100 workers, based on direct and indirect labor. In terms of renewable energy, Japan employs 3,000 jobs in liquid biofuels, 5,000 jobs in wind power, 700 jobs in solar cooling and heating, and 2,000 jobs in geothermal energy.\nIn 2010 Green Goods and Services survey found there are 3.1 million Green Goods and Services (GGS) jobs in the United States which accounts for 2.4 percent of all United States salary and wage employment. The private sector had 2.3 million GGS jobs, and the public sector had 860,000 GGS jobs. From 2010 the data indicates that green jobs are continuing to grow rapidly in the United States. The US is currently undergoing an energy revolution from coal fire power plants to renewable energy. The majority of these additions are coming from three main resources: solar (9.5 GW), natural gas (8 GW), and wind (6.8 GW). Together, these three sources make up 93 percent of total additions. The shift from fossil fuels to renewables will be mirrored by US employment as workers turn away from jobs like coal mining and towards green jobs. This is made evident by a report published by the Bureau of Land Management published April 17, 2017 that states wind turbine service technicians are currently and projected to continue to be the fastest growing profession in the United States between 2017 and 2024 with projected growth of 108.0 percent\n\nPresident Reagan said,\"Trees cause more pollution than automobiles do.\" As governor of California, Reagan advocated on behalf of the environment; a large portion of Californian constituents were pro-environment. It states in the book The Enduring Wilderness, \"President Ronald Reagan signed more wilderness laws than any other president - forty-three laws designating 10.6 million acres of wilderness in thirty-one states.\" President Reagan also set a new precedent as president by leasing over twenty million acres of national land for coal, oil, and gas development.\n\nThe Business Energy Investment Tac credit is a United States federal policy introduced in 2005 under the Bush administration to promote the implementation of green energy sources through a 30% federal tax return in both residential and commercial projects. Individuals and companies were able to apply to the ITC to receive credits for investments in green energy technologies including solar, fuel cell and wind energy technology The ITC has been extended multiple times, most recently in 2015 through a multi-year extension that will maintain the 30% return up until 2019, afterward decreasing to 26% until 2020 and 22% until 2021. After 2021, commercial credits would reduce to 10% and 0% for residential projects. The Solar Energy Industries Association has attributed stability in the growth of solar energy industries in the U.S. to the implementation of the ITC since 2006 Since the implementation of the ITC, the U.S. solar industry has experienced growth in implementation of solar technology, mainly due to the rapidly decreasing overhead costs as the solar industry was spurred to production and development through the ITC. The solar industry is projected to employ over 420,000 individuals by 2020- nearly double of the 260,000 solar workers in 2016- and contribute $30 billion to the United States economy annually.\n\nPresident Obama campaigned under the promise of creating 5 million new green jobs in the United States. President Obamas plan included the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (ACES) proposed a cap and trade system which would bring in revenue that would used to invest in clean energy technology creating 5 million new jobs The bill was passed through the house but never made it to the senate floor and therefore was never written into law. Secondly, due to the 2013 Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act the federal government \"discontinued measuring all green jobs\" which makes tracking job growth extremely difficult.\n\nAlthough it is unclear if President Obama met his 5 million jobs goal, there was significant growth under his administration. As of March 2016 according to a nonpartisan group, Environmental Entrepreneurs, there were 2.5 million jobs in clean energy with 77,088 jobs solely in the wind industry. During this period of time employment in the solar field was also on the rise. According to the 2015 National Solar Census 2015 marked the third consecutive year in which solar growth was at 20 percent.\n\nAdditionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), passed in early 2009, includes provisions for new jobs in industries such as energy, utilities, construction, and manufacturing with a focus toward energy efficiency and more environmentally-friendly practices.\n\nIn March 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama appointed Van Jones as Special Advisor for Green Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Following Jones' resignation in September 2009, no further candidates appear to have been appointed to this position.\n\nOn January 23, 2017 President Trump signed an executive order, \"Presidential Memorandum Regarding the Hiring Freeze\", regarding a hiring freeze on government positions across the executive branch. Trump placed a hold on grants distributed through the EPA that could amount to $4 billion per year. The measure was recanted days later, but Trump has proclaimed his intent to “drastically cut the EPA.” Myron Ebell, a former member of the Trump transition team, when asked about United States Environmental Protection Agency cuts in an interview with Associated Press, responded \"Let's aim [to cut] for half and see how it works out, and then maybe we'll want to go further.\"\n\nIn the 2018 \"Make America Great Again Blueprint,\" the Trump administration projected EPA funding cuts of 31% and discontinued funding for the Clean Power Plan, international climate change programs, and climate change research and partnership programs.\n\nIn 2008 the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), and the International Employers Organization (IEO) jointly launched the Green Jobs Initiative. The purpose is to bring a just transition to a green economy by providing space for workers, employers, and governments to negotiate on policy effective in providing equitable opportunity to green jobs.\n\n$8 million was invested to produce and measure data on green-collar Jobs and green economic activity through the Department of Labor, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Federal agencies (Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy and Commerce, Employment and Training Administration). Methods on the approach target business that produce green goods and services and include special employer surveys, aggregate data gathering on employment and wages, and tabulations that distinguish between occupation and industry.\n\nData collection and upkeep on Green Goods and Services (GGS) jobs has been discontinued due to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act in 2013. All \"measuring green jobs\" programs in the US government were eliminated by this Act.\n\nThe Green Jobs Act of 2007 (H.R. 2847), introduced by Reps. Hilda Solis (D-CA) and John Tierney (D-MA), \"authorized up to $125 million in funding to establish national and state job training programs, administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, to help address job shortages that are impairing growth in green industries, such as energy efficient buildings and construction, renewable electric power, energy efficient vehicles, and biofuels development.\" The Energy Independence and Security Act passed in December 2007 incorporates the Green Jobs Act of 2007.\n\nPathways out of Poverty (POP) is a national workforce training program that was established on August 14, 2009 by the Obama administration and funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. POP targets individuals living below or near the poverty level to provide them with skills needed to enter the green job market, focusing on the energy efficiency and renewable energy industries. The training programs focus on teaching basic literacy and job readiness skills. Some of the programs also provide supportive assistance with childcare and transportation to overcome barriers to employment.\n\n(MTTP) provides job training opportunities specifically to low-income, job insecure 18-24 year-olds who have a high school degree or GED. In 2009, secure full-time salaries of twice the New York State minimum wage of $7.25 were provided to graduates of MTTP by a grant from the US Forest Service. Out of the 16 employed graduates that were interviewed for a study by USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, 75% were male, 25% were female, 81% were black, 19% were brown, 75% had a High School Diploma, 19% had a GED, and 6% went to some high school. Most employees with personal support who graduate from MTTP stay in their green job; not all employees have personal support networks.\n\nAccording to the Green Equity Toolkit by Race Forward, Green jobs are disproportionately occupied by white men. Historically, the environmental movement has been white, middle- and upper-class. In 1990, minorities consisted of 1.9 percent (14 out of the 745) of workers for four of the largest environmental organizations (Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, Audubon Society, and Sierra Club); out of sixty-three mainstream environmental organizations, 32 percent had no minorities staffed, 22 percent had no board members of color, 19 percent had no volunteers of color, 16 percent had no members of color. According to a journal in the Ecology Law Quarterly published in 1992, white people disproportionately occupy green jobs since said jobs address environmental concerns not confronted by low-income people and people of color. Environmental lawyers (who are disproportionately white, middle- and upper-class) focus on environmental issues based on aesthetics, recreation, and protecting natural lands outside of their communities; they often do not face environmental problems in their communities. Low-income communities and people of color who face environmental problems, such as pollution, do not often have access or will to seek green jobs due to the immediate health hazards in their communities. Instead of green jobs, they often engage in grassroots environmental activism to prevent mortality in their communities from toxicities, such as superfund sites, landfills, incinerators and other health hazards.\n\nA report published in 2014 titled, \"The State of Diversity in Environmental Organizations,\" states there has been increasing racial diversity over the past 50 years, but at a disproportionately slow rate. People of color consist of 38% of the US population and do not exceed 16% of the staff of the environmental organizations studied (191 conservation and preservation organizations, 74 government environmental agencies, 28 environmental grant-making foundations). Employed ethnic minorities disproportionately occupy lower-ranked positions in environmental organizations and fewer than 13% occupy leadership positions. A small number of environmental organizations have a diversity manager, diversity committee, or collaborate with low-income or ethnic organizations. Environmental organizations rarely recruit from minority-serving institutions, minority professional gatherings, and other pipelines with talented minorities. Minority interns to environmental organizations are hired less often than their white counterparts. Promotions often go to white females in environmental organizations.\n\nThe National Council for Workforce Education and AED published a report, Going Green: The Vital Role of Community Colleges in Building a Sustainable Future and a Green Workforce that examines how workforce education and community colleges contribute to the overall efforts in the move toward renewable and clean energy. The report gives examples of initiatives currently in effect nationally as well as offering information as to how to implement programs.\n\nIn response to high unemployment and a distressed economy workers need skills that are relevant to their specific geographical locations. \"Instead of making green jobs we need to make jobs green\" says Ken Warden, an administrator in workforce education.\n\nThere are a lot of solar industry jobs. The SEIA maintains a resource for those looking for solar jobs.\nA 2016 study indicates that the declining coal industry could protect their workers by retraining them for the solar industry. There are also some indications that the solar industry \"welcomes coal workers with open arms\".\n\n\n"}

Healthcare real estate or \"medical real estate\" describes buildings, offices, and campuses leased to members or organizations within the healthcare community. These buildings can be owned by hospitals, health systems or private or public third party groups. There is a rising trend among hospitals, health care systems, and medical practitioners to embrace third party ownership and management of real estate. By using third party developers, they can preserve their capital resources for acute care needs and focus their attention on helping people, while passing on responsibility of building regulation and maintenance minutiae.\n\nHealthcare facilities have detailed technological and regulatory requirements. Even such building maintenance tasks as cleaning, heating, and cooling are done differently in health care, with demanding sterilization and filtration needs. In addition to outsourcing building and management tasks, it's becoming increasingly attractive for hospitals to leave building ownership itself to someone else. The concept fits well with the current US development trend pairing not-for-profit hospitals with for-profit physician groups as partners in new specialty facilities. Illinois, Texas, California, and Florida accounted for a third of healthcare construction starts in 2007, though the practice of third party ownership is also rising among all metropolitan areas where space is at a premium.\n\nFrom an investor viewpoint, healthcare REITs as a group generally trade at a premium yield to other REIT categories. It is also considered one of the more stable sectors, along with higher education and government. During times of economic decline, health care real estate continues to grow.\n\nIn 2008, several factors converged to drive healthcare real estate:\n\n\nThere have been growth in medical office development through 2015.

{"id": "26282284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26282284", "title": "History of the Socialist Left Party", "text": "History of the Socialist Left Party\n\nThe Socialist Left Party of Norway ( or SV) was founded in 1975. Its history shows a long-term rise in political influence, resulting in part from its emergence from older left-wing parties, especially the Socialist People's Party. After initial political setbacks in the 1970s, the party reorganized and regained support, particularly under Theo Koritzinsky (1983–87) and Erik Solheim (1987–97). Support dropped in the 1997 parliamentary election but rose again by the 21st Century, thanks to the party's position as the only sizeable party to the left of the Norwegian Labour Party. Labour's move further to the right under Jens Stoltenberg also helped the party's rise. By 2005, the Socialist Left Party had joined the Labour and Centre parties in Norway's governing Red-Green Coalition. The party has been led by Audun Lysbakken since 11 March 2012.\n\nAfter losing all of its seats in the 1969 parliamentary election, the Socialist People's Party sought to create a coalition of various left-wing parties. Although previously sceptical about working with the Communist Party, it became a member of the coalition, along with the Democratic Socialists – AIK and various independent socialists. Reidar T. Larsen, then leader of the Communist Party, said that members at the party's national convention voted unanimously in favour of joining the coalition, which would later go by the name of the Socialist Electoral League.\n\nThe four leading members of the coalition were Finn Gustavsen, Berge Furre (both from the Socialist People's Party), Berit Ås (from AIK) and Larsen (from the Communist Party). Furre and Ås emphasized that the three parties were still operating independently in 1973, while Larsen was very pleased with the outcome, saying that the main object of the Communist Party was to \"unite all socialist parties\" in one joint cause. The coalition also stressed that they did not want to create a joint platform for the three parties, claiming it to be unimportant for their image. A meeting in September elected Gustavsen as parliamentary leader of the coalition, Roald Halvorsen from the Communist Party as general secretary, and Larsen and Ås to the group board. It was decided that Torild Skard would seek the position of President of the Storting. After the meeting, the party sought to build a closer relationship with the Labour Party and said they would support a Labour-run minority government.\n\nBy late 1975, most Communist Party members were against dissolving the party to join what would become the Socialist Left. Reidar T. Larsen, the party leader at the time, supported dissolving the party, while deputy leader Martin Gunnar Knutsen wanted it to continue. Signs before the election showed that the majority supported Knudsen. The media speculated that a faction led by Larsen would split from the party to join the ranks of the Socialist Left.\n\nIn the Oslo chapter of the coalition, the Communist Party wanted Arne Jørgensen, editor-in-chief of the Norwegian newspaper \"Friheten\", to get the top position on the election list for the 1975 local elections. However, most Socialist People's Party members in the Oslo chapter did not want him to top the list, because of his background in Norwegian local politics. Socialist People's Party members stated that they had nothing against nominating Communist Party members, pointing out that they had placed communist Karl Kromann in second place. Jørgensen lost the election for the first spot, instead obtaining 11th place on the list and eventually losing his nomination to Socialist People's Party official Fred Dunhaug. Parliamentary leader Finn Gustavsen officially endorsed Jørgensen's candidacy during the national convention in Trondheim, saying he did not want to \"split the coalition\", which would wreck his plan to unite the coalition into one political party. In May, the Oslo chapter of the coalition held an oral ballot for the top place on the election list, and Jørgensen received 189 votes against Dunhaug's 192. Because the margin was so small, they decided to hold a written ballot, and Dunhaug received 197 votes to Jørgensen's 196. After this result, twenty-one other communist candidates withdrew from their candidacy. This event damaged the unification process and internal conflict continued.\n\nAnother conflict between the Socialist People's Party and the Communist Party was the proposal to merge the two party papers, \"Friheten\" and \"Orientering\", into a new one. However, Larsen rejected this offer, preferring the two papers to continue even if the two parties merged. Berit Ås felt that the party leadership had weakened its position, saying that they had \"kicked the ball over to the communists\". After the Communist Party rejected the offer, \"Orientering\" was replaced by \"Ny Tid\".\n\nWhile it was always clear where Larsen stood in the unification process, ever since he became leader of the Communist Party in 1969, he had been able to maintain a strong following in the party. But his support started to waver when he wanted to put an end to the pro-Soviet line the party had held under the leadership of Emil Løvlien. Larsen had always held a vision of one single united left-wing party to the left of Labour, but this vision was not supported by the communist hardliners. In the aftermath of the Communist Party national convention, Larsen said that his speech was \"behind closed doors – and behind closed ears\". He suffered a clear defeat at the party conference, and he and his remaining supporters left the Communist Party to join the Socialist Left, newly founded by the Socialist People's Party and the AIK without the Communist Party. Because the policies of the Socialist Left were nearly identical to those of the Socialist People's Party, it has often been seen as the latter's direct successor.\n\nBerit Ås, a compromise candidate for the party leadership, was elected at the so-called unification congress. During the 1975 local elections she became the party's most influential figure. However, her campaigning and her debating skills were criticised both by the Norwegian press and within her own party. During the election campaign, Ås wanted to become the party's representative at the leader debates, a position held since the 1960s by Finn Gustavsen from the Socialist People's Party. The weekly newspaper \"Dag og Tid\" described Ås' performance at the leader debates as \"messy\".\n\nAt the party's first national convention in November 1975, it was decided to maintain \"a soft party line\" towards the remaining Communist Party members still active in the Socialist Left Party. However, they did urge them to leave the Communist Party. Rune Fredh, who had supported Larsen in the Communist Party, called the situation \"insane\". He still believed that Larsen and the remaining communists would continue to fight for communism in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.\n\nAfter experiencing what many observers called a bad election in 1976, a national convention was held early in 1976. During her short tenure, Ås lost all trust amongst party members. Several leading members were calling for Berge Furre to take over as party chairman. However, early in the nomination process, there were rumours that the party's AIK-Communist wing would establish a united front against former Socialist People's Party members. No factions or party notables supported Ås for reelection. It was decided at the convention that Socialist Left Party members could only be members of one party at the time, which meant that the remaining Communist Party members were forced to choose between the Socialist Left Party and the Communist Party. Larsen and Fredh, the Socialist Left Party Secretary, told delegates at the convention that \"from now on, the road the Communist Party is following is its own\". Furre was elected as party chairman at this convention, with little or no opposition.\n\nOn the election list for the 1977 election, Ås became the party's second candidate in Oslo for a seat in the Storting, having lost first place to Stein Ørnhøi. Because of the party's internal difficulties, its electoral base was greatly weakened in 1977: only one Socialist Left candidate from Oslo, and only two nationwide, won seats in the Storting.\n\nBerge Furre, previously known unofficially as the Socialist People's Party's \"crown prince\", became party chairman after the feud between Ås and Finn Gustavsen over who would represent the party during the 1975 local elections. Gustavsen resigned as parliamentary leader, as early signs indicated that he did not have the full support of the party's Election Committee. The party, which suffered several aftershocks after its founding, was severely disorganized. \"Verdens Gang\" speculated that the current leadership would be replaced by a troika consisting of Furre (from the Socialist People's Party) as party chairman, Larsen (from the Communist Party) as parliamentary leader and Ås (from the Democratic Socialists – AIK) as deputy leader.\n\nThe establishment of the Socialist Left Party had several destabilising effects, such as weakening the party's voter base. Several opinion polls indicated that many voters were leaving, or thinking of leaving, the party or voting for the Labour Party in the 1977 election. As the power struggle between the left- and right-wing factions worsened, Steinar Stjernø was accused of trying to expel the party's social democratic wing (the right-wing faction). However, Sternjø called the rumours absurd. The reason for the accusation was that Stjernø wanted to create a \"new and radical alternative for the Norwegian working class\". By the time of the national convention where Ås stepped down as party chairwoman, the party had not succeeded in making itself a viable option for the common voter. Furre told the convention's delegates that the party would be able to win over voters, and take several from the Labour Party, if and when the internal situation stabilised. Another difficulty for the party, according to Furre, was that Odvar Nordli's Cabinet was moving the Labour Party further to the centre. It caused some controversy that two of the newly elected Members of Parliament had been convicted of treason for collaborating with the Nazis during World War II.\n\nBelieving that the Labour Party had moved further to the political centre, Furre commented that the Socialist Left Party could only support a left-oriented minority government. Labour Party Secretary Ivar Leveraas responded negatively to Furre's comment, saying \"It isn't appropriate for the Labour Party to sit down together with the Socialist Left to discuss our political program and conditions for support, as Berge Furre requires.\"\n\nLate in 1977, it was known that both Furre and Finn Gustavsen had revealed classified information during an open meeting in the People's House of Oslo on 22 August 1977, after threatening to do so. When this became known, the parliament established a Committee to investigate them. Not knowing what to do, representatives from the Odelstinget voted to shelve the case. There were 44 for and 47 against prosecuting them. When the result was made official, the media speculated that it was some kind of \"punishment\" of the party, since the incident proved that the party was unable to protect valuable information which could have jeopardized Norway's security interests.\n\nAfter having what \"Verdens Gang\" described as a \"disastrous election\", in which the Socialist Left lost fourteen of their sixteen seats in the Storting, the party discussed changing its election platform. The platform, which had changed little since the 1973 election, was the centre of a power struggle, in which some Socialist Left Party members were calling for the removal of the peace paragraph (which called for the disbanding of the Norwegian military and the removal of foreign military bases located in Norway). Several leading party members opposed this paragraph. Furre and Gustavsen, both of whom came from the moderate camp, wanted to make the paragrah more moderate, and they succeeded at the 1977 national convention. In the aftermath of the election, Odvar Nordli, then the Labour Prime Minister, criticised the Socialist Left for being \"capitalists\" who supported right-wing policies, and further claimed that the Labour Party was the only remaining \"anti-capitalist\" alternative.\n\nIn the wake of the 1979 local elections, the internal struggle continued, and \"Verdens Gang\" claimed the situation inside the party was like a \"civil war\". When asked about the situation, Furre controversially claimed that there had never been so much stability within the party, considering that the \"main\" policy issues had been solved during the 1979 national convention. The party's electoral base became even smaller during the 1979 election, when it won 4.1% in the municipal and 4.4% in the county elections. At the national convention of 1983, the party was able to stabilise itself greatly. This national convention adopted socialism as the party's most important campaign promise during the election, with the majority of the delegates voting in favour. Hanna Kvanmo, parliamentary leader of the Socialist Left Party, claimed after the convention that, for the first time in the party's history, there was a \"consensus in most areas\". Furre was again reelected as party chairman, while Hilde Bojer and Torbjørn Dahl became the party's first and second deputy leader respectively. The Socialist Left Party was able to increase its voting share by 0.7 percentage points, from 4.2% to 4.9% nationwide, during the 1981 parliamentary election.\n\nBeginning in 1981, Party Secretary Erik Solheim became very critical of the party's left wing. He claimed that these radicals contributed nothing to the party and were more interested in being against everything than in supporting any policies. Writing for the party newspaper, \"Ny Tid\", Solheim criticised the party's support for what he claimed to be extreme progressive taxation, and said he wanted to give the party a new public image. He also accused the party of having become conservative – objecting to change, for example – and claimed that there had not been any major changes to the party's policies since its establishment in 1975. Many members supported Solheim's criticism, and it led to renewed conflict between the right- and left-wing factions of the party. Several leading party officials agreed with Solheim's criticism. Furre, for example, shared several of his views and told the press that the party had discussed the same old topics \"ad nauseam\" for several years.\n\nFurre announced his resignation as party chairman early in 1983. None of the leading party members of the time, most notably Hanna Kvanmo, Per Maurseth and Hilde Bojer, sought the party's chairmanship. Because of this Theo Koritzinsky was elected the party's new chairman at its 1983 national convention. The majority in the party's Election Committee had officially endorsed him beforehand.\n\nAt its 1983 national convention, the Socialist Left Party initiated an action plan that supported an increase in government spending on the elderly and addressed what they called \"serious issues with the welfare state\". Theo Koritzinsky wanted to increase the pension up to at least 40,000 and at most 50,000 Norwegian kroner. The action plan was heavily promoted, and Koritzinsky tried to collaborate with both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party to get it passed in the Storting. Another worry of Koritzinsky and the party was that, in their eyes, the public sector had begun to decay, which they feared would lead to increased unemployment within that sector.\n\nDuring his campaign, Koritzinsky made a habit of campaigning outside the major cities. In an interview with the Norwegian News Agency, he expressed amazement at the support he was able to gather, and even claimed \"renewed interest\" in the party. While disappointed with the initial results in the 1983 local elections, he was pleased with the overall outcome of both the Socialist Left Party and the Labour Party. However, he was worried about the increased interest in right-wing parties, especially the Progress Party.\n\nAfter the American invasion of Grenada, the party organised protests in Oslo against the war, during which Koritzinsky accused the political right of being slaves to the United States Government. Over 200,000 demonstrators attended the protests, and many Latin American interest groups were vocal in their support for the demonstrations. Koritzinsky criticised western diplomacy for condemning the Soviet Union, saying it was unfair that the First World only denounced military action when the Soviet Union or the communist bloc engaged in it, while remaining passive if the United States did so.\n\nAt the 1983 national convention, the majority of the delegates sought to collaborate with the Labour Party in the 1985 parliamentary elections. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Labour chairwoman at the time, told the press that she was considering a proposal by the Socialist Left Party that the two parties make joint lists during the elections. In another press conference, Koritzinsky told the press that he was worried that, if an election pact was not established between the two parties, the \"bourgeois right-wing parties\" would create their own, and maybe even win the election if the left did not respond properly.\nIn 1984, Koritzinsky wanted party members who were teachers to leave local trade unions for the much larger Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (NCTU). He was not the only one promoting this idea: the Labour and Communist parties had done so for years. While supporting his original goal of enlarging the NCTU, Koritzinsky also recognized that there existed good reasons for teachers to work in traditional organisations – before being elected party chairman he was a member of a local trade union himself. On another subject, Koritzinsky favored a referendum on the question of arming Norway with nuclear weapons, or letting foreign powers position nuclear weapons on Norwegian soil.\n\nWhen Stein Ørnhøi retired from active politics in 1984, Koritzinsky was seen as a likely candidate to replace him in the Storting, but it emerged that other party members were also interested in the Storting seat, most notably prominent Oslo city councillor Per Maurseth and veteran politician Finn Gustavsen. Early speculations were highly skeptical of Gustavsen's candidacy. The Socialist Left Party's Oslo nomination committee was split between Koritzinsky and Maurseth – they won 12 and 11 votes respectively, while Gustavsen won only one vote. As it turned out, Koritzinsky became the Socialist Left Party's first candidate for the Storting and Maurseth became the second, winning a contest against Kristin Halvorsen for second place. Gustavsen was not even on the list.\n\nAt the national convention of 1985, Koritzinsky told the delegates that\n\nThe voters accepted us as part of the labour movement a long time ago. This is proved by the fact that around one third of Labour voters consider the Socialist Left Party as their second voting preference. However, the Labour Party leadership has not accepted us a political force, and it is clear to us, and to them, that more voters will take us seriously if the Labour Party starts treating us with mutual respect. In it there is a political gain.\n\nKvanmo quickly corrected \"in it there is a political gain\" to \"it may be a political gain\". She further stated that the party's most realistic goal was not to collaborate with the Labour Party, but to increase the party's voter base to five or six percent. At the 1985 national convention, Koritzinsky wanted the party to promote itself as a \"red-green alternative\" to the Labour Party, an idea which had broad support within the Socialist Left. One month after the national convention, Koritzinsky visited West Germany with officials from the International Department of the Socialist Left Party to discuss green politics with members of the German Green Party.\n\nIn June 1985, the Socialist Left rejected an offer made jointly by the Communist Party, the Workers' Communist Party and the Red Electoral Alliance (the electoral organisation of the Workers' Communist Party) to establish an electoral coalition in the 1985 parliamentary elections. Instead, Koritzinsky continued with his plans to establish some sort of electoral collaboration with the Labour Party by encouraging all local party chapters to initiate formal contact with their Labour Party counterparts. However, the Labour Party still showed no great interest in a coalition; it neither accepted nor rejected Koritzinsky's offer. Koritzinsky vehemently opposed any notion that his party could collaborate with the Liberal Party, claiming that that party had chosen its own path – a path \"to suffer a slow and beautiful death in Norwegian politics\". Optimism within the party had been able to manifest itself in the weeks before the election, with Party Secretary Erik Solheim believing that the 1985 election could be the party's best election yet.\n\nWhen the results were announced, Christian Democratic Party chairman Kjell Magne Bondevik told the press: \"If the Labour Party had supported electoral reform, the socialists would have had a majority in the Storting\". In response to Bondevik's statement, Koritzinsky said; \"It is obvious that the lack of cooperation may have ruined the chances of a new socialist government\", further claiming that he and his party had been open to cooperation with both the Liberal Party and Labour Party all along. Odd Einar Dørum, a Liberal Party member, also criticised the Labour Party's unwillingness to collaborate with other parties. Although there was no socialist majority in parliament, most Socialist Left members were pleased with the outcome, increasing their vote from 4.9% to 5.4% nationwide and gaining two more seats in parliament.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, several key party members wanted to move the party closer to the centre of Norwegian politics and make it a viable and open social democratic alternative on the left. Many supported the idea and believed it would expand the party's electoral base. According to \"Aftenposten\", both Erik Solheim, leader of the party's right wing, and the ageing Finn Gustavsen, leader of its left wing, were likely candidates for the party chairmanship. On 27 August 1986, Koritzinsky announced in \"Dagbladet\" that he would step down as party chairman at the 1987 national convention. When asked why, he replied that he found it difficult to combine the chairmanship, his work in the Storting and the extensive travelling, which strained his family life. By August, Solheim and Tora Haug were the most likely candidates for the position, as Gustavsen had become editor-in-chief of \"Ny Tid\", the party's newspaper.\n\nDuring his tenure, Koritzinsky became a well-known and respected public figure, although several leading Socialist Left Party members were discontented with his leadership style, some even complaining that \"he was not clever enough\" to lead the party. In self-defense, Koritzinsky stated that he himself believed he had received criticism for his unusual working methods, explaining further that during his party chairmanship, he had been worried that leading members had concentrated much power in their own hands. At the 1986 national convention, the party again tried to improve its relations with the Labour Party, but this time, the Socialist Left Party would only collaborate with them if they moved more to the left. They were certain this could happen, considering that 39 percent of Labour Party members in a recent opinion poll said the Socialist Left Party was the second closest party to them in political views and policies.\n\nThe race between Solheim and Haug was close, so several members sought a compromise by trying to persuade Koritzinsky to extend his chairmanship two more years, until the next national convention. When this proved unfruitful, others tried to persuade Kvanmo to run for the chairmanship, but Kvanmo declined. On 2 March 1987 Solheim beat Haug and became the party's new chairman.\n\nIn spite of the belief expressed in the media that it would be close to impossible for the two parties to collaborate, the Socialist Left and the Labour Party managed to negotiate a tax settlement. This settlement was met with strong criticism from leading trade unionist Jan Davidsen of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, who claimed that higher taxes would help the municipalities and counties. The party later stated that the sitting government had weakened its position after handling Norway's national budget with the Progress Party.\n\n"}

It was created in 2013 by the Spanish Government, on the initiative of the European Union and to implement a constitutional mandate. Its aim is to guarantee the principle of budgetary stability, as well as the country's financial sustainability.\nIndependent fiscal control bodies began to be formed in other countries in the mid-20th century. The first was established in the Netherlands in 1947, followed by Denmark, Germany, US, Belgium, Austria, Korea, Sweden and Canada.\n\nThe creation of such an authority in Spain formed part of the Spanish Strategy for Economic Policy, approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers in September 2012, with the intention of ensuring compliance with legal requirements on budgetary stability. On 14 November 2013, the Government of Spain published Organic Law 6/2013, creating the Independent Authority of Spanish Fiscal Responsibility (AIReF). AIReF was set up with the appointment of José Luis Escrivá as its president in February 2014, having been accepted by the Congressional Commission of Inland Revenue and Public Administration. In March 2014 the Organic Law was approved and in the second quarter the rest of the Managerial Committee was created, comprising the president and the directors of the three divisions that make up the AIReF, with the assistance of the Director of the Spanish President's Cabinet. The Managerial Committee first met in June 2014, a date that may be considered as the start of the institution's activities. All the records of the Committee are published. The Action Plan for 2014 was approved in July that year, and early in 2015 the Strategic Plan 2015–2020 was also approved.\n\nOn 18 April 2016 AIReF issued a communiqué expressing concern over the absence of data needed to prepare its annual report on macroeconomic forecasts.\n\nSome of AIReF's main aims are:\n\nThe structure and activities of AIReF are regulated under the Organic Statute of the Independent Authority of Fiscal Responsibility, collected in the Royal Decree 215/2014, of 28 March 2014. This regulates among other things data analysis, publication, the functions of the president, and the control of the institution's own expenditure. AIReF comprises the president's office and three divisions—Budgetary Analysis, Economic Analysis and Legal Affairs.\n\nUnder the founding statute, the president may be advised by professionals in relevant fields, for which purpose an Advisory Board has been formed. The president may attend the Managerial Committees.\n\nAIReF is part of a network of Independent Fiscal Institutions (IFI's) in other European countries. This network has set up a Committee for European Affairs, with the aim of constructing a Europe-wide platform to help the IFI's carry out their functions effectively, in particular those arising from the fiscal framework of the European Union.\n\n"}

The uprising was part of the Time of Troubles in Russia.\n\nLittle information is available about Ivan Bolotnikov’s life before the uprising. It is known that he was a kholop and belonged to the household of Prince Andrei Telyatevsky. It appears that Bolotnikov fled from his master’s estate, then was captured by the Crimean Tatars, and sold to the Turks as a galley slave. He somehow managed to escape from his owners, reached Venice, and then was captured in Poland en route to Russia by the associates of Mikhail Molchanov (one of the assassins of Feodor Godunov, who had successfully fled from Moscow and was again contemplating the second coming of False Dmitry). \n\nMolchanov sent Ivan Bolotnikov to the town of Putyvl to meet a voyevoda named Grigory Shakhovskoy. The latter received him as the new tsar’s envoy and put him in charge of a Cossack unit. Ivan Bolotnikov used this opportunity to muster a small army of runaway kholops, peasants, outlaws, and vagabonds, disgruntled with social and economic situation in Russia. He promised them to exterminate the ruling class and establish a new social system. By the order of Grigory Shakhovskoy, Bolotnikov and his army advanced to Kromy (today’s Oryol Oblast) in August 1606, defeating the Muscovite army under the command of Prince Yury Trubetskoy. From there, he moved towards Serpukhov and ravaged the city. \n\nAt the time there were several other rebellions taking place across Russia, the participants of which would join Ivan Bolotnikov’s army. Most of the insurgents (Cossacks, gentry, service class people, and even boyar children) organized themselves into three main groups under the command of Grigory Sumbulov, Prokopy Lyapunov, and Istoma Pashkov. All these rebels united and besieged Moscow, settling in a village of Zagorye on October 12, 1606. The consensus among these rebellious groups, however, did not last long. Soon, the noblemen realized that most of Ivan Bolotnikov’s plans had really been aimed against them, so they figured it would be much safer to return their support to Vasili Shuisky.\n\nOn November 15, Sumbulov and Lyapunov left Zagorye and gave themselves up to the authorities, asking the tsar for forgiveness. Now that Bolotnikov’s army had lost some of its men, Vasili Shuisky decided to make his move. On December 2, Prince Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky (tsar’s cousin) attacked the enemy near Kolomenskoye. During the battle, Istoma Pashkov and his men decided to switch camps and joined the Muscovite army. Left all by himself, Ivan Bolotnikov suffered a defeat and fled to Kaluga. Vasili Shuisky’s commanders Fyodor Mstislavsky and Ivan Shuisky laid siege to the city, but Bolotnikov and his Cossacks managed to repel their attacks until the end of winter.\n\nIn the spring of 1607, another imposter by the name of False Peter (also known as Ileyka Muromets; he claimed to be the son of Feodor I of Russia) came to Tula with a whole mob of robbers to meet with Prince Grigory Shakhovskoy. Immediately after this, the latter dispatched Prince Andrei Telyatevsky and his men to help out Ivan Bolotnikov, forcing Prince Mstislavsky to lift the siege of Kaluga. Bolotnikov moved to Tula. Thus, all the rebels met together in one place, their joint forces numbering some 30,000 people. It was then that Vasili Shuisky decided to attack all of them at once and left Moscow on May 21, 1607. He besieged Tula, but the insurgents managed to hold out until October despite deprivations and hunger. Bolotnikov sent letters to False Dmitry II in Starodub asking for help, but to no avail. \n\nFinally, Bolotnikov decided to negotiate his surrender. The tsar promised to pardon the insurgents in return for Tula. On October 10, the rebels surrendered to the authorities. Shuisky, however, did not keep his promise. Instead, he transported all of the rebel leaders to Moscow on October 30, and then executed each of them in a different way. Ivan Bolotnikov was transported to Kargopol, blinded and then drowned.\n"}
{"id": "408945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=408945", "title": "Jamaica Labour Party", "text": "Jamaica Labour Party\n\nThe Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) is one of the two major political parties in Jamaica, the other being the People's National Party (PNP). While its name suggests that it is a social democratic party, the JLP is actually a conservative party. However, it has longstanding ties to the Jamaican labour movement.\n\nIt is the current governing party, having won 32 of the 63 parliamentary seats in the lower house of parliament (House of Representatives) in the 2016 general elections. The JLP gained another seat in the November 2017 St Mary South East By-Election, increasing its majority to 33 to the PNP's 30.\n\nIn the November 2016 Local Government Elections, the party won eight of the fourteen municipal corporations (Kingston & St. Andrew, Clarendon, St. Elizabeth, St. James, Trelawny, St. Ann, St. Mary and Portland). With a 5-5 tie in the St. Thomas Municipal Corporation and with the JLP winning the popular vote in St. Thomas, the JLP gets control and therefore the mayorship and the PNP gets the deputy mayorship.\n\nThe JLP uses the Liberty Bell, the victory sign, and the colour green as electoral symbols. The JLP is a member of the Caribbean Democrat Union.\n\nThe party was founded on 8 July 1943 by Alexander Bustamante as the political wing of the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union. Bustamante had previously been a member of the PNP.\n\nIt won the 1944 general elections with 22 of the 32 seats. It went on to win the 1949 elections with a reduced majority, before losing power to the PNP in the 1955 elections. It remained in opposition following the 1959 elections, but was victorious in 1962 and was therefore the Government when Jamaica gained its political independence from Great Britain on 6 August 1962.\n\nBustamante suffered a stroke in 1964 and largely withdrew from politics. However, he did not relinquish the title of party leader for another decade. Donald Sangster took over as acting prime minister after Bustamante's stroke. He was named First Deputy Leader in 1967, and led the party to victory as of the 21 February 1967 elections. Sangster suffered a brain hemorrhage and died about six weeks after the elections, while he was preparing for his budget presentation.\n\nHugh Shearer succeeded Sangster as First Deputy Leader and Prime Minister, defeating David Clement (DC) Tavares by two votes in a run-off by of the JLP parliamentarians. Tavares had come out on top in the first ballot, with Shearer and Robert Lightbourne being the other candidates. Under Shearer, the JLP lost power for the first time to the People's National Party and Michael Manley in 1972. Shearer served as Opposition Leader until 1974.\n\nBustamante finally gave up the post of party leader in 1974, and Edward Seaga was elected his successor. The party lost the 1976 elections, but Seaga became Prime Minister after victory in 1980 when the party won by a landslide, capturing 51 of the then 60 parliamentary seats. In 1983 with the JLP achieving a spike in popularity, in part because of Seaga's support of the US-led military invasion of Grenada, Seaga called early elections and won all sixty seats, the majority by acclamation, mainly because the opposition PNP boycotted those elections. The JLP suffered defeat in the 1989 elections and went on to lose elections in 1993, 1997 and 2002, all under the continued leadership of Seaga.\n\nIn 2005 Bruce Golding succeeded Seaga as leader of the party, and led it to victory in the 2007 elections. Golding resigned as head of the party and Prime Minister in October 2011 and was succeeded by current leader Andrew Holness. Soon after becoming leader, Holness called an election over a year before it was constitutionally due, and the party lost by a 2:1 margin to the PNP. Holness was not blamed for the defeat, and continued to lead the party as Opposition Leader\n\nThe party held a leadership election on 10 November 2013 where Holness was challenged by his deputy, Shadow Minister for Finance Audley Shaw. Holness defeated Shaw by a margin of 2,704 votes to Shaw's 2,012.\n\nHolness went on to lead the JLP to a one-seat parliamentary majority (32-31) in the February 25, 2016 general elections, reducing the PNP to the opposition benches after one term.\n\nThe JLP is a conservative party. It believes in a market-driven economy and individual personal responsibility.\n\nIn May 2008, in an interview with Stephen Sackur of the BBC, Bruce Golding PM and Party Leader declared that any cabinet formed by him would exclude any MP known to be gay. In previous statements, Golding stated that he and his party strongly opposed public displays of homosexuality in Jamaica and that he felt that they should continue to be illegal in keeping with Jamaican societal norms. He justified the illegality of homosexual acts by referring to Christian values and the integrity of the family.\n\n\n"}

Rapping is an American criminal defense attorney, founder and president of Gideon's Promise, and professor of law at Atlanta's John Marshall Law School and Harvard Law School. Rapping received the MacArthur \"Genius\" Award in 2014.\n\nRapping regularly writes about issues related to criminal defense and the criminal justice system. He is a contributor for The Nation, Talk Poverty, The National Association For Public Defense, and The Huffington Post. He also maintains a blog called Fulfilling the Promise: Insights to Forging a Path to Meaningful Justice Reform.\n\nRapping grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a young age, Rapping went to demonstrations and protests with his mother, Elayne Rapping, a community organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women's movements. The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about social justice, and trying to change things in the world that aren't fair or right. Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired the lawyers who worked to keep them out of jail. After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.\n\nRapping attended Allderdice High School in Squirrel Hill, and graduated in 1984. After high school, Rapping attended the University of Chicago where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics \"cum laude\". People close to Rapping convinced him that he would incur tremendous debt if he went to law school, so he worked as a research assistant with the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. for two years, following in the footsteps of his father, Leonard Rapping, a well-known economist. Rapping earned a scholarship to attend the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University where he earned a Master of Public Administration in 1992. Rapping's sister, Alison Rapping has spent her career in the non-profit sector, and is widely considered a leader in that realm. Both siblings attribute their commitment to social justice to the influence of their parents.\n\nRight after graduating from Princeton and still unfulfilled, Rapping decided to attend George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C. After his first year of law school at GWU, Rapping interned with the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, where he found his calling. He worked at PDS throughout law school.\n\nWhile living in Washington, Rapping met and married his wife, Ilham Askia, who was teaching at an elementary school and then spent two years at a charter high school for court involved children. Askia was born in Buffalo, New York and every man in her family has been a victim of the criminal justice system. Askia's father went to Attica Correctional Facility when she was five years old. She helped raise her younger brother who ended up in prison. Askia became a teacher to break the school-to-prison pipeline, but soon questioned how much of a difference she could make on the front end. This led to her joining Rapping to start Gideon's Promise and, ultimately, to become the organization's Executive Director, where she advocates for attacking the pipeline on the back end.\n\nAfter law school, Rapping worked as a staff attorney for The Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia (1995–2004), where he served his final three years as training director. From 2004-2006, Rapping was the training director for the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council.\n\nFrom 2006-2007, he served as training chief for the New Orleans Office of the Public Defender. In recognition of his work in New Orleans to rebuild the public defender system post-Hurricane Katrina, he was a co-recipient of the Lincoln Leadership Award, given by Kentucky's Department of Public Advocacy to honor leadership in national efforts to improve indigent defense.\n\nIn 2007, Rapping created the Southern Public Defender Training Center, subsequently renamed Gideon's Promise, along with his wife, Ilham Askia. Named after the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case Gideon v. Wainwright, Gideon's Promise teaches public defenders to work more effectively within the judicial system by providing coaching, training, and professional development as well as a supportive network of peers and mentors from around the country. Rapping received a grant to help start the center from George Soros' Open Society Foundations.\n\nSince its founding, the organization has grown from a single training program for sixteen attorneys in two offices in Georgia and Louisiana, to a multi-tiered enterprise with over 300 participants in more than 35 offices across 15 mostly Southern states. An initial three-year \"Core\" program for new public defenders has since expanded into a comprehensive model that includes programs for graduates of the initial Core program as they continue their development, public defender leaders, trainers and supervisors, and law students. Further, the organization is unique in that it intervenes at the trial stage, rather than after conviction, where challenges to criminal injustice often take place.\n\nIn 2013, HBO Films produced a documentary called Gideon's Army, based in part on the Gideon's Promise program and highlighting participants in the program.\n\nGideon's Promise has won numerous awards including Emory University's 2014 Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Service Award, the Southern Center for Human Rights' 2013 Gideon's Promise Award, The National Association of Sentencing Advocates and Mitigation Specialists 2013 Sentencing Project Award, and the American College of Trail Lawyers' 2011 Emil Gumpert Award.\n\nIn 2014, Rapping became the Director of Strategic Planning and Organizational Development for the Maryland Office of the Public Defender. In 2014, Rapping earned a MacArthur Foundation \"Genius Fellow.\"\n\nSince 2007, Rapping has also been an associate professor at Atlanta's John Marshall Law School. In 2015 he was promoted to full Professor. Rapping is also a visiting associate professor of law at Harvard Law School. In 2009, Rapping was selected as one of Harvard Law School's Wasserstein Public Interest Fellows in recognition of his contribution to the public interest legal arena. In 2013, Rapping was the Public Interest Scholar in Residence at Touro Law School.\n\nRapping has been a leading voice in discussing how culture shapes our criminal justice system. He has written and talked extensively about the culture of criminal justice, has theorized how criminal justice reform can be accomplished through cultural transformation, and through his work with Gideon's Promise, has applied his ideas to build a movement of public defenders to drive criminal justice reform. He is a thought leader in articulating the critical role public defenders must play in any comprehensive criminal justice reform strategy. His work in this area earned him a 2014 MacArthur \"Genius\" grant.\n\nRapping first applied organizational culture theory to indigent defense reform in his 2007 article, Directing the Winds of Change. In 2009, he laid out a vision for how to put this theory to practice in describing the work of the Southern Public Defender Training Center (the precursor to Gideon's Promise) in You Can't Build on Shaky Ground. He made the case that supporting public defenders in their quest to drive cultural transformation should be a priority of the United States federal government in National Crisis, National Neglect. And in 2012—applying his work to prosecutors in Who's Guarding the Henhouse—he examined how prosecutors too have been shaped by the existing criminal justice culture and, as a result, help perpetuate injustice.\n\nBelieving that well-intentioned professionals are shaped by a criminal justice system that has become unmoored from is foundational values, Rapping's vision involves supporting defenders as they struggle to resist the pressure to adapt to the status quo. This vision is best articulated in his article \"Redefining Success as a Public Defender\" and in a speech he delivered at Touro Law School.\n\nHe has examined how the American story of justice has evolved to a narrative that would be unrecognizable to our founding fathers in \"Reviving the Hero Image of the Public Defender.\" He has analyzed how defenders can combat the pernicious role of race in driving this culture in \"Implicitly Unjust.\" And in \"Retuning Gideon's Trumpet,\" he answers skeptics who believe public defenders are only important to individuals and play no role in driving systemic reform.\n\nRapping frequently addresses criminal justice issues of the day by promoting a narrative in which a movement of public defenders, serving as the voice for the vast majority of people in the criminal justice system, serve as the catalyst for reform. As the nation grappled with a seeming epidemic of police killings of young black men like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice, Rapping urged that we not see that issue as disconnected from \"routine injustice\" destroying poor communities of color every day. In \"It's Not Just the Cops\" and \"From Ferguson to Staten Island: In Case Anyone Doubted the Public Needs Defending,\" he argues that public defenders are a necessary component to a comprehensive strategy to realize equal justice that is illusive throughout the criminal justice system. In \"The Other Baltimore Story,\" he makes a similar argument as the nation focused its attention on the killing of Freddy Gray by reminding us of the routine injustice in Baltimore through the story of Ronald Hammond, and the response of public defenders.\n\nIn articles like \"Continuing the March of Civil Rights Warriors in Selma,\" \"One of the Most Important Civil and Human Rights Battles of Our Time,\" and \"Redefining Success as a Public Defender,\" Rapping makes the case that criminal justice is the civil rights struggle of this generation and that public defenders are on the front lines of that battle.\n\nHe routinely tips his hat to the men and women who represent poor people accused of crimes, particularly in essays like \"Reviving the Hero Image of the Public Defender By Changing the Story of Our Clients,\" \"To All the Patriots Out There, and Especially Our Public Defenders,\" and \"Gideon's Orchestra: It's Time For the Encore.\" And in pieces like \"The Special Few\" and \"Who Will Heal the Public Defenders,\" he explains the emotional toll that makes this work so difficult.\n\nRapping's 2015 TEDx Atlanta talk is a powerful articulation of the critical role of culture in shaping our criminal justice system and the importance of a public defender movement to transforming it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28869050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28869050", "title": "Land titling", "text": "Land titling\n\nLand titling is a form of land reform in which private individuals and families are given formal property rights for land which they have previously occupied informally or used on the basis of customary land tenure. Proponents argue that providing formal titles increases security of land tenure, supports development of markets in land, and allows better access to credit (using land titles as collateral). Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto Polar is the most well-known advocate of the approach, but it has a long history. Recently, \"inspired by these ideas, and fostered by international development agencies, land titling programs have been launched throughout developing and transition economies as part of poverty alleviation efforts.\" The goals of poverty alleviation and urban management, however, can lead to conflicts in the design of land titling programs. \n\nResearch in China by Landesa and others has found that more than 40% of farmers lack written documentation to confirm their land rights, and that local governments can frequently take away or sell off their land rights. Where policy reforms have been implemented, the organizations report, farmers invest in and benefit from their land, and they estimate that secure land rights represent the equivalent of $1.2 trillion in farmers' hands. UN Habitat launched a \"Global Campaign for Secure Tenure\".\n\nEvidence on the effectiveness of land titling for poverty reduction and economic development is mixed, with the key issue being the impact of titling on the security of land tenure, which varies. Particularly where customary land is involved, the introduction of formal land registration may have unpredictable effects, with the efficiency and marketisation of existing forms of land tenure underestimated, and the costs of formal registration underestimated and the security of formal land title overestimated. In many countries, recipients of formal title have later found that their titles did not give them the expected security in the face of market or state requirements to obtain their land. Some studies have found positive outcomes, albeit less strong than expected; one recent study on land titling in Argentina found that \"entitling the poor increases their investment both in the houses and in the human capital of their children.\" \n\nThe way in which land titling is carried out may raise gender issues. While titling was expected to promote long term investments and ensure the transfer of land from less efficient to more efficient users, studies assessing the impact of tenure reform in Africa often found few significant effects of privatisation on production and, in some cases, even negative effects (Bruce and Migot Adholla 1994). The impacts of privatisation of pastoral rangelands on production have been particularly contentious (Rutten 1992, Peters 1994, Pinckney and Kimuyu 1994, Archambault 2007)\n\nJoint titling successes happen, though most have not been complete successes, even when significant reforms have taken place. Despite Tanzanian legislation providing women the right to land and implementing default joint-titling, there has been little work on\nthe ground to ensure this is implemented. In India, even with political support for joint-titling policy, institutional backing from local land authority's is needed to make progress. As each reform is important for establishing joint-titling regimes, they are worth considering independently, even if they ultimately failed \n"}
{"id": "42280431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42280431", "title": "Leftist errors (Yugoslavia)", "text": "Leftist errors (Yugoslavia)\n\nLeftist errors () was a term used by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) to describe radical policies and strategies – described as the Red Terror by others – pursued by self-described left-wing elements among the party and partisan units during World War II, mostly in Montenegro, Herzegovina and Serbia, as well as to a lesser extent in Croatia and Slovenia. From 1941-42, these areas saw mass executions, burning of villages and confiscation of property, motivated both by partisan fears of a \"fifth column\" and class conflict. As a result of these actions by the communists, many villagers from Eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, who were far from being collaborators or kulaks, joined Chetnik forces en masse. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia condemned actions undertaken during the period and punished several local commanders.\n\nThis policy was also referred to as Leftist deviation or Left-wing deviation, Left Errors or sectarian deviations. In Titoist dogma after World War II this policy was referred to as the \"Mistakes of the left\" or \"left deviations\" while the others referred to it as \"Red Terror\". This policy is sometimes referred to as the \"Second Stage\". Karl Marx believed that revolution has two stages: bourgeois-democratic and proletarian. He believed that in the second stage the proletarian revolution has to turn against its allies from the first stage.\n\nTito was the main protagonist of the leftist deviations. Tito was well known as leftist who was against any arrangements with non-communists. His formal appointment as general secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) was confirmed in October 1940 during the Fifth Land Conference of the CPY in Zagreb. At this conference Tito formulated the leftist strategy of the CPY as focused on revolutionary seizure of power in the country in order to organize Soviet-style administrative organization in Yugoslavia.\n\nIn July 1941, after the beginning of the Second World War, the Communist Politburo adopted the strategy which insisted that the Partisans should aim to create \"liberated territories\", cleared of enemies. According to the instructions of the Poliburo, such territories were to be administered by the communists in a state-like manner so the local population would be exposed to the ideas and practice of the socialism. On the territories that came under their control the communists adopted many leftist policies including radical socialism. This antagonized many peasants in Serbia, Montenegro and Herzegovina. Laziness was punished as desertion, peasants were punished with high taxes or forced labor if their houses were not tidy or if they got lice. The Yugoslav communists suspended the instructions not to reach the second stage (the revolution) given by the Comintern in June 1941. Because they ignored instructions from Moscow the leadership of CPY could not find a modus vivendi with other resistance movement, the Chetniks of Mihajlović, because they could put in danger communist revolutionary action. That is why Tito rejected Soviet pleas to cooperate with Chetniks and insisted on carrying on with the communist revolution.\n\nIn June 1941 the Regional Committee of CPY for Montenegro, Boka and Sandžak issued a proclamation inviting people to \"final liquidation of capitalist system\".\nLeftist errors policy was pursued in Montenegro since August while its intensity was increased since September 1941. This extremist policy was pursued by the Partisans in Montenegro under the influence of Milovan Đilas and Moša Pijade. After the initial success of the Uprising in Montenegro communists seized control of almost all the territory of Montenegro and began to fight against their class enemies. The substantial percentage of population of Montenegro supported Chetniks because they were afraid of the \"red terror\". Despite instructions to minimize the revolutionary side of their policies, the leaders of Montenegrin Partisans introduced \"Soviet elements\" in the summer of 1941, during the Uprising in Montenegro, because they perceived the uprising as the first stage of the communist revolution.\n\nIn mid-August 1941, Đilas wrote a letter to the Regional Committee of Yugoslav Communist Party for Montenegro, Boka and Sandžak and recommended an isolation and destruction of the fifth column. He emphasized that tolerance and inactivity of communists toward spies is a crime equal to treason. At the end of August 1941 the Regional Committee issued a directive which follows the recommendations of Đilas and insists on cleansing of the villages from the fifth column. In another directive issued in October the Regional Committee repeated similar instructions insisting on the destruction of those who disturb the mobilization of insurgents even by saying \"wait, it's not the right moment yet\". Đilas himself wrote how retreating Partisans, who only punished their opponents in July, arbitrarily executed them following the Italian counteroffensive of August 1941.\n\nFrom September 1941 onward, Communist Party program documents began to mention courts authorized to prescribe the death penalties. This immediately came to life in practice. Since October 1941, the headquarters of Partisan forces in Montenegro, Boka and Sandžak published lists of executed \"enemies of the people, including spies and traitors\" with a note - \"to be continued...\". During the first year the victims included women who \"flirted\" with Italians. Most of the people killed by the communists in 1941 were military and administrative officers of former Kingdom of Yugoslavia before the war. According to Croatian nationalist Jozo Tomasevich, during the period of \"leftist deviation\" from circa December 1941 through May 1942, the Partisans, especially in Herzegovina and Montenegro, used terror against people who were not collaborating, but were potential class enemies.\n\nThe Partisans occupied Kolašin in January and February 1942, and turned against all real and potential opposition, killing about 300 people and throwing their mangled corpses into pits they called the \"dogs' cemetery\". Due to this and other examples of communist terror, a part of Montenegrin population turned against the Partisans. According to \"Zbornik za istoriju\", \"[a] land without Chetniks was suddenly overwhelmed by Chetniks\", largely due to the policies of Left Deviations. Communist executions of notable tribal chieftains in Montenegro caused additional animosity of middle class peasants towards communists. Đurišić soon recaptured Kolašin and held it as a Chetnik bastion until May 1943. His rule was marked by terrorizing Partisan supporters. A large number of captured Partisans and sympathizers were executed in following weeks, including lieutenant colonel Radisav Radević, major Batrić Zečević, captains Đuro Radosavljević, Mileta Lakićević and Tomica Jojić, and former member of Yugoslav Parliament Blagota Selić, none of which were members of the Communist Party. Đurišić formed a Chetnik prison in Kolašin, in which some 2,000 opponents were incarcerated and/or tortured. Many were handed over to the Italians.\n\nIn March 1942, communists from Nikšić burned the villages of Ozrinići and Zagarač. According to some sources this was ordered by Đilas and Sava Kovačević. Between the onset of the Uprising in Montenegro and the middle of 1942, communists killed between 500 and 624 people in Montenegro, most of them during armed conflict.\n\nIn September 1941, Serb Partisans established the Republic of Užice, a short-lived military mini-state with its administrative center in Užice. At the end of November 1941 Partisans were defeated and had to retreat from Serbia. The policy of leftist errors pursued by Josip Broz Tito substantially contributed to Partisan defeat in the Republic of Užice. Because of the repression of the communists and their intention to carry on with communist revolution the population of Serbia also turned against the uprising and communist insurgents. At the beginning of December 1941 the communists moved from Serbia to Bosnia (nominally NDH) and joined their comrades who had already left Montenegro.\n\nIn January and February 1942 alone, Partisans executed 250 people in Eastern Herzegovina because they were accused of belonging to \"fifth column\". In Herzegovina alone the total number of civilians murdered by communists in 1941–42 was probably around 500. \n\nOwing to \"leftist errors\" the Partisans were chased out of Herzegovina during the summer of 1942, not by the Axis forces but by its population.\n\nThe policy of leftist deviation proved counterproductive.\nLeftist deviation gave a real meaningful sense to the policy of those nationalists who found a way out of the difficult situation in collaboration with occupying and quisling forces. \"Red terror\" antagonized most of the peasantry and angered the Soviet Union. As a result of the communist actions, villagers from Eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, who were far from being collaborators or kulaks, joined Chetnik forces en masse.\n\nThe songs and mottoes were composed to promote the policy of leftist deviations. The verse of one of them was: \"Partisans, prepare machine guns, to greet the king and Englishmen\"(). The Partisan slogan \"Death to fascism, freedom to the people\", a new greeting \"Red Army is with us – the victory is ours!\"\n\nMajor exponents of this policy included Milovan Đilas, Ivan Milutinović and Boris Kidrič. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia later publicly condemned this policy and punished (by warning them) several local commanders (Petar Drapšin and Miro Popara in Herzegovina and several Montenegrin party leaders). Petar Drapšin was stripped of his rank, removed from all functions in the communist party and its membership. Moša Pijade was held responsible for the adoption of brutal extremist policy of the CPY.\n\nIn November 1941, Tito dismissed Milovan Đilas from the command of Partisan forces in Montenegro because of his mistakes during the uprising, including his \"Leftist Errors\". \n\nTito claimed Đilas made mistakes because he organized a frontal struggle of armies against a much stronger enemy instead of connecting the Partisan struggle with the people's uprising and adopting the partisan methods of resistance. Đilas was appointed as editor of the paper \"Borba\", the Party's main propaganda organ. While Tito repeatedly accused other communist officials from Montenegro for \"sectarianism\", Edvard Kardelj admitted to Đilas that \"grave sectarian errors were made in Serbia in 1941\" (under Tito's administration).\n\n\n\n"}

The bill was presented by the French Ministry of Higher Education Valérie Pécresse and was officially voted on 11 August 2007 by the Parliament. The law is commonly referred to as the law LRU (after the acronym of the official name), or Law Pécresse. It is sometimes called the law on the autonomy of universities, because the law give universities more financial autonomy, so that the government will stop funding them.\n\nThe text of the bill consists of six titles. The first title recall public service and higher education's mission. The second title is about the management of universities. The third deals with the new responsibilities for universities. The three other titles give additional details about the reform.\n\nThe bill was rapidly voted by the Parliament in July 2007, and definitively adopted on 1 August 2007, less than three months after Nicolas Sarkozy's election. The university student, in holidays during the vote of the law, began to express their discontentment in October 2007.\n\nUniversity Reforms had been promised by French President Nicolas Sarkozy before the 2007 Presidential Elections. Prime Minister François Fillon announced the reform would be the most important of his term in office. Therefore, the reform was debated long before the bill was officially presented by the government.\n\nSoon after the presidential elections in May 2007, the Higher Education minister Valérie Pécresse announced to university representatives (students, teachers, researchers, presidents of universities) that her ministry would work on the reform. She said the bill on university autonomy would be voted in July by Parliament, during an extraordinary session, while the other reforms would follow in the next months. The ministry released a first draft on 22 June. Some representatives were dissatisfied, saying that independency was not the main concern. The priority was to address student failure.\n\nUniversity autonomy concerns university management, i.e. the powers of the presidents and the administration councils, also recruitment and paying teachers. The majority of the representatives of students, teachers and researchers said they were strongly opposed to reform:\n\nTo satisfy the students, Nicolas Sarkozy said the presentation of the bill would be delayed (the bill was to be examine during the Ministers Council on 26 June). At the end of June, he met and discussed the bill with president of universities, then with representatives of researchers, then of teachers, and finally students organizations (mainly UNEF and UNI), along with François Fillon and Valérie Pécresse. The UNEF, the Fage and the CGT, the main associations of students, withdrawn from the discussions. The most controversial measures were the selectiveness in universities and the underrepresentation of students in administration councils. \n\nAll the organizations were satisfied by the postponement of the bill. The students organizations (mainly UNEF) said the government had retained the lessons from the CPE discontentment. The presidents of universities conference (CPU) said they would have time to pass amendments, notably to make the reform compulsory for all universities, while it was to be initially optional.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy, François Fillon and Valérie Pécresse declared they were ready to grant some points to the representatives. They said they were ready to modify the text on administration councils to include more people in it, but refused to include more students. They were ready to discuss the selectiveness.\n\nA new bill was released by the Ministry of Higher Education on 26 June. The number of students in the administration councils could be extended to 5, and the total number of members to 30. The reform would apply to all universities (as opposed to the initial draft) by 2012. A vice-president would be appointed by the students to represent them. The measure on selectiveness (diploma at the end of the first year) was abandoned. \n\nOrganizations expressed their satisfaction, but criticized the increasing power of presidents of universities and the new management in universities. The bill include measures reinforcing the powers of the administration councils. They would define the missions of each teachers-researchers. Bonuses are decided by the board and the president. Recruitment is managed by the president and a board composed of professionals of companies and teachers-researchers.\n\nOn 11 July 2007, just before the examination of the bill by the Senate, more than 800 teacher-researchers signed a petition, to demand various modifications of the bill. The petition expressed concerns about the university directory board choosing itself the teachers instead of electing them, and about the excessive power of university presidents over recruitment.\n\nThe bill was submitted to the Senate on 12 July 2007. Senators modified the text so that the external members of the directive board be elected by the other members, instead of being nominated by the president. Thus, these external members would be able to take part in the election of the president with the other members. Valerie Pécresse accepted the modification. The bill was voted on 13 July. The Socialist Party voted against the bill.\n\nOn 24 July, the bill was examined by the National Assembly. The Socialist Party said that while if they agreed to reform the higher education system, the management of universities was not a priority, and that the bill was unadapted to the needs. The socialist deputies criticized the law and voted against it. They said they expected a real reform of the higher education system. Valérie Pécresse argued this law was the indispensable basis for further reform.\n\nThe deputies removed the senatorial amendment which modified the election of the president. The major change came from an amendment proposed by the UMP deputy Claude Goasguen. The amendment proposed that the president of university be reserved for a teacher-researcher. The amendment was unanimously voted, while Valerie Pécresse had opposed it. However, the minister succeeded in modifying the bill, so that any executive of the university can be elected president.\n\nAs the government chose to use the urgency procedure to pass the bill, only one vote was permitted for each house of the parliament. A joint commission of 7 senators and 7 deputies then worked again on the text. The final bill was definitively approved by the houses on 1 August 2007.\n\nAt the beginning of October 2007, period when university classes begin, students began to express their opposition to the bill. Students of the three Toulouse universities call for a general mobilization to demand the removal of the Pécresse law. They said they were ready to go on strike. Students from Lille also announced they were ready to take measures. Various universities began to be blocked by students at the beginning of November, including Le Mirail (Toulouse II), Tours, Paris I (Tolbiac), Rouen, Perpignan, Lille II, Rennes III. Aix-Marseille 1 only decided a strike. The students denounced the privatization of universities. Valerie Pécresse declared these movements were unjustified, arguing the state would remain implicated in the funding of universities. \n\nStudents organizations declared the new management of universities would make non-profitable studies disappear. They condemned the inequalities between universities the law would cause, without the support of the government. They also opposed the increasing power of the presidents and the underrepresentation of students in directive boards. They said governmental action should focus on financial aids to students.\n\nThe blockages extended on 7 and 8 November to Paris IV Clignancourt, Aix-Marseilles, Nantes, Lille I, while Lyon-II, Lyon-III and Lille III only decided a strike. Other action was planned in other universities, but did not lead to blockages. On 9 November, demonstrations took place in Paris, Rennes, Toulouse and Perpignan, with clashes with police. Around 15 universities (out of 85) were blocked for a week, and more than 50 organized demonstrations. The next week, the movement amplified and 36 universities were blocked on 14 November, 42 on 15 November. Students organizations (UNEF, UNI, Cé, Fade) met with Valerie Pécresse, without outcome. Organizations (among them the UNEF) said they would continue the movement unless the government gave guarantee on state fundings. On 22 November, demonstrations were held in Paris, Rennes, Bordeaux, Lyon, along with lycées students. The next week, from 26 November, various lycées began to be blocked. \n\nOn 26 November, François Fillon promised to increase the budget dedicated to universities in the next years to satisfy the students. The prime minister said the governmental funding for universities would increase by 50% in the next five-year period, which means an additional one billion euros for each year until 2012, the total budget for the five years passing from 10 to 15 billions euros. On 27 November, while various demonstrations took place in France, with 30.000 participants, discussions were held between students organizations and Valérie Pécresse. The minister of higher education promised various modifications of the law, including a reduction of selectiveness. UNEF representants said they were satisfied by these guarantees. Soon after, the organization chose to stop the blockages. However, the mobilization amplified in lycées. In Paris, more than 30 lycées out of 73 were blocked, and more than 200 in total.\n\nAt the end of November, some 100 lycées (out of 1,500 in France) and some 40 universities were still blocked, but at the beginning of December, the classes resumed in most universities and lycées. On 13 December, Valérie Pécresse unveiled a plan to address university students' failure, the second point of the vast reform of university.\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1786 by David Dale, who built cotton mills and housing for the mill workers. Dale built the mills there in a brief partnership with the English inventor and entrepreneur Richard Arkwright to take advantage of the water power provided by the only waterfalls on the River Clyde. Under the ownership of a partnership that included Dale's son-in-law, Robert Owen, a Welsh philanthropist and social reformer, New Lanark became a successful business and an early example of a planned settlement and so an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning.\n\nThe New Lanark mills operated until 1968. After a period of decline, the New Lanark Conservation Trust (NLCT) was founded in 1974 (now known as the New Lanark Trust (NLT)) to prevent demolition of the village. By 2006 most of the buildings have been restored and the village has become a major tourist attraction. It is one of six UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Scotland and an Anchor Point of ERIH - the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nThe New Lanark cotton mills were founded in 1786 by David Dale in a brief partnership with Richard Arkwright. Dale was one of the self-made \"Burgher Gentry\" of Glasgow who, like most of this gentry, had a summer retreat, an estate at Rosebank, Cambuslang, not far from the Falls of Clyde, which have been painted by J. M. W. Turner and many other artists. The mills used the recently developed water-powered cotton spinning machinery invented by Richard Arkwright. Dale sold the mills, lands and village in the early 19th century for £60,000, payable over 20 years, to a partnership that included his son-in-law Robert Owen. Owen, who became mill manager in 1800, was an industrialist who carried on his father-in-law's philanthropic approach to industrial working and who subsequently became an influential social reformer. New Lanark, with its social and welfare programmes, epitomised his Utopian socialism (\"see also Owenism\"). The town and mills are important historically through their connection with Owen's ideas, but also because of their role in the developing industrial revolution in the UK and their place in the history of urban planning.\n\nThe New Lanark mills depended upon water power. A dam was constructed on the Clyde above New Lanark and water was drawn off the river to power the mill machinery. The water first travelled through a tunnel, then through an open channel called the lade. It then went to a number of water wheels in each mill building. It was not until 1929 that the last waterwheel was replaced by a water turbine. Water power is still used in New Lanark. A new water turbine has been installed in Mill Number Three to provide electricity for the tourist areas of the village.\n\nIn Owen's time some 2,500 people lived at New Lanark, many from the poorhouses of Glasgow and Edinburgh. Although not the grimmest of mills by far, Owen found the conditions unsatisfactory and resolved to improve the workers' lot. He paid particular attention to the needs of the 500 or so children living in the village (one of the tenement blocks is named Nursery Buildings) and working at the mills, and opened the first infants' school in Britain in 1817, although the previous year he had completed the Institute for the Formation of Character.\n\nThe mills thrived commercially, but Owen's partners were unhappy at the extra expense incurred by his welfare programmes. Unwilling to allow the mills to revert to the old ways of operating, Owen bought out his partners. In 1813 the Board forced an auction, hoping to obtain the town and mills at a low price but Owen and a new board (including the economist Jeremy Bentham) that was sympathetic to his reforming ideas won out.\n\nNew Lanark became celebrated throughout Europe, with many statesmen, reformers and royalty visiting the mills. They were astonished to find a clean, healthy industrial environment with a content, vibrant workforce and a prosperous, viable business venture all rolled into one. Owen's philosophy was contrary to contemporary thinking, but he was able to demonstrate that it was not necessary for an industrial enterprise to treat its workers badly to be profitable. Owen was able to show visitors the village's excellent housing and amenities, and the accounts showing the profitability of the mills.\n\nAs well as the mills' connections with reform, socialism and welfare, they are also representative of the Industrial Revolution that occurred in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries and which fundamentally altered the shape of the world. The planning of employment in the mills alongside housing for the workers and services such as a school also makes the settlement iconic in the development of urban planning in the UK.\n\nIn 1825, control of New Lanark passed to the Walker family when Owen left Britain to start settlement of New Harmony in the US. The Walkers managed the village until 1881, when it was sold to Birkmyre and Sommerville and the Gourock Ropeworks (although they tried unsuccessfully to sell the mills and the town in 1851). They and their successor companies remained in control until the mills closed in 1968.\n\nThe town and the industrial activity had been in decline before then, but after the mills closed migration away from the village accelerated, and the buildings began to deteriorate. The top two floors of Mill Number 1 were removed in 1945 but the building has since been restored and is now the New Lanark Mill Hotel. In 1963 the New Lanark Association (NLA) was formed as a housing association and commenced the restoration of Caithness Row and Nursery Buildings. In 1970 the mills, other industrial buildings and the houses used by Dale and Owen were sold to Metal Extractions Limited, a scrap metal company. In 1974 the NLCT (now the NLT) was founded to prevent demolition of the village. A compulsory purchase order was used in 1983 to recover the mills and other buildings from Metal Extractions after a repairs notice had been served in 1979. This was because of the state of repair of the buildings despite their listing as historic buildings that required their legal preservation in 1971. They are now controlled by the NLT, either directly through the Trust or through wholly owned companies (New Lanark Trading Ltd, New Lanark Hotel Ltd and New Lanark Homes). By 2005 most of the buildings had been restored and the village has become a major tourist attraction.\n\nIn the mid 19th century, an entire family would have been housed in a single room. Some sense of such living conditions can be obtained by visiting the David Livingstone Centre at Blantyre. David Dale, who founded New Lanark, was also involved in the mills at Blantyre. Only one tenement row has survived in Blantyre, and that building is now a museum. This is mostly devoted to David Livingstone, who was born there in 1813, but it includes a re-creation of the single~room living conditions of the time at New Lanark, featuring trundle beds for children such as Livingstone would have used. The David Livingstone Centre is 18 miles by road from New Lanark, between Glasgow and Hamilton.\n\nThe living conditions in the village gradually improved, and by the early 20th century families would have had the use of several rooms. It was not until 1933 that the houses had interior cold water taps for sinks and the communal outside toilets were replaced by inside facilities.\n\nFrom 1938 the village proprietors provided free electricity to all the homes in New Lanark, but only enough power was available for one dim bulb in each room. The power was switched off at 10 pm Sunday-Friday, 11 pm Saturday. In 1955 New Lanark was connected to the National Grid.\n\nIt has been estimated that over 400,000 people visit the village each year. The importance of New Lanark has been recognised by UNESCO as one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites, the others being Edinburgh Old and New Towns, Heart of Neolithic Orkney, St Kilda, the Antonine Wall and the Forth Bridge. The mills and town were listed in 2001 after an unsuccessful application for World Heritage listing in 1986.\n\nAbout 200 people live in New Lanark. Of the residential buildings, only Mantilla Row has not been restored. Some of the restoration work was undertaken by the NLA and the NLCT. Braxfield Row and most of Long Row were restored by private individuals who bought the houses as derelict shells and restored them as private houses. In addition to the 20 owner-occupied properties in the village there are 45 rented properties let by the NLA, which is a registered housing association. The NLA also owns other buildings in the village. \n\nIn 2009 the NLA was wound up as being financially and administratively unviable, and responsibility for the village's tenanted properties passed to the NLCT. The same year, Clydesdale Bank released a new series of Scottish banknotes, of which the 20-pound note features New Lanark on its reverse.\n\nConsiderable attention has been given to maintaining the historical authenticity of the village. No television aerials or satellite dishes are allowed in the village, and services such as telephone, television and electricity are delivered though buried cables. To provide a consistent appearance all external woodwork is painted white, and doors and windows follow a consistent design. Householders used to be banned from owning dogs, but this rule is no longer enforced.\n\nSome features introduced by the NLT, such as commercial signage and a glass bridge connecting the Engine House and Mill Number Three, have been criticised. The retention of a 1924-pattern red telephone box in the village square has also been seen as inappropriate.\n\nThe mills, the hotel and most of the non-residential buildings in the village are owned and operated by the NLT through wholly owned companies.\n\nA 1911 Ordnance Survey map is available from the National Library of Scotland is available and \n\n\nThere is a large free car park on the outskirts of the village. Only disabled visitors may park in the village. The walk from the car park down to the mill village provides a worthwhile panoramic view. There is a bus service [Number 135] from Lanark station bus stance. The railway station has half-hourly services from Glasgow.\n\nThe village has a four-star hotel, the New Lanark Mill Hotel, owned and operated by the New Lanark Conservation Trust; holiday flats, the Waterhouses, let by the hotel; and the Wee Row hostel type accommodation. There are restaurants and shops in the village, and a visitors' centre.\n\nThe Clyde walkway long distance footpath passes through the village and the Scottish Wildlife Trust's visitor centre for the Falls of Clyde Nature reserve is based in a group of mill buildings.\n\n\n\n"}

The party campaigned for clean air and a federal union of the world. It was founded in 2015 and its first contest was in the 2016 London mayoral election.\n\nThe party was led and founded by Ankit Love, a musician and film maker. It was statutorily deregistered on 19 December 2017.\n\nThe One Love Party was founded in Hackney, London by Ankit Love and his friend from Cambridge University, Finn Grant. The party was set up in a dormitory room at a youth hostel.\n\nThe One Love Party was registered with the Electoral Commission on 12 October 2015. In 2016, Pax Brown became the party's general-secretary.\n\nIn May 2016, Love stood in the London mayoral election and was the youngest candidate to do so. His campaign focussed on London's housing crisis and air pollution in the capital. Love, who was technically homeless during the campaign, claimed not to have spent more than \"a couple of thousand\" pounds on the campaign. Nevertheless, Love had almost twice as many Facebook followers as the campaign's frontrunners, Sadiq Khan (Labour) and Zac Goldsmith (Conservative). Love came last with 4,941 first preference votes (0.2%).\n\nLove subsequently stood for the party in the Tooting by-election, which was called after Khan, the constituency's Member of Parliament (MP), was elected as Mayor of London. During the election campaign, Love released a rap video depicting a map in which the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir is an independent country; such representations are illegal under Indian law. Love obtained 32 votes (0.1%), coming 10th out of 14 candidates.\n\nOn 15 September 2016, the party achieved its best electoral result by vote share: Dawn Ma, its candidate, won 494 first-preference votes (1.5%) in the Hackney mayoral by-election.\n\nLove stood in the Batley and Spen by-election on 20 October 2016. Love wanted to unite Britain on the air pollution issue, claiming that it would kill 200,000 people in the UK over the next five years. He came last with 34 votes (0.2%).\n\nEmilia Rose Arnò, who was raised in Luxembourg and moved to the UK six years prior to the election to pursue an academic career in Arts and Education, stood for the One Love Party in the Witney by-election, which took place on the same day as the Batley and Spen by-election. Arnò's campaign called for emergency action on air pollution and better youth enfranchisement. She came second to last with 44 votes (0.1%).\n\nLove stood in the Richmond Park by-election on 1 December, using the title of Maharaja Jammu and Kashmir, with plans to reunite India and Pakistan, and end the potential for a nuclear war between the two countries, embroiled in 69 years of armed conflict in Kashmir.\n\nThe One Love Party was statutorily deregistered with the Electoral Commission on 19 December 2017.\n\nLove calls himself the \"Maharaja of the sovereign state of Jammu and Kashmir\" and is the son of Bhim Singh and Jay Mala, the founders of the Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party of India, a socialist party opposed to Islamic terrorism. He was born in 1983 and grew up in Shimla, but was moved to Surrey in 1989 for security reasons, given the political engagements of his family. He later studied art and music in Surrey and California. At the age of 24, Love was expected to take over his father's political party, but he refused to do so, given his father's former connections with Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nLove is a musician and film-maker. Love's short film \"Whale!\" and documentary \"Runners\" premiered at Cannes Film Festival. Love was also previously a racing car driver and co-founded the fashion brand Nicole Coste.\n\nOn 24 February 2017, Love announced his candidacy for Prime Minister of India for the 2019 Indian general election. Love joined the Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party. He became the party's leader on 28 May 2017. His announced policies including sending the first woman to Mars, and tackling air pollution in India.\n\nIn the build-up to the 2017 UK general election, Love joined the Liberal Democrats based on their opposition to Brexit. In the 2017 general election, Love stood as an independent candidate in the Cities of London and Westminster constituency using the title \"The Maharaja of Kashmir\". By the time of the election, he was registered homeless and living on the streets. He came second to last with 59 votes, winning 0.2% of the total vote.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, Ankit Love attended a Panthers Party campaign rally at Barmulla district in Jammu and Kashmir. At the rally he called for the abolition of Article 35A, and the reunification of India and Pakistan to stop the threat of an “apocalyptic nuclear war for Kashmir.” Shortly after leaving the rally, Love and his convoy of twenty-two Indian army guards, survived an armed attack by Al-Qaeda terrorists, in which his father, Bhim Singh, was wounded.\n\nThe party described itself as \"techno-progressive\".\n\nThe party proposed legalising, licensing and taxing drugs such as cannabis in the hope of ending the war on drugs and reducing violent crime. Love claimed that the prohibition of drugs \"was originally based on racism, and it funds all the criminal activity in our society.\" During the London mayoral campaign, it proposed to do this through municipality-owned licensed dispensaries.\n\nThe party called for a vote on the final Brexit deal, which would have enfranchised citizens of the European Union resident in the United Kingdom and 16- and 17-year-olds. Because EU citizens could not vote in it, the party claimed that the Brexit referendum was illegal, violating the Lisbon Treaty and the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nDuring the London mayoral election campaign, the party endorsed Terry Farrell's proposal to build six new bridges across the River Thames in order to boost the regeneration of East London and provide 47,000 homes. The party also pledged to introduce \"discount travel cards for Londoners\" and make higher education free for London residents up to phD level.\n\nDuring the Tooting by-election campaign, Love favoured bringing the Crossrail 2 line through Tooting Broadway and voiced his opposition to HS2.\n\nThe One Love Party's priority issue was air pollution, which it described as a pandemic situation, quoting figures that 50,000 people die from it annually in the UK. It campaigned for immediate emergency action to bring fossil fuel emissions to zero by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and Royal Prerogative to force all power production, shipping, aviation and automobile companies to convert to only clean energy sources. The party pledged to ban all cars except electric and hydrogen vehicles. Love had previously called for the army to organise a military coup d'état and overthrow David Cameron, then the Prime Minister, on the issue of air pollution. In an interview with \"London Live\", Love expressed his long-term intention to decommission power stations using fossil fuels across the UK.\n\nDuring the London mayoral election campaign, the party called for a ban on all fossil fuel emissions vehicles from the capital and wanted to introduce driverless electric cars for public transport. Love called for the city's cycle superhighways to be suspended from the railway network. The party would have converted all water vessels from bunker fuel to hydrogen fuel, solar or SkySails. The party also pledged to increase the use of driverless electric vehicles, reduce the cost of installing solar panels in residential homes, adopt electric and hydrogen-powered buses, scrap the Garden Bridge project, cancel the Silvertown tunnel project, revive the Thames' eel population and investigate the potential of new moorings. Love also called for adverts for cars to be banned in the same way as adverts for cigarettes. During the Hackney mayoral by-election campaign, the party called for a monument to remember the victims of air pollution akin to a war memorial.\n\nIn agreement with its techno-progressive philosophy, the party supported the expansion of drones, driverless cars, robotic technology and artificial intelligence, stating that these would make more efficient use of scarce resources even if they increased unemployment.\n\nThe One Love Party believed in an accelerated program of space exploration, including the colonisation of Mars and Venus and the mining of asteroids to mitigate economic scarcity.\n\nThey had pledged to establish a London municipal space program to detect unknown asteroids on a collision course with Earth.\n\nBy applying robotic technology and artificial intelligence, the party wished to abolish personal income taxes and introduce a universal basic income for all citizens. During the London mayoral election campaign, the party pledged to introduce Li-Fi networks and use maintenance drones to oversee roadworks and street and building repairs. Love said that he wanted London to be the first major city \"to have driverless cars on an everyday basis.\"\n\nDuring the London mayoral election campaign, the party pledged to build one million social homes in four years. They pledged to achieve this by constructing skyscrapers akin to quick-build flatpack buildings in China on land owned by Transport for London and the Greater London Authority; the building would have been funded by bank loans and private financing. At the same time, the party said it would outlaw purchases of new apartments for buy-to-let or investment purposes.\n\nThe party proposed a confederate economic union for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China, akin to that of the European Union, which would have included free movement of labour and a single currency, with the aim of ending the \"potential of an apocalyptic nuclear war\". Love supported the United Kingdom's continued membership of the European Union.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n"}

Nelson proposes 'ontogenetic depth' as evidence of specified complexity, and a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent, in opposition to modern evolutionary theory.\n\nNelson subsequently stated that ontogenetic depth is \"Currently Impossible to Measure\".\n\nBiologist PZ Myers, who works in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, dismissed the concept, stating in 2010 that \"Nelson is a creationist who made up this wacky claim of \"ontogenetic depth\", saying he had a way of objectively measuring the complexity of the developmental process in organisms with a number that described the distance from egg to adult. Unfortunately, he forgot to tell us how one calculated this number, or how it actually accounted for the complexity of a network, or even how we'd get a number that was different for a sponge and a cat. But he did say he'd get back to us with the details tomorrow...six years ago.\" Myers concludes that \"ontogenetic depth is a sloppily-defined concept with no theoretical support for its validity and no apparent operational utility.\"\n\nThe concept of 'ontogenetic depth' has not been published in any peer-reviewed journal, there are no methods described that would allow to measure this value in any organisms, nobody other than Nelson and his collaborator, Marcus Ross, do anything with the idea.\n"}

It is active in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nPBP was established in 2005, primarily by members of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). The Community & Workers Action Group of south Dublin (CWAG) joined the group in 2007 and brought along the party's first elected representative, Joan Collins, an anti–bin tax campaigner and former member of the Socialist Party. In the opinion of Harry McGee, an opinion writer for the Irish Times newspaper, the organisation is Trotskyist.\n\nPBP contested several constituencies in the 2007 general election, polling around 9,000 first preferences, with Richard Boyd Barrett—the candidate in the Dún Laoghaire constituency—missing a seat on the 10th and final count by 7,890 votes to 9,910.\n\nIn May 2008, PBP launched a campaign calling for a No vote on the Lisbon Treaty when it was put to the people.\n\nIn the Republic's 2009 local elections PBP ran twelve candidates, including ten in County Dublin. It secured five seats in three of Dublin's four councils. As well as ten members of the SWP, Joan Collins and Pat Dunne of the CWAG ran in Dublin, and Donnie Fell (a former Waterford Crystal worker and trade union representative) in Waterford.\n\nIn the Republic's 2011 general election, both Richard Boyd Barrett and Joan Collins were elected to Dáil Éireann as TDs (deputies), running under a joint People Before Profit and United Left Alliance banner.\n\nIn April 2013 Joan Collins TD and Cllr Pat Dunne left the group to form United Left, a political party with former Socialist Party TD Clare Daly.\n\nIn the May 2014 local elections, PBP won 14 seats including two seats outside Dublin on Sligo and Wexford County Councils.\n\nDiscussions were held in August 2015 with the Anti-Austerity Alliance about forming a new political grouping. On 17 September 2015, the two parties announced they had formally registered as a single political party for electoral purposes. The new organisation was called the Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit.\n\nAt the 2016 general election, Boyd Barrett was re-elected. He was joined by fellow PBP candidates Gino Kenny and Bríd Smith.\n\nPeople Before Profit unsuccessfully ran one candidate, Sean Mitchell, in the 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election, polling 774 first preferences in the Belfast West constituency. He successfully gained the right to stand in an election by threatening to take the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain, to court if the legal loophole preventing him from doing so was enforced. (England, Scotland and Wales had secured the right to contest candidates under the age of 20, providing they were over 18, for constituencies for devolved government, whereas Northern Ireland had been simply excluded).\n\nPeople Before Profit ran four candidates in the Northern Ireland Assembly election of May 2011, winning 5,438 first-preference votes between them but no seats in the new Assembly. Its most successful candidate in this election was Eamonn McCann, who won 3,120 first-preference votes, or 8% of the total, in Foyle.\n\nIn the June 2011 Belfast West by-election, Gerry Carroll won 1,751 votes (7.6%), coming in third place and ahead of both unionist candidates.\n\nIn the 2014 Belfast City Council election, Gerry Carroll became the first PBP councilor elected in Northern Ireland, winning 3rd place in the Black Mountain DEA, with 1,691 1st Preference votes.\n\nIn May 2016, Carroll]] topped the poll in the Belfast West constituency at the 2016 Assembly Election with 8,299 votes (22.9%), almost 4,000 first-preference votes clear of his nearest challenger, Sinn Féin MLA Fra McCann (Sinn Féin was running five candidates). This victory secured PBP with their first elected MLA. Eamonn McCann also took a seat in the Derry constituency of Foyle. In 2017, Carroll retained his seat but with a much reduced vote (12.2%), while McCann lost his.\n\nIn the Northern Ireland Assembly, the party is designated as neither unionist nor Irish nationalist, but 'Other'.\n\nPeople Before Profit supported and campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum.\n\nPeople Before Profit have only contested European Elections in the Republic of Ireland. \n"}

Briffa is one of the first people to be public about a chosen blank, indeterminate, birth certificate.\n\nTony Briffa was born with Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, raised as a girl and castrated at age seven to impose that assigned sex of rearing. Speaking to a 2013 Senate of Australia inquiry into the \"Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia\", Briffa describes how doctors \"convinced my mother to approve me to be castrated\":\nTony Briffa is the world's first openly intersex public mayor, and \"the first known intersex public office-bearer in the Western world\", serving as Deputy Mayor of the City of Hobsons Bay, Victoria, between 2009 and 2011, and Mayor between 2011–2012.

In October 2016, Briffa was re-elected to Hobsons Bay City Council.\n\nTony Briffa has previously served as the President of the Genetic Support Network of Victoria. Briffa is now co-executive director of Intersex Human Rights Australia (formerly OII Australia) and vice-president of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia; described as \"the two leading groups advocating for the rights of intersex people in Australia\".\n\n\nNorrie May-Welby is popularly regarded as the first person with an indeterminate birth certificate, and \"non-specific\" sex was awarded by the High Court of Australia in April 2014 on the basis of May-Welby's failed sex affirmation surgery. However, Tony Briffa had previously obtained a birth certificate with a blank sex classification. Alex MacFarlane is believed to be the first. Speaking to the Senate hearing on intersex sterilisation in March 2013, Briffa said:\nBriffa made the following statement: \"I am very public about being born biologically partially female and partially male and that I was raised as a girl and lived as a woman until I was 30. I ask all my friends and colleagues to respect my sex as what nature made me; both female and male.\" On his website Briffa posted: “I feel very comfortable having accepted my true nature. I am not male or female, but both. I am grateful for the years I lived as a woman and the insight and experiences it gave me. I am still ‘Antoinette’ and have now also incorporated and accepted my male (‘Anthony’ or ‘Tony’) side. I feel whole. I’ll continue to live as Tony but I feel I am now at a point in my life where I can celebrate being different.”He also added that now that he has come to accept the male part of himself, he is now using male pronouns however continue to identify as neither male or female.\n\nLegal issues presented by Tony Briffa's non-specific birth certificate meant that Briffa could not lawfully marry in Australia until late 2017. On 27 September 2013, Tony Briffa married Manja Sommeling in Dunedin, New Zealand. Intersex Human Rights Australia notes:\n\n"}

Under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), \"Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements\".\n\nNo member state has as of yet withdrawn from the EU (or the EC); however, the Government of the United Kingdom triggered Article 50 to begin the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March 2017 following a referendum, and the withdrawal is scheduled to occur on 29 March 2019.\n\nThree territories of EU member states have withdrawn: French Algeria (in 1962, upon independence), Greenland (in 1985, following a referendum) and Saint Barthélemy (in 2012), the latter two becoming Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union.\n\nArticle 50, which allows a member state to withdraw, was originally drafted by Scottish cross-bench peer and former diplomat Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, the secretary-general of the European Convention, which drafted the Constitutional Treaty for the European Union. Following the failure of the ratification process for the European Constitution, the clause was incorporated into the Treaty of Lisbon which entered into force in 2009.\n\nPrior to this, no provision in the treaties or law of the EU outlined the ability of a state to voluntarily withdraw from the EU. The absence of such a provision made withdrawal technically difficult but not impossible. Legally there were two interpretations of whether a state could leave. The first, that sovereign states have a right to withdraw from their international commitments; and the second, the treaties are for an unlimited period, with no provision for withdrawal and calling for an \"ever closer union\" – such commitment to unification is incompatible with a unilateral withdrawal. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states where a party wants to withdraw unilaterally from a treaty that is silent on secession, there are only two cases where withdrawal is allowed: where all parties recognise an informal right to do so and where the situation has changed so drastically, that the obligations of a signatory have been radically transformed.\n\nArticle 50 of the Treaty on European Union, enacted by the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, introduced for the first time a procedure for a member state to withdraw voluntarily from the EU. This is specified in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that:\nThis provision does not cover certain overseas territories which under do not require a full treaty revision.\n\nThus, once a member state has notified the European Council of its intention to leave, a period begins during which a withdrawal agreement is negotiated, setting out the arrangements for the withdrawal and outlining the country's future relationship with the Union. Commencing the process is up to the member state that intends to leave.\n\nThe article allows for a negotiated withdrawal, due to the complexities of leaving the EU. However, it does include in it a strong implication of a unilateral right to withdraw. This is through the fact that a state would decide to withdraw \"in accordance with its own constitutional requirements\" and that the end of the treaties' application in a member state that intends to withdraw is not dependent on any agreement being reached (it would occur after two years regardless).\n\nThe treaties cease to apply to the member state concerned on the entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of such an agreement, two years after the member state notified the European Council of its intention to leave, although this period can be extended by unanimous agreement of the European Council. \n\nThe leaving agreement is negotiated on behalf of the EU by the European Commission on the basis of a mandate given by the remaining Member States, meeting in the Council of the European Union. It must set out the arrangements for withdrawal, taking account of the framework for the member state's future relationship with the EU, though without itself settling that framework. The agreement is to be approved on the EU side by the Council of the EU, acting by qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. For the agreement to pass the Council of the EU it needs to be approved by at least 72 percent of the continuing member states representing at least 65 percent of their population.\n\nThe agreement is concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council and must set out the arrangements for withdrawal, including a framework for the State's future relationship with the Union, negotiated in accordance with of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The agreement is to be approved by the Council, acting by qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Should a former Member State seek to rejoin the European Union, it would be subject to the same conditions as any other applicant country.\n\nRemaining members of the EU would need to manage consequential changes over the EU's budgets, voting allocations and policies brought about by the withdrawal of any member state.\n\nThis system gives a negotiated withdrawal, due to the complexities of leaving the EU (particularly concerning the euro). However it does include in it a strong implication of a unilateral right to withdraw. This is through the fact the state would decide \"in accordance with its own constitutional requirements\" and that the end of the treaties' application in said state is not dependent on any agreement being reached (it would occur after two years regardless).\n\nIf negotiations do not result in a ratified agreement, the seceding country leaves without an agreement, and the EU Treaties shall cease to apply to the seceding country, without any substitute or transitional arrangements being put in place. As regards trade, the parties would likely follow World Trade Organization rules on tariffs.\n\nArticle 50 does not spell out whether Member States can rescind their notification of their intention to withdraw during the negotiation period while their country is still a Member of the European Union. However, the President of the European Council said to the European Parliament on 24 October 2017 that “deal, no deal or no Brexit” is up to Britain. Indeed, the prevailing legal opinion among EU law experts and the EU institutions themselves is that a member state intending to leave may change its mind, as an “intention” is not yet a deed and intentions can change before the deed is done. The issue is untested in court. \n\nThe European Parliament resolution of 5 April 2017 on negotiations with the United Kingdom following its notification that it intends to withdraw from the European Union states, \"a revocation of notification needs to be subject to conditions set by all EU-27, so that it cannot be used as a procedural device or abused in an attempt to improve on the current terms of the United Kingdom’s membership.\" The European Union Policy Department for Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs has stated that a hypothetical right of revocation can only be examined and confirmed or infirmed by the EU institution competent to this purpose, namely the CJEU. In addition the European Commission considers that Article 50 does not provide for the unilateral withdrawal of the notification.\n\nLord Kerr, the British author of Article 50, also considers the process is reversible as does Jens Dammann. Professor Stephen Weatherill disagrees.. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis has stated that the British Government \"does not know for sure\" whether Article 50 is revocable; the British prime minister \"does not intend\" to reverse it.\n\nShould a former member state seek to rejoin the European Union after having actually left, it would be subject to the same conditions as any other applicant country and need to negotiate a Treaty of Accession, ratified by every Member State.\n\n(6), introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon allows the status of French, Dutch and Danish overseas territories to be changed more easily, by no longer requiring a full treaty revision. Instead, the European Council may, on the initiative of the member state concerned, change the status of an overseas country or territory (OCT) to an outermost region (OMR) or vice versa.\n\nSome former territories of European Union members broke formal links with the EU when they gained independence from their ruling country or were transferred to an EU non-member state. Most of these territories were not classed as part of the EU, but were at most associated with OCT status, and EC laws were generally not in force in these countries.\n\nSome current territories changed or are in the process of changing their status so that, instead of EU law applying fully or with limited exceptions, EU law mostly will not apply. The process also occurs in the opposite direction, as formal enlargements of the union occur. The procedure for implementing such changes was made easier by the Treaty of Lisbon.\n\nFrench Algeria had joined the European Communities as part of France (since legally it was not a colony of France, but rather one of its overseas departments). Upon independence in 1962, Algeria left France and thus left the European Communities.\n\nGreenland chose to leave the EU predecessor without also seceding from a member state. It initially voted against joining the EEC when Denmark joined in 1973, but because Denmark as a whole voted to join, Greenland, as a county of Denmark, joined too. When home rule for Greenland began in 1979, it held a new referendum and voted to leave the EEC. After wrangling over fishing rights, the territory left the EEC in 1985, but remains subject to the EU treaties through association of Overseas Countries and Territories with the EU. This was permitted by the Greenland Treaty, a special treaty signed in 1984 to allow its withdrawal.\n\nSaint Martin and Saint-Barthélemy in 2007 seceded from Guadeloupe (overseas department of France and outermost region (OMR) of the EU) and became overseas collectivities of France, but at the same time remained OMRs of the European Union. Later, the elected representatives of the island of Saint-Barthélemy expressed a desire to \"obtain a European status which would be better suited to its status under domestic law, particularly given its remoteness from the mainland, its small insular economy largely devoted to tourism and subject to difficulties in obtaining supplies which hamper the application of some European Union standards.\" France, reflecting this desire, requested at the Council of the European Union to change the status of Saint Barthélemy to an overseas country or territory (OCT) associated with the European Union. The status change came into effect from 1 January 2012.\n\nThe UK's planned withdrawal, known as \"Brexit\", is the first and only invocation of Article 50, as of December 2017.\n\nThe British government led by David Cameron held a referendum on the issue in 2016; a majority voted to leave the European Union. On 29 March 2017, Theresa May's administration invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union in a letter to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. The UK is set to leave by April 2019.\n\nThe terms of withdrawal have not yet been negotiated, and the UK remains a full member of the European Union. May said that the UK government would not seek permanent single market membership, and promised a Great Repeal Bill that would repeal the European Communities Act and would incorporate existing European Union law into the domestic law of the UK.\n\nUntil the withdrawal from the European Union is effected, the UK remains a member of the EU continuing to fulfil all EU-related treaties and must legally be treated as a member.\n\nSeveral states have political parties and individuals advocating and seeking withdrawal from the EU. In member states, there are political movements of varying significance campaigning for withdrawal.\n\nWhile no country other than the United Kingdom has voted on whether to withdraw from the EU, political parties criticizing the federative trend of the European Union and advocating its reshaping into a looser cooperation framework have gained prominence in several member states since the last European Parliament election in 2014, similarly to the rise of UKIP in the United Kingdom. \n\nThe main parties are:\n\nThe European Parliament currently includes two official groups of Eurosceptic members opposing the EU institutions: Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy and Europe of Nations and Freedom.\n\nThere are no clear agreements, treaties or precedents covering the scenario of an existing EU member state breaking into two or more states. The question is whether one state is a successor rump state which remains a member of the EU and the other is a new state which must reapply and be accepted by all other member states to remain in the EU, or alternatively whether both states retain their EU membership following succession.\n\nIn some cases, a region leaving its state would leave the EU - for example, if any of the various proposals for the enlargement of Switzerland from surrounding countries were to be implemented at a future date.\n\nDuring the failed Scottish independence referendum of 2014 it was clarified by the European commission that any newly independent country would be considered as a new state which would have to negotiate with the EU to rejoin.\nSuch considerations also apply to the likes of Catalonia where even if the independence movement is in favor of rejoining the EU, other states may have an interest in blocking membership to deter independence movements within their own borders.\n\nCitizenship of the European Union is dependent on citizenship (nationality) of a member state, and citizenship remains a competence entirely vested with the member states. Citizenship of the EU can therefore only be acquired or lost by the acquisition or loss of citizenship of a member state. A probable but untested consequence of a country withdrawing from the EU is that, without otherwise negotiated and then legally implemented, its citizens are no longer citizens of the EU. But the automatic loss of EU citizenship as a result of a member state withdrawing from the EU is the subject of debate.\n\nWhile a state can leave, there is no provision for a state to be expelled. But provides for the suspension of certain rights of a member state if a member persistently breaches the EU's founding values.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "912961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=912961", "title": "Womanism", "text": "Womanism\n\nWomanism is a social theory based on the history and everyday experiences of women of color. It seeks, according to womanist scholar Layli Maparyan (Phillips), to \"restore the balance between people and the environment/nature and reconcil[e] human life with the spiritual dimension\". The writer Alice Walker coined the term \"womanist\" in a short story, \"Coming ----Apart\", #7 35527432\n\nWomanist theory, while diverse, holds at its core that both femininity and culture are equally important to the woman's existence. In this conception one's femininity cannot be stripped from the culture within which it exists. At first glance, this seems similar to the thought process of third wave feminism, which embraced the concept of intersectionality. The difference lies in the valuation placed on intersectionality within the theoretical frameworks. Womanism espouses the idea that the culture of the woman, which in this case is the focal point of intersection as opposed to class or some other characteristic, is not an element of her femininity, but rather is the lens through which femininity exists. As such, a woman's Blackness is not a component of her feminism; instead, her Blackness is the lens through which she understands her femininity.\n\nIn discussing womanist theory, one must acknowledge the racism that was perceived by black women in the feminist movement. This perception fuels two different conceptions of womanism's relationship with feminism. Some womanists believe that the experience of Black women will not be validated by feminists to be equal to the experience of White women because of the problematic way in which some feminists treated blackness throughout history. As such, they do not see womanism as an extension of feminism, but rather as a theoretical framework which exists independent of feminist theory. This is a move from the thought of Black feminists who have carved their own space in feminism through academia and activism.\n\nHowever, not all womanists hold this view of feminism. The chronological first conception of womanism can be captured through Alice Walker's quotation \"womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender\". Under this description, the theories are intimately tied, with womanism as the broad umbrella under which feminism falls.\n\nAuthor and poet Alice Walker first used the term \"womanist\" in her short story, \"Coming Apart\", in 1979, and later in\" In Search of our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose\" (1983). Walker defined a \"womanist\" as a \"black feminist or feminist of color. From the black folk expression of mothers to female children, 'You acting womanish'\", referring to grown-up behavior. The womanish girl exhibits willful, courageous, and outrageous behavior that is considered to be beyond the scope of societal norms. She goes on to say that a womanist is also:\n\nAccording to Walker, while feminism is incorporated into womanism, it is also instinctively pro-humankind; womanism is a deeper subset of feminism. The focus of the theology is not on gender inequality, but race and class-based oppression. She sees womanism as a theory/movement for the survival of the black race; a theory that takes into consideration the experiences of black women, black culture, black myths, spiritual life, and orality. Walker's much cited phrase, \"womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender\", suggests that feminism is a component beneath the much larger ideological umbrella of womanism. Walker's definition also holds that womanists are universalists. This philosophy is further invoked by her metaphor of a garden where are all flowers bloom equally. A womanist is committed to the survival of both males and females and desires a world where men and women can coexist, while maintaining their cultural distinctiveness. This inclusion of men provides Black women with an opportunity to address gender oppression without directly attacking men. A third definition provided by Walker pertains to the sexuality of the women portrayed in her review of \"Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson\". Here, she argues that the best term to describe Rebecca Jackson, a black Shaker who leaves her husband and goes on to live with her white Shaker companion, would be a womanist, because it is a word that affirms the connection to the world, regardless of sexuality. The seemingly contrasting interpretations of womanism given by Walker validates the experiences of African-American women, while promoting a visionary perspective for the world based on said experiences.\n\nThe short story \"Everyday Use\" by Alice Walker illustrates the voice of a black rural middle class woman through the relationship that a black woman shares with her two daughters Dee and Maggie. Dee is spoiled and believes that her education and experiences make her better than her mother and her sister. On the other hand, Maggie envies her sister for her the beauty and arrogance that always gets her what she wants. Historically, it has been very common for people of color to have their stories told by Caucasians. However, Walker attempts to break this tradition by having a black rural middle class woman tell the story of her relationships with her two daughters. An important part of the story occurs when the mother in \"Everyday Use\" states, \"You've no doubt seen those TV shows where the child who has \"made it\" is confronted, as a surprise, by her own mother and father, tottering in weakly from backstage… Sometimes I dream a dream in which Dee and I are suddenly brought together on a TV program of this sort…\". Here the mother reminisces about a family experience that she has witnessed on television that she wishes she could have for herself. A heart-warming scene similar to the one that the mother witnessed on television does not take place when her daughter Dee comes to visit. Instead when Dee comes to visit the mother a rough, awkward tension-filled encounter slowly unfolds. Walker employs this story and its context to illustrate that a majority of womanism is characterized by black women telling their stories.\n\nMuch of Alice Walker's progeny admits that while she is the creator of the term, Walker fails to consistently define the term and often contradicts herself. At some points she portrays womanism as a more inclusive revision of Black feminism as it is not limited to Black women and focuses on the woman as a whole. Later in life she begins to regret this peace seeking and inclusive form of womanism due to the constant and consistent prejudice inflicted upon Black women, specifically, whose voices had yet to be validated by both White women and Black men.\n\nClenora Hudson-Weems is credited with coining the term Africana womanism. In 1995, the publication of her book, \"Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves\" sent shock waves through the Black nationalism community and established her as an independent thinker. Hudson-Weems rejects feminism as the theology of Africana women, that is to say women of the African diaspora, because it is philosophically rooted in Eurocentric ideals. She further asserts that it is impossible to incorporate the cultural perspectives of African women into the feminism ideal due to the history of slavery and racism in America. Furthermore, Weems rejects feminism's characterization of the man as the enemy. She claims that this does not connect with Africana women as they do not see Africana men as the enemy. Instead the enemy is the oppressive force that subjugates the Africana man, woman, and child. She claims that feminism's masculine-feminine binary comes from a lack of additional hardship placed on women by their circumstances (i.e. race and socio-economic) as feminism was founded to appeal to upper-class White women.\n\nShe also distances the Africana woman from Black feminism by demarcating the latter as distinctly African-American which is in turn distinctly western. She also critiques Black feminism as a subset of feminism needing the validation of White feminists for their voices to be heard. She claims that feminism will never truly accept Black feminists, but instead relegate them to the fringes of the feminist movement. She ultimately claims that the matriarchs of the Black feminist movement will never be put into the same conversation as the matriarchs of the feminist movement. A large part of her work mirrors separatist Black Nationalist discourse, because of the focus on the collective rather than the individual as the forefront of her ideology. Hudson-Weems refutes Africana womanism as an addendum to feminism, and asserts that her ideology differs from Black feminism, Walker's womanism, and African womanism.\n\nChikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi is a Nigerian literary critic. In 1985, she published the article \"Womanism: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Black Female Novel in English\", and described her interpretation of womanism. She asserts that the womanist vision is to answer the ultimate question of how to equitably share power among the races and between the sexes. She arrived at her interpretation of the term independently of Alice Walker's definition, yet there are several overlaps between the two ideologies. Rather than citing gender inequality as the source of Black oppression, Ogunyemi takes a separatist stance much like Hudson-Weems, and dismisses the possibility of reconciliation of white feminists and black feminists on the grounds of the intractability of racism. She uses a few examples of how feminists write about Blackness and African Blackness specifically to make salient the need for an African conception of womanism. These critiques include the use of Blackness as a tool to forward feminist ideals without also forwarding ideals related to blackness, the thought that western feminism is a tool which would work in African nations without acknowledging cultural norms and differences, and a co-opting of things that African women have been done for centuries before the western notion of feminism into western feminism.\n\nIt is also important to note that Ogunyemi finds her conception of womanism's relationship with men at the cross roads of Walker's and Hudson Weems' conceptions. Walker's expresses a communal opportunity for men while acknowledging how they can be dangerous to the womanist community. While Hudson-Weems' conception refuses to see the Africana man as an enemy, disregarding the harm that Africana men have imparted on to the community. \n\nWomanism has various definitions and interpretations. At its broadest definition, it is a universalist ideology for all women, regardless of color. A womanist is, according to Walker's 1979 story \"Coming Apart\", an African-American heterosexual woman willing to utilize wisdom from African-American lesbians about how to improve sexual relationships and avoid being sexually objectified. In the context of men's destructive use of pornography and their exploitation of Black women as pornographic objects, a womanist is also committed to \"the survival and wholeness of an entire people, male and female\" through confronting oppressive forces. Walker's much cited phrase, \"womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender\" suggests that Walker considers feminism as a component of the wider ideological umbrella of womanism. It focuses on the unique experiences, struggles, needs, and desires of not just Black women, but all women of color in addition to critically addressing the dynamics of the conflict between the mainstream feminist, the Black feminist, the African feminist, and the Africana womanist movement. However, there is Black nationalist discourse prevalent within womanist work and for this reason scholars are divided between associating womanism with other similar ideologies such as Black feminism and Africana womanism or taking the stance that the three are inherently incompatible.\n\nThe Black feminist movement was formed in response to the needs of women who were racially underrepresented by the Women's Movement and sexually oppressed by the Black Liberation Movement. Black feminist scholars assert that African-American women are doubly disadvantaged in the social, economic, and political sphere, because they face discrimination on the basis of both race and gender. Black women felt that their needs were being ignored by both movements and they struggled to identify with either based on race or gender. African-American women who use the term Black feminism attach a variety of interpretations to it. One such interpretation is that Black feminism addresses the needs of African-American women that the feminism movement largely ignores. Feminism, as Black feminist theorist Pearl Cleage defines it, is \"the belief that women are full human beings capable of participation and leadership in the full range of human activities—intellectual, political, social, sexual, spiritual, and economic\". With this definition, the feminist agenda can be said to encompass different issues ranging from political rights to educational opportunities within a global context. The Black feminist agenda seeks to streamline these issues and focuses on those that are the most applicable to African-American women.\n\nClenora Hudson-Weems's Africana womanism arose from a nationalist Africana studies concept. In \"Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves\", Hudson-Weems explores the limitations of feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is set up in a way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be okay for black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice. She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man. She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to the black experience. Unlike womanism, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.\n\nIn her introduction to \"The Womanist Reader\", Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its main concern is not the black woman per se but rather the black woman is the point of origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. \"Purple is to Lavender\" illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss. Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In \"Purple is to Lavender\", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty. They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino (Jain & Turner, pp. 67–70). They go on to describe the concept of \"The Politics of Naming\" which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism (Jain & Turner, pp. 73–75). Jain states: \"I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a foreign substance that I was being forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride\" (Jain & Turner, p. 68). Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels like she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, \"The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level\" (Jain & Turner, p. 73). This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: \"I don't choose womanism because it is \"better\" than feminism ... I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it… because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see\" (quoted in Jain & Turner, pp. 77–78).\n\nFor a majority of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals to the world that surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism it is important to remember that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.\n\nWomanist literature and activism are two areas that are largely interpolated, with each having a considerable effect on the other. A major tenet of womanist literature and activism is the idea that Black activists and Black authors should separate themselves from the feminist ideology. This stems from assertions by Kalenda Eaton, Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, and numerous other womanist theologians that the goal of a womanist should be to promote the issues affecting not just Black women, but black men and other groups that have been subjected to discrimination or impotence. In the words of Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, a white woman writer may be a feminist, but a black woman writer is likely to be a womanist. That is, she recognizes that along with battling for sexual equality, she must also incorporate race, economics, culture, and politics within her philosophy. In Kalenda Eaton's, \"Womanism, Literature and the Black Community\", black women writers are portrayed as both activists and visionaries for change in the Black Community following the Civil Rights Movement. She interweaves the historical events of African-American history with the development of Afro-Politico womanism in a bid to create a haven for Black female activism within the black community. This Afro-Politico womanism veers from the traditional feminist goal of gender equality within a group and rather seeks to fight for the men and women whose civil rights are infringed upon. While Eaton takes the stance that Black women were largely excluded from the more prominent positions within the Black Movement, she argues that black women activists had the greatest effect in small-scale grassroots protests within their communities. Using various characters from Toni Morrison's \"Song of Solomon\", Alice Walker's \"Meridian\", Toni Cade Bambara's \"The Salt Eaters\", and Paule Marshall's \"The Chosen Place, the Timeless People\" as symbols of the various political agendas and issues that were prevalent within The Black Movement, Eaton draws upon the actions of the protagonists to illustrate solutions to the problems of disgruntlement and disorganization within the movement. Often the main task of these literary activists was to empower the impoverished masses—defined by Eaton as mainly Southern African-Americans, and they used the black middle class as a model for the possibility of social mobility within the African-American community. A common theme within womanist literature is the failure of Black women writers to identify with feminist thought. Womanism becomes the concept that binds these novelists together.\n\nSpirituality concerns the desire for a connection with the sacred, the unseen, the superhuman, or the nonexistent. Patricia Hill Collins offers this definition:\nSpirituality is not merely a system of religious beliefs similar to logical systems of ideas. Rather, spirituality comprises articles of faith that provide a conceptual framework for living everyday life\n\nWhereby religion is an institutional mechanism, spirituality is a personal one. Unlike religion, spirituality cannot be abandoned or switched. It is an integral component of one's consciousness. Womanist spirituality has six identifying characteristics—it is eclectic, synthetic, holistic, personal, visionary, and pragmatic. It draws from its resources and uses the summation of said resources to create a whole from multiple parts. Although it is ultimately defined by self, it envisions the larger picture and exists to solve problems and end injustice. Emilie Townes, a womanist theologian, further asserts that womanist spirituality grows out of individual and communal reflection on African American faith and life. She explains that it is not grounded in the notion that spirituality is a force but rather a practice separate from who we are moment by moment.\" In a blaze of glory: womanist spirituality as social witness. Nashville: Abingdon Press. One of the main characteristics of womanism is its religious aspect, commonly thought of as Christian. This connotation paints the picture of spiritual black womanists being \"church going\" women that play a vital role in the operation of the church. In William's article \"Womanist Spirituality Defined\" she discusses how womanist spirituality is directly connected to an individual's experiences with God. For instance, Williams declares, \"the use of the term spirituality in this paper speaks of the everyday experiences of life and the way in which we relate to and interpret God at work in those experiences\". However, this connotation is disputed in Monica Coleman's Roundtable Discussion: \"Must I Be a Womanist?\" where she focuses on the shortcomings of womanism that result from how individuals have historically described womanism. This holistic discussion of womanism is the result of a roundtable discussion. Coleman, who initiated the discussion, describes her thoughts on why she prefers black feminism as opposed to womanism, and she also discusses the limited scope that womanist religious scholarship embodies. Coleman offers deep insight into the spiritual aspect of womanism when she declares that, \"Intentionally or not, womanists have created a Christian hegemonic discourse within the field\". Here Coleman explains that the majority of womanists have painted the spiritual aspect of womanism to be spiritual in terms of Christianity. A specific example of this occurs in Walker's \"Everyday Use\", in the instance when the mother suddenly gains the courage to take a stand against her spoiled daughter as she declares, \"When I looked at her like that something hit me in the top of my head and ran down to the soles of my feet. Just like when I'm in church and the spirit of God touches me and I get happy and shout\". This could be categorized as an example of the spiritual aspect of womanism because of the mention of relation to the Christian God. However, Coleman provides a counter example to this assumption when she states: \"How, for example, might a womanist interpret the strength Tina Turner finds in Buddhism and the role her faith played in helping her to leave a violent relationship?\" Here Coleman pokes a hole in the pre-conceived notions of womanist scholarship. Coleman believes that the notorious sector of spirituality that womanism is most known for referring to is limited in its scope. Womanist religious scholarship has the ability to spread across a variety of paradigms and represent and support radical womanist spirituality. Considering womanism as a whole, it is also important to understand how it relates to feminism.\n\nWomanist ethics is a religious discipline that examines the ethical theories concerning human agency, action, and relationship. At the same time, it rejects social constructions that have neglected the existence of a group of women that have bared the brunt of injustice and oppression. Its perspective is shaped by the theological experiences of African-American women. With the use of analytic tools, the effect of race, class, gender, and sexuality on the individual and communal perspective is examined. Womanist ethic provides an alternative to Christian and other religious ethics while utilizing the elements of critique, description, and construction to assess the power imbalance and patriarchy that has been used to oppress women of color and their communities. The publication of Katie Cannon's \"The Emergence of Black Feminist Consciousness\" was the first to directly speak on womanist ethics. In this article, Cannon argues that the perspectives of Black women are largely ignored in various religious and academic discourses. Jacquelyn Grant expands on this point by asserting that Black women concurrently experience the three oppressive forces of racism, sexism, and classism. Black feminist theory has been used by womanist ethics to explain the lack of participation of African-American women and men in academic discourse. Patricia Collins, credits this phenomenon to prevalence of white men determining what should or should not be considered valid discourse and urges for an alternative mode of producing knowledge that includes the core themes of Black female consciousness.\n\nA major ongoing critique about womanist scholarship is the failure of many scholars to critically address homosexuality within the black community. Walker's protagonist in \"Coming Apart\" uses writings from two African-American lesbians, Audre Lorde and Louisah Teish, to support her argument that her husband should stop consuming pornography. She posts quotes from Audre Lorde above her kitchen sink. \"In Search of Our Mother's Garden\" states that a womanist is \"a woman who loves another woman, sexually and/or non-sexually\", yet despite \"Coming Apart\" and \"In Search of Our Mother's Garden\", there is very little literature linking womanism to the lesbian and bisexual issue. Womanist theologian Renee Hill cites Christian influences as the cause of the lack of sympathy towards heterosexism and homophobia. Black feminist critic Barbara Smith blames it on the Black community's reluctance to come to terms with homosexuality. On the other hand, there is an increase in the criticism of heterosexism within womanist scholarship. Christian womanist theologian Pamela R. Lightsey, in her book \"Our Lives Matter: A Womanist Queer Theology\" (2015), writes, \"To many people, we are still \"perverts\". To many, the Black pervert is the most dangerous threat to the American ideal. Because the Black conservative bourgeoisie has joined the attack on our personhood, Black LGBTQ persons cannot allow the discourse to be controlled such that our existence within the Black community is denied or made invisible.\" An additional critique lies within the ambivalence of womanism. In Africana womanism and African womanism, the term is associated with black nationalist discourse and the separatist movement. Patricia Collins argues that this exaggerates racial differences by promoting homogeneous identity. This is a sharp contrast to the universalist model of womanism that is championed by Walker. The continued controversy and dissidence within the various ideologies of womanism serves only to draw attention away from the goal of ending race and gender-based oppression.\n\n\n\n"}

It aims at reflecting, debating, and offering constructive solutions to major regional and international issues, in an atmosphere of respect and tolerance.\n\nIn 2017, the World Policy Conference ranked 3rd best Think Tank Conference according to The Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP) at the Lauder Institute, University of Pennsylvania '2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report'.\n\nLaunched in 2008 by Thierry de Montbrial, the President and Founder of the French Institute of International Relations (\"Ifri\"), the World Policy Conference (WPC) is the first effort to foster systematic reflection on organizing global governance tailored to 21st century realities, bringing together the highest-level decision-makers, experts and opinion leaders.\n\nThe first edition of the conference took place in Evian (France), from October 6–8, 2008.\n\nThe World Policy Conference (WPC) was founded on three complementary ideas:\n\n- the nature of globalisation\n\nThe World Policy Conference falls within a context where globalisation and interconnections between countries have never been stronger, whether it is on a political, economic or environmental level. During its first edition in 2008, the conference has addressed the subprime crisis, which had just broken out in the United States and has spared no continents since then.\n\n- International relations are still centered on relations between states\n\nDespite phenomena of globalisation, the world is still organized around political entities, States. They are characterized by a territory, a population and a government. They also share common culture, values, institutions, and have delimited borders.\n\n- The construction of the new international system – or rather of its governance – is not just a matter for states\n\nIn order to ensure good global governance, states must reform and cooperate. However, they cannot be the only ones to work to that end. NGOs and think tanks, including the French Institute of International Relations \"(Ifri)\", have to take part in this process as well. Each member should be able to express his point of view and influence the choices made via a proper decision-making process. Finally, global institutions (UN), as well as regional (African Union, Arab League) and specialized institutions (IMF, World Bank, International Energy Agency, World Health Organization) have to adjust to the new global order and find adequate solutions.\n\nThe three meeting formats – namely, the plenary sessions, workshops and lunch or dinner debates – are based on the concept of constructive public-private interaction at the highest level. During plenary sessions, each speaker has an exclusive and equal right to the floor, regardless of his home country’s status on the world stage.\n\nEach participant is individually chosen on the basis of a range of criteria, such as regional, functional and media-related factors. The number of participants at each conference remains limited to ensure that meetings are as productive as possible. On this basis and in a warm and welcoming setting, all the conditions are met for participants to speak their mind freely, thereby creating a very high-level yet informal meeting-place.\n\nAs the conference proceedings are intended to fuel public debate, they are largely “on the record” and widely disseminated.\n\nA report is published after each WPC conference. This report contains the most noteworthy excerpts from the presentations and the profiles of all the participants, as well as a description of all the WPC’s partners. Each conference’s highlights are illustrated with a large number of images. Thousands of copies of this bilingual (French-English) publication are distributed worldwide every year. The report can also be downloaded in PDF format from the WPC website.\n\nThe WPC website provides access not only to all past conferences but also to the latest information on the forthcoming conference.\n\n• WPC TV: WPC TV provides access to interviews with and statements by the participants in the conference.\n\n• Conference proceedings: The proceedings of each conference are published online, with all presentations entirely available in video and text formats.\n\nThe WPC can be followed on Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Pearltrees and Pinterest. Moreover, the whole intellectual content of the event is saved in video format and is available on YouTube.\n\nEach year, the World Policy Conference gathers political, economic and social leaders: Heads of States and governments, ministers, members of parliaments, ambassadors, CEOs, experts, journalists and NGOs’ members.\n\nAmong distinguished guests, one can quote:\n\n- Masood Ahmed (Director of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Department)\n\n- Martti Ahtisaari (Former President of the Republic of Finland)\n\n- Khalid Bin Mohammed Al Attiyah (then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar)\n\n- Sheikh Abdullah bin Naser bin Khalifa Al-Thani (Prime Minister of the State of Qatar)\n\n- H.R.H.
