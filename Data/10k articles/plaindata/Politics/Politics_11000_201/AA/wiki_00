{"id": "40658899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40658899", "title": "ART/MEDIA", "text": "ART/MEDIA\n\nART/MEDIA was a social sculpture project in the form of series of socio-political public art events that took place in 1986 in Albuquerque and Santa Fe New Mexico. This groundbreaking artist forum featured artworks presented to the public through the mass media in a series of artist-designed billboards, television, radio and print media, and in museum exhibitions, a lecture series, and performance art series. Through this extended format, the artwork and ideas of contemporary artists were made accessible to a large public audience outside of the traditional art audience. \n\nLocal and nationally known artists were commissioned to create socio-political artwork presented through the mass media, concerning critical issues of the time, such as nuclear proliferation, environmental degradation, human rights, animal rights, and loss of privacy through technology. The forum stimulated discourse between local communities and nationally known artists through hands-on video workshops, interviews, lectures, performances, informal discussions and road trips. It was sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts, Albuquerque Arts Alliance, the Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Art, and the New Mexico Arts Division. ART/MEDIA operated as a \"museum without walls\" with an office located in the historical Kimo Theater on Route 66. Inspired by the concept/model of Joseph Beuys social sculpture, that have the potential to transform society, ART/MEDIA was an extended artwork that included human interactions, creating structures and systems within society using language, thought, objects, events and actions. The project was documented by seminal video artists Steina and Woody Vasulka who founded The Kitchen in New York City in 1971.\n\nArtists involved in ART/MEDIA included: Hans Haacke, Jenny Holzer, Rachel Rosenthal, Terry Allen (artist), Paul Bob of Bob and Bob, Church of the SubGenius, Godfrey Reggio and the Institute for Regional Education, Mohammed Jim 5X (Jim Stuber), Larry Goodell, Violet Ray, Bob Willis, The Carcass Sisters, Jean-Paul Curtay, Lousie Maffitt and Robert McDermott, Patrick Clancy and Gwen Widmer, Lee Connor, Barbara Bock, Manny Rettinger, John P. McCloskey, Steven Durland of High Performance Magazine, and the art critic/historian, Craig Owens (critic).\n\nArtist-designed billboards included a series of forty billboards by Jenny Holzer addressing Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, and deployed a fleet of Holzer's \"Inflammatory Statements\" street posters. Rachel Rosenthal designed a billboard dealing with animal rights for laboratory rats. Paul Bob designed a series of billboards on the practice of everyday life. Artist-designed print media projects included a color spread by Patrick Clancy and Gwen Widmer that recontextualized articles within Albuquerque Magazine, Jenny Holzer produced a large print piece containing her \"inflammatory statements\" that was inserted into the Sunday edition of the Albuquerque Journal newspaper, Paul Bob, and Rachel Rosenthal produced projects in other statewide publications.\n\nExhibitions included \"Subversive Acts: Artists Working With The Media Politically\", at the New Mexico Museum of Art at the University of New Mexico Art Museum, and the Art Gallery Fogelson Library Center at the College of Santa Fe. \"Subversive Acts\" was an exhibition of mass media forms utilized by artists to present their sociological, environmental and political messages. The video exhibition \"Tuning In\", took place at the Museum of Fine Arts, Santa Fe, and the Art Gallery of the College of Santa Fe. Public performances included visual artist and country western singer, Terry Allen (artist), performance artist and ecological activist Rachel Rosenthal, Paul Bob of the performance due Bob and Bob and performance poet, Larry Goodell. Public lectures included Hans Haacke on art, economics and ethics, Jenny Holzer speaking on the power of public art interventions to change human consciousness, Steven Durland on the history of performance art, Craig Owens (critic) of Art in America Magazine speaking on the relationship between political art and the mass media.\n\nThe concept for the project originated in 1984 with artists Duane Griffin, Patrick Clancy and Scott Portman who later joined with Co-Directors Eve Andree Laramee and Ann Zimmerman to found the project and organization. The Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Arts was the fiscal sponsor under 501c3 not-for-profit status. Bob Gaylor, then director of SFCCC and invited Griffin and Laramee to be part of a Think Tank at St. John's College where they met with Steina and Woody Vasulka, Allan Kaprow, Carolee Schneemann, Edward \"Ned\" Hall, Jerome Rothenberg, and other artists and thinkers. Empowered by this experience, a team of advisors were assembled. Gaylor served as a primary advisor throughout the project, along with Gordon Church of the City of Albuquerque Cultural Affairs Office. The Albuquerque Arts Alliance and the City of Albuquerque became the second fiscal sponsor, providing an office in the historical Kimo Theater on Route 66. Steina and Woody Vasulka introduced the organizers to Godfrey Reggio, director of the film Koyannisqatsi (1982) who provided guidance on organizing Social Sculpture events as \"public service announcements\". Reggio, having been involved in numerous progressive political causes, took interest because his Institute for Regional Education had developed a multi-media campaign of PSA's for the American Civil Liberties Union on the invasion of privacy and use of technology to control behavior in 1972. Grants were received from the National Endowment for the Arts in the InterArts and the Artist Forums categories and the New Mexico Arts Division.\n\nART/MEDIA Documentation https://vimeo.com/39454685\n\n"}
{"id": "983838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=983838", "title": "Acting governor", "text": "Acting governor\n\nAn acting governor is a constitutional position created in some U.S. states when the governor dies in office or resigns. In some states, the governor may also be declared to be incapacitated and unable to function for various reasons including, illness and absence from the state for more than a specified period.\n\nIn these instances, the state constitution will declare which official is to serve as governor and whether this person will have all of the powers of the office or only specified ones. In many states, the person succeeding to the governorship or becoming acting governor is the lieutenant governor; however, not all states have such a position. If the state constitution provides for an acting governor in the event of the governor's disability, it will also provide for a method by which the governor can be declared to be no longer disabled.\n\nGeorge C. Wallace was shot in an assassination attempt in May of 1972. With him out of state recovering for more than 120 days, Lt. Governor Jere Beasley acted as governor from June 5 to July 7, 1972, at which time Governor Wallace returned to the state and returned to office. \n\nIn New Jersey, a state which now has an office of lieutenant governor, in the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. In case of the inability of the current governor to fulfill the gubernatorial duties through injury, the lieutenant governor serves as the acting governor. The acting governor performs powers and duties until the governor recovers from the injuries. If the governor's death or resignation occurs less than 16 months before end of the term, the new governor serves until the end of the term, otherwise a special election (in which the new governor may participate) is held. \n\nPrior to the establishment of the modern office of lieutenant governor following a constitutional referendum in 2005, a vacancy in the office of governor would lead to the president of the New Jersey Senate to become acting governor while still retaining the title of senate president. Following the resignation of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 to become EPA Administrator, Donald DiFrancesco assumed the acting governor's post, serving until January 2002. Following DiFrancesco's departure from the senate, John O. Bennett and Richard J. Codey each served as acting governor as well. As control of the New Jersey Senate was evenly split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett each held the office of acting governor for three days in January 2002, until Jim McGreevey began his term as governor. Codey again served as acting governor following McGreevey's own resignation, serving from November 2004 until January 2006, when Jon Corzine took office as governor. The proximity of these events were a major factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of lieutenant governor in the 2005 referendum, effective with the 2009 election. Even before the amendment could take effect, on December 28, 2006, state transportation commissioner Kris Kolluri served as acting governor for a day, as Governor Corzine, the senate president, assembly speaker and attorney general, were all out of state, and Kolluri was next in the line of succession.\n\nIn Massachusetts, in the event of a vacancy in the governor's office, the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the office, but not the office for the remainder of the term, thus becoming acting governor, while retaining the lieutenant governor's office. In 1997, when William Weld resigned to pursue the ambassadorship to Mexico, Paul Cellucci took over as acting governor until after his 1998 election as governor, when he assumed office in January 1999. In 2001 when Cellucci resigned to become United States Ambassador to Canada, Jane Swift became the acting governor for the remainder of the term, until January 2003.\n\nIn West Virginia, if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor. If more than one year remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a special election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. Then-Senate President Earl Ray Tomblin is the first person under the current state Constitution to act as governor following the November 15, 2010 resignation of Joe Manchin following his election to the United States Senate seat vacated by the death of Robert Byrd. As there was more than one year remaining on Manchin's term as governor, a special election was held, which Tomblin won. He became governor on November 13, 2011 to complete the term.\n\nThe powers of an acting governor came into dispute during the 1980 Democratic primary presidential campaign of Jerry Brown, then governor of California. When he was campaigning out of state, which was often in late 1979 and early 1980, Mike Curb, a Republican who was then serving as Lieutenant Governor of California often used his position as acting governor to veto legislation, promulgate executive orders, issue proclamations, and to do other things that Brown would not likely have done had he been present in the state. This eventually resulted in litigation, much of which went in Curb's favor. \n\nPowers of an acting governor had previously been questioned in the mid-1970s in Kentucky. In her capacity as acting governor of Kentucky in Julian Carroll's absence, Thelma Stovall, then-Lieutenant Governor, acting as governor, issued pardons, called the Kentucky General Assembly into special session to enact legislation limiting property tax increases, and purported to veto the legislature's repeal of its ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The authority of the Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky to act as governor when the elected governor is out of state was repealed under a 1992 amendment to the Kentucky Constitution.\n\nIn 1993, in Pennsylvania, Governor Robert P. Casey underwent surgery that left him incapacitated for months, thus leaving Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel as acting governor. During that time, Singel fulfilled all duties of the office of governor.\n\nFollowing the death of New Hampshire Governor Hugh Gallen, Vesta M. Roy, as president of the state Senate, served as acting governor of New Hampshire from December 30, 1982, to January 6, 1983.\n\nPractices in this area are anything but uniform from state to state. In Rhode Island, for example, the Lieutenant Governor never acts as governor, even if the Governor has left the state. In most of the states, when the governor dies, resigns or is removed from office (via impeachment conviction), the next in line become the new governor, succeeding to the office \"and\" powers.\n\n"}
{"id": "177335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177335", "title": "Andrew Sullivan", "text": "Andrew Sullivan\n\nAndrew Michael Sullivan (born 10 August 1963) is a British-born American author, editor, and blogger. Sullivan is a conservative political commentator, a former editor of \"The New Republic\", and the author or editor of six books. He was a pioneer of the political blog, starting his in 2000. He eventually moved his blog to various publishing platforms, including \"Time\", \"The Atlantic\", \"The Daily Beast\", and finally an independent subscription-based format. He announced his retirement from blogging in 2015. Sullivan has been a writer-at-large at \"New York\" since 2016.\n\nSullivan's conservatism is rooted in his Roman Catholic background and in the ideas of the British political philosopher Michael Oakeshott; In 2003, he wrote he was no longer able to support the American conservative movement, as he was disaffected with the Republican Party's continued rightward drift on social issues during the George W. Bush era.\n\nBorn and raised in Britain he has lived in the United States since 1984 and currently resides in Washington, D.C., and Provincetown, Massachusetts. He is openly gay and a practising Roman Catholic.\n\nSullivan was born in South Godstone, Surrey, England into a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent, and was brought up in the nearby town of East Grinstead, West Sussex. He was educated at Reigate Grammar School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first-class Bachelor of Arts in modern history and modern languages. In his second year, he was elected President of the Oxford Union for Trinity term 1983.\n\nSullivan earned a Master of Public Administration in 1986 from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, followed by a Doctor of Philosophy degree in government from Harvard in 1990. His dissertation was titled \"Intimations Pursued: The Voice of Practice in the Conversation of Michael Oakeshott.\"\n\nIn 2001, it came to light that Sullivan had posted anonymous online advertisements for unprotected anal sex, preferably with \"other HIV-positive men\". He was widely criticised in the media for this, with some critics noting that he had condemned President Bill Clinton's \"incautious behavior\", though others wrote in his defense. In 2003, Sullivan wrote a \"Salon\" article identifying himself as a member of the gay \"bear community\". On 27 August 2007, he married Aaron Tone in Provincetown, Massachusetts.\n\nSullivan was barred for many years from applying for United States citizenship because of his HIV-positive status. Following the statutory and administrative repeals of the HIV immigration ban in 2008 and 2009, respectively, he announced his intention to begin the process of becoming a permanent resident and citizen. On \"The Chris Matthews Show\" on 16 April 2011, Sullivan confirmed that he had become a permanent resident, showing his green card. On 1 December 2016, Sullivan became a naturalized U.S. citizen.\n\nHe has been a daily user of marijuana since 2001.\n\nIn 1986, Sullivan began his career with \"The New Republic\" magazine, serving as its editor from 1991 to 1996. In that position, he expanded the magazine from its traditional roots in political coverage to cultural issues and the politics surrounding them. During this time, the magazine generated several high-profile controversies.\n\nWhile completing graduate work at Harvard in 1988, Sullivan published an attack in \"Spy\" magazine on Rhodes Scholars, \"All Rhodes Lead Nowhere in Particular,\" which dismissed recipients of the scholarship as \"hustling apple-polisher[s]\"; \"high-profile losers\"; \"the very best of the second-rate\"; and \"misfits by the very virtue of their bland, eugenic perfection.\" \"[T]he sad truth is that as a rule,\" Sullivan wrote, \"Rhodies possess none of the charms of the aristocracy and all of the debilities: fecklessness, excessive concern that peasants be aware of their achievement, and a certain hemophilia of character.\" Author Thomas Schaeper notes that \"[i]ronically, Sullivan had first gone to the United States on a Harkness Fellowship, one of many scholarships spawned in emulation of the Rhodes program.\"\n\nIn 1994, Sullivan published excerpts on race and intelligence from Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's controversial \"The Bell Curve\", which argued that some of the measured difference in IQ scores among racially defined groups was a result of genetic inheritance. Almost the entire editorial staff of the magazine threatened to resign if material that they considered racist was published. To appease them, Sullivan included lengthy rebuttals from 19 writers and contributors. He has continued to speak approvingly of the research and arguments presented in \"The Bell Curve\", writing, \"The book ... still holds up as one of the most insightful and careful of the last decade. The fact of human inequality and the subtle and complex differences between various manifestations of being human—gay, straight, male, female, black, Asian—is a subject worth exploring, period.\" According to Sullivan, this incident was a turning point in his relationship with the magazine's staff and management, which he conceded was already bad because he \"was a lousy manager of people\". He left the magazine in 1996.\n\nSullivan began writing for \"The New York Times Magazine\" in 1998, but was fired by editor Adam Moss in 2002. Jack Shafer wrote in \"Slate\" magazine that he had asked Moss in an e-mail to explain this decision, but that his e-mails went unanswered, adding that Sullivan was not fully forthcoming on the subject. Sullivan wrote on his blog that the decision had been made by \"Times\" executive editor Howell Raines, who found Sullivan's presence \"uncomfortable\", but defended Raines's right to fire him. Sullivan suggested that Raines had done so in response to Sullivan's criticism of the \"Times\" on his blog, and said he had expected that his criticisms would eventually anger Raines.\n\nSullivan has also worked as a columnist for \"The Sunday Times\" of London.\n\nRoss Douthat and Tyler Cowen have suggested that Sullivan is the most influential political writer of his generation, particularly because of his very early and strident support for same-sex marriage, his pioneering blog, his support of the Iraq War, and his subsequent support of Barack Obama's presidential candidacy. Mark Ames has charged that Sullivan lacks journalistic integrity and has been responsible for a number of unethical and misleading articles during his career.\n\nSullivan describes himself as a conservative and is the author of \"The Conservative Soul\". He has supported a number of traditional libertarian positions, favouring limited government and opposing interventionist measures such as affirmative action. However, on a number of controversial public issues, including same-sex marriage, social security, progressive taxation, anti-discrimination laws, the Affordable Care Act, the United States government's use of torture, and capital punishment, he has taken positions not typically shared by conservatives in the United States. In July 2012, Sullivan said that \"the catastrophe of the Bush-Cheney years ... all but exploded the logic of neoconservatism and its domestic partner-in-crime, supply-side economics.\"\n\nOne of the most important intellectual and political influences on Sullivan is Michael Oakeshott. Sullivan describes Oakeshott's thought as \"an anti-ideology, a nonprogramme, a way of looking at the world whose most perfect expression might be called inactivism.\" He argues \"that Oakeshott requires us to systematically discard programmes and ideologies and view each new situation \"sui generis\". Change should only ever be incremental and evolutionary. Oakeshott viewed society as resembling language: it is learned gradually and without us really realising it, and it evolves unconsciously, and for ever.\" In 1984, he wrote that Oakeshott offered \"a conservatism which ends by affirming a radical liberalism.\" This \"anti-ideology\" is perhaps the source of accusations that Sullivan \"flip-flops\" or changes his opinions to suit the whims of the moment. He has written, \"A true conservative—who is, above all, an anti-ideologue—will often be attacked for alleged inconsistency, for changing positions, for promising change but not a radical break with the past, for pursuing two objectives—like liberty and authority, or change and continuity—that seem to all ideologues as completely contradictory.\"\n\nAs a youth, Sullivan was a fervent supporter of Margaret Thatcher and later Ronald Reagan. He says of that time, \"What really made me a right-winger was seeing the left use the state to impose egalitarianism—on my school\", after the Labour government in Britain tried to merge his admissions-selective school with the local comprehensive school. At Oxford, he became friends with future prominent conservatives William Hague and Niall Ferguson and became involved with Conservative Party politics.\n\nFrom 1980 through 2000, he supported Republican presidential candidates in the United States, with the exception of Bill Clinton, who he supported during his first election campaign in 1992. In 2004, however, he supported the presidential campaign of John Kerry, a Democrat, angered by George W. Bush's support of the Federal Marriage Amendment designed to enshrine in the Constitution marriage as a union between a man and a woman, as well as what he saw as his administration's incompetence over its Iraq War management.\n\nSullivan endorsed Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 United States presidential election, and Representative Ron Paul for the Republican nomination. He eventually endorsed Obama for president, largely because he believed that he would restore \"the rule of law and Constitutional balance\"; he also argued that Obama represented a more realistic prospect for \"bringing America back to fiscal reason\", and expressed a hope that Obama would be able to \"get us past the culture war.\" Sullivan has continued to maintain that Obama is the best choice for president from a conservative point of view. During the 2012 election campaign, he wrote, \"Against a radical right, reckless, populist insurgency, Obama is the conservative option, dealing with emergent problems with pragmatic calm and modest innovation. He seeks as a good Oakeshottian would to reform the country's policies in order to regain the country's past virtues. What could possibly be more conservative than that?\"\n\nSullivan has declared support for Arnold Schwarzenegger and other like-minded Republicans. He argues that the Republican Party, and much of the conservative movement in the United States, has largely abandoned its earlier scepticism and moderation in favour of a more fundamentalist certainty, both in religious and political terms. He has said this is the primary source of his alienation from the modern Republican Party.\n\nIn January 2009, \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Sullivan No. 19 on a list of \"The 25 Most Influential Liberals in the U.S. Media\". Sullivan rejected the \"liberal\" label and set out his grounds in a published article in response.\n\nIn August 2018, describing Sarah Jeong as a racist with a \"vicious hatred\" of white people, Sullivan explicitly accused the \"New York Times\" editorial board-member of eliminationism; a belief that political opponents are a societal cancer that should be separated, censored or exterminated.\n\nSullivan, like Marshall Kirk, Hunter Madsen, and Bruce Bawer, has been described by Urvashi Vaid as a proponent of \"legitimation\", seeing the objective of the gay rights movement as being \"mainstreaming gay and lesbian people\" rather than \"radical social change\". Sullivan wrote the first major article in the United States advocating for gay people to be given the right to marry, published in \"The New Republic\" in 1989. Many gay rights organisations attacked him for the stance at the time. Many on \"the gay left\" believed that he was promoting \"assimilation\" into \"straight culture\", when the aim of most at that time was to alter codes of sexuality and society as a whole, rather than fitting gays into it. However, his arguments eventually became widely accepted and formed the basis of the modern movement to allow same-sex marriage. In the wake of the United States Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage in 2013 (\"Hollingsworth v. Perry\" and \"United States v. Windsor\"), \"New York Times\" op-ed columnist Ross Douthat suggested that Sullivan might be the most influential political writer of his generation, writing, \"No intellectual that I can think of, writing on a fraught and controversial topic, has seen their once-crankish, outlandish-seeming idea become the conventional wisdom so quickly, and be instantantiated so rapidly in law and custom.\"\n\nSullivan opposes hate crime laws, arguing that they undermine freedom of speech and equal protection. He also opposes the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, arguing that it would \"not make much of a difference\" and that the \"gay rights establishment\" was wrong to oppose a version of the bill that did not include protections for gender identity. Sullivan opposed calls to remove Brendan Eich as CEO of Mozilla and argued that \"old-fashioned liberalism brought gay equality to America far, far faster than identity politics leftism.\"\n\nIn 2006, Sullivan was named as an LGBT History Month icon.\n\nSullivan supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States and was initially hawkish in the war on terror, arguing that weakness would embolden terrorists. He was \"one of the most militant\" supporters of the Bush administration's counter-terrorism strategy immediately following the September 11 attacks in 2001; in an essay for \"The Sunday Times\", he stated, \"The middle part of the country—the great red zone that voted for Bush—is clearly ready for war. The decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead—and may well mount what amounts to a fifth column.\" Eric Alterman wrote in 2002 that Sullivan had \"set himself up as a one-man House Un-American Activities Committee\" running an \"inquisition\" to unmask \"anti-war Democrats\", \"basing his argument less on the words these politicians speak than on the thoughts he knows them to be holding in secret\".\n\nLater, Sullivan criticised the Bush administration for its prosecution of the war, especially regarding the numbers of troops, protection of munitions, and treatment of prisoners, including the use of torture against detainees in United States custody. Though he argues that enemy combatants in the war on terror should not be given status as prisoners of war because \"terrorists are not soldiers\", he believes that the US government must abide by the rules of war—in particular, Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions—when dealing with such detainees. In retrospect, Sullivan said that the torture and abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq had jolted him back to \"sanity\". Of his early support for the invasion of Iraq, he said, \"I was terribly wrong. In the shock and trauma of 9/11, I forgot the principles of scepticism and doubt towards utopian schemes that I had learned.\"\n\nOn the edition of 27 October 2006 of \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", he described conservatives and Republicans who refused to admit they had been wrong to support the Iraq War as \"cowards.\" On 26 February 2008, he wrote on his blog: \"After 9/11, I was clearly blinded by fear of al Qaeda and deluded by the overwhelming military superiority of the US and the ease of democratic transitions in Eastern Europe into thinking we could simply fight our way to victory against Islamist terror. I wasn't alone. But I was surely wrong.\" His reversal on the Iraq issue and his increasing attacks on the Bush administration caused a severe backlash from many hawkish conservatives, who accused him of not being a \"real\" conservative.\n\nSullivan authored an opinion piece, \"Dear President Bush,\" that was featured as the cover article of the October 2009 edition of \"The Atlantic\" magazine. In it, he called on former President Bush to take personal responsibility for the incidents and practices of torture that occurred during his administration as part of the war on terror.\n\nSullivan states that he has \"always been a Zionist\". However, in February 2009, he wrote that he could no longer take the neoconservative position on Israel seriously: \n\nIn January 2010, Sullivan blogged that he was \"moving toward\" the idea of \"a direct American military imposition\" of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with NATO troops enforcing \"the borders of the new states of Palestine and Israel\". He commented, \"I too am sick of the Israelis. [...] I'm sick of having a great power like the US being dictated to.\" His post was criticised by Noah Pollak of \"Commentary\", who referred to it as \"crazy\", \"heady stuff\" based on \"hubris\".\n\nIn February 2010, Leon Wieseltier suggested in \"The New Republic\" that Sullivan, a former friend and colleague, had a \"venomous hostility toward Israel and Jews\" and was \"either a bigot, or just moronically insensitive\" toward the Jewish people. Sullivan rejected the accusation and was defended by some writers, while others at least partly supported Wieseltier.\n\nSullivan devoted a significant amount of blog space to covering the allegations of fraud and related protests after the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Francis Wilkinson of \"The Week\" stated that Sullivan's \"coverage—and that journalism term takes on new meaning here—of the uprising in Iran was nothing short of extraordinary. 'Revolutionary' might be a better word.\"\n\nSullivan was inspired by the Iranian people's reactions to the election results and used his blog as a hub of information. Because of the media blackout in Iran, Iranian Twitter accounts were a major source of information. Sullivan frequently quoted and linked to Nico Pitney of \"The Huffington Post\".\n\nSullivan identifies himself as a faithful Catholic while disagreeing with some aspects of the Catholic Church's doctrine. In \"Virtually Normal\", he argues that the Bible forbids same-sex sexual activity only when it is linked to prostitution or pagan rituals.\n\nHe expressed concern about the election of Pope Benedict XVI in an article in \"Time Magazine\" on 24 April 2005, titled \"The Vicar of Orthodoxy\". He wrote that Benedict was opposed to the modern world and women's rights, and considered gays and lesbians innately disposed to evil. Sullivan has, however, agreed with Benedict's assertion that reason is an integral element of faith.\n\nSullivan takes a moderate approach to religion, rejecting fundamentalism and describing himself as a \"dogged defender of pluralism and secularism\". He defended religious moderates in a series of exchanges with atheist author Sam Harris in which Harris maintained that religious moderates provided cover for fundamentalists and made it impossible for anyone to effectively oppose them.\n\nIn late 2000, Sullivan began his blog, \"The Daily Dish\". The core principle of the blog has been the style of conservatism he views as traditional. This includes fiscal conservatism, limited government, and classic libertarianism on social issues. Sullivan opposes government involvement with respect to sexual and consensual matters between adults, such as the use of marijuana and prostitution. He believes recognition of same-sex marriage is a civil-rights issue but expressed willingness to promote it on a state-by-state legislative federalism basis, rather than trying to judicially impose the change. Most of Sullivan's disputes with other conservatives have been over social issues and the handling of postwar Iraq.\n\nSullivan gave out yearly \"awards\" for various public statements, parodying those of the people the awards were named after. Throughout the year, nominees were mentioned in various blog posts. The readers of his blog chose winners at the end of each year.\n\nIn February 2007, Sullivan moved his blog from \"Time\" to \"The Atlantic Monthly\", where he had accepted an editorial post. His presence was estimated to have contributed as much as 30% of the subsequent traffic increase for \"The Atlantic\"'s website.\n\nIn 2009, \"The Daily Dish\" won the 2008 Weblog Award for Best Blog.\n\nSullivan left \"The Atlantic\" to begin blogging at \"The Daily Beast\" in April 2011. In 2013, he announced that he was leaving \"The Daily Beast\" to launch \"The Dish\" as a stand-alone website, charging subscribers $20 a year.\n\nIn a note posted on \"The Dish\" on 28 January 2015, Sullivan announced his decision to retire from blogging. He posted his final blog entry on 6 February 2015. On 26 June 2015, he posted an additional piece in reaction to \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", which legalized same-sex marriage in the United States.\n\n\n"}

The United States Supreme Court held (5–4) on January 21, 2010, that the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for communications by nonprofit corporations, for-profit corporations, labor unions, and other associations.\n\nIn the case, the conservative non-profit organization Citizens United sought to air a film critical of Hillary Clinton and to advertise the film during television broadcasts shortly before the 2008 Democratic primary election in which Clinton was running for U.S. President. \n\nThe federal law, however, prohibited any corporation (or labor union) from making an \"electioneering communication\" (defined as a broadcast ad reaching over 50,000 people in the electorate) within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of an election, or making any expenditure advocating the election or defeat of a candidate at any time. The court found that these provisions of the law conflicted with the United States Constitution.\n\nThe court upheld requirements, however, for public disclosure by sponsors of advertisements. The case did not affect the federal ban on direct contributions from corporations or unions to candidate campaigns or political parties.\n\nThe decision was highly controversial and remains a subject of widespread public discussion.\n\nIn the case, ,\nthe conservative non-profit organization Citizens United wanted to air a film critical of Hillary Clinton and to advertise the film during television broadcasts, which was a violation of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, commonly known as the McCain–Feingold Act or \"BCRA\" (pronounced \"bik-ruh\"). Section 203 of BCRA defined an \"electioneering communication\" as a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that mentioned a candidate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary, and prohibited such expenditures by corporations and unions. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia held that §203 of BCRA applied and prohibited Citizens United from advertising the film \"\" in broadcasts or paying to have it shown on television within 30 days of the 2008 Democratic primaries. The Supreme Court reversed this decision, striking down those provisions of BCRA that prohibited corporations (including nonprofit corporations) and unions from making independent expenditures for \"electioneering communications\". The majority decision overruled \"Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce\" (1990) and partially overruled \"McConnell v. Federal Election Commission\" (2003). The Court, however, upheld requirements for public disclosure by sponsors of advertisements (BCRA §201 and §311). The case did not involve the federal ban on direct contributions from corporations or unions to candidate campaigns or political parties, which remain illegal in races for federal office.\n\nSection 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (known as BCRA or McCain–Feingold Act) modified the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, to prohibit corporations and unions from using their general treasury to fund \"electioneering communications\" (broadcast advertisements mentioning a candidate in any context) within 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election. During the 2004 presidential campaign, a conservative nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization, Citizens United, filed a complaint before the Federal Election Commission (FEC) charging that advertisements for Michael Moore's film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", a docudrama critical of the Bush administration's response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, produced and marketed by a variety of corporate entities, constituted political advertising and thus could not be aired within the 30 days before a primary election or 60 days before a general election. The FEC dismissed the complaint after finding no evidence that broadcast advertisements featuring a candidate within the proscribed time limits had actually been made. The FEC later dismissed a second complaint which argued that the movie itself constituted illegal corporate spending advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, which was illegal under the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 and the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974. In dismissing that complaint, the FEC found that:\nIn response, Citizens United produced the documentary \"Celsius 41.11\", which is highly critical of both \"Fahrenheit 9/11 \"and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. The FEC, however, held that showing the movie and advertisements for it would violate the Federal Election Campaign Act, because Citizens United was not a bona fide commercial film maker.\n\nIn the wake of these decisions, Citizens United sought to establish itself as a bona fide commercial film maker before the 2008 elections, producing several documentary films between 2005 and 2007. By early 2008, it sought to run television commercials to promote its political documentary \"Hillary: The Movie\" and to air the movie on DirecTV.\n\nIn December 2007, Citizens United filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of several statutory provisions governing \"electioneering communications\". It asked the court to declare that the prohibition on corporate and union funding were facially unconstitutional, and also as applied to \"Hillary: The Movie,\" and to enjoin the Federal Election Commission from enforcing its regulations. Citizens United also argued that the Commission's disclosure and disclaimer requirements were unconstitutional as applied to the movie pursuant to the Supreme Court decision in \"Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.\". It also sought to enjoin funding, disclosure and disclaimer requirements as applied to Citizens United’s intended ads for the movie.\n\nIn accordance with special rules in section 403 of the BCRA, a three-judge court was convened to hear the case. On January 15, 2008, the court denied Citizens United’s motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the suit had little chance of success because the movie had no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton, that it was therefore express advocacy, not entitled to exemption from the ban on corporate funding of electioneering communications, and that television advertisements for the movie within 30 days of a primary violated the BCRA restrictions on \"electioneering communications\". The court held that the Supreme Court in \"McConnell v. FEC\" (2003) had found the disclosure requirements constitutional as to all electioneering communications, and \"Wisconsin RTL\" did not disturb this holding because the only issue of that case was whether speech that did not constitute the functional equivalent of express advocacy could be banned during the relevant pre-election period.\n\nOn July 18, 2008, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Federal Election Commission. In accordance with the special rules in the BCRA, Citizens United appealed to the Supreme Court which docketed the case on August 18, 2008 and granted certiorari on November 14, 2008.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument on March 24, 2009 and then asked for further briefs on June 29; the re-argument was heard on September 9, 2009.\n\nDuring the original oral argument, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L. Stewart (representing the FEC) argued that under \"Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce\", the government would have the power to ban books if those books contained even one sentence expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate and were published or distributed by a corporation or labor union. In response to this line of questioning, Stewart further argued that under \"Austin\" the government could ban the digital distribution of political books over the Amazon Kindle or prevent a union from hiring an author to write a political book.\n\nAccording to a 2012 article in \"The New Yorker\" by Jeffrey Toobin, the Court expected after oral argument to rule on the narrow question that had originally been presented—Can Citizens United show the film? At the subsequent conference among the justices after oral argument, the vote was 5–4 in favor of Citizens United being allowed to show the film. The justices voted the same as they had in \"Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.\", a similar 2007 case, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito in the majority.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the initial opinion of the Court, holding that the BCRA allowed the showing of the film. A draft concurring opinion by Justice Kennedy argued that the court could and should have gone much further. The other justices in the majority agreed with Kennedy's reasoning, and convinced Roberts to reassign the writing and allow Kennedy's concurrence to become the majority opinion.\n\nOn the other side, John Paul Stevens, the most senior justice in the minority, assigned the dissent to David Souter, who announced his retirement from the Court while he was working on it. The final draft went beyond critiquing the majority. Toobin described it as \"air[ing] some of the Court's dirty laundry,\" writing that Souter's dissent accused Roberts of having manipulated Court procedures to reach his desired result – an expansive decision that, Souter claimed, changed decades of election law and ruled on issues neither party to the litigation had presented.\n\nAccording to Toobin, Roberts agreed to withdraw the opinion and schedule the case for reargument. When he did, the \"Questions Presented\" to the parties were, however, more expansive, touching on the issues Kennedy's opinion had identified. According to Toobin, the eventual result was therefore a foregone conclusion from that point on. Toobin's account has been criticized for drawing conclusions unsupported by the evidence in his article.\n\nOn June 29, 2009, the last day of the term, the Court issued an order directing the parties to re-argue the case on September 9 after briefing whether it might be necessary to overrule \"Austin\" and/or \"McConnell v. Federal Election Commission\" to decide the case. Justice Stevens noted in his dissent that in its prior motion for summary judgment, Citizens United had abandoned its facial challenge of BCRA §203's constitutionality, with the parties agreeing to the dismissal of the claim.\n\nJustice Sotomayor sat on the bench for the first time during the second round of oral arguments. This was the first case argued by then-Solicitor General and future Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan. Former Bush Solicitor General Ted Olson and First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams argued for Citizens United, and former Clinton Solicitor General Seth Waxman defended the statute on behalf of various supporters. Legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky called it \"one of the most important First Amendment cases in years\".\n\nJustice Kennedy's majority opinion found that the BCRA §203 prohibition of all independent expenditures by corporations and unions violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The majority wrote, \"If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.\"\n\nJustice Kennedy's opinion also noted that because the First Amendment does not distinguish between media and other corporations, the BCRA restrictions improperly allowed Congress to suppress political speech in newspapers, books, television, and blogs. The Court overruled \"Austin\", which had held that a state law that prohibited corporations from using treasury money to support or oppose candidates in elections did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court also overruled that portion of \"McConnell\" that upheld BCRA's restriction of corporate spending on \"electioneering communications\". The Court's ruling effectively freed corporations and unions to spend money both on \"electioneering communications\" and to directly advocate for the election or defeat of candidates (although not to contribute directly to candidates or political parties).\n\nThe majority ruled that the Freedom of the Press clause of the First Amendment protects \"associations\" of individuals in addition to individual speakers, and further that the First Amendment does not allow prohibitions of speech based on the identity of the speaker. Corporations, as associations of individuals, therefore have free speech rights under the First Amendment. Because spending money is essential to disseminating speech, as established in \"Buckley v. Valeo\", limiting a corporation's ability to spend money is unconstitutional because it limits the ability of its members to associate effectively and to speak on political issues.\n\nThe decision overruled \"Austin\" because that decision allowed different restrictions on speech-related spending based on corporate identity. Additionally, the decision said that \"Austin\" was based on an \"equality\" rationale – trying to equalize speech between different speakers – that the Court had previously rejected as illegitimate under the First Amendment in \"Buckley\". The Michigan statute at issue in \"Austin\" had distinguished between corporate and union spending, prohibiting the former while allowing the latter. The \"Austin\" Court, over the dissent by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and O'Connor, had held that such distinctions were within the legislature's prerogative. In \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\", however, the majority argued that the First Amendment purposefully keeps the government from interfering in the \"marketplace of ideas\" and \"rationing\" speech, and it is not up to the legislatures or the courts to create a sense of \"fairness\" by restricting speech.\n\nThe majority also criticized \"Austin's\" reasoning that the \"distorting effect\" of large corporate expenditures constituted a risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption. Rather, the majority argued that the government had no place in determining whether large expenditures distorted an audience's perceptions, and that the type of \"corruption\" that might justify government controls on spending for speech had to relate to some form of \"quid pro quo\" transaction: \"There is no such thing as too much speech.\" The public has a right to have access to all information and to determine the reliability and importance of the information. Additionally, the majority did not believe that reliable evidence substantiated the risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, and so this rationale did not satisfy strict scrutiny.\n\nThe Court's opinion relied heavily on the reasoning and principles of the landmark campaign finance case of \"Buckley\" and \"First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti\", in which the Court struck down a broad prohibition against independent expenditures by corporations in ballot initiatives and referenda. Specifically, the Court echoed \"Bellotti's\" rejection of categories based on a corporation's purpose. The majority argued that to grant Freedom of the Press protections to media corporations, but not others, presented a host of problems; and so all corporations should be equally protected from expenditure restrictions.\n\nThe Court found that BCRA §§201 and 311, provisions requiring disclosure of the funder, were valid as applied to the movie advertisements and to the movie itself. The majority ruled for the disclosure of the sources of campaign contributions, saying that... prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether their corporation’s political speech advances the corporation’s interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are \"in the pocket\" of so-called moneyed interests... This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.\n\nChief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Alito joined, wrote separately \"to address the important principles of judicial restraint and \"stare decisis\" implicated in this case\".\n\nRoberts wrote to further explain and defend the Court's statement that \"there is a difference between judicial restraint and judicial abdication.\" Roberts explained why the Court must sometimes overrule prior decisions. Had prior Courts never gone against \"stare decisis\" (that is, against precedent), for example, \"segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants\". Roberts' concurrence recited a plethora of case law in which the court had ruled against precedent. Ultimately, Roberts argued that \"\"stare decisis\"... counsels deference to past mistakes, but provides no justification for making new ones\".\n\nJustice Scalia joined the opinion of the Court, and wrote a concurring opinion which Justice Alito joined in full and Justice Thomas joined in part. Scalia addressed Justice Stevens' dissent, specifically with regard to the original understanding of the First Amendment. Scalia wrote that Stevens' dissent was \"in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment... It never shows why 'the freedom of speech' that was the right of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form.\" He further considered the dissent's exploration of the Framers' views about the \"role of corporations in society\" to be misleading, and even if valid, irrelevant to the text. Scalia principally argued that the First Amendment was written in \"terms of speech, not speakers\" and that \"Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker.\" Scalia argued that the Free Press clause was originally intended to protect the distribution of written materials and did not only apply to the media specifically. This understanding supported the majority's contention that the Constitution does not allow the Court to separate corporations into media and non-media categories.\n\nJustice Thomas wrote a separate opinion concurring in all but the upholding of the disclosure provisions. In order to protect the anonymity of contributors to organizations exercising free speech, Thomas would have struck down the reporting requirements of BCRA §201 and §311 as well, rather than allowing them to be challenged only on a case-specific basis. Thomas's primary argument was that anonymous free speech is protected and that making contributor lists public makes the contributors vulnerable to retaliation, citing instances of retaliation against contributors to both sides of a then-recent California voter initiative. Thomas also expressed concern that such retaliation could extend to retaliation by elected officials. Thomas did not consider \"as-applied challenges\" to be sufficient to protect against the threat of retaliation.\n\nA dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens was joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor. To emphasize his unhappiness with the majority, Stevens read part of his 90-page dissent from the bench. Stevens concurred in the Court's decision to sustain BCRA's disclosure provisions but dissented from the principal holding of the Court. He argued that the Court's ruling \"threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation. The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution.\" He added: \"A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold.\"\n\nStevens also argued that the Court addressed a question not raised by the litigants when it found BCRA §203 to be facially unconstitutional, and that the majority \"changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law\". He argued that the majority had expanded the scope beyond the questions presented by the appellant and that therefore a sufficient record for judging the case did not exist. Stevens argued that at a minimum the Court should have remanded the case for a fact-finding hearing, and that the majority did not consider other compilations of data, such as the Congressional record for justifying BCRA §203.\n\nStevens argued that the Court had long recognized that to deny Congress the power to safeguard against \"the improper use of money to influence the result [of an election] is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection\". After recognizing that in \"Buckley v. Valeo\" the Court had struck down portions of a broad prohibition of independent expenditures from any sources, Stevens argued that nevertheless \"Buckley\" recognized the legitimacy of \"prophylactic\" measures for limiting campaign spending and found the prevention of \"corruption\" to be a reasonable goal for legislation. Consequently, Stevens argued that \"Buckley\" left the door open for carefully tailored future regulation. Although the majority echoed many of the arguments in \"First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti\", Stevens argued that the majority opinion contradicted the reasoning of other campaign finance cases – in particular, \"Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce\" and \"McConnell v. Federal Election Commission\" – and found it telling that the majority, when citing such cases, referenced mainly dissenting opinions.\n\nStevens argued that the majority failed to recognize the possibility for corruption outside strict \"quid pro quo\" exchanges. He referenced facts from a previous BCRA challenge to argue that, even if the exchange of votes for expenditures could not be shown, contributors gain favorable political access from such expenditures. The majority, however, had considered access to be insufficient justification for limiting speech rights.\n\nStevens responded that in the past, even when striking down a ban on corporate independent expenditures, the Court \"never suggested that such quid pro quo debts must take the form of outright vote buying or bribes\" (\"Bellotti\"). \"Buckley\", he said, also acknowledged that large independent expenditures present the same dangers as \"quid pro quo\" arrangements, although \"Buckley\" struck down limits on such independent expenditures. Using the record from a previous BCRA §203 challenge, he argued that independent expenditures were sometimes a factor in gaining political access and concluded that large independent expenditures generate \"more\" influence than direct campaign contributions. Furthermore, Stevens argued that corporations could threaten Representatives and Senators with negative advertising to gain unprecedented leverage. Stevens supported his argument by citing \"Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.\", where the Court held that $3 million in independent expenditures in a judicial race raised sufficient questions about a judge's impartiality to require the judge to recuse himself in a future case involving the spender. Stevens argued that it was contradictory for the majority to ignore the same risks in legislative and executive elections, and argued that the majority opinion would exacerbate the problem presented in \"Caperton\" because of the number of states with judicial elections and increased spending in judicial races.\n\nSecond, Stevens argued that the majority did not place enough emphasis on the need to prevent the \"appearance of corruption\" in elections. Earlier cases, including \"Buckley\" and \"Bellotti\", recognized the importance of public confidence in democracy. Stevens cited recent data indicating that 80% of the public view corporate independent expenditures as a method used to gain unfair legislative access. Stevens predicted that if the public believes that corporations dominate elections, disaffected voters will stop participating.\n\nThird, Stevens argued that the majority's decision failed to recognize the dangers of the corporate form. \"Austin\" held that the prevention of corruption, including the distorting influence of a dominant funding source, was a sufficient reason for regulating corporate independent expenditures. In defending \"Austin\", Stevens argued that the unique qualities of corporations and other artificial legal entities made them dangerous to democratic elections. These legal entities, he argued, have perpetual life, the ability to amass large sums of money, limited liability, no ability to vote, no morality, no purpose outside profit-making, and no loyalty. Therefore, he argued, the courts should permit legislatures to regulate corporate participation in the political process.\n\nLegal entities, Stevens wrote, are not \"We the People\" for whom our Constitution was established. Therefore, he argued, they should not be given speech protections under the First Amendment. The First Amendment, he argued, protects individual self-expression, self-realization and the communication of ideas. Corporate spending is the \"furthest from the core of political expression\" protected by the Constitution, he argued, citing \"Federal Election Commission v. Beaumont\", and corporate spending on politics should be viewed as a business transaction designed by the officers or the boards of directors for no purpose other than profit-making. Stevens called corporate spending \"more transactional than ideological\". Stevens also pointed out that any member of a corporation may spend personal money on promoting a campaign because BCRA only prohibited the use of general treasury money.\n\nFourth, Stevens attacked the majority's central argument: that the prohibition of spending guards free speech and allows the general public to receive all available information. Relying on \"Austin\", Stevens argued that corporations \"unfairly influence\" the electoral process with vast sums of money that few individuals can match, which distorts the public debate. Because a typical voter can only absorb so much information during a relevant election period, Stevens described \"unfair corporate influence\" as the potential to outspend others, to push others out of prime broadcasting spots and to dominate the \"marketplace of ideas\". This process, he argued, puts disproportionate focus on this speech and gives the impression of widespread support regardless of actual support. Thus, this process marginalizes the speech of other individuals and groups.\n\nStevens referred to the majority's argument that \"there is no such thing as too much speech\" as \"facile\" and a \"straw man\" argument. He called it an incorrect statement of First Amendment law because the Court recognizes numerous exceptions to free speech, such as fighting words, obscenity restrictions, time, place and manner restrictions, etc. Throughout his dissent, Stevens said that the majority's \"slogan\" ignored the possibility that too much speech from one source could \"drown out\" other points of view.\n\nFifth, Stevens criticized the majority's fear that the government could use BCRA §203 to censor the media. The focus placed on this hypothetical fear made no sense to him because it did not relate to the facts of this case – if the government actually attempted to apply BCRA §203 to the media (and assuming that Citizens United could not constitute media), the Court could deal with the problem at that time. Stevens described the majority's supposed protection of the media as nothing more than posturing. According to him, it was the majority's new rule in this case, that prohibited a law from distinguishing between speakers or funding sources. This new rule would be the only reason why media corporations could not be exempted from BCRA §203. In this, Stevens and the majority conceptualize the First Amendment's protection of \"the press\" quite differently. Stevens argues that the press is an entity, which can be distinguished from other persons and entities which are not press. The majority opinion viewed \"freedom of the press\" as an activity, applicable to all citizens or groups of citizens seeking to publish views.\n\nSixth, Stevens claimed that the majority failed to give proper deference to the legislature. Stevens predicted that this ruling would restrict the ability of the states to experiment with different methods for decreasing corruption in elections. According to Stevens, this ruling virtually ended those efforts, \"declaring by fiat\" that people will not \"lose faith in our democracy\". Stevens argued that the majority's view of a self-serving legislature, passing campaign-spending laws to gain an advantage in retaining a seat, coupled with \"strict scrutiny\" of laws, would make it difficult for any campaign finance regulation to be upheld in future cases.\n\nSeventh, Stevens argued that the majority opinion ignored the rights of shareholders. A series of cases protects individuals from legally compelled payment of union dues to support political speech. Because shareholders invest money in corporations, Stevens argued that the law should likewise help to protect shareholders from funding speech that they oppose. The majority, however, argued that ownership of corporate stock was voluntary and that unhappy shareholders could simply sell off their shares if they did not agree with the corporation's speech. Stevens also argued that Political Action Committees (PACs), which allow individual members of a corporation to invest money in a separate fund, are an adequate substitute for general corporate speech and better protect shareholder rights. The majority, by contrast, had argued that most corporations are too small and lack the resources and raw number of shareholders and management staff necessary to maintain compliance, accounting and administrative costs of a PAC. In this dispute, the opposing views essentially discussed differing types of entities: Stevens focused his argument on large, publicly held corporations while the justices in the majority, particularly Justice Scalia's concurring opinion, placed an emphasis on small, closely held corporations and non-profits.\n\nStevens called the majority's faith in \"corporate democracy\" an unrealistic method for a shareholder to oppose political funding. A derivative suit is slow, inefficient, risky and potentially expensive. Likewise, shareholder meetings only happen a few times a year, not prior to every decision or transaction. Rather, the officers and boards control the day-to-day spending, including political spending. According to Stevens, the shareholders have few options, giving them \"virtually nonexistent\" recourse for opposing a corporation's political spending. Furthermore, most shareholders use investment intermediaries, such as mutual funds or pensions, and by the time a shareholder may find out about a corporation's political spending and try to object, the damage is done and the shareholder has funded disfavored speech.\n\nStevens concluded his dissent by writing:\n\nThere was a wide range of reactions to the case from politicians, academics, attorneys, advocacy groups and journalists.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a plaintiff in the earlier related decision \"McConnell v. FEC\", said: \n\nRepublican campaign consultant Ed Rollins opined that the decision adds transparency to the election process and will make it more competitive.\n\nCitizens United, the group filing the lawsuit, said, \"Today's U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing Citizens United to air its documentary films and advertisements is a tremendous victory, not only for Citizens United but for every American who desires to participate in the political process.\" During litigation, Citizens United had support from the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association.\n\nCampaign finance attorney Cleta Mitchell, who had filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of two advocacy organizations opposing the ban, wrote that \"The Supreme Court has correctly eliminated a constitutionally flawed system that allowed media corporations (e.g., The Washington Post Co.) to freely disseminate their opinions about candidates using corporate treasury funds, while denying that constitutional privilege to Susie's Flower Shop Inc. ... The real victims of the corporate expenditure ban have been nonprofit advocacy organizations across the political spectrum.\"\n\nHeritage Foundation fellow Hans A. von Spakovsky, a former Republican member of the Federal Election Commission, said \"The Supreme Court has restored a part of the First Amendment that had been unfortunately stolen by Congress and a previously wrongly-decided ruling of the court.\"\n\nLibertarian Cato Institute analysts John Samples and Ilya Shapiro wrote that restrictions on advertising were based on the idea \"that corporations had so much money that their spending would create vast inequalities in speech that would undermine democracy\". They continued, \"To make campaign spending equal or nearly so, the government would have to force some people or groups to spend less than they wished. And equality of speech is inherently contrary to protecting speech from government restraint, which is ultimately the heart of American conceptions of free speech.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union filed an amicus brief that supported the decision, saying that \"section 203 should now be struck down as facially unconstitutional\", though membership was split over the implications of the ruling and its board sent the issue to its special committee on campaign finance for further consideration. On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's \"Citizens United\" ruling.\n\nBradley A. Smith, professor of law at Capital University Law School, former chairman of the FEC, founder of the Center for Competitive Politics and a leading proponent of deregulation of campaign finance, wrote that the major opponents of political free speech are \"incumbent politicians\" who \"are keen to maintain a chokehold on such speech\". Empowering \"small and midsize corporations – and every incorporated mom-and-pop falafel joint, local firefighters' union, and environmental group – to make its voice heard\" frightens them. In response to statements by President Obama and others that the ruling would allow foreign entities to gain political influence through U.S. subsidiaries, Smith pointed out that the decision did not overturn the ban on political donations by foreign corporations and the prohibition on any involvement by foreign nationals in decisions regarding political spending by U.S. subsidiaries, which are covered by other parts of the law.\n\nCampaign finance expert Jan Baran, a member of the Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, agreed with the decision, writing that \"The history of campaign finance reform is the history of incumbent politicians seeking to muzzle speakers, any speakers, particularly those who might publicly criticize them and their legislation. It is a lot easier to legislate against unions, gun owners, 'fat cat' bankers, health insurance companies and any other industry or 'special interest' group when they can't talk back.\" Baran further noted that in general conservatives and libertarians praised the ruling's preservation of the First Amendment and freedom of speech, but that liberals and campaign finance reformers criticized it as greatly expanding the role of corporate money in politics.\n\nAttorney Kenneth Gross, former associate general counsel of the FEC, wrote that corporations relied more on the development of long-term relationships, political action committees and personal contributions, which were not affected by the decision. He held that while trade associations might seek to raise funds and support candidates, corporations which have \"signed on to transparency agreements regarding political spending\" may not be eager to give.\n\n\"The New York Times\" asked seven academics to opine on how corporate money would reshape politics as a result of the court's decision. Three of the seven wrote that the effects would be minimal or positive: Christopher Cotton, a University of Miami School of Business assistant professor of economics, wrote that \"There may be very little difference between seeing eight ads or seeing nine ads (compared to seeing one ad or two). And, voters recognize that richer candidates are not necessarily the better candidates, and in some cases, the benefit of running more ads is offset by the negative signal that spending a lot of money creates. Eugene Volokh, a professor of law at UCLA, stated that the \"most influential actors in most political campaigns\" are media corporations which \"overtly editorialize for and against candidates, and also influence elections by choosing what to cover and how to cover it\". Holding that corporations like Exxon would fear alienating voters by supporting candidates, the decision really meant that voters would hear \"more messages from more sources\". Joel Gora, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who had previously argued the case of \"Buckley v. Valeo\" on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the decision represented \"a great day for the First Amendment\" writing that the Court had \"dismantled the First Amendment 'caste system' in election speech\".\n\nThe Editorial Board of the \"San Antonio Express-News\" criticized McCain–Feingold's exception for media corporations from the ban on corporate electioneering, writing that it \"makes no sense\" that the paper could make endorsements up until the day of the election but advocacy groups could not. \"While the influence of money on the political process is troubling and sometimes corrupting, abridging political speech is the wrong way to counterbalance that influence.\"\n\nAnthony Dick in \"National Review\" countered a number of arguments against the decision, asking rhetorically, \"is there something uniquely harmful and/or unworthy of protection about political messages that come from corporations and unions, as opposed to, say, rich individuals, persuasive writers, or charismatic demagogues?\" He noted that \"a recent Gallup poll shows that a majority of the public actually agrees with the Court that corporations and unions should be treated just like individuals in terms of their political-expenditure rights\". A Gallup poll taken in October 2009 and released soon after the decision showed 57 percent of those surveyed agreed that contributions to political candidates are a form of free speech and 55 percent agreed that the same rules should apply to individuals, corporations and unions. Sixty-four percent of Democrats and Republicans believed campaign donations are a form of free speech.\n\n\"Chicago Tribune\" editorial board member Steve Chapman wrote \"If corporate advocacy may be forbidden as it was under the law in question, it's not just Exxon Mobil and Citigroup that are rendered mute. Nonprofit corporations set up merely to advance goals shared by citizens, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association, also have to put a sock in it. So much for the First Amendment goal of fostering debate about public policy.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama stated that the decision \"gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington – while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates\". Obama later elaborated in his weekly radio address saying, \"this ruling strikes at our democracy itself\" and \"I can't think of anything more devastating to the public interest\". On January 27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, \"Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations – to spend without limit in our elections. Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities.\" On television, the camera shifted to a shot of the SCOTUS judges in the front row directly in front of the President while he was making this statement, and Justice Samuel Alito was frowning, shaking his head side to side while mouthing the words \"Not true\".\n\nDemocratic Senator Russ Feingold, a lead sponsor of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, stated \"This decision was a terrible mistake. Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue, the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president.\" Representative Alan Grayson, a Democrat, stated that it was \"the worst Supreme Court decision since the \"Dred Scott case\", and that the court had opened the door to political bribery and corruption in elections to come. Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards, along with constitutional law professor and Maryland Democratic State Senator Jamie Raskin, have advocated petitions to reverse the decision by means of constitutional amendment. Rep. Leonard Boswell introduced legislation to amend the constitution. Senator John Kerry also called for an Amendment to overrule the decision. On December 8, 2011, Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the Saving American Democracy Amendment, which would reverse the court's ruling.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain, co-crafter of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and the party's 2008 presidential nominee, said \"there's going to be, over time, a backlash ... when you see the amounts of union and corporate money that's going to go into political campaigns\". McCain was \"disappointed by the decision of the Supreme Court and the lifting of the limits on corporate and union contributions\" but not surprised by the decision, saying that \"It was clear that Justice Roberts, Alito and Scalia, by their very skeptical and even sarcastic comments, were very much opposed to BCRA.\" Republican Senator Olympia Snowe opined that \"Today's decision was a serious disservice to our country.\"\n\nAlthough federal law after \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\" still prohibited corporate contributions to all political parties, Sanda Everette, co-chair of the Green Party, stated that \"The ruling especially hurts the ability of parties that don't accept corporate contributions, like the Green Party, to compete.\" Another Green Party officer, Rich Whitney, stated \"In a transparently political decision, a majority of the US Supreme Court overturned its own recent precedent and paid tribute to the giant corporate interests that already wield tremendous power over our political process and political speech.\"\n\nRalph Nader condemned the ruling, saying that \"With this decision, corporations can now directly pour vast amounts of corporate money, through independent expenditures, into the electoral swamp already flooded with corporate campaign PAC contribution dollars.\" He called for shareholder resolutions asking company directors to pledge not to use company money to favor or oppose electoral candidates. Pat Choate, former Reform Party candidate for Vice President, stated, \"The court has, in effect, legalized foreign governments and foreign corporations to participate in our electoral politics.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a contender in the 2016 Democratic Primary, has filed a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's Decision. Further, both Sanders and Hillary Clinton said that, if they were elected, they would only have appointed Supreme Court Justices who were committed to the repeal of Citizens United. In September 2015, Sanders said that \"the foundations of American Democracy are being undermined\" and called for sweeping campaign finance reform. Sanders repeated such calls in the years since.\n\nAmbassador Janez Lenarčič, speaking for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (which has overseen over 150 elections) said the ruling may adversely affect the organization's two commitments of \"giving voters a genuine choice and giving candidates a fair chance\" in that \"it threatens to further marginalize candidates without strong financial backing or extensive personal resources, thereby in effect narrowing the political arena\".\n\nThe constitutional law scholar Laurence H. Tribe wrote that the decision \"marks a major upheaval in First Amendment law and signals the end of whatever legitimate claim could otherwise have been made by the Roberts Court to an incremental and minimalist approach to constitutional adjudication, to a modest view of the judicial role vis-à-vis the political branches, or to a genuine concern with adherence to precedent\" and pointed out, \"Talking about a business corporation as merely another way that individuals might choose to organize their association with one another to pursue their common expressive aims is worse than unrealistic; it obscures the very real injustice and distortion entailed in the phenomenon of some people using other people's money to support candidates they have made no decision to support, or to oppose candidates they have made no decision to oppose.\"\n\nFormer Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose opinions had changed from dissenting in \"Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce\" to co-authoring (with Stevens) the majority opinion in \"McConnell v. Federal Election Commission\" twelve years later, criticized the decision only obliquely, but warned, \"In invalidating some of the existing checks on campaign spending, the majority in \"Citizens United\" has signaled that the problem of campaign contributions in judicial elections might get considerably worse and quite soon.\"\n\nRichard L. Hasen, professor of election law at Loyola Law School, argued that the ruling \"is activist, it increases the dangers of corruption in our political system and it ignores the strong tradition of American political equality\". He also described Justice Kennedy's \"specter of blog censorship\" as sounding more like \"the rantings of a right-wing talk show host than the rational view of a justice with a sense of political realism\".\n\nKathleen M. Sullivan, professor at Stanford Law School and Steven J. Andre, adjunct professor at Lincoln Law School, argued that two different visions of freedom of speech exist and clashed in the case. An egalitarian vision skeptical of the power of large agglomerations of wealth to skew the political process conflicted with a libertarian vision skeptical of government being placed in the role of determining what speech people should or should not hear. Wayne Batchis, Professor at the University of Delaware, in contrast, argues that the Citizens United decision represents a misguided interpretation of the non-textual freedom of association.\n\nThe four other scholars of the seven writing in the aforementioned \"The New York Times\" article were critical. Richard L. Hasen, Distinguished Professor of election law at Loyola Law School argued differently from his Slate article above, concentrating on the \"inherent risk of corruption that comes when someone spends independently to try to influence the outcome of judicial elections\", since judges are less publicly accountable than elected officials. Heather K. Gerken, Professor of Law at Yale Law School wrote that \"The court has done real damage to the cause of reform, but that damage mostly came earlier, with decisions that made less of a splash.\" Michael Waldman, director of the Brennan Center for Justice at N.Y.U. School of Law, opined that the decision \"matches or exceeds \"Bush v. Gore\" in ideological or partisan overreaching by the court\", explaining how \"Exxon or any other firm could spend Bloomberg-level sums in any congressional district in the country against, say, any congressman who supports climate change legislation, or health care, etc.\" and Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of Democracy 21 considered that \"Chief Justice Roberts has abandoned the illusory public commitments he made to 'judicial modesty' and 'respect for precedent' to cast the deciding vote for a radical decision that profoundly undermines our democracy,\" and that \"Congress and presidents past have recognized this danger and signed numerous laws over the years to prevent this kind of corruption of our government.\"\n\nIn a \"TIME\" Magazine survey of over 50 law professors, Richard Delgado (University of Alabama), Cass Sunstein (Harvard), and Jenny Martinez (Stanford) all listed \"Citizens United\" as the “worst Supreme Court decision since 1960,” with Sunstein noting that the decision is “undermining our system of democracy itself.”\n\n\"The New York Times\" stated in an editorial, \"The Supreme Court has handed lobbyists a new weapon. A lobbyist can now tell any elected official: if you vote wrong, my company, labor union or interest group will spend unlimited sums explicitly advertising against your re-election.\" Jonathan Alter called it the \"most serious threat to American democracy in a generation\". The \"Christian Science Monitor\" wrote that the Court had declared \"outright that corporate expenditures cannot corrupt elected officials, that influence over lawmakers is not corruption, and that appearance of influence will not undermine public faith in our democracy\".\n\nIn 2012, Ben Cohen, the co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, founded Stamp Stampede, a sustained protest to demonstrate widespread support for a proposed constitutional amendment to overturn \"Citizens United\". The campaign encourages people to rubber stamp messages such as \"Not To Be Used for Bribing Politicians\" on paper currency. In 2014, Cohen told \"Salon\", \"As long as the Supreme Court rules money is speech, corporations and the wealthy are using it by giving piles of it to politicians to pass or not pass laws that they want. Now, the rest of the people, [those] who don't have that money, can actually make their voice heard by using money to stamp a message out.\"\n\nMost blogs avoided the theoretical aspects of the decision and focused on more personal and dramatic elements, including the Barack Obama–Samuel Alito face-off during the President's State of the Union address. There, President Obama argued that the decision \"reversed a century of law\" (the federal ban on corporate contributions dates back to the 1907 Tillman Act, and the ban on union and corporate expenditures dates from 1947) and that it would allow \"foreign corporations to spend without limits in our elections\", during which Justice Alito, in the audience, perceptibly mouthed the words \"not true\". This event received extensive comment from political bloggers, with a substantial amount of the coverage concentrated on whether or not foreign corporations would be able to make substantial political contributions in US elections. In the opinion, the Court had specifically indicated it was not overturning the ban on foreign contributions.\n\nAn ABC–\"The Washington Post\" poll conducted February 4–8, 2010, showed that 80% of those surveyed opposed (and 65% strongly opposed) the \"Citizens United\" ruling, which the poll described as saying \"corporations and unions can spend as much money as they want to help political candidates win elections\". Additionally, 72% supported \"an effort by Congress to reinstate limits on corporate and union spending on election campaigns\". The poll showed large majority support from Democrats, Republicans and independents.\n\nA Gallup Poll conducted in October 2009, after oral argument, but released after the Supreme Court released its opinion, found that 57 percent of those surveyed \"agreed that money given to political candidates is a form of free speech\" and 55 percent agreed that the \"same rules should apply to individuals, corporations and unions\". In the same poll, however, respondents by 52% to 41% prioritized limits on campaign contributions over protecting rights to support campaigns and 76% thought the government should be able to place limits on corporation or union donations.\n\nSeparate polls by various conservative organizations, including the plaintiff Citizens United and the Center for Competitive Politics, found support for the decision. In particular, the Center for Competitive Politics poll found that 51% of respondents believed that Citizens United should have a right to air ads promoting \"Hillary: The Movie.\" The poll also found that only 22 percent had heard of the case.\n\nPolling conducted by Ipsos in August 2017 found that 48% of Americans oppose the decision and 30% support it, with the remainder having no opinion. It also found that 57% percent of Americans, favored \"limits on the amount of money super PACs can raise and spend\". \n\nSpeechNow is a nonprofit, unincorporated association organized as a section 527 entity under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The organization was formed by individuals who seek to pool their resources to make independent expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates. SpeechNow planned to accept contributions only from individuals, not corporations or other sources prohibited under the Federal Election Campaign Act. On February 14, 2008, SpeechNow and several individual plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign Act provisions governing political committee registration, contribution limits and disclosure. The plaintiffs contended that the Act unconstitutionally restricts their association guaranteed under the First Amendment. By requiring registration as a political committee and limiting the monetary amount that an individual may contribute to a political committee, SpeechNow and the other plaintiffs asserted that the Act unconstitutionally restricted the individuals' freedom of speech by limiting the amount that an individual can contribute to SpeechNow and thus the amount the organization may spend. SpeechNow also argued that the reporting required of political committees is unconstitutionally burdensome.\n\nOn March 26, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in \"SpeechNow.org. v. FEC\" that the contribution limits of 2 U.S.C. §441a were unconstitutional as applied to individuals' contributions to SpeechNow. The court also ruled that the reporting requirements of 2 U.S.C. §§432, 433 and 434(a) and the organizational requirements of 2 U.S.C. §431(4) and §431(8) can be constitutionally applied to SpeechNow. A unanimous nine-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals struck down the federal limits on contributions to federal political committees that make only independent expenditures and do not contribute to candidates or political parties. This type of \"independent expenditure committee\" is inherently non-corruptive, the Court reasoned, and therefore contributions to such a committee can not be limited based on the government's interest in preventing political corruption. In light of the Supreme Court's decision in \"Citizens United v. FEC\", in which the Supreme Court held that the government has no anti-corruption interest in limiting independent expenditures, the appeals court ruled that \"contributions to groups that make only independent expenditures cannot corrupt or create the appearance of corruption.\" As a result, the court of appeals held that the government has no anti-corruption interest in limiting contributions to an independent group such as SpeechNow. Contribution limits as applied to SpeechNow \"violate the First Amendment by preventing [individuals] from donating to SpeechNow in excess of the limits and by prohibiting SpeechNow from accepting donations in excess of the limits.\" The court noted that its holding does not affect direct contributions to candidates, but rather contributions to a group that makes only independent expenditures. The appeals court held that, while disclosure and reporting requirements do impose a burden on First Amendment interests, they \"'impose no ceiling on campaign related activities'\" and \"'do not prevent anyone from speaking.'\" Furthermore, the court held that the additional reporting requirements that the Commission would impose on SpeechNow if it were organized as a political committee are minimal, \"given the relative simplicity with which SpeechNow intends to operate.\" Since SpeechNow already had a number of \"planned contributions\" from individuals, the court ruled that SpeechNow could not compare itself to \"ad hoc groups that want to create themselves on the spur of the moment.\" Since the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate and who is funding that speech, the court held that requiring such disclosure and organization as a political committee are sufficiently important governmental interests to justify the additional reporting and registration burdens on SpeechNow.\n\nOn June 27, 2011, ruling in the consolidated cases of \"Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett\" (No. 10-238) and \"McComish v. Bennett\" (No. 10-239), the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional an Arizona law that provided extra taxpayer-funded support for office seekers who have been outspent by privately funded opponents or by independent political groups. A conservative 5–4 majority of justices said the law violated free speech, concluding the state was impermissibly trying to \"level the playing field\" through a public finance system. Arizona lawmakers had argued there was a compelling state interest in equalizing resources among competing candidates and interest groups. Opponents said the law violated free-speech rights of the privately financed candidates and their contributors, inhibiting fundraising and spending, discouraging participation in campaigns and limiting what voters hear about politics. Chief Justice John Roberts said in the court's majority opinion that the law substantially burdened political speech and was not sufficiently justified to survive First Amendment scrutiny.\n\nAs a consequence of the decision, states and municipalities are blocked from using a method of public financing that is simultaneously likely to attract candidates fearful they will be vastly outspent and sensitive to avoiding needless government expense. \"The government can still use taxpayer funds to subsidize political campaigns, but it can only do that in a manner that provides an alternative to private financing\" said William R. Maurer, a lawyer with Institute for Justice, which represented several challengers of the law. \"It cannot create disincentives.\" The ruling meant the end of similar matching-fund programs in Connecticut, Maine and a few other places according to David Primo, a political science professor at University of Rochester who was an expert witness for the law's challengers.\n\nDespite the \"Citizens United\" ruling, in December 2011, the Montana Supreme Court, in \"Western Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Attorney General of Montana,\" upheld that state's law limiting corporate contributions. Examining the history of corporate interference in Montana government that led to the Corrupt Practices Law, the majority decided that the state still had a compelling reason to maintain the restrictions. It ruled that these restrictions on speech were narrowly tailored and withstood strict scrutiny and thus did not contradict \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\".\n\nWhile granting permission to file a certiorari petition, the US Supreme Court agreed to stay the Montana ruling, although Justices Ginsburg and Breyer wrote a short statement urging the Court \"to consider whether, in light of the huge sums of money currently deployed to buy candidate's allegiance, \"Citizens United\" should continue to hold sway\". In June 2012, over the dissent of the same four judges who dissented in \"Citizens United\", the Court simultaneously granted certiorari and summarily reversed the decision in \"American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock\", 567, U.S. __ (2012). The Supreme Court majority rejected the Montana Supreme Court arguments in a two paragraph, twenty line per curiam opinion, stating that these arguments \"either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.\" The ruling makes clear that states cannot bar corporate and union political expenditures in state elections.\n\nIn addition to limiting the size of donations to individual candidates and parties, the Federal Election Campaign Act also includes aggregate caps on the total amount that an individual may give to all candidates and parties. In 2012, Shaun McCutcheon, a Republican Party activist, sought to donate more than was allowed by the federal aggregate limit on federal candidates. McCutcheon \"et al\" filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC). In 2014, the US Supreme Court reversed a ruling of the DC District Court's dismissal of \"McCutcheon v. FEC\" and struck down the aggregate limits. The plurality opinion invalidated only the aggregate contribution limits, not limits on giving to any one candidate or party. The decisive fifth vote for McCutcheon came from Justice Thomas, who concurred in the judgment on the grounds that all contribution limits are unconstitutional.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that 24 states with laws prohibiting or limiting independent expenditures by unions and corporations would have to change their campaign finance laws because of the ruling.\n\nAfter \"Citizens United\" and \"SpeechNow.org\" numerous state legislatures raised their limits on contributions to candidates and parties. At the federal level, lawmakers substantially increased contribution limits to political parties as part of the 2014 budget bill. Such changes are widely perceived as efforts to place candidates and parties on something closer to equal footing with organizations making independent expenditures.\n\nWhile many states and the federal government have raised contribution limits in response to \"Citizens United\", proposals aimed at discouraging political spending, or providing for public financing of campaigns, have been less successful.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin (D-IL) proposed that candidates who sign up small donors receive $900,000 in public money, but the proposal has not been acted on by Congress. Others proposed that laws on corporate governance be amended to assure that shareholders vote on political expenditures.\n\nIn February 2010, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, immediate past Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, outlined legislation aimed at undoing the decision. In April 2010, they introduced such legislation in the Senate and House, respectively. On June 24, 2010, H.R.5175 (The DISCLOSE Act) passed in the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate. It would have required additional disclosure by corporations of their campaign expenditures. The law, if passed, would also have prohibited political spending by U.S. companies with twenty percent or more foreign ownership, and by most government contractors. The DISCLOSE Act included exemptions to its rules given to certain special interests such as the National Rifle Association and the American Association of Retired Persons. These gaps within the proposal attracted criticism from lawmakers on both political parties. \"They are auctioning off pieces of the First Amendment in this bill... The bigger you are, the stronger you are, the less disclosure you have,\" said Republican Congressman Dan Lungren of California. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California commented, \"I wish there had been no carve-outs\".\nThe bill was criticized as prohibiting much activity that was legal before \"Citizens United\".\n\nThe DISCLOSE Act twice failed to pass the U.S. Senate in the 111th Congress, in both instances reaching only 59 of the 60 votes required to overcome a unified Republican filibuster. A scaled down version of the DISCLOSE Act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate in 2012 but did not pass.\n\nSome have argued for a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision. Although the decision does not address \"corporate personhood,\" a long-established judicial and constitutional concept, much attention has focused on that issue. Move to Amend, a coalition formed in response to the ruling, seeks to amend the Constitution to abolish corporate personhood, thus stripping corporations of all rights under the Constitution. In an online chat with web community Reddit, President Obama endorsed further consideration of a constitutional amendment and stated \"Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it)\". He further elaborated that \"Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight on the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.\"\n\nMembers of 16 state legislatures have called for a constitutional amendment to reverse the court's decision: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia.\n\nMost of these are non-binding resolutions, but three states – Vermont, California, and Illinois – called for an Article V Convention to draft and propose a federal constitutional amendment to overturn \"Citizens United\". In Minnesota, the Minnesota Senate passed a similar resolution, \"Senate File No. 17,\" on May 2, 2013, but the House of Representatives returned the measure to the General Calendar (meaning the measure did not pass) on May 15, 2013. Thirty-four states are needed to call an Article V convention.\n\nOn a local level, Washington D.C. and 400 other municipalities passed resolutions requesting a federal constitutional amendment.\n\nSince \"Citizens United\", however, 13 states have actually raised their contribution limits.\n\nThe \"Citizens United\" ruling \"opened the door\" for unlimited election spending by corporations, but most of this spending has \"ended up being funneled through the groups that have become known as super PACs.\" Critics predicted that the ruling would \"bring about a new era of corporate influence in politics,\" allowing companies and businesspeople to \"buy elections\" to promote their financial interests. Instead large expenditures, usually through \"Super PACS,\" have come from \"a small group of billionaires\", based largely on ideology. This has shifted power \"away from the political parties and toward the ... donors themselves. In part, this explains the large number and variety of candidates fielded by the Republicans in 2016.\"\n\n\"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\" has often been credited for the creation of \"super PACs\", political action committees which make no financial contributions to candidates or parties, and so can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations and unions. Certainly, the holding in \"Citizens United\" helped affirm the legal basis for super PACs by deciding that, for purposes of establishing a \"compelling government interest\" of corruption sufficient to justify government limitations on political speech, \"independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption\".\n\nIt took another decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \"Speechnow.org v. Federal Election Commission\", to actually authorize the creation of super PACs. While \"Citizens United\" held that corporations and unions could make independent expenditures, a separate provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act, at least as long interpreted by the Federal Election Commission, held that individuals could not contribute to a common fund without it becoming a PAC. PACs, in turn, were not allowed to accept corporate or union contributions of any size or to accept individual contributions in excess of $5,000. In \"Speechnow.org\", the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, held 9–0 that in light of \"Citizens United\", such restrictions on the sources and size of contributions could not apply to an organization that made only independent expenditures in support of or opposition to a candidate but not contributions to a candidate's campaign.\n\n\"Citizens United\" and \"SpeechNOW\" left their imprint on the 2012 United States presidential election, in which single individuals contributed large sums to \"super PACs\" supporting particular candidates. Sheldon Adelson, the gambling entrepreneur, gave approximately fifteen million dollars to support Newt Gingrich. Foster Friess, a Wyoming financier, donated almost two million dollars to Rick Santorum’s super PAC. Karl Rove organized super PACs that spent over $300 million in support of Republicans during the 2012 elections.\n\nIn addition to indirectly providing support for the creation of super PACs, \"Citizens United\" allowed incorporated 501(c)(4) public advocacy groups (such as the National Rifle Association, the Sierra Club, and the group Citizens United itself) and trade associations to make expenditures in political races. Such groups may not, under the tax code, have a primary purpose of engaging in electoral advocacy. These organizations must disclose their expenditures, but unlike super PACs they do not have to include the names of their donors in their FEC filings. A number of partisan organizations such as Karl Rove's influential conservative Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies and the liberal 21st Century Colorado have since registered as tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups (defined as groups promoting \"social welfare\") and engaged in substantial political spending. This has led to claims of large secret donations, and questions about whether such groups should be required to disclose their donors. Historically, such non-profits have not been required to disclose their donors or names of members. See \"National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama\".\n\nIn an August 2015 essay in \"Der Spiegel\", Markus Feldkirchen wrote that the \"Citizens United\" decision was \"now becoming visible for the first time\" in federal elections as the super-rich have \"radically\" increased donations to support their candidates and positions via super PACs. Feldkirchen also said in the first six months of 2015 the candidates and their super PACs received close to $400 million: \"far more than in the entire previous campaign.\" He opined that super-rich donating more than ever before to individual campaigns plus the \"enormous\" chasm in wealth has given the super-rich the power to steer the economic and political direction of the United States and undermine its democracy. In October 2015, \"The New York Times\" observed that just 158 super-rich families each contributed $250,000 or more, while an additional 200 families gave more than $100,000 for the 2016 presidential election. Both groups contributed almost half of the \"early money\" for candidates in the 2016 presidential election as of June 30, 2015 through channels like super PACs legalized by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision.\n\nAt least in the Republican Party, the Citizens United ruling has weakened the fund raising power of the Republican \"establishment\" in the form of the \"three major\" Republican campaign committees (Republican National Committee, National Republican Congressional Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee). Columnist Thomas B. Edsall notes that in 2008, \"the last election before the Citizens United decision\", the three campaign committees \"raised six times\" the money that \"nonparty conservative organizations\" did — $657.6 million vs. $111.9 million. By 2016 those party committees raised less than the independent groups — $652.4 million v. $810.4 million. Thus the new funding \"freed candidates to defy\" the party establishment, although not it seems, move policy making away from traditional Republican priorities.\n\nStudies have shown that the Citizens United ruling gave Republicans an advantage in subsequent elections. One study by political scientists at University of Chicago, Columbia University and the London School of Economics found \"that Citizens United increased the GOP’s average seat share in the state legislature by five percentage points. That is a large effect — large enough that, were it applied to the past twelve Congresses, partisan control of the House would have switched eight times. In line with a previous study, we also find that the vote share of Republican candidates increased three to four points, on average.\" A 2016 study in \"the Journal of Law and Economics\" found \"that Citizens United is associated with an increase in Republicans’ election probabilities in state house races of approximately 4 percentage points overall and 10 or more percentage points in several states. We link these estimates to on-the-ground evidence of significant spending by corporations through channels enabled by Citizens United.\"\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

It is a subset of the broader environmental movement, but some regard it as a new social movement itself given its scope, strength and activities.\n\nThe climate movement has rapidly evolved in the first decades of the 21st century, starting as one of the many causes of the environmental movement. \n\nActivism related to climate change began in the 1990s, when major environmental organizations became involved in the discussions about climate, mainly in the UNFCCC framework. In the 2000s several climate-specific organizations were founded, such as 350.org, Energy Action Coalition, and the Global Call for Climate Action.\n\nThe 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen was the first UNFCCC summit in which the climate movement started showing its mobilization power at a large scale. Between 40,000 and 100,000 people attended a march in Copenhagen on December 12 calling for a global agreement on climate. And activism went beyond Copenhagen, with more than 5,400 rallies and demonstrations took place around the world simultaneously.\n\nThe climate movement convened its largest single event in September 21, 2014, when it mobilized 400.000 activists in New York during the People’s Climate March (plus several thousands more in other cities), to demand a climate action from the global leaders gathered for the 2014 UN Climate Summit.\n\nThe Fossil Fuel Divestment movement calls for colleges and universities, as well as cities, states, religious institutions, and pension funds to withdraw their investments from fossil fuel companies. 350.org launched their Go Fossil Free campaign in 2012 with Bill McKibben's \"Do The Math\" speaking tour around the country. 350.org explains that the reasoning behind this campaign is simple: \"If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage.\" The Fossil Fuel Divestment movement escalated tactics in the spring of 2015, with 19 students arrested at Yale University, a week-long blockade of Harvard University's administrative buildings, a 70-student sit-in at Tulane University, and other arrestable actions.\n\nSince 2014, growing portions of the climate movement, especially in the United States have been organizing for an international economic response to climate change on the scale of the mobilization of the American home front during World War II, with the goal of rapidly slashing carbon emissions and transitioning to 100% clean energy faster than the free market is likely to allow. Throughout 2015 and 2016, The Climate Mobilization led grassroots campaigns in the U.S. for this scale of ambition, and in July 2016, activists succeeded in getting text adopted into the Democratic Party's national platform calling for WWII-scale climate mobilization. In August 2015, environmentalist Bill McKibben published an article in the New Republic rallying Americans to \"declare war on climate change.\"\n\nThe climate movement is closely connected to other parts of the environmental movement, in particular groups aiming for a sustainable society and sustainable energy.\nAlso the faith community has been active in the climate movement, both at an interfaith level (such as in Our Voices) and at the specific level of each denomination (such as the Global Catholic Climate Movement).\n\n"}
{"id": "22166508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22166508", "title": "Congressional Baseball Game", "text": "Congressional Baseball Game\n\nThe Congressional Baseball Game for Charity is an annual baseball game played each summer by members of the United States Congress. The game began as a casual event among colleagues in 1909 and eventually evolved into one of Washington, D.C.'s most anticipated annual pastimes, according to the House of Representatives Office of the Historian. In the game, Republicans and Democrats form separate teams and play against each other.\n\nToday, the game raises money for three local charities: The Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington, The Washington Nationals Dream Foundation, and The Washington Literacy Center. The game is usually attended by crowds of congressional staffers and, occasionally, even dignitaries and US Presidents.\n\nThe 1909 game was organized by Representative John Tener of Pennsylvania, a former professional baseball player. The \"Boston Daily Globe\" observed, \"The game was brewing for weeks and the members of the house were keyed up a high pitch of enthusiasm. Deep, dark rumors were in circulation that 'ringers' would be introduced, but when they lined up at 4 o'clock the nine Republicans were stalwart, grand old party men, while the Democrats were of the pure Jeffersonian strain.\"\n\nThe Democrats beat their Republican opponents, 26–16 in the first game and continued their winning streak for the first six games. Republicans won their first game in 1916. Due to its growing popularity, the Congressional Baseball Game was first covered via radio in 1928. The radio broadcast continued in succeeding years.\n\nThe event has at times interrupted the work flow of Congress. In 1914, Speaker James Beauchamp \"Champ\" Clark of Missouri became frustrated with the Congressional Baseball Game interfering with legislative business. An Appropriations bill on Civil War cotton damage was to be debated on the House floor, but a quorum was not present because of the game.\n\nDespite its appeal, the annual game occurred intermittently because of interruptions due to the Great Depression, the Second World War, and intervention by the House leadership. For a while the game was held biennially, until the Washington Evening Star newspaper sponsored it annually from 1946 to 1958. Despite the sponsorship, Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas ended the game in 1958, saying it had become too physically straining on the members and was causing injuries. With the new sponsor, the \"Roll Call\" Trophy was created, for the team that wins each best-of-five series. It was first awarded in 1965—to the Republican team, which was the first team to win three games since \"Roll Call\" had begun its sponsorship. Since 1965, a new trophy is awarded to the next team to win three games (over the next three, four, or five years), following the year in which the most recent trophy was awarded. As of the 2017 game, 14 trophies have been awarded—ten to the Republicans' team and four to the Democrats' team.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, one day before the annual event, a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress who were practicing for the next day's game. Four people were shot including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. The gunman was himself shot by Capitol Police and died at a nearby hospital later that day. Despite discussions about postponing the game, officials said the game would be held as scheduled. The shooting resulted in a dramatic increase in interest for the game; it was reported that revenue from ticket sales and online donations had exceeded $1 million, and organizers stated that 24,959 people were in attendance C-SPAN also announced that it would televise the game.\n\nThe Game was originally played at the American League Park. However, after the park's destruction in a fire in March 1911, it was played at the Griffith Stadium built on the same site in Northwest Washington, D.C. In 1962, it was moved to the new District Stadium (later renamed Robert F. Kennedy Stadium). It remained there until 1972, when the Washington Senators moved to Texas becoming the Texas Rangers as RFK did not need a long-term baseball seating layout or field. It moved for the next two decades to the Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, then to Langley High School in McLean, Virginia for 1977; and Four Mile Run Park in Alexandria, Virginia. From 1995 to 2004, the game was played in Prince George's Stadium in Bowie, Maryland. From 2005 to 2007, the event returned to RFK Stadium when the Montreal Expos moved to Washington to become the Washington Nationals. In 2008, Nationals Park was completed and the Nationals moved there along with the Congressional Baseball Game.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a post-game reception for members of Congress and their staffs was organized and sponsored by Sears, Roebuck and Company. However, attendance was very low until 1972 when Sears' Washington office Public Information officer, Larry Horist took over the management of the event, and established the Most Valuable Player awards to be voted by each team and presented by the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate. He also obtained photos of the players in their hometown uniforms, producing baseball cards packaged in gum wrappers. A limited number of autographed master sheets of the cards occasionally appear for sale on Internet auction sites. The cards included such personalities as Senator Eugene McCarthy (D-MN), Barry Goldwater, Jr. (R-AZ), and professional player \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell (R-NC). The cards were publicized in the \"Washington Post\" and became part of the permanent collection of the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile the modern Congressional Baseball Game comprises both House and Senate Members, this was not always the case. From 1909 to 1949, House Members exclusively filled the rosters—although there appears to have been no prohibition against Senators. Bicameral baseball was inaugurated in 1950, when Senator Harry P. Cain of Washington joined the Republican team and Senator-elect George Smathers of Florida, a former Representative, joined the Democratic team.\n\nIn a few cases, former professional baseball players were elected to Congress and had a large impact on the game. In the case of Wilmer \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell of North Carolina, a former professional pitcher, the Republican team was victorious for each year that he played. Fielding a once-a-year team presented some problems for members, who often grew rusty when it came to batting. Strong pitching proved decisive in most games but, in 1963, neither team could field a pitcher. As a result, relief pitcher George Susce of the Washington Senators pitched for both teams.\n\nIn 1917, Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana tossed out the first pitch and kept score, becoming the first woman to participate in the annual event. More than 70 years later, in 1993, Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Maria Cantwell of Washington, and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas became the first women to break into the starting lineup.\n\nIn 1971, the first African Americans joined the game. Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy of the District of Columbia and Rep. Ron Dellums of California joined the Democratic roster. Despite Fauntroy's hitting prowess, the Democrats lost their eighth straight annual game, 7–3.\n\nIn 1909, Rep. Joseph F. O'Connell of Massachusetts hit the first home run, gaining three runs for the Democrats. In the same year, Republican Rep. Edward B. Vreeland of New York was the first player to be withdrawn due to an injury. In 1957, Rep. Gerald Ford of Michigan hit the first known grand slam, while playing for the Republicans. In 1979, Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas hit what was believed to be (at that time) the first home run hit over the fence. Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois is the only other player to hit an out-of-the-park home run, doing so in 1997. Paul was inducted into the Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame prior to the 2012 game.\n\nThe \"Roll Call\" Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame was founded in 1993.\nIn the early years of the game, each team wore a uniform that was either plain or had the words \"Republicans\" or \"Democrats\" embroidered on it. In modern games, members typically have worn uniforms of the professional baseball teams or college baseball teams in their congressional district or home state. In the 1920s, pomp and fanfare preceded each game. The United States Navy Band and United States Marine Corps Band traditionally kicked off the festivities with patriotic tunes. In 1926, the Republicans paraded into American League Field on a live elephant, while in 1932 both teams had costumed mascots entertain the crowds. During the 1960s, the teams had cheerleaders dressed in uniforms.\n\nAs of the 2018 game, Republicans lead the all-time series, 42–41–1. Scores, locations, and other details of past games are available here to the extent they are known.\n\n"}
{"id": "41585977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41585977", "title": "Conjugal dictatorship", "text": "Conjugal dictatorship\n\nA \"conjugal dictatorship\" is the unofficial phrase to denote the rule of Philippine president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda to describe a type of family dictatorship. It originated from a book titled \"The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos\" by Primitivo Mijares that was written in 1976 within the decade after the proclamation of martial law.\n\nMijares, the author who coined the phrase, disappeared after the publication of his book and his son Boyet Mijares was later found dead after being tortured brutally and dropped from a helicopter. Police investigations led by Panfilo Lacson claimed that Mijares' son was a victim of hazing by University of the Philippines Tau Gamma fraternity and the accused fraternity members were sentenced to death. Journalist Raissa Robles contests that the son, Luis Manuel “Boyet” Mijares, wasn’t even about to enter college, as he still had a year of high school to finish and that the fate of the accused fraternity members seems suspicious: two escaped from prison and the third died of a heart attack in detention.\n\nThe phrase alludes to the power held by both halves of the couple, especially Imelda, who began to wield much more influence than that of the typical First Lady. Imelda was able to hold many more positions in government than any other First Lady of the Philippines before her. These appointments allowed her to build structures in and around the capital of Manila and act as a \"de facto\" diplomat who traveled the world and met state leaders.\n\nSupporters, loyalists and even propagandists of the Marcos regime criticize the use of the term because they believe that the era of the Marcos' and Martial Law was the \"golden age\" of the Philippines. The children of the Marcos couple: Imee, Bongbong, and Irene, reject the use of the term to describe their parents which they believe is an insult to their legacy. Meanwhile, opponents of the Marcos dictatorship use the word to highlight the excesses of the couple and the greed and plunder that occurred during their 20-year rule. Critics, such as the relatives of the \"desaparecidos\", also use the term to describe human rights abuses by the regime during their rule together.\n\nA journalist who had become a propagandist and confidant for Ferdinand Marcos, Primitivo “Tibo” Mijares had served under Marcos since 1963 and claimed to have been privy to government’s high-level doings. As Chairman of the National Press Club, Mijares ran the Media Advisory Council, a state agency established to censor the press in 1973. Upon the declaration of martial law in September 1972, and with the power to choose which media outlet would be re-opened, the Mijares-led Media Advisory Council was accused of abusing its role and was criticized as a \"money-raising tool,\" leading one of its members, Emil Jurado, to resign. Mijares himself, after failing to account for NPC funds, ran away to the US, and joined Manglapus' Movement for a Free Philippines and wrote the book. Mijares said that he was offered a bribe amounting to US$100,000 to be dissuaded to testify about the human rights situation in the Philippines, and said that he refused the bribe. However, whether there was a bribe by Marcos' associates or whether Mijares himself extorted money from Marcos, and whether Mijares actually received money from Marcos remains unclear. Steve Psinakis, an anti-Marcos critic married into the Lopez family that owns ABS-CBN, wrote in his memoir A Country Not Even His Own” (2008): “The investigation (referring to the U.S. Justice Department investigation) revealed that after his February 1975 defection, Mijares did, in fact extort money from Marcos by feeding him imaginary information for which Marcos was ignorant enough to pay considerable sums. While Mijares was still receiving money from Marcos, he was at the same time lambasting Marcos in the U.S. press, causing the Marcos regime irreparable damage. It is no wonder the only natural conclusion is that Marcos had his vengeance and did Mijares in.”\n\nA declassified U.S. Department of State cable dated February 24, 1975 further casts doubt on Mijares credibility, noting that \"Mijares' moved not surprising to Manila Community which recognizes him as complete opportunist who recently was feeling hot breath of Martial Law Regime for certain recent extra-curricular activities. Allegedly, Mijares gambled away 50,000 dollars of GOP funds during a 1974 Las Vegas visit, misappropriated for personal use 7,000 dollars of the First Lady's personal funds and attempted to rape a well connected Philippine foreign service secretary while in New York for the trade center opening,\" and that \"final push to action may in fact have been provided by Philippine opposition group in US and financial inducements of Lopez family members. Local Lopezes got word of San Francisco story February 21 and quickly began telephoning glad news around town.\"\n\nSome of the book's claims have been refuted after more than a decade since its publication. For example, the book insinuated that Marcos plotted the Plaza Miranda bombing to wipe out the entire Liberal Party leadership and that the weapon landing from China for the communists along the coast of Isabela was 'staged'. The communists have since admitted to the plot to bomb Plaza Miranda, and former NPA Victor Corpuz admitted that their plot was foiled when the weapons that they were about to receive from communist China was intercepted by the military.\n\nOn May 2016, the heirs of Primitivo Mijares released \"The Conjugal Dictatorship\" as a free e-book download from the Ateneo de Manila Rizal Library.\n\nIn February 2017, a revised and annotated reprint of the book was released by Mijares' grandson Joseph Christopher \"JC\" Mijares Gurango. The Mijares family admitted that what happened to Primitivo and his youngest son Boyet was so traumatic that they did not want to talk about it, but decided to break their silence with the resurgence of Marcos in the political scene, culminated by the burial of Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani and near victory of the dictator's namesake and son Ferdinand Jr. in the 2016 national elections. The revised edition was aimed for the \"new generation of readers\", referring to the millennials, as well as new annotations and \"verification of sources\".\n\n"}
{"id": "12870574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12870574", "title": "Dictator novel", "text": "Dictator novel\n\nThe dictator novel () is a genre of Latin American literature that challenges the role of the dictator in Latin American society. The theme of \"caudillismo\"—the régime of a charismatic \"caudillo\", a political strongman—is addressed by examining the relationships between power, dictatorship, and writing. Moreover, a dictator novel often is an allegory for the role of the writer in a Latin American society. Although mostly associated with the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, the dictator-novel genre has its roots in the nineteenth-century non-fiction work \"Facundo\" (1845), by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. As an indirect critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas's dictatorial régime in Argentina, \"Facundo\" is the forerunner of the dictator novel genre; all subsequent dictator novels hearken back to it. As established by Sarmiento, the goal of the genre is not to analyze the rule of particular dictators, or to focus on historical accuracy, but to examine the abstract nature of authority figures and of authority in general.\n\nTo be considered a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the \"caudillo\", and some general reflection on the nature of authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes \"I, the Supreme\" (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and \"The Feast of the Goat\" (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in \"Reasons of State\" (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential in the development of a Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the \"caudillo\" whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.\n\nLiterary critic Roberto González Echevarría argues that the dictator novel is “the most clearly indigenous thematic tradition in Latin American literature”, and traces the development of this theme from “as far back as Bernal Díaz del Castillo’s and Francisco López de Gómara’s accounts of Cortés’s conquest of Mexico.” The nineteenth century saw significant literary reflections on political power, though on the whole the dictator novel is associated with the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. For critic Gerald Martin, the dictator novel marks the end of the Boom and even (as he says of Roa Bastos's \"I, the Supreme\") “the end of an entire era in Latin American history, the era which had stretched from Sarmiento's \"Facundo\" in 1845.\" In the 1970s, many dictator novels focused on the figure “of the aging dictator, prey to the boredom of a limitless power he is on the verge of losing.”\n\nMiguel Ángel Asturias's \"El Señor Presidente\" (written in 1933, but not published until 1946) is, in the opinion of critic Gerald Martin, \"the first real dictator novel\". Other literary treatments of the dictator figure followed, such as Jorge Zalamea's \"El Gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto\", but the genre did not gain impetus until it was reinvented in the political climate of the cold war, through the Latin American Boom.\n\nThe dictator novel came back into fashion in the 1970s, towards the end of the Boom. As Sharon Keefe Ugalde remarks, \"the 1970s mark a new stage in the evolution of the Latin American dictator novel, characterized by at least two developments: a change in the perspective from which the dictator is viewed and a new focus on the nature of language.\" By this she means that the dictator novels of the 1970s, such as \"The Autumn of the Patriarch\" or \"I, the Supreme\", offer the reader a more intimate view of their subject: \"the dictator becomes protagonist\" and the world is often seen from his point of view. With the new focus on language, Keefe Ugalde points to the realisation on the part of many authors that \"the tyrant's power is derived from and defeated by language.\" For example, in Jorge Zalamea's \"El Gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto\" the dictator bans all forms of language.\n\nAccording to Raymond L. Williams, it was not until the 1970s, when enough Latin American writers had published novels dealing with military regimes, that \"dictator novel\" became common nomenclature. The most celebrated novels of this era were Alejo Carpentier's \"Reasons of State\" (1974), Augusto Roa Bastos's \"I, the Supreme\" (1974), and Gabriel García Marquez's \"The Autumn of the Patriarch\" (1975). He defines the dictator novel as a novel which draws upon the historical record to create fictionalized versions of dictators. In this way, the author is able to use the specific to explain the general, as many dictator novels are centred around the rule of a one particular dictator. Within this group he includes those novelists who took to task authoritarian figures such as Vargas Llosa's \"Conversation in the Cathedral\" (1969) and Denzil Romero's \"La tragedia del Generalísimo\" (1984). He even includes Sergio Ramírez's \"¿Te dio miedo la sangre?\" (1977), a novel about Nicaraguan society under the Somoza dictatorship, which has been described as a \"dictator novel without the dictator\".\n\nThe novelists of the dictator novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed largely in the late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to the dictator novel genre pioneered what came to be known as magical realism, although the use of this technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.\n\nA predominant theme of the dictator novel is power, which according literary critic Michael Valdez Moses, in his 2002 review of \"Feast of the Goat\", is linked to the theme of dictatorship: \"The enduring power of the Latin American dictator novel had everything to do with the enduring power of Latin American dictators\". As novels such as \"El Señor Presidente\" became more well-known, they were read as ambitious political statements, denouncing the authority of dictators in Latin America. As political statements, dictator novel authors challenged dictatorial power, creating a link between power and writing through the force wielded by their pen. For example, in Roa Bastos's \"I, The Supreme\", the novel revolves around a central theme of language and the power inherent in all of its forms, a power that is often only present in the deconstruction of communication. González Echevarría argues that: Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of Policarpo Patiño ..., [and] his constant worry about writing all stem from the fact that he has found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supremo defines power as being able to do through others what we are unable to do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power, for things act and mean through it without ceasing to be themselves. Dr. Francia has also realized that he cannot control language, particularly written language, that it has a life of its own that threatens him.\n\nAnother constant theme which runs throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is the interdependence of the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism. In Mario Vargas Llosa's \"The Feast of the Goat\", for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the CIA, previously held for over 32 years in light of his anti-communist leanings.\n\nGender is an additional overarching theme within dictator novels. National portraits in Latin America often insist on the importance of women (and men) that are healthy, happy, productive, and patriotic, yet many national literary treasures often reflect government rhetoric in the way they code active citizenship as male. Masculinity is an enduring motif in the dictator novel. There is a connection between the pen and the penis in Latin American fiction, but this pattern cannot be explained by machismo alone—it is far more complex. According to Rebecca E. Biron, \"where we find violent, misogynistic fantasies of masculinity, we also [find] violent social relations between actual men and women.\" Many Latin American works \"include characters who act out violent fictions of masculinity, and yet their narrative structure provides readers with alternative responses to misogynistic fantasies of masculine identity formation\".\n\nSince independence, Latin American countries have been subject to both right and left-wing authoritarian regimes, stemming from a history of colonialism in which one group dominated another. Given this long history, it is unsurprising that there have been so many novels \"about individual dictators, or about the problems of dictatorship \"caudillismo\", \"caciquismo\", militarism and the like.\" The legacy of colonialism is one of racial conflict sometimes pushing an absolute authority to rise up to contain it—thus the tyrant is born. Seeking unlimited power, dictators often amend constitutions, dismantling laws which prevent their reelection. Licenciado Manuel Estrada Cabrera, for example, altered the Guatemalan Constitution in 1899 to permit his return to power. The dictators who have become the focus of the dictator novel (Augusto Roa Bastos's \"I, the Supreme\", for instance, is based on Paraguay's dictator of the early nineteenth century, the so-called Dr Francia) do not differ much from each other in terms of how they govern. As author González Echevarría states: \"they are male, militaristic, and wield almost absolute personal power.\" Their strong-arm tactics include exiling or imprisoning their opposition, attacking the freedom of the press, creating a centralized government backed by a powerful military force, and assuming complete control over free thought. Despite intense criticisms leveled at these figures, dictators involved in nationalist movements developed three simple truths, \"that everybody belonged, that the benefits of Progress should be shared, and that industrial development should be the priority\". Epitácio Pessoa, who was elected President of Brazil in 1919, wanted to make the country progress regardless of whether or not Congress passed the laws he proposed. In particular, during the Great Depression, Latin American activist governments of the 1930s saw the end of neocolonialism and the infusion of nationalist movements throughout Latin America, increasing the success of import substitution industrialization or ISI. The positive side-effect of the collapse of international trade meant local Latin American manufacturers could fill the market niches left vacant by vanishing exports.\n\nIn the twentieth century, prominent Latin American dictators have included the Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, and Augusto Pinochet in Chile, among others. As an outside influence, United States interference in Latin American politics is controversial and has often been severely criticized. As García Calderon noted as far back as 1925: \"Does it want peace or is it controlled by certain interests?\" As a theme in the dictator novel, the link between U.S. imperialism and the power of the tyrant is very important. Dictators in Latin America have accepted military and financial support from the United States when it suited them, but have also turned against the United States, using anti-American campaigning to gain favour with the people. In the case of Trujillo, \"Nothing promises to reinvigorate his flagging popularity more than to face up to the Yankee aggressor in the name of la patria.\"\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the pendulum swung in the other direction, introducing a series of 'left wing' governments to the region that curtailed civil liberties and set up their own messy version of popular dictatorships through a process that has been called \"competitive authoritarianism\". The most well-known of these was President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, and came to include other countries in his Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras - and in some ways Argentina, though it was not an official member) in what was called the Pink Tide.\n\nIn 1967 during a meeting with Alejo Carpentier, Julio Cortázar, and Miguel Otero Silva, the Mexican author Carlos Fuentes launched a project consisting of a series of biographies depicting Latin American dictators, which was to be called \"Los Padres de la Patria\" (The Fathers of the Fatherland). After reading Edmund Wilson's portraits of the American Civil War in \"Patriotic Gore\", Fuentes recounts, \"Sitting in a pub in Hampstead, we thought it would be a good idea to have a comparable book on Latin America. An imaginary portrait gallery immediately stepped forward, demanding incarnation: the Latin American dictators.\" Vargas Llosa was to write about Manuel A. Odría, Jorge Edwards about José Manuel Balmaceda, José Donoso about Mariano Melgarejo, and Julio Cortázar about Eva Perón. As M. Mar Langa Pizarro observes, the project was never completed, but it helped inspire a series of novels written by important authors during the Latin American literary boom, such as Alejo Carpentier, Augusto Roa Bastos, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa.\n\nBoth Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's \"Facundo\" and José Marmol's \"Amalia\", published in the nineteenth century, were precursors to the twentieth century dictator novel; however, \"all fictional depictions of the Latin American 'strong-man', have an important antecedent in Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's \"Facundo\", a work written as a sociolodical treatise\". \"Facundo\" is an indirect critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas's dictatorship, directed against the actual historical figure, Juan Facundo Quiroga, but is also a broader investigation into Argentine history and culture. Sarmiento's \"Facundo\" has remained a fundamental fixture because of the breadth of its literary exploration of the Latin American environment. In \"Facundo\", Sarmiento criticizes the historical figure Facundo Quiroga, a provincial caudillo, who like Rosas (dictator of Argentina from 1829 to 1853) was opposed to the enlightened ideas of progress. After returning from exile, Sarmiento worked to reinvent Argentina, eventually becoming president himself from 1868 to 1874. Sarmiento's analysis of Facundo Quiroga was the first time that an author questioned how figures like Facundo and Rosas could have maintained such absolute power, and in answering this question, \"Facundo\" established its place as an inspirational text to later authors. Sarmiento perceived his own power in writing \"Facundo\" as \"within the text of the novel, it is the novelist, through the voice of omniscience, who has replaced God\", thereby creating the bridge between writing and power that is characteristic of the dictator novel.\n\nSet in post-colonial Buenos Aires, \"Amalia\" was written in two parts and is a semi-autobiographical account of José Mármol that deals with living in Rosas's police state. Mármol's novel was important as it showed how the human consciousness, much like a city or even a country, could become a terrifying prison. \"Amalia\" also attempted to examine the problem of dictatorships as being one of structure, and therefore the problem of the state \"manifested through the will of some monstrous personage violating the ordinary individual's privacy, both of home and of consciousness.\" In the early twentieth century, the Spaniard Ramón del Valle-Inclán's \"Tirano Banderas\" (1926) acted as a key influence on those authors whose goal was to critique power structures and the status quo.\n\n\n\nLatin American novels that explore political themes, but that do not centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”. For example, \"Libro de Manuel\" (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cortázar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of interpretation. \"In the Time of the Butterflies\" (1994), by Julia Álvarez, tells the story of the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo régime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine \"how\" the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of \"El imperio de los sueños\" 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “United States of Banana” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States of Banana, who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of \"Distant Star\" (1996), by Roberto Bolaño, begins on 11 September 1973, with the \"coup d’état\" by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be read as a meditation on the horror of absolute power”.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to establish the exact origin of the dictator novel in the nineteenth century, its intellectual influence spans Latin American Literature. Most of the novels were written in the middle years of the twentieth century, and each has a unique literary style that employed techniques of the “new novel”, by which the writer rejected the formal structure of conventional literary realism, arguing that “its simplistic assumption that reality is easily observable” is a narrative flaw. As a genre, the dictator novel redefined the literary concept of “the novel” in order to compel the readers to examine the ways in which political and social mores affect their daily lives. Therefore, the regional politics and the social issues of the stories yielded to universal human concerns, thus the traditional novel’s “ordered world view gives way to a fragmented, distorted or fantastic narrative” in which the reader has an intellectually active role in grasping the \"thematic\" gist of the story. Additional to the narrative substance, the novelists redefined the formal literary categories of \"author\", \"narrator\", \"character\", \"plot\", \"story\", and \"reader\", in order to examine the etymological link between “author” and “authority”, wherein the figure of the novelist (the author) became very important to the telling of the tale. In the dictator novels, the writers questioned the traditional story-teller role of the novelist as the “privileged, paternal figure, as the authoritative ‘father’, or divine creator, in whom meaning would be seen to originate”, and so, the novelists fulfilled the role of the dictator.\n\n\n"}

Since the end of 3rd century, every Roman diocese was governed by vicarius who was called \"exarch\" in eastern parts of the Empire, dominated by Greek language and the use of Greek terminology. The office of exarch as a governor with extended political and military authority was later created in Byzantine Empire, with jurisdiction over a particular territory, usually a frontier region at some distance from the capital Constantinople.\n\nIn the Eastern Christian Churches (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic), the term exarch has three distinct uses: metropolitan who holds the office of exarch is the deputy of a patriarch and holds authority over bishops of the designated ecclesiastical region (thus, a position between that of patriarch and regular metropolitan); or, an auxiliary or titular bishop appointed to be exarch over a group of the faithful not yet large enough or organized enough to be constituted an eparchy or diocese (thus the equivalent of a vicar apostolic); and, a priest or deacon who is appointed by a bishop as his executive representative in various fields of diocesan administration (in Byzantine Empire, executive exarchs were usually collecting diocesan revenues for local bishops).\n\nIn the civil administration of the Byzantine Empire the exarch was, as stated above, the imperial governor of a large and important region of the Empire. The Exarchates were a response to weakening imperial authority in the provinces and were part of the overall process of unification of civil and military offices, initiated in early form by Justinian I, which would lead eventually to the creation of the Thematic system by either the Emperor Heraclius or Constans II.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Western Empire in the late fifth century, the Eastern Roman Empire remained stable through the beginning of the Middle Ages and retained the ability for future expansion. Justinian I reconquered North Africa, Italy, Dalmatia and finally parts of Spain for the Eastern Roman Empire. However, this put an incredible strain on the Empire's limited resources. Subsequent emperors would not surrender the re-conquered land to remedy the situation. Thus the stage was set for Emperor Maurice to establish the Exarchates to deal with the constantly evolving situation of the provinces.\n\nIn Italy the Lombards were the main opposition to Byzantine power. In North Africa the Amazigh or Berber princes were ascendant due to Roman weakness outside the coastal cities. The problems associated with many enemies on various fronts (the Visigoths in Spain, the Slavs and Avars in the Balkans, the Sassanid Persians in the Middle East, and the Amazigh in North Africa) forced the imperial government to decentralize and devolve power to the former provinces.\n\nThe term Exarch most commonly refers to the Exarch of Italy, who governed the area of Italy and Dalmatia, still remaining under Byzantine control after the Lombard invasion of 568. The exarchate's seat was at Ravenna, whence it is known as the \"Exarchate of Ravenna\". Ravenna remained the seat of the Exarch until the revolt of 727 over Iconoclasm. Thereafter, the growing menace of the Lombards and the split between eastern and western Christendom that Iconoclasm caused made the position of the Exarch more and more untenable. The last Exarch was killed by the Lombards in 751.\n\nA second exarchate was created by Maurice to administer northern Africa, formerly a separate praetorian prefecture, the islands of the western Mediterranean and the Byzantine possessions in Spain. The capital of the Exarchate of Africa was Carthage. The exarchate proved both financially and militarily strong, and survived until the Arab Muslim conquest of Carthage in 698.\n\nThe term exarch entered ecclesiastical language at first for a metropolitan (an archbishop) with jurisdiction not only for the area that was his as a metropolitan, but also over other metropolitans within local political dioceses. Since imperial vicarius (governor of a political diocese) was often called \"exarch\" in eastern, Greek speaking parts of the Empire, it became customary for the metropolitans of the diocesan capitals (Ephesus in Diocese of Asia, Heraclea in Thrace and Caesarea in Cappadocia) also to use the title \"exarch\" in order to emphasize their precedence and primatial status over other metropolitans within local political dioceses.\n\nThe Council of Chalcedon (451), which gave special authority to the see of Constantinople, as being \"the residence of the emperor and the Senate,\" in its canons spoke of diocesan \"exarchs\", placing all metropolitans in dioceses of Asia, Thrace an Pontus (including metropolitas-exarchs of Ephesus, Heraclea and Caesarea) under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Constantinople. Metropolitans-exarchs of Ephesus tried to resist the supreme jurisdiction of Constantinople, but eventually failed since imperial government supported the creation of a centralized Patriarchate.\n\nWhen the proposed government of universal Christendom by five patriarchal sees (Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, known as the pentarchy), under the auspices of a single universal empire, was formulated in the legislation of Emperor Justinian I (527-565), especially in his Novella 131, and received formal ecclesiastical sanction at the Council in Trullo (692), the name \"patriarch\" became the official one for the heads of major autocephalous churches, and the title of \"exarch\" was further demoted by naming all metropolitans as \"patriarchal exarchs\" in their ecclesiastical provinces. The advance of Constantinople put an end to privileges of three older, original exarchates, which fell back to the state of ordinary metropolitan sees.\n\nLocal ecclesiastical development in some regions also included the title of exarch. Since the Church of Cyprus was declared autocephalous (431), its Primate received the title of Exarch of Cyprus. On the similar principle the Archbishop of Mount Sinai and Raithu is an exarch, though in this case, as in that of Cyprus, modern Eastern Orthodox usage generally prefers the title \"Archbishop\".\n\nIn modern ecclesiastical practice of the Eastern Orthodox Church, title of exarch was often used to designate the highest hierarchical office under the rank of patriarch. When Russian Patriarch Adrian of Moscow died in 1700, Emperor Peter the Great abolished the patriarchal office and appointed Metropolitan Stefan Yavorsky as \"exarch\" and head of the governing council of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nAfter imperial Russia annexed Georgia (eastern part in 1801, and western part in 1810), the ancient Georgian Orthodox Church (autocephalous since 750, whose head was since 1008 styled Catholicos-Patriarchs), was reorganized into \"Georgian Exarchate\" and the newly appointed \"Exarch of Georgia\" (since 1817 always an ethnic Russian) sat in the Russian Holy Synod at St. Petersburg. Since the entire region of Caucasus fell under the Russian rule, jurisdiction of \"Georgian Exarchate\" was expanded, encompassing territories of modern-day Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. On 7 April 1917, the Georgian Patriarchate was restored for the Archbishops of Mtsheta and Tbilisi, with the style Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, and the title \"Exarch of Georgia\" was extinguished, but only for the Georgian part of the Exarchate. Russian Orthodox Church and its exarch Platon (Rozhdestvensky) kept their jurisdiction over non-Georgian parts of the Caucasian region, and for those territories \"Caucasian Exarchate\" of the Russian Orthodox Church was created in the summer of 1917, with metropolitan Platon as \"Exarch of Caucasus\". In the spring of 1918, he was succeeded by metropolitan Cyril (Smirnov) as new \"Exarch of Caucasus\", but after his transfer to another post in the spring of 1920 no new exarch was appointed.\n\nOn 28 February 1870 the twenty-year-old struggle between Greeks and Bulgarians for the control of the Orthodox Church in Bulgaria culminated when the Ottoman Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz created an independent Bulgarian ecclesiastical organization, known as the Bulgarian Exarchate. The Orthodox Church in Bulgaria had now become independent of the Greek-dominated Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Bulgarian Exarch, who resided in Constantinople, became the most famous bearer of the title of exarch; his adherents throughout region were called \"exarchists\", as opposed to the Greek \"patriarchists\".The ensuing struggle, waged especially in Macedonia, was not only religious but had a conspicuous political dimension of a contention between competing Greek and Bulgarian national aims. For more information see Bulgarian Exarchate and Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\nIn 1921, eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine were reorganized as Ukrainian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, headed by patriarchal exarch, with seat in Kiev. The Ukrainian Exarchate existed until 1990 when it was granted a higher degree of ecclesiastical autonomy within the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1989, an autonomous Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church was formed, with jurisdiction over eparchies in Belarus.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the pentarchy-number principle, already abandoned in the case of Bulgaria (10th century), Serbia (14th century) and Russia (16th century), gave way to the desire of the now politically independent orthodox nations to see their sovereignty reflected in ecclesiastical autonomy - autocephaly - and the symbolic title to crown it: a 'national' Patriarch. For example, Bulgarian Exarchate was raised to the rank of Patriarchate in 1953.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the office of exarch can be also given to a special deputy of a Patriarch, with jurisdiction over a community outside the home territory of the Patriarchate. Thus, in the United States, there are Exarchs representing, among others, the Serbian, Romanian, Bulgarian and Jerusalem Patriarchs. The style of the Exarchs of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem is \"Exarch of the Holy Sepulcher\".\n\nThe Mexican Orthodox parishes in five deaneries (Mexico City, D.F., State of Mexico, State of Jalisco, State of Veracruz and State of Chiapas) of the Orthodox Church in America are governed as the \"Exarchate of Mexico\", currently under the leadership of Bishop Alejo of Mexico City.\n\nThe third officer of the court of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, who examines marriage cases (analogous to the Catholic defensor matrimonii), is called the Exarch.\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch currently has under his authority an Exarch in India, known by the ancient title Maphrian, although he is popularly referred to as Catholicos. This is not to be confused with the autocephalous Catholicate of the East, which is also located in India.\n\nHistorically, there have been a very few cases of the civil title of Exarch granted by the civil authority to prelates of the Latin Church, as when Emperor Frederick I named the Archbishop of Lyon Exarch of Burgundy in 1157.\nHowever, the ecclesiastical title of Exarch has disappeared in the Western Catholic Church, being replaced by the terms \"Primate\" (ranking above Metropolitan Archbishop) and \"Apostolic Vicar\" (ranking below Suffragan Bishop).\n\nIn Eastern Catholic Churches (of Eastern tradition but in full communion with the Bishop of Rome, the Pope), the ecclesiastical title of Exarch is in common use, just as with its Orthodox counterparts.\n\nThese Churches are, in general, not identified with a particular liturgical rite. Thus, no less than fourteen of them use the one same Byzantine Rite, mostly in one or other of only two languages, Greek and Church Slavonic, but they maintain their distinct identities. Because of population shifts, half or so of these Churches have not just exarchates but full-scale eparchies (bishoprics) or even archeparchies (archdioceses) outside their original territory.\n\nApostolic exarch is usually a consecrated bishop of a titular see to whom the Pope, as Bishop of the Roman See of the \"Apostle\" Peter, has entrusted the pastoral care of the faithful of an autonomous Eastern Catholic particular Church \"sui iuris\" in an area, not raised to the rank of eparchy (diocese), that is situated outside the home territory of an Eastern Catholic Church. The office of \"apostolic exarch\" thus corresponds to what in the Latin Church is called an Apostolic vicar. Apostolic exarchates are generally exempt (immediately subject to the Holy See), with limited oversight by the Patriarch, Major Archbishop or Metropolitan in chief of the particular Eastern Church. It there is no metropolitan in a particular Eastern Catholic church, apostolic exarchates in their territories are directly subjected to Rome. For example, Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia belongs to the Byzantine Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia, but since there is no metropolitan in that church, Apostolic Exarch of Serbia is directly subjected to the Holy See.\n\nPatriarchal exarch is appointed in those Eastern Catholic churches whose head is styled as patriarch. Office of \"patriarchal exarch\" is often (not always) given to a consecrated bishop of a titular see. Their appointments are limited to the traditional territory of their church, with main task of governing the region not yet raised to the rank of eparchy (diocese). They may be suffragan to an archdiocese or archeparchy of the Eastern Catholic Church, or be immediately subject to the Patriarch.\n\nArchiepiscopal exarch is appointed in those Eastern Catholic churches whose head is styled as Major Archbishop. Office of \"archiepiscopal exarch\" is also usually given to a consecrated bishop of a titular see. Appointment of \"archiepiscopal exarchs\" is limited to the traditional territory of their particular church. They also may be suffragans to an archdiocese or archeparchy of their Eastern Catholic Church, or be immediately subject to the Major Archbishop.\n\nIn particular cases, usually because of illness or some other problem, an exarch of any rank can be assisted by the appointment of a colleague who is called Coadjutor exarch. The position of \"coadjutor exarch\" towards his superior exarch is similar to the position of Latin coadjutor bishop towards his superior diocesan bishop. Coadjutor exarchs are appointed with rights of succession. For example, in 1993 titular Bishop Christo Proykov of Briula was appointed Coadjutor to Apostolic Exarch of Sofia, Methodius Stratiev, and when later died in 1995, coadjutor exarch succeeded him as new Apostolic Exarch.\n\nIn practice, exarch of any rank can be additionally assisted by an auxiliary exarch, who is appointed in order to help the exarch in administration of his exarchate. Position of auxiliary exarch towards his superior exarch is similar to position of Latin auxiliary bishop towards his superior diocesan bishop. Auxiliary exarchs are appointed without the rights of succession.\n\nThe following Eastern Catholic exarchates can be found in the 2006 \"Annuario Pontificio\" and newer sources.\n\nThese are exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See, rather than to their Patriarch or other head of the particular Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(probably still incomplete)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34752055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34752055", "title": "Global imbalances", "text": "Global imbalances\n\nGlobal imbalances refers to the situation where some countries have more assets than the other countries. In theory, when the current account is in balance, it has a zero value: inflows and outflows of capital will be cancelled by each other. Hence, if the current account is persistently showing deficits for certain period it is said to show an inequilibrium. Since, by definition, all current accounts and net foreign assets of the countries in the world must become zero, then other countries become indebted with the other nations.\nDuring recent years, global imbalances have become a concern in the rest of the world. The United States has run long term deficits, as well as many other advanced economies, while in Asia and emerging economies the opposite has occurred. \n\nThey refer to global imbalances as \"external positions of systemically important economies that reflect distortions or entail risks for the global economy\". \nThe three parts of this definition can be re-defined further:\n\nGlobal imbalances are far from being a new phenomenon in economic history. There are many periods where they were present, although here only those periods where some data is available will be referred to.\n\nThe first period of global imbalances that will be presented, occurred during the years 1870 to 1914 (a former era of financial globalisation) where massive flows of capital flew from the core countries of Western Europe to the countries of recent settlement overseas (especially the Americas and Australasia). Current account surpluses run by Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands reached approximately 9% of GDP, while for the destination of the flows. (Argentina, Australia and Canada) the deficit exceeded 5%.\n\nThe process of adjustment of these imbalances relates to the price specie flow mechanism of the classical gold standard, which was smooth, in general, with exception of the Barings Crisis in 1890 for some countries.\n\nDuring the First World War, the participating countries abandoned gold convertibility, with exception of the United States. After the war, by 1926, the major countries got back to a gold standard, where the countries held reserves in dollars, sterling and francs, and the United States, Great Britain and France held gold. But this system had some serious flaws which prevented that the imbalances generated were adjusted smoothly. Real exchange rates were misaligned, and the system began to lose credibility (since, at the time, it seemed that external concerns came second after domestic concerns). The collapse began after 1929: speculative attacks on countries following expansionary policies to alleviate the effects of the Great Depression, and soon had to leave the gold standard. The United States continue until 1933. The imbalance during this period, however, where not as large in magnitude as they were before the First World War.\n\nAfter the Second World War, under the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. was the country with the largest gold reserves, and had to peg the dollar to gold at 35 dollars per ounce, as the rest of the world pegged to the dollar. Stronger restrictions existed on cross-border capital flows, compared to the gold standard, that did not allow countries to run big surpluses or deficits in the current account, as it was the case during the classical gold standard regime. The system ended in 1971, amidst expansionary policies in the United States, that lead European countries to begin converting their dollar claims into gold, threatening U.S. gold reserves.\n\nAnother periods of smaller imbalances began after the end of the Bretton Woods system, but their magnitude is much smaller than the ones of the beginning of the 21st century, involving different sets of countries and with different resolutions.\n\nMaking a comparison with the former global imbalances, the current period has unprecedented features. This is the first time that capital flows go mostly from emerging market economies (mainly Asia and the Oil exporting economies), to advanced economies. Also, the foreign asset positions have become much larger in both gross and net terms, and the degree of capital mobility is the highest in decades. Hence, the size of these imbalances are only comparable to the period previous to the First World War. Also the conditions under which they appeared are different. New participants that were in the periphery of global trade and finance before, have become an important part of the international markets, after a process of economic liberalisation, falling transportation costs, information technology and the deepening of financial markets and global chains of production. The financial links among the economies has also increased. And the macroeconomic and financial conditions improved, especially during 2003-2007, with record economic growth and low financial market volatility. As it will explained later, this are important factors in generating the increased globalisation of financial markets.\n\nThe essential requirement to make large global imbalances in world, is the monetary globalisation or, in other words, freeing and opening the financial markets. Without this, it is not able to produce the amount of capital flows between countries However, not every monetary globalisation should lead to imbalances. Other factors are important as well.\n\nOne factor is increases in the bank savings from emerging countries, especially in Asian Countries and Commodity Exporter economies, part of what is known as the Savings Glut. These economies increased their foreign exchange reserves to respond to future balance of payment. Of course, there are some other reasons, such as low levels of social security in emerging countries, as well as the fixed or flexible foreign exchange systems of many of these countries. In some advanced countries, such as Germany,Japan and New Zealand, the ageing issue has been a very important factor increasing the amount of the savings.\n\nSo far, we have explained why some countries have accumulated many savings, but not why they are held abroad (besides the precautionary savings explanation). One reason, is that the financial development has not been followed at the same pace as the financial openness. This can be seen in a very small markets to generate safe assets where to store value from one period to the next. For this reason, many countries have decided to invest those assets abroad, in the more financially developed countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, in the form of Sovereign Wealth Funds, portfolio investments and foreign reserves, indicating the existence of shortages in safe assets as well. Another explanation is that ageing population do not find profitable investment vehicles to invest at home, and end up investing them abroad.\n\nAlso, some coincidental factors amplified the extent of the imbalances. The decreasing output volatility in advanced economies (i.e. Great Moderation), led to less savings and a decrease in risk aversion, that was reflected in deepening current account deficits.\n\nGlobal imbalances helped fuel the financial crisis, even though it did not cause it. The Savings Glut helped push down the yields on Treasury bonds, through the foreign purchases. This reduction in interest rate, in addition to other policy measures adopted by central banks, encouraged risk taking and underestimation of risks, on the verge of financial innovation, that might as well had been boosted by this financial environment. It also helped in the increase of leverage in advanced economies, and the formation of the housing market bubble in many of them, through the relaxed credit conditions. Also the increase in the financial linkages, lead to a rapid contagion across economies. It would not be hard to argue that the economic policies followed by the emerging markets, led to the ability of advanced economy to borrow cheaply abroad and finance the bubbles in the housing and financial markets.\n\nEven though many of the policies adopted or discussed since the beginning of the Great Recession, have centred on the sectors of Finance, Housing and Public Debt, among other issues, the presence of Global Imbalances still remains as a factor, that although reduced, points out the need of reforms of the international monetary and financial system to correct the imbalances, and hence, the distortions and market imperfections that gave them origin in first place.\n\n"}

{"id": "521734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=521734", "title": "Highlands and Islands Alliance", "text": "Highlands and Islands Alliance\n\nThe Highlands and Islands Alliance or Càirdeas was a minor Scottish electoral alliance that was active in the late 1990s. Founded in the Autumn of 1998 by non-partisan politicians local to the Highlands and Islands, it only contested the inaugural Scottish Parliament election of 1999, where it collected a negligible 1.3% of the regional vote and despite a reasonably publicised campaign, failed to elect any of its candidates. Led by anti-nuclear activist Lorraine Mann, the Alliance was established to better represent marginalised communities in rural Scotland, who they felt had been ignored by government in favour of those in the more densely populated Central Belt. Its policies were near exclusively centred on localism and rural issues, only contesting Scotland's regional additional member system so that electors could vote on nationwide matters through their constituency ballot. After the election, the group remained politically inactive until it was quietly disestablished in August 2004.\n\nAlthough electorally unimportant, the Alliance's legal campaign to allow political job sharing in the Scottish Parliament attracted considerable media and academic coverage. The dispute has since become the subject of legislative research by both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the British House of Commons, where it informed debate surrounding the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002.\n\nOverseen by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair's administration, a Scottish Parliament was to be established in accordance with the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum result. In response, the Highlands and Islands Alliance was founded in the Autumn of 1998 by local activists who sought to \"create a strong, independent voice for the Highlands and Islands\" in preparation for the following year's inaugural election. They believed that the Central Belt in the Scottish Lowlands, the most densely populated area in the country, had received a disproportionate amount of attention from the British Government in Westminster and that rural communities were being neglected as a consequence. The group also wanted to redress the fact, that in their opinion, residents in the Highlands and Islands experienced \"the lowest incomes and highest taxes in the UK\". Alliance members believed that the establishment of a devolved parliament at Holyrood was an opportunity to enhance their region's representation, commenting \"[we] have great hopes that Holyrood will not emerge Russian-doll like from Westminster\".\n\nMembers instrumental in the Alliance's development included playwright Edwin 'Eddie' Stiven, Black Isle Councillor Bryan Beattie and the group's sole leader, anti-nuclear activist Lorraine Mann. Prior to leading the party, Mann campaigned successfully and single-handedly against nuclear reprocessing at the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment in Caithness, further serving as Convenor of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping. The Alliance was formerly registered with the Electoral Commission on 25 February 1999, with Beattie acting as nominating officer, as well as treasurer, and Mann as leader. Consisting of about 280 members, the group were headquartered at Midoxgate House, a converted pigsty in the small hamlet of Fearn. Before its official registration, the party steadily built up a respectable profile; this included interviews with \"The Guardian\" on 22 and 26 January, in which they declared their intention to stand in the Scottish Parliament election, as well as criticised the disconnection between Highland parliamentarians and the constituencies they represented.\n\nThe Alliance ran an active parliamentary campaign, sometimes labelling themselves as Càirdeas, a Scottish Gaelic word that \"has a meaning incorporating friendship, fellowship, relationship, goodwill and alliance.\" Their efforts were an object of media attention, becoming the subject of several articles by BBC News, \"The Economist\", \"The Glasgow Herald\", \"The Guardian\", \"The Independent\" and other publications. Leader Lorraine Mann also attended a land reform debate at Aberdeen University on 16 April, where she was joined by Iain Haughie of the Scottish Conservatives, Dot Jessiman of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Charles Kennedy of the Scottish Liberal Democrats and Lord Sewel of the Scottish Labour Party. Despite reasonable coverage in public life, the party produced a \"disappointing\" result at the election, held on 6 May 1999. They captured 2,607 votes, 1.3% of those cast in the Parliament's additional member Highlands and Islands electoral region; the group did not contest the region's individual first-past-the-post constituencies, leaving potential supporters to vote on nationwide issues as they saw fit.\n\nAt one time, commentators observed that the Alliance was \"on the verge of taking one seat\", with the \"outside chance of winning one or two seats\", though all of the group's candidates were ultimately defeated. Among them was Arthur Cormack, an Alliance candidate otherwise known as a traditional Scottish singer. Following the election, the group remained electorally inactive until it was, without statement, voluntarily deregistered from the Electoral Commission on 24 August 2004.\n\nIdeologically, journalist James Cusick of \"The Independent\" observed that the Alliance had a \"radical edge that harks back to the Highland Land League of a century ago.\" Although technically non-partisan, it received the formal endorsement of post-communist group Democratic Left Scotland, which \"was committed to ... renew radical socialist politics\" through the fledgling Scottish Parliament's proportional representation (PR) electoral system.\n\nMann suggested that the group were promoting \"positions rather than policies\", with representatives not bound to act on legislation according to party instruction. They instead proposed that any Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) elected from the Alliance would consult their electorate on how to vote through the internet, namely via E-Mail, in what they hailed as a new form of \"community democracy\". Described by political scientists David Butler and Martin Westlake as \"localised\", the Alliance nonetheless developed a detailed regional policy platform \"on the basis that the distinctive voice of [the Highlands and Islands] should be heard\". This included the release of a publication, \"The Problems, in Fishing, Aquaculture, and the Marine Environment\", authored by Edwin Stiven and printed in Glenelg. In it, Stiven recommends that fisheries in the west of Scotland should be free of all European Union (EU) influence and legal restrictions, advocating their complete return to community ownership; he further suggests management by sea trusts, similar to those established for crofts. Otherwise regarding the EU, the Alliance called for more funding to be directed towards \"communities which have found themselves on the periphery of investment.\"\n\nDomestically, the group pushed for the diversification of funding from central government to promote sustainable jobs, including the establishment of a separate, Scottish agricultural policy that prioritised land reform and redistribution initiatives. It further believed that attempted funding strategies in the Highlands and Islands were largely unworkable due to the lack of big business and investment, instead suggesting the formation of a regional Highland bank. Social policy proposals were similarly community-focused, and included support for affordable basic services and the upkeep of rural schools, namely preschools. Connected to this was the Alliance's proposal for a non-legislative assembly in which all of the region's parliamentarians (MPs, MEPs and MSPs) would convene and discuss policy development with their local constituents. The group also endorsed the founding of a watchdog to monitor the Highlands and Islands' quangos and public services.\n\nSuggestions in transport included ending toll collections on the Skye Road Bridge, improving the region's ferry network, slashing fares for local public transport and establishing a community-owned airline; these measures were to be encompassed into the Alliance's \"Right to Move\" scheme. Nationally, the Alliance supported both the reduction of student tuition fees and the maintenance of British student grants. Regarding the continuation of the United Kingdom, it took a neutral stance, simply stating \"a Scotland which is treated fairly is more likely to want to stay within the union.\" The Alliance are recorded as supporters of the Scottish Gaelic language.\n\nThe Alliance are perhaps best known for their controversial job-share candidacies. Such a proposal was suggested so that if the group were successful in obtaining a seat, the time a Holyrood representative would spend away from their rural constituents would not exceed a week, as they could interchange with their job-sharing partner. Fielding 20 candidates, the Alliance was the first British political party ever to achieve an absolute gender balance through its election nominations. Although each Alliance seat would be represented by two MSPs, the group insisted that they would share a single salary and expenses record.\n\nJob-share proposals were eventually accepted by the Highland Council's Returning Officer, Arthur McCourt, in April 1999. This followed a four-month dispute between the Alliance and the Highland Council, under the authority of the Scottish Office, over the arrangement. However, it was revealed that McCourt was unaware of the job-share element, and subsequently deemed the nominations invalid. Lorraine Mann successfully took the case to an employment tribunal and the group fought the election on a job-sharing platform; that said, political scientist David Boothroyd speculates that the previously illegal status of their innovation lost them popularity. Legal support for job-sharing candidates was reversed at the Employment Appeal Tribunal in December 2000 as it was ruled the tribunal system had no jurisdiction over electoral law.\n\nUnder the advice of pressure group New Ways To Work, Mann then took the disagreement to another tribunal as a sex-discrimination suit under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in November 2001, where the Council's decision was nonetheless upheld. The case has since been referenced by the parliamentary research papers of both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the British House of Commons, where it informed debate surrounding the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002.\n\n"}

Homosexuality-related violations of the law of chastity may result in church discipline.\n\nMembers of the church who experience homosexual attractions, including those who self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, may remain in good standing in the church if they abstain from sexual relations (outside opposite-sex marriage). Although no one, including those participating in same-sex sexual behavior, is forbidden from LDS Church Sunday worship services, acquiring and maintaining membership in the church and receiving a temple recommend is dependent upon observing the law of chastity's prohibition of sexual relationships outside a marital relationship between husband and wife.\n\nThe LDS Church previously taught that homosexuality is a curable condition, but now states that \"individuals do not choose to have such attractions\" and that therapy focusing on \"a change in sexual orientation\" is \"unethical.\" The church teaches that regardless of the cause of same sex attraction, \"immoral relationships\" must be abjured, leaving homosexual members with the option of attempting to change their sexual orientation, entering a mixed-orientation opposite-sex marriage, or living a celibate lifestyle without any sexual expression (including masturbation).\nThe LDS Church has campaigned against government recognition of same-sex marriage, and the issue of same-sex marriage has been one of the church's foremost political concerns since the 1990s. For example, church members represented as much as 80 to 90 percent of the early volunteers petitioning voters door-to-door and 50 percent of the campaign funds in support of California Proposition 8 (2008). The church supported a Salt Lake City ordinance protecting members of the LGBT community against discrimination in employment and housing while at the same time allowing religious institutions to exercise their religious beliefs while hiring or providing university accommodations, stating it remained \"unequivocally committed to defending the bedrock foundation of marriage between a man and a woman.\"\n\nIn November 2015, the church updated its policies regarding those in legal same-sex unions, stating that such couples are apostates from the church. Its new policies also bar such couples' children—either adopted or biological—from being baptized, confirmed, ordained, or participating in mission service until reaching adulthood and obtaining permission from the First Presidency. The church's policies and treatment of LGBT people has long been a source of controversy both within and outside the church and a significant cause of disagreement and disaffection by members.\n\nThe entire body of LDS canonized scripture (including the Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price and Doctrine and Covenants) is silent on same-sex sexual activity except for the Bible. However, sexual immorality (coupled with forsaking a ministry) was described in the Book of Mormon as the \"most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost.\" The LDS Church teaches that the Bible forbids homosexuality.\n\nHistorian D. Michael Quinn has suggested that early church leaders had a more tolerant view of homosexuality, but leaders like then apostle Gordon Hinckley have stated that LDS leaders have always considered homosexual behavior a grievous sin. The first recorded instance of a Church leader using the term \"homosexuality\" in a public discourse was First Presidency member J. Reuben Clark in a 1952 General Conference, though, the term had been in use in the US since 1892. It appears that by the 1940s church leaders had a greater awareness of homosexual behavior in Utah since apostle Charles Callis had been assigned to cases of church members involved in homosexuality sometime before 1947 and surveillance had been organized in 1945 to stop male-male sexual activity in the church's (now-demolished) Deseret Gymnasium steam room. Callis was succeeded in the appointment over homosexual cases by apostle Spencer Kimball in 1947. Kimball later shared this role with apostle Mark Petersen in 1959.\n\nSince the first recorded mentions of homosexuality by general church leaders, teachings and policies around the topics of the nature, etiology, mutability, and identity around same-sex romantic and physical attractions have seen many changes through the decades, including a softening in rhetoric over time. In reference to the harsh rhetoric on homosexuality of the past, the apostle Todd Christofferson stated in a 2015 interview, \"I think we can express things better.\" Regarding this subject, apostle Dallin Oaks said, \"I know that the history of the church is not to seek apologies or to give them. We sometimes look back on issues and say, 'Maybe that was counterproductive for what we wish to achieve,' but we look forward and not backward.\" A table summarizing some of the major shifts in official dialogue is found below. \nSome changes have seemed abrupt and contradictory as was the case in September 1995 when a First Presidency member affirmed in the Ensign that an inborn homosexual orientation was a false belief with no scientific evidence and that if homosexuality were inborn it would frustrate God's plan. In the next month's edition of the Ensign, however, an Apostle refuted this without referring to it directly by stating that there is some evidence that inheritance plays a role in a homosexual orientation.\n\nThere were several known or alleged instances of same-sex sexual activity by church members in the 19th century and early 20th century. These include the young man George Naylor, the actress Ada Russell, and the researcher Mildred Berryman. During the early days of the church, when same-sex sexual activity by a member was suspected, the accused was sometimes disfellowshipped or excommunicated. The first known instance of church discipline related this was in 1841 around the alleged bisexual behavior of church leader John Bennett, allegedly with Francis Higbee. Valeen Avery has suggested that Joseph Smith's son, David Hyrum Smith (1844–1904), may have been gay.\n\nOne of the more prominent instances of homosexual activity by a Mormon man in the early 20th century was presiding patriarch Joseph Fielding Smith. He served in the position only four years before being released by church president George Albert Smith for reasons of \"ill health.\" It is reported that he had been involved in several gay affairs with at least three men After being released, Smith took his wife and children to Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nIn 1959, in response to a rash of arrests of gay men in Utah and Idaho, church president David O. McKay had apostles Spencer W. Kimball and Mark E. Petersen focus their assignment on curing gay members. At the time, the American Psychiatric Association's \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" classified homosexuality as a mental illness, and Kimball was adamant that it could be cured. Speaking to church educators and LDS psychiatrists in 1965, Kimball said, citing a \"Medical World News\" article, that \"[w]e know such a disease is curable,\" and that ex-gay Mormons had emerged from the church's counseling programs cured, although the cure was \"like the cure for alcoholism subject to continued vigilance.\" In 1970, Kimball was involved in creating an LDS publication for church leaders to \"assist them to effect a cure and ... become normal again.\" The pamphlet taught that church leaders may assist gay members by reciting scripture; appealing to their reason; encouraging them to abandon gay lovers and associates; praying with them; and encouraging them to replace any sexual expression of their homosexual feelings with heterosexual expressions like opposite-sex dating. The pamphlet emphasized that \"[h]omosexuality CAN be cured.\" In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association’s removed homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and in 1990 the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of disorders classified in the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases.\n\nIn 1992 the church produced a booklet for leaders entitled \"Understanding and Helping Those With Homosexual Problems\", which removed all reference to homosexuality as a disease, instead framing it as \"sinful behavior\" that \"should be eliminated\" as well as \"thoughts and feelings\" which \"should be overcome.\" LDS leaders have referenced contemporary scientific research, but have explained that this should not be taken as an official church position on \"scientific questions,\" such as the causes of homosexuality.\n\nOn several occasions spanning the 70's to the early 2000's while discussing homosexuality, church leaders have alluded to their belief that the homosexual feeling may stem from a confusion over one's gender identity or gender roles. Since then the church has acknowledged differences between gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nFormer LDS historian D. Michael Quinn has suggested that early church leaders had a more tolerant view of homosexuality given that during the 19th century, the Church (like American society as a whole) was relatively tolerant of same-sex intimate relationships. However, at the time, many such relationships had no sexual component, and among those that did, the evidence is usually circumstantial. Quinn also states that several active and prominent members of the church in Utah were not disciplined after publicizing that they were living in romantic relationships with their same-sex domestic partners, although there is no clear evidence these relationships involved sex. These included Evan Stephens, who had been director of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir until 1916 and is the author of numerous standard church hymns, who remained single but had intimate relationships and shared the same bed with a series of male domestic partners and traveling companions. Some of these relationships were described under a pseudonym in \"The Children's Friend\". Also notable were Louise B. Felt and May Anderson, the church's first two general presidents of the Primary, who lived together in the same bedroom for decades and were referred to by Primary leaders as the \"David and Jonathan\" of Primary. Quinn's interpretations of previous leaders' views and the nature of the relationships of Evan Stephens, and Felt and Anderson have been challenged as a distortion of history. Kimball Young has cited the early church's practice of sealing men to each other as evidence of latent homosexuality.\n\nIn 1999, Gordon B. Hinckley, president of the church, officially welcomed gay people in the church, and in an interview affirmed them as \"good people\": \"Now we have gays in the church. Good people. We take no action against such people—provided they don't become involved in transgression, sexual transgression. If they do, we do with them exactly what we'd do with heterosexuals who transgress.\" The church teaches that homosexual problems can be overcome \"through faith in God, sincere repentance, and persistent effort.\" \"Homosexual relations\" is included on the church's list of \"serious transgressions\" that may result in a disciplinary council and, if the person does not desist, excommunication. The church defines \"serious transgressions\" to include \"murder, rape, forcible sexual abuse, spouse abuse, intentional serious physical injury of others, adultery, fornication, homosexual relations (especially sexual cohabitation), deliberate abandonment of family responsibilities, robbery, burglary, theft, embezzlement, sale of illegal drugs, fraud, perjury, and false swearing.\"\n\nIn November 2015, the church clarified that its members who are in a same-sex marriage are in apostasy and would be subject to church discipline. Prior to this, local leadership had more discretion in whether or how far to pursue church disciplinary action for members in same-sex marriages. Local church leaders still have discretion for same-sex couples who are cohabiting but not married. While explicitly including same-sex marriage in the church's definition of apostasy, the November 2015 update also addressed children of same-sex couples. In the updated policy, children living in a same-sex household may not receive a name and a blessing, nor be baptized until at least 18 years of age, and must disavow same-sex marriage and no longer be living with a parent who is, or has been, in a same-sex relationship.\n\nAlthough there is no official policy to this effect, some church leaders have stated that \"homosexual\", \"lesbian\", and \"gay\" should be used as adjectives to describe thoughts, feelings, or behaviors, and never as nouns to describe people. Not all leaders adhere to this approach. For example, Hinckley once stated in a public interview that \"we have gays in the church.\" Those leaders who adopt this position argue that using these words to denote a person rather than a feeling would imply a person has no choice in regards to their sexual behavior. Church leaders and organizations have made reference to homosexuality as a sexual orientation and have only begun directly addressing bisexual members since October 2016. According to apostle Dallin H. Oaks, church references condemning homosexuality are to be interpreted as a condemnation of sexual behavior, not of the people who have certain sexual feelings.\n\n\"Homosexual problems\", according to popular church vernacular, are defined as \"homoerotic thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.\" In describing people with homosexual feelings, the church and its members will often refer to \"same-gender attractions\". This is used in contrast to people who have problems with opposite-gender attraction. \"Marriage\" is defined by the church as being between a man and a woman. To many in the church, same-sex marriages are not considered a legitimate form of marriage, and the church supports the notion of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to define marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\nThe church does not condemn what it calls \"susceptibilities,\" \"inclinations\", or \"temptations\" of any type that are not acted upon, pointing to the example of the temptation of Christ. Members with homosexual \"inclinations\" can participate as all other members of the church and if they remain celibate or heterosexually married, they can participate in the religion to the same extent as straight members. Heterosexual marriage is considered a sacred covenant which should generally not be pursued if homosexual feelings are not under control. Those with same-gender attractions are encouraged to talk to their ecclesiastical leader. They are encouraged not to let their sexual feelings be the sole defining factor in their lives, but to see the whole person, extending their horizons beyond their sexual orientation. They are advised that they should be careful not to blame their parents.\n\nHowever, church leaders recognize the loneliness and difficulty that those with homosexual inclinations may have and encourage other members to reach out to them. Oaks has said, “All should understand that persons (and their family members) struggling with the burden of same-sex attraction are in special need of the love and encouragement that is a clear responsibility of church members, who have signified by covenant their willingness to bear one another's burden and so fulfill the law of Christ.\n\nThe church does not participate in debate on whether homosexual susceptibilities develop from \"nature\" or \"nurture\", suggesting that such debates are better left to science. Oaks has admitted that \"perhaps such susceptibilities are inborn or acquired without personal choice\" and \"may have some relationship to inheritance,\" citing some scientific research. However, the church teaches that these inclinations will not continue beyond death and that gender and gender roles are an eternal and essential characteristic of a soul.\n\nThe church teaches that all members should take responsibility in bridling their thoughts, attitudes, feelings, desires, and passions. All members are taught to avoid any talk or activity that may arouse immoral sexual feelings. Members are taught to \"let virtue garnish [their] thoughts unceasingly.\" Apostle Richard G. Scott has taught that through the atonement of Jesus Christ, all desire to sin can be changed and individuals can experience lasting peace.\n\nFor those with same-gender attractions, church leaders counsel that \"the line of prudence is between the susceptibility and the feelings.\" The church teaches that everyone has feelings they did not choose, and homosexual feelings can be powerful and difficult to control but \"regardless of the causes, these problems can be controlled and eventually overcome.\" Even though there is no church discipline for homosexual thoughts or feelings, the church teaches they should learn to accept responsibility for homosexual feelings and cite examples of how those born with inclinations to alcoholism, anger, or other undesirable traits have been able to control their thoughts and actions. With better understanding of moral law, they teach these problems will be able to be fixed \"routinely.\"\n\nThe church teaches that members should not indulge in activities that will intensify homosexual feelings, such as viewing pornography, masturbating, or participating in homosexual behavior. \"Unhealthy\" relationships, such as those with people that encourage homosexual behavior, should be cut off, and the very appearance of evil should be avoided. Bishops of the church are counseled to be careful to avoid creating circumstances in which those with homosexual problems are exposed to temptations.\n\nIn 1991, the church issued a statement that read:\nSexual relations are proper only between husband and wife appropriately expressed within the bonds of marriage. Any other sexual contact, including fornication, adultery, and homosexual and lesbian behavior is sinful ... We plead with those involved in such behavior to forsake it.\n\nThe church has also taught that homosexual behavior distorts loving relationships, undermines the divinely created institution of the family and can become an addiction. Church discipline for homosexual activity is similar to that for members involved in heterosexual activity. For example, pre-marital sex of either kind may permanently bar a person from serving as a church missionary.\n\nThe church teaches that homosexual behavior has always been a grievous sin. In 1976, apostle Boyd K. Packer taught: \nThere is a falsehood that some are born with an attraction to their own kind, with nothing they can do about it. They are just \"that way\" and can only yield to those desires. It is a malicious and destructive lie. While it is a convincing idea to some, it is of the devil. No one is locked into that kind of life ... Boys are to become men—masculine, manly men—ultimately to become husbands and fathers.\nAlthough church leaders condemn the sin of homosexual behavior, they teach love for the men and women who experience homosexual attraction, including for those who pursue some form of homosexual lifestyle: \"We should reach out with kindness and comfort to the afflicted, ministering to their needs and assisting them with their problems.\" Church leaders have spoken out against \"gay-bashing\" and other physical or verbal attacks on those involved in homosexual behavior.\n\nChurch president Spencer W. Kimball stated that he finds it hard to believe that one would choose to be homosexual by a conscious decision; instead, he suggested that it might be a spiritual disorder—with its roots in selfishness—resulting in feelings that must be overcome or suppressed. Kimball emphasized that the behavior is changeable, and if not repented of, may result in church discipline including excommunication under the direction of the bishop. Kimball maintained that the cure comes through following the basic rules for moral and spiritual health for a long period of time with undeviating determination.\n\nOn several occasions from 2006–2009 multiple top leaders taught that attractions to those of the same sex won't exist after death, stating \"it must be true\" that \"gay or lesbian inclinations\" will \"not exist post-mortality\", but only occur \"right now in mortality.\" The 2007 official church publication \"God Loveth His Children states that, \"others may not be free of this challenge [of same-gender attraction] in this life\" but that \"our bodies, feelings, and desires will be perfected in the next life so that every one of God’s children may find joy in a family.\"\n\nThe church has occasionally addressed the treatment and views of LGBT+ members. In 2000 the apostle Packer addressed gay and lesbian youth stating that church leaders don't reject, but rather them, and that they sometimes must extend tough love through teaching and discipline. Additionally, the 2007 church pamphlet \"God Loveth His Children\" acknowledged that some gay members have felt rejection by other members. It criticized those who did not show love and challenged gay members to show love and kindness to help other members change their attitudes.\n\nThere are many current and former members of the LDS church who are attracted to people of the same sex, and they have had a variety of positive and negative experiences with leaders and other members. For example, one gay Mormon man who dates men reported never having problems with his local leaders, while another who was a Church employee described how his stake president denied his temple recommend resulting in him getting fired simply because of his friendship with other gay men and his involvement in a charity bingo for Utah Pride in a 2011 article. One former LDS bishop and temple sealer Antonio A. Feliz said that his Peruvian mission was directed in the early 1960s by South American area authorities to not teach known homosexuals. A 1997 poll at BYU found that 1/3 of male students would avoid befriending a gay student and 42% of all students believed that even celibate, honor-code-following gay members should not be allowed to attend BYU. Several church employees have been fired or pressured to leave for being celibate but gay, or for supporting LGBT rights. In a 2007 US poll, 24% of Mormons agreed that \"homosexuality is a way of life that should be accepted,\" less than any other major religious group in the survey except for Jehovah's Witnesses. In a similar poll seven years later, 36% said homosexuality should be accepted.\n\nExpressions and identities for sexuality and gender are \"separate, but related\" aspects of a person and stem from similar biological origins. In relation to transgender and other gender diverse individuals church spokesman Eric Hawkins stated in March 2016 that LDS bishops recognize that \"each case is different\" and \"difficult and sensitive\" and that they recognize the \"emotional pain\" many gender minorities feel. He also reaffirmed the church's views that \"gender is part of our eternal God-given identity and purpose\" and stated that the Church does not baptize \"those who are planning trans-sexual operations\" and that undergoing a \"trans-sexual operation\" may imperil the membership of a church member.\n\nAccording to current church policy, members who have undergone an “elective transsexual operation” are banned from temple rites or receiving priesthood authority. Additionally, a trangender individual who has undergone gender-confirming surgery may be baptized only with First Presidency approval, and those considering it are barred from baptism. The church has acknowledged differences between gender identity and sexual orientation stating that they have \"unfinished business in teaching on [transgender situations].\" The official website on homosexuality states that \"same-sex attraction and gender dysphoria are very different ... those who experience gender dysphoria may or may not also experience same-sex attraction, and the majority of those who experience same-sex attraction do not desire to change their gender. From a psychological and ministerial perspective, the two are different.\"\n\nThe church's policies and treatment of LGBT people has long been a source of controversy both inside and outside the church and a significant cause of disagreement and disaffection by members.\n\nA 2011 online survey of over 3,000 individuals who no longer believe church truth claims found that around ten percent would consider returning if (among several changes) LGBT persons were accepted and treated equally.\n\nThe controversial policies for LGBT persons has made an impression on the general public. A 2003 nationwide Pew Research Center survey of over 1,000 LGBT Americans found that 83% of them said the LDS church was \"generally unfriendly towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people\" surpassed only by \"the Muslim religion\" at 84%. Additionally, in May 2008 a Georgia Tech gay-rights manual referred to the LDS Church as \"anti-gay.\" After two students sued the school for discrimination, a judge ordered that the material be removed.\n\nPast leaders' teachings on reparative therapy and the origins of homosexuality have been criticized. In the late 90s psychiatrist Jeffery R. Jensen, a University of Utah almnus, criticized church reparative therapy modalities and etiological theories around homosexuality in multiple presentations as lacking scientific integrity as he believed they were dictated from top church leaders rather than drawn from actual empirical observation by trained professionals. He also stated that current church publications on the subject were condescending, dehumanizing pontifications using caricatures and stereotypes of gay men and lesbians to distort knowledge and facts in order to justify oppressive standards and norms. He continued asserting that \"far too many of our lesbian and gay youths kill themselves because of what you say about them\" since gay men and lesbians cannot be made heterosexual, and \"those who believe your false promises and remain celibate in the hopes of eventual 'cure' are consigned to a misery.\" Soon after, The American Psychiatric Association disavowed therapy trying to change sexual orientation as ineffective and destructive.\n\nOne general conference address later distributed as a pamphlet that generated controversy was Packer's \"To Young Men Only\" which condones an example of a male missionary who punched his missionary companion for making romantic advances with Packer stating, \"Well, thanks. Somebody had to do it ...\" Historians Michael Quinn and Rocky O'Donovan have argued these comments \"essentially advocated anti-Gay violence\", and that the church itself endorsed such behavior by continuing to publish Packer's speech in pamphlet form. Former bishop David Hardy also condemned this pamphlet and other publications as promoting violence against gay people and providing outdated misinformation on the nature of his once-suicidal gay son. In 1995, Oaks said, \"Our doctrines obviously condemn those who engage in so-called 'gay bashing'—physical or verbal attacks on persons thought to be involved in homosexual or lesbian behavior\" and in 2016, the church ceased publication of the pamphlet and it was removed from the church's website.\n\nThe policies and treatment of LGBTQ individuals have prompted several protests and mass resignations including the following:\n\nMany gay and lesbian members of the LDS Church have felt that they should get marry someone of the opposite sex because of the church's emphasis on marriage. Evergreen director David Pruden was quoted as stating in 2002 that 40% of the approximately 150 callers requesting help each month on their hotline were Mormon men married to women, and distressed about their homosexual attractions. Additionally, a 2004 publication quoted LDS Family Services statistics which showed that about half of the approximately 400 gay Mormon men they had seen as clients for over a year during the past 30 years were married, though only half of those were able to stay married.\n\nThe church teaches that heterosexual marriage is one of several requirements for afterlife entry into the \"highest degree of glory\" in the celestial kingdom. Church leaders previously encouraged this with one former church employee stating in 1986 that he had experienced pressure to marry at the age of 24 in the belief that it would change his homosexual feelings later resulting in a divorce. Leaders have stated that those who do not have an opportunity to be married in this life have been promised that they will have an opportunity to do so in the afterlife Leaders have said that homosexual attractions will not continue past death, and that if the individual is faithful in this life, they will receive every blessing in the eternities, including eternal marriage.\n\nThe most recent statement by a general church leader as of 2015 was when the apostle Oaks stated that leaders \"definitely do not recommend marriage as a solution for same-gender feelings. No, it’s not a therapy. In times past, decades ago, there were some practices to that effect. We have eradicated them in the Church now.\" Another current mention is in the church website on homosexuality which features a gay man married to a straight woman.\n\nOther teachings include when in 1984 Hinckley (then in the First Presidency) had stated that \"marriage should not be viewed as a therapeutic step to solve problems such as homosexual inclinations or practices ...\" Oaks had also previously stated in 2007 that marriages should not be entered under false pretenses and that doing so can damage the lives of others. Church leaders are warned that encouraging members to cultivate heterosexual feelings generally leads to frustration and discouragement. Previously, The church had taught that it was possible to overcome same-sex feelings and that heterosexual feelings can emerge once an individual ceases any same-sex sexual activity. Oaks did state in 2007, however, that marriage would be appropriate for a man attracted to men who had \"shown their ability to deal with these feelings or inclinations and put them in the background, and feel a great attraction for a daughter of God and therefore desire to enter marriage and have children and enjoy the blessings of eternity.\" Several gay LDS men reported being able to maintain a heterosexual marriage in 2007.\n\nSeveral surveys have been done on the topic of LGBT Mormons and opposite-sex marriages. A 1997 study by members of the BYU Family Studies Department found that of over 200 single LDS women of diverse ages polled, 33% would be willing to seriously date and consider marriage with a hypothetical LDS college grad who had been sexually active with other men 3 years ago. A 2015 study found that 51% of the 1,612 LGBT Mormon respondents who had entered a mixed-orientation marriage ended up divorcing, and projected that 69% of all these marriages would ultimately end in divorce. The study also found that engaging in mixed-orientation marriages and involvement in the LDS church were correlated with higher rates of depression and a lower quality of life for LGBT people.\n\nThe LDS church has been involved with many pieces of legislation relating to LGBT discrimination and same-sex marriage. Leaders have stated that it will become involved in political matters if it perceives that there is a moral issue at stake and wields considerable influence on a national level with over a dozen members of congress having membership in the church in the early 2000s, and about 80% of Utah state lawmakers identifying as Mormon.\n\nIn February 2003, the LDS Church said it did not oppose a hate-crimes bill, which included sexual orientation, then under consideration in the Utah state legislature. The church opposes same-sex marriage, but does not object to rights regarding hospitalization and medical care, fair housing and employment rights, or probate rights, so long as these do not infringe on the integrity of the family or the constitutional rights of churches and their adherents to administer and practice their religion free from government interference. Following two months of negotiations between top Utah gay rights leaders and mid-level church leaders, the church supported a gay rights bill in Salt Lake City which bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in housing and employment, calling them \"common-sense rights.\" The law does not apply to housing or employment provided by religious organizations. Apostle Holland stated that it could be a model for the rest of the state. The LDS Church has not taken a position on ENDA.\n\nA 2017 Public Religion Research Institute survey found that over half (53%) of all Mormon adults believed small private business should be able to deny products and services to gay or lesbian people for religious reasons (compared to 33% of the 40,000+ American adults surveyed), and 24% of all Mormon adults oppose laws that protect LGBT Americans against discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations.\n\nIn reference to church involvement with legislation around LGBT people and marriage the apostle M. Russell Ballard has said the church is \"locked in\" if anything interferes with the principle of marriage being between a man and a woman, and stated that a very careful evaluation is made to determine what action is appropriate. Beginning in the mid-1990s, the LDS Church began to focus its attention on the issue of same-sex marriages with one scholar citing the church's views of God's male-female union plan, their sense of responsibility in publicly protecting traditional morality, and a fear of government encroachment in church performed marriages as the motivations for this opposition. In 1993, the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that discrimination against same-sex couples in the granting of marriage licenses violated the Hawaiian constitution. In response, the church's First Presidency issued a statement on February 13, 1994 declaring their opposition to same-sex marriage, and urging members to support efforts to outlaw it. With the lobbying of the LDS Church and several other religious organizations, the Hawaii legislature enacted a bill in 1994 outlawing same-sex marriages.\n\nIn response to Hawaii's same-sex marriage passage, the LDS Church released the 1995 \"\" reaffirming its stance that marriage is between one man and one woman. However, this monogamous stance has been strongly criticized as hypocritical given the Church's historical disagreement with this legal definition which bars polygamy.\n\nIn 2004, the Church officially endorsed an federal amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Utah Constitutional Amendment 3 banning any marriages not between one man and one woman and announced its opposition to political measures that \"confer legal status on any other sexual relationship\" than \"a man and a woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife.\" This statement seemed to also oppose civil unions, common-law marriages, plural marriages, or other family arrangements. This political involvement elicited the criticism of California Senator Mark Leno who questioned whether the Church's tax-exempt status should be revoked.\nOn August 13, 2008, the Church released a letter explaining why it believed that same-sex marriage would be detrimental to society and encouraging California members to support Prop 8 which would bar anything but opposite-sex marriages. The letter asked members to donate time and money towards the initiative. Church members would account for 80 to 90 percent of volunteers who campaigned door-to-door and as much as half of the nearly $40 million raised during the campaign. In November 2008, the day after California voters approved Proposition 8, the LDS Church stated that it does not object to domestic partnership or civil union legislation as long as these do not infringe on the integrity of the traditional family or the constitutional rights of churches. Soon after, top leader Whitney Clayton stated that members who opposed Prop. 8 may be subject to discipline from local church leaders. The Church's political involvement in Prop 8 and stance on homosexuality was denounced by the 2010 documentary film \"\". In a special meeting for some Oakland, California members it was reported that church historian and Seventy Marlin Jensen apologized to straight and gay members for their pain from the Proposition 8 campaign and some other church actions around homosexuality.\nOn December 20, 2013, the topic of same-sex marriage and the LDS church was raised again when U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby struck down the Utah ban on same-sex marriage, saying it violated the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. In response, the Church released instructions to leaders regarding same-sex marriage in Utah. These included the stance that, while the church disagrees with the court ruling, those who obtain same-sex marriage should not be treated disrespectfully. Additionally, it stated that church leaders were prohibited from employing their authority to perform marriages, and that any church property could not be used for same-sex marriages or receptions.\n\nIn November 2015, a new policy was released stating that members who are in a same-sex marriage are considered apostates and may be subject to church discipline. Additionally, the children of parents who are in same-sex relationships must wait until they are 18 years old and then disavow homosexual relationships before they can be baptized.\n\nA 2017 Public Religion Research Institute survey found that over half (52%) of Mormon young adults (18–29) supported same-sex marriage while less than a third (32%) of Mormon seniors (65+) did the same.\n\nBrigham Young University (BYU) is the largest religious university in North America and is the flagship institution of the LDS Church's educational system. A BYU study from 1950 to 1972 showed that 10% of BYU men and 2% of BYU women indicated having had a \"homosexual experience.\" Several LGBT rights organizations have criticized BYU's Honor Code as it relates to LGBT students and The Princeton Review has regularly ranked BYU among the most LGBT-unfriendly schools in the United States. BYU campus currently offers no official LGBT-specific resources.\nBYU has seen many changes in policies around its LGBT student population. In 1962 a ban on students known to have a homosexual orientation was enacted by Ernest Wilkinson, but softened a decade later by his successor Dallin H. Oaks in 1973 to only ban \"overt and active homosexuals.\" Under Oaks a system of surveillance and searches of dorms of problem students including suspected homosexuals was implemented including stake outs by BYU security looking for license plates of BYU students at gay bars in Salt Lake City and fake contact advertisements placed in gay publications attempting to ensnare BYU students. In the late 1990s a reference to \"homosexual conduct\" was added to the BYU Honor Code, and there was a ban on coming out for lesbian, gay, or bisexual students. In 2007, BYU changed the honor code to read that stating one's sexual orientation was not an honor code issue. This allowed for the formation of a group called USGA (Understanding Same-Gender Attraction) consisting of BYU students and other members of the Provo community which began meeting on campus in 2010 to discuss issues relating to homosexuality and the LDS Church. By December 2012 they were no longer allowed to hold meetings on campus.\n\nIn the past the LDS church (like Orthodox Judaism, evangelical Christianity, and Catholicism) encouraged its LGBTQ members to attempt to change their sexual orientation, and continued to communicate into 2015 that changing one's sexual orientation was possible through personal righteousness, prayer, faith in Christ, psychotherapy, and group therapy and retreats.\nStances softened over the years, however. In the 60s and 70s Church leaders taught that homosexuality was a curable disease and they encouraged self-help attempts by homosexual members to change their sexual orientation and cultivate heterosexual feelings. To assist in this, leaders developed an aversion therapy program on BYU campus for gay adolescents and adults from '59 to '83 since simply being attracted to people of the same sex was an excommunicable sin under church president Kimball. Teachings later changed as it became clear these self-help and aversive techniques were not working and, thus, from the 80s to the 2000s reparative therapy (also called conversion therapy) became the dominant treatment method. It was often recommended by Evergreen in an attempt to help homosexual members unchoose and unlearn their attractions.\n\nIn a 2010 survey of 625 Utah individuals 55% of Mormons believed sexual orientation could be changed, and a 2015 survey of 1,612 LGBT Mormons and former Mormons found that 73% of men and 43% of women had attempted sexual orientation change, usually through multiple methods across many years. Counselor-led sexual orientation change efforts dwindled among members around 2015 as church teachings evolved with leaders explicitly stating in 2012 that same-sex sexual attractions were not a choice and affirming in 2016 that therapy focusing on a change in sexual orientation was unethical.\n\nIn 1959 BYU began administering \"aversion therapy\" to \"cure,\" \"repair,\" or \"reorient\" homosexual feelings or behavior among Mormon males. The on-campus program lasted through the 60s and 70s, and faded out around 1983. BYU mental health counselors, LDS bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, general authorities, and the BYU Standards Office (equivalent to today's Honor Code Office) all referred young men to the BYU program. Gerald J. Dye, who was over the University Standards Office from 1971 to 1980 (renamed the Honor Code Office in 1991), stated that part of the \"set process\" for homosexual BYU students referred to his office for \"less serious\" offenses was to require that they undergo therapy to remain at BYU and that in special cases this included \"electroshock and vomiting aversion therapies.\" From 1975 to 1976 Max Ford McBride, a student at BYU, conducted electroshock aversion therapy on 17 men (with 14 completing the treatment) and published a dissertation on the use of electrical aversive techniques to treat ego-dystonic homosexuality. Participant in the 1975-76 BYU study Don Harryman wrote that he experienced \"burns on [his] arms and ... emotional trauma.\" In 2011 BYU admitted to the past use of electroshock therapy.\n\nLDS church leaders explicitly promoted non-aversive therapy attempts to change sexual orientation in the past, but have recently shifted away from those previous views. Some events and publications on LDS reparative or conversion therapy are shown below:\n\n\nIn society at large LGBT individuals especially youth are at a higher risk of depression and suicide due to minority stress stemming from societal anti-LGBT biases and stigma, rejection, and internalized homophobia. Some individuals and organizations have linked church teachings against homosexuality and the treatment of LGBT Mormons by other members and leaders as contributing to LGBT Mormon suicides. LGBT Mormon suicides and experiences with suicidal ideation have received media coverage.\n\nIn 2013 It was estimated that among the approximately 1000 homeless Utah youths, 30% to 40% were LGBTQ with about half of those coming from LDS homes The Ogden, Utah OUTreach Resource Center has reported that over half of their often homeless youth clients identify as LGBTQ. In the large 2012 survey \"Growing Up LGBT in America\" over two-thirds of LGBT youth in Utah reported not feeling accepted in their community, compared to 42% of LGBT youth nationwide, and 3/4 said they would need to leave Utah to feel accepted. In January 2016 the LDS church mourned over reported suicides of LGBT Mormons and stated that leaders and members are taught to \"reach out in an active, caring way to all, especially to youth who feel estranged or isolated.\" The Affirmation website reported over 30 LGBT Mormon victims of suicide between 1971 and 2008 including five gay male BYU students who all completed suicide in 1965.\n\nThough there are no official numbers for how many members of the LDS Church identify their romantic orientation as gay, bisexual, or lesbian, BYU's newspaper cited two LDS therapists who stated in 2003 that the supermajority-Mormon BYU student body is \"somewhere around 4 to 5 percent\" homosexual. LDS Family Services estimates that there are, on average, four or five members per church ward who experience same-sex attraction. The most recent external study, conducted in 1972, shows that between 10–13 percent of college-aged Mormon men reported past experimentation with homosexual behavior, which was similar to the percentage of non-Mormon men who similarly reported. The study did not tabulate the number of homosexuals who had never had a homosexual experience. Another poll of BYU students in 1997 found that 10% had a gay family member and 69% knew someone attracted to those of the same sex. Gary Watts, former president of Family Fellowship, estimates that only 10 percent of homosexual Mormons remain in the church. Others dispute that estimate, saying numbers in support groups for active Latter-day Saints and for self-identified gay Mormons are comparable. There is a variety of terminology used, including \"Moho\", to refer to a Mormon homosexual.\nProminent LGBT or homosexually attracted Mormons include Elder Christofferson's brother Tom Christofferson, therapist Ty Mansfield, therapist David Matheson, and therapist Josh Weed. Prominent LGBT former Mormons include writer Dustin Lance Black, singer Tyler Glenn, historian D. Michael Quinn, gay rights activist Leonard Matlovich, and attorney Kate Kendell. Organization that have supported Mormons and former Mormons that experience attractions to those of the same sex include , North Star, Mormons Building Bridges, Mama Dragons, Evergreen International, USGA. Break-off churches for LGBT Mormons include the United Order Family of Christ in the 70s and the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ by Antonio Feliz from the 80s to 2010.\n\nLGBT Mormon characters and themes have been featured in many films, plays, and pieces of literature. Examples include the audiovisual works \"Latter Days\", \"Believer\", \"\", TLC's \"My Husband's Not Gay\", the plays \"Book of Mormon musical\", \"Angels in America\", \"8\", \"14\", \"G.B.F.\", \"Facing East\", \"Confessions of a Mormon Boy\", \"Missa Solemnis or The Play About Henry\", and the novel \"Advise and Consent\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is associated with the development of the Australian New Left, as a political activist and public intellectual. His most iconic work \"A New Britannia\" gained notoriety for challenging the dominant approach to Australian history developed by the Old Left. He has written books on history, the media, politics and the visual arts.\n\nMcQueen was born in Brisbane to a working-class family that were active in the Australian Labor Party. He was educated at Marist College Ashgrove, and later edited the Queensland Young Labor newsletter. McQueen joined the ALP at the age of fifteen, and was instrumental in establishing the Queensland Young Labor organisation. In 1961, McQueen served as the ALP campaign organiser for the seat of Ryan. He completed a Bachelor of Arts with Honours at the University of Queensland in 1965. McQueen was an active participant in the anti-Vietnam War movement in Australia, campaigning against conscription as chairman of the Melbourne-based Revolutionary Socialist Group in 1968. His organisational engagement shaped his interest in Maoist and Gramscian theory, influencing his subsequent historical work. From 1966-1969 he was employed as a teacher at Glen Waverley High, Victoria. In 1970, he moved to Canberra, where he taught Australian history as a senior tutor at the Australian National University from 1970-1974. It was there that he met and befriended the historian, Manning Clark. McQueen had been head-hunted by Henry Mayer after reading McQueen's articles 'Convicts and Rebels' and 'A Race Apart'.\n\nMcQueen’s early academic writing was intent on dispelling the approaches to labour history generated by the Australian Old Left, especially Russel Ward's \"The Australian Legend\". His critique was first developed in \"Convicts and Rebels\", in which McQueen contested the Australian Whig history associated with the Old Left. As he argued:\n\nIn the article, McQueen doubted the authenticity of a democratic and egalitarian tradition emanating from Australia’s convict history. He challenged the egalitarian aspect of the tradition, highlighting the prominence of racism in convict society.\n\nIn 1970, McQueen wrote \"A New Britannia\", an historical analysis of the emergence and development of the Australian labour movement. It influentially argued that the history of the Australian labour movement, from colonisation to Australian federation (1788-1901), should be understood as an extension of Imperialism within the British Empire. The argument challenged existing account of the labour movement emerging from the Australian Old Left, which had mythologised the nation-building and democratic nature of the movement. In seeking to challenge accounts of Australian history presented in the Old Left, McQueen established the grounds to contest the Whig tradition in Australian scholarship. He identified that British imperialism cannot be separated from the experience of capitalism in Australia, and that Australian identity should be reconsidered in light of the role that racism and Patriarchy had played in development of the Australian labour movement. Together with an application of British New Left theorists, Perry Anderson and Tom Nairn, the approach redefined the nature of Australian historical enquiry, which would prove to be influential in the discipline of history.\n\nReceptions of the book were mixed. Terry Irving in reviewing A New Britannia, highlighted the work’s theoretical legacy, but also the need to produce a more developed theoretical engagement. He stated that A New Britannia “Will provoke angry discussion, but I hope it will also provoke the new left to develop the methodology necessary to write a new history”. This observation would influence the development of another hallmark of the Australian New Left, Class Structure in Australian History.\n\n"}

Both hyperdescent and hypodescent vary from, and may not be mutually exclusive with, other methods of determining lineage, such as patrilineality and matrilineality.\n\nUntil well into the 20th century, Australian state and federal governments engaged in a program of forcibly separating Aboriginal children with white ancestry from their Aboriginal families, and raising them in institutions that were intended to prepare them for white foster homes, jobs under white employers and/or marriage to whites.\n\nThis occurred according to theories of hyperdescent that were popular among white people. These ideas were not usually shared by Aboriginal people. White politicians and officials utilised pseudo-scientific theories that Aboriginal people were genetically and culturally inferior to whites, and were becoming extinct. These authorities believed that it was therefore improper for part-white children to live as Aboriginal people.\n\nIt was also widely believed that if Aboriginal people whose descendants had children with whites for several generations, successive generations of descendants would be less and less distinguishable from whites.\n\nIn Australia, while there were many racist laws intended to keep Aboriginal people in a socially inferior position, there were no anti-miscegenation laws and hence no barriers to marriages between Aboriginal and white partners.\n\nBrazil is an example of a country with a history of European slavery of black Africans somewhat analogous to that of the United States of America. However, in the United States, hypodescent was applied, gradually classifying anyone with African American ancestry as black, specifically in one-drop rule laws passed in Virginia and other states in the 20th century. In Brazil, by contrast, people of mixed race who were fair-skinned or were educated and of higher economic classes were accepted into the elite. Thomas E. Skidmore, in \"Black into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought\" explains that many of the Brazilian elite encouraged a national process of \"whitening\" through miscegenation. Skidmore writes (p. 55): \"In fact, miscegenation did not arouse the instinctive opposition of the white elite in Brazil. On the contrary, it was a well-recognized (and tacitly condoned) process by which a few mixed bloods (almost invariably light mulattoes) had risen to the top of the social and political hierarchy.\"\n\nHyperdescent is the rule in the rest of Latin America as well. The mestizo populations of Latin America usually consider themselves to be of European culture rather than American Indian. This is also apparent in the United States, where the practice of hypodescent is the rule among the non-Hispanic population contrasting with hyperdescent among Hispanics. Nearly half of U.S. Hispanics called themselves \"white\" in the 2000 Census, along with 80% of the population of Puerto Rico. Non-Hispanics, on the other hand, if they are of mixed race, will usually call themselves white only if they are a small fraction (1/8 or 1/16) American Indian, but otherwise will claim being of mixed race or even of the minority race. In the 2000 Census, of 35,305,818 Hispanics, only 407,073 (or just over 1%) called themselves American Indian, and only 2,224,082 (just over 6%) claimed to be of mixed race, even though these Hispanic groups (such as Mexicans) are majority mestizo in their home countries.\n\nAbout 41.2% of U.S. Hispanics identify as \"Some other race\" as of 2006, but government agencies which do not recognize \"Some other race\" (such as the FBI, the CDC, and the NCHS) include this group, and therefore over 90% of Hispanics, within the white population. In such cases, such as with the NCHS, separate statistics are often kept for \"White\" (which includes whites and over 90% of Hispanics) and \"non-Hispanic white\".\n\nAnother example of hyperdescent is in Iceland, which was initially populated by Norsemen, who took with them slaves from Ireland, Scotland and the Ancient Britons, including some women.\n\nModern Icelanders are considered to be a Scandinavian people ethnically, although many of the founding generations were Irish, Scots, or English women.\n\n\n"}

ISJR fosters international and interdisciplinary collaboration and promotes the exchange of new ideas, research, and theories related to justice and these related phenomena. ISJR facilitates such collaboration and exchange and the dissemination of knowledge through the publication of an academic journal Social Justice Research, the conduct of biennial scientific conferences, regular newsletters, and informal discussion by means of a listserv. Through these activities ISJR connects scholars in a wide variety of disciplines and geographic locations who are all focused on the study of justice. Scholars from a host of fields, including social psychology, sociology, economics, ethology and animal behavior, history, law and others are represented among the society's membership.\n\nEarly steps towards the establishment of ISJR were taken when the social psychologist Melvin J. Lerner accepted the Cleveringa Chair at the University of Leiden in 1984. His visit and the exchanges it facilitated led to a First International Conference on Social Justice in Human Relations, organized by Riel Vermunt in Leiden in 1986.\n\nA Second International Conference followed in 1988, again organized by Riel Vermunt in Leiden, at which the idea of a research center took shape, furthered in particular by Melvin Lerner, Herman Steensma, and Riel Vermunt. In 1989, a Center for Social Justice Research was formed cooperatively between the Universities of Leiden, Waterloo and Utrecht, with Melvin Lerner as director, and Piet Hermkens and Riel Vermunt as associate directors.\n\nFurther International Conferences were held in Utrecht, Netherlands (1991), Trier, Germany (1993), and Reno, NV, USA (1995), before at a sixth conference in Potsdam, Germany, in 1997, Leo Montada was charged with transforming the scientific network into an institutionalized association: the International Society for Justice Research. Founding members of ISJR were Ron Cohen, Karen Cook, Ron Dillehay, Russel Hardin, Melvin Lerner, Gerold Mikula, Leo Montada (founding president), Tom Tyler, and Riel Vermunt.\n\nQuestions about justice, which have occupied many scholars across different scientific disciplines for centuries, are ubiquitous in interpersonal relations, within and between communities, social groups, organizations, and states. They are at the core of social conflicts and essential for sustainable conflict resolutions. Given the importance of justice issues in everyday life, ISJR was founded with the aim of advancing justice research in every way. Its mission is to further three main goals:\n\n\nThe society meets biennially as a forum for the exchange and discussion of knowledge related to the multiple facets of justice and fairness. Information about upcoming and past meetings is available at http://www.isjr.org/conference/\n\nThe journal \"Social Justice Research\" (SJR) was founded in 1987 by Melvin Lerner to publish work related to the growing field. The journal is published quarterly.\n\n\"Social Justice Research\" is abstracted and indexed in the Social Sciences Citation Index. According to the \"Journal Citation Reports\", the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 0.796.\n\nThe journal is explicitly interdisciplinary, covering research from psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics, social policy research, political science, law, management science, and other fields that relates to the origins, structures, and consequences of justice in human affairs.\n\nThe ISJR Lifetime Achievement Award is presented bi-annually to honor distinguished lifetime contributions to the scientific study of justice and for efforts to advance justice as a field of study.\n\nThe ISJR Early Career Contribution Award is presented bi-annually to an accomplished young researcher in order to foster, encourage, and support excellence in justice-related scholarship.\n\nThe Morton Deutsch Award is presented annually for the best article published in the society’s journal, \"Social Justice Research\", every year, with preference given to contributions from investigators who are early in their research careers. The award is named after one of the society’s most prolific and influential contributors, Morton Deutsch.\n\n"}

JADE uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology combining user input, a knowledge base of stored plans, and suggestions by the system to provide the ability to develop large-scale and complex plans in minimal time.\n\nIn 1999, the operational tool used for managing force deployment planning in the U.S. military was the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES). The JADE tool for rapid crisis action planning had been developed by BBN Technologies under a contract to DARPA within the ARPA-Rome Planning Initiative, but was available only in a prototype environment. In subsequent years, JADE was successfully demonstrated and then integrated into the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and the Adaptive Course of Action (ACOA) environment while meeting the requirements of the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII-COE).\n\nAn official 2016 document approved for public release titled \"Human Systems Roadmap Review\" describes plans to create autonomous weapon systems that analyze social media and make decisions, including the use of lethal force, with minimal human involvement. This type of system is referred to as a Lethal Autonomous Weapon System (LAWS).\n\nThe name \"JADE\" comes from the jade green color seen on the island of Oahu in Hawaii where the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) is headquartered.\n\nJFRG II will be replaced with JADE.\n\nJADE integrates the technology of three software systems:\n\nJADE uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with case-based and generative planning methods to provide the ability to develop large-scale and complex plans in minimal time. JADE is a knowledge-based system that uses highly structured information that takes advantage of data hierarchies. JADE uses dialog initiated both by the user and by the system. JADE is used to rapidly create Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) to organize the deployment of combat-ready forces. Case-based planning methods (also known as the variant approach) use an existing plan for a similar mission and make the necessary modifications to the plan for the new mission. Generative planning methods build new plans from the mission goals and requirements by means of planning algorithms and the knowledge base.\n\nJADE supports the retrieval and reuse of previous plan elements for use in the development of new plans by using a map-oriented drag and drop interface. Force modules (FMs) from previous plans (cases) can be dragged from the case library and dropped onto a geographic destination. To support plan adaption of previous plans or modifications resulting from changing mission requirements, constraint checking against the knowledge base and mission goals causes automatic reminders from the system to notify the user of changes and improvements that need to be made. JADE is a mixed-initiative system, using dialog initiated by both the user (user-initiative) and by the system (system-initiative).\n\nThe knowledge base supports the development of deployment plans for war and situations other than war. JADE is designed to inter-operate with the Adaptive Course of Action (ACOA) program, which provides a near real-time distributed collaborative environment that supports end-to-end joint planning by multiple command centers. The Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) produced by JADE included an Operational Plan (OPLAN) which describes the mission and specifies where and when the forces involved in a mission are to be deployed. The TPFDD also specifies the combat forces and the combat service support required in order to support the mission, which includes transportation phasing, mode, and geographical locations.\n\n\"Time Phased Force Deployment Data\" (TPFDD) is a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) term. A TPFDD is the data base portion of an operation plan in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES); this system is part of the Global Command and Control System (GCCS). The TPFDD contains data on military units and forces regarding force data as scheduled over time, data for cargo and personnel that are not part of the units, and movement data for the operation plan.\n\nData regarding military units in the TPFDD include:\n\n"}

For six years he served as chief legal counsel at CEPOS.\n\nIn 2003, he received a cand.jur. degree from the University of Copenhagen. In 2004, after studying in Venice and Strasbourg, he received a degree in human rights and democratization from the European Inter-University Centre.\n\nHe was an assistant professor in International Human Rights at the University of Copenhagen from 2005 to 2007, and an adjunct professor there from 2007 to 2012.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007 he was a paralegal at Evershes. From 2007 to 2008 he was an attorney at Plesner. From 2008 to 2014 he was a chief legal counsel at CEPOS. He founded Justicia in 2014, and has been its director since that time.\n\nMchangama has contributed extensively to such publications as the Danish newspaper \"Information\" and Berlingske Tidende, the Norwegian website Minerva, and the American journals National Review and Foreign Affairs. He has written on such subjects as the oppression of women in Islam http://www.nationalreview.com/author/jacob-mchangama, the mass rapes in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2016 http://mchangama.blogs.berlingske.dk/2016/01/11/koln-og-det-vaerdimaessige-ophorsudsalg/, and the danger of laws against “hate speech,” blasphemy, and Koran-burning.\n\nHe reported in August 2011 that the European left was using the recent mass murder in Norway “to argue for limiting free speech” on the grounds that certain speech “can lead to murder.” Mchangama strongly challenged this premise.\n\nIn a February 2012 article, he maintained that “the combination of a debt crisis, an aging population addicted to public welfare benefits, one and a half decades of low growth rates, and increasing competition...is revealing the dark underbelly of welfarism” in Denmark. “It is not an overstatement,” he claimed, “to say that the balance between the state and the individual has been shifted decisively in favor of the state.” Because of a growing need for higher tax income, the Danish government was now harassing citizens in ways that violated their rights, and was dangerously skewing “the balance between public welfare and the free market...in favour of the former,” thus revealing the tendency of the welfare state to eat away at “the capitalist foundation which sustains it” and the fact that welfare ultimately “comes not only at the expense of economic freedom but also individual freedom and choice.”\n\nIn March 2013 Mchangama dismissed the “putative consensus” around UN Human Rights Counsil Resolution 16/18, which was seen as resolving divisions between free-speech advocates and those who would criminalize defamation of religion, as a “charade.” While the US saw the resolution as affrming First Amendment-style speech rights, Pakistan saw it as banning “advocacy of religious hatred.” In the middle were Europeans, who, Mchangama pointed out, were often eager to defend Islam from criticism. While praising the US for “standing firm on the need to counter intolerance and hatred through debate rather than censorship,” Mchangama called on the US to vigorously confront other interpretations of R 16/18.\n\nA February 2015 essay on the 26th anniversary of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie criticized the widespread notion that “free speech should not be 'abused' to insult the religious convictions of minorities,” and cited a recent speech by Barack Obama stating that when “we defend the legal right of a person to insult another’s religion, we’re equally obligated to use our free speech to condemn such insults.” Mchangama challenged this view, noting a recent London demo by Muslims who “were perfectly happy to exercise their right to free speech and association” but whose “core message was that those very rights should be denied to those with whom they disagree, and that insult to religious feelings is a kind of extremism not too dissimilar from that of the murder of cartoonists.”\n\nIn a March 2, 2015, Wall Street Journal op-ed, Mchangama lamented the “long-running pattern” in Europe “of bending to Islamist 'outrage' instead of defending free speech for all.” He noted with dismay that Denmark's current prime minister, Helle Thorning Schmidt, had demanded in 2006 that then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen distance himself from the Jyllands-Posten cartoons, that the Danish newspaper Politiken had agreed to a 2010 settlement in which it apologized for offending Muslims by reprinting Muhammed cartoons, and that Denmark’s former minister of foreign affairs, Uffe Ellemann Jensen, had expressed no sympathy for cartoonist Lars Vilks after an attempt on his life, saying that Vilks “had asked and begged to be attacked.” Mchangama warned against the rise of “offense creep,” whereby jihadists were being permitted to limit debate, and urged the democratic West to push back.\n\nIn April 2017, writing for The Washington Post, Mchangama called for Denmark to end its law of banning blasphemy. He noted that, while Denmark ranked first in the 2016 \"Rule of Law Index,\" the country shares a ban on blasphemy similar to that of countries like Iran and Pakistan.\n\nIn October 2018, writing for Quillette, Mchangama wrote about the decline of free speech in cyberspace, pointing to recent policies changes by Facebook and Twitter which had previously been strong advocates of free speech. He noted that these companies had previously adopted the American model 'viewpoint diversity' but then switched to the European model of \"'balancing' free speech against competing interests\". He noted the various inconsistencies in the application of such rules, such as the ban on denying the Holocaust while denying the American genocide remains tolerated. \n\nMchangama received the Venstre Party's Freedom Prize in 2013 for his involvement in the public debate about rights in Denmark and abroad. In his acceptance speech, Mchangama underscored that freedom and democracy do not come naturally – they need to be fought for as hard in a country like Denmark as in any other part of the world. “No one has won freedom by being silent.”\n"}

It is particularly associated with Prussia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Sweden and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian \"Landsturm\" was a reserve force that consisted of men aged 34 to 55. It was intended to provide replacements for the front line units and provide a militia for local defense. It was divided into the Austrian K.u.K. (\"Kaiserlich und Königlich\", \"Imperial and Royal\") Landsturm and the Hungarian Kgl. (\"Königlich\", \"Royal\") Landsturm.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Austrian Landsturm formed 40 regiments totaling 136 battalions in Austria and the Hungarian Landsturm formed 32 regiments totaling 97 battalions. They provided 20 Brigades who took to the field with the rest of the army.\n\nIn Prussia after the of 21 April 1813 all the male population from ages 15 to 60 who were capable of military service, who were not in the standing army or the \"Landwehr\", had to respond to the orders of the \"Landsturm\". It effectively formed the last national military reserve.\n\nKing Frederick William III of Prussia established the Prussian \"Landsturm\" as irregular military forces on 21 April 1813 by royal edict – the decree appeared in the \"\" (German: Prussian Code of Law) (pp. 79–89). The 1813 edict called for resistance \"by any means\" against the Napoleonic invasion. As a model and an explicit example, it took the Spanish \"Reglamento de Partidas y Cuadrillas\" of 28 December 1808 and the decree of 17 April 1809, known as \"Corso Terrestre\", during the Peninsula War against Napoleonic troops (ref. the introduction, §8, §52).\n\nAccording to this edict, all Prussian citizens were obliged to oppose the invasion by the enemy using any weapons available, like axes, pitchforks, scythes or shotguns (§43). All Prussians were further encouraged to not obey orders by the enemy, but rather to make themselves a nuisance to the Napoleonic troops however possible. This was a clear departure from ordinary \"jus in bello\" (Latin for Law of War), which commanded the civilian population to obey the orders of the occupying power, and the police forces to assist the occupying power in crushing any uprising. It did not qualify as an insurgency, but simply as criminal activity. The \"Landsturm\" edict explicitly stated that it was preferable to risk the danger brought about by the furies of an armed population rather than to let the enemy have control over the situation. \"Légitime défense\" \"justified the use of all means\" (§7), including chaos.\n\nThe edict was modified less than three months later on 17 July 1813 and was purified of its subversive content relative to the laws of war. The war then took place according to the standard rules of conventional warfare. Carl Schmitt qualified it as the \"Magna Carta of the partisan\". Despite its not being put to practice, fascist jurists considered it in a 1962 lecture in Francoist Spain to be the \"official document of the legitimation of the partisan of national defense\" and as the \"philosophical discovery of the partisan.\"\n\nThe North German Confederation Act of 9 November 1867 about the obligation for wartime military service and the Reich law about the \"Landsturm\" of 12 February 1875 restricted the obligation to the period from 17 to 42 years of age.\n\nIn the Bavarian Army the oldest ages for compulsory military service since the army reform of 1868 was referred to as the \"Landsturm\".\n\nIn February 1808, Russia invaded Swedish Finland and on March 14 Denmark-Norway declared war on Sweden, starting the Finnish War. On the very same day of the Danish declaration of war, Gustav IV Adolf, the Swedish king, issue a decree that ordered the formation of a new military unit, called \"Lantvärnet\", which is the Swedish name for \"landwehr\". The decree stated that all able unmarried men between 18 and 25 would become eligible to be conscripted for service in lantvärnet. The plan was that lantvärnet would consist of 60,000 men, almost at par with the standing army that numbered 66,000 men. However, in reality, lantvärnet consisted of only circa 30,000 men. The soldiers of lantvärnet were poorly equipped and they only received their pay on an irregular basis. This led to low morale amongst the men. After the war had ended the common people had a very negative view on lantvärnet and conscription. Lantvärnet was abolished in 1811. Some believe that the popular resistance against conscription caused by the neagtive experiences of lantvärnet lived on for many years and was one of the main causes that Sweden didn't reintroduce conscription until 1901.\n\nIn 1885, the Swedish parliament passed a law that formed \"Landstormen\". All able Swedish males between 27 and 32 would serve in landstormen as a territorial defence force in case of war. Landstormen however then only existed in theory and lacked any organization, only in the case of war were the Swedish Army to prepare plans and organizations for the landstorm. In 1892 the law was changed, and all men between 33 and 40 would serve in Landstormen in case of war. In 1901 Sweden introduced conscription, and became a proper second line unit, organizing the elder conscripted men (those between 33 and 40), and were tasked with territorial defence as well as securing the mobilization of the field army. In 1914 the law was changed and landstormen was to organize all men between 35 and 42. Also a mandatory 5 days refresher training was mandated for all those that belonged to landstormen. During World War I, Landstormen was frequently mobilized to secure the Swedish neutrality.\n\nLandstormen was again mobilized during World War II. In 1942 the Swedish Army went through a major re-organization and landstormen was abolished and incorporated into the regular army.\n\nIn the Swiss Army, the Landsturm was, until 1995, the third age class (men from 42 - 50) after the Elite (men from 18 - 32) and the Landwehr (men from 32 - 42).\n\n"}

The impoverished peasants mistook the government introduction of public works aimed at stemming the Great Crisis as an attempt to reintroduce serfdom. First clashes occurred on June 21, over the next weeks thousands of people became involved across the Bieszczady region (primarily around the town of Lesko), as Polish police and military put down the unrest. The uprising ended on 9 July, with about a dozen dead, many wounded and a few hundred peasants arrested. \n\nThe uprising was directly connected with the idea of a local magnate, Count Jan Potocki of Rymanow, who suggested that local residents should take part in public works project. In the area of Rymanow the idea was widely accepted, as local Lemkos respected Potocki, and joined the project, whose purpose was to improve infrastructure - roads, bridges, schools. The situation was different in the Bieszczady Mountains, where the Starosta of Lesko tried to introduce Potocki’s idea. On June 19, 1932, a meeting of Potocki and local officials took place at Ustrzyki Dolne, during which an Organizational Committee was created. \n\nNext meeting took place on June 21, at Brzegi Dolne. Among its participants was engineer Stefan Zieba, who urged peasants to join the public works. In response, Mykola Werebenec, the son of a local Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church parish priest claimed that Potocki’s idea was in fact an attempt to reintroduce serfdom. The meeting turned into a heated argument, and then into a riot, in which peasants, armed with sticks and pickaxes, surrounded the officials. Altogether, 39 people were arrested, including 4 women. Some other sources claim that the peasants were egged on by members of Communist Party of Western Ukraine, who spread rumour that serfdom would be brought back. \n\nThe arrest of 39 peasants echoed in the area, and soon afterwards, residents of local villages, such as Telesnica Oszwarowa, Lobozew Dolny, Lobozew Gorny, Bobrka joined the rebellion. Their struggle was supported by parish priests.\n\nAmong organizers of the uprising were such individuals, as Piotr Madej, Stanislaw Lenkiewicz, Wladyslaw Nowicki, Mikolaj Malecki, Stanislaw Drozd, Antoni Paclawski and Iwan Bucio. Peasants were armed with axes, pickaxes, rakes and scythes. They were faced by reinforced police units, as well as soldiers of the Polish Army garrison in Przemyśl. First clash took place at Brzegi Dolne on June 23, after which several arrests took place. \n\nIn the following days clashes took place at several other villages. At Lobozew, some 2,000 peasants fought the police and the soldiers, with five casualties. Urged by the police to disperse, the peasants stated that they would go home only if police units were withdrawn from Lobozow. As the situation did not improve, the starosta of Lesko informed the Voivode of Lwow Voivodeship, asking him for help. As a result, Polish Army sent the 2nd Regiment of Podhale Rifles from Sanok, mounted and foot police units from Przemysl, Sambor, Sanok and Mosty Wielkie, as well as a squadron of Polish Airforce. \n\nThe uprising spread to villages from the counties of Dobromil, Sanok and Turka. Armed peasants fought four skirmishes with the police and the soldiers, near the villages of Lobozew, Telesnica Oszwarowa and Bobrka. Since government forces were armed with machine guns, the insurgents withdrew southwards, in the sparsely populated hills. They were followed by the army units, which pacified the peasants.\n\nAltogether, up to 800 people were arrested, out of some 5,000 participants from 19 villages. The exact number of casualties has not been established. In the historiography of the People's Republic of Poland, the Lesko uprising was regarded as a popular insurrection against oppressive capitalists. A monument commemorating the event was erected in the village of Bóbrka.\n\n"}
{"id": "1938138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938138", "title": "Licence Raj", "text": "Licence Raj\n\nThe Licence Raj or Permit Raj (\"rāj\", meaning \"rule\" in Hindi) is the elaborate system of licences, regulations and accompanying red tape that were required to set up and run businesses in India between 1947 and 1990.\n\nThe Licence Raj was a result of the Nehru government's decision to have a planned economy where all aspects of the economy are controlled by the state and licences are given to a select few. Up to 80 government agencies had to be satisfied before private companies could produce something and, if granted, the government would regulate production.\n\nReforms since the mid-1980s have significantly reduced regulation, but Indian labour laws still prevent manufacturers from reducing their workforce without prohibitive burdens.\n\nThe term plays off \"British Raj\", the period of British rule in India. It was coined by Indian freedom fighter and statesman Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari, who firmly opposed it for its potential for political corruption and economic stagnation and founded the Swatantra Party to oppose these practices.\n\nIn his newspaper, Rajagopalachari wrote:\n\nI want the corruptions of the Permit/Licence Raj to go. [...] I want the officials appointed to administer laws and policies to be free from pressures of the bosses of the ruling party, and gradually restored back to the standards of fearless honesty which they once maintained. [...] I want real equal opportunities for all and no private monopolies created by the Permit/Licence Raj.\n\nThe architect of the system of Licence Raj was Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. Private players could manufacture goods only with official licences.\n\nThe key characteristic of the Licence Raj is a Planning Commission that centrally administers the economy of the country. Like a command economy, India had Five-Year Plans on the lines of the Five-Year Plans in the Soviet Union. Arguing that the Planning Commission has outlived its utility, Modi government disbanded it in 2014.\n\nBefore the process of reforms began in 1991, the government attempted to close the Indian economy to the outside world. The Indian currency, the rupee, was inconvertible and high tariffs and import licensing prevented foreign goods reaching the market. India also operated a system of central planning for the economy, in which firms required licences to invest and develop. This bureaucracy often led to absurd restrictions: up to 80 agencies had to be satisfied before a firm could be granted a licence to produce, and, even then, the state would decide what was produced, how much, at what price and what sources of capital were used.\n\nThe government also prevented firms from laying off workers or closing factories. The central pillar of the policy was import substitution industrialisation, the belief that countries like India needed to rely on internal markets for development, not international trade, a belief generated by a mixture of socialism and the experience during the colonial period.\n\nThe Licence Raj system was in place for four decades. The government of India initiated a liberalisation policy under P. V. Narasimha Rao. Narasimha Rao also had the responsibility of industries minister; he is directly responsible for dismantling the Licence Raj.\n\nLiberalisation resulted in substantial growth in the Indian economy, which continues today. The Licence Raj is considered to have been significantly reduced in 1991 when India had only two weeks of foreign reserves left. In return for an IMF bailout, Gold bullion was transferred to London as collateral, the Rupee devalued and economic reforms were forced upon India. The federal government, with Manmohan Singh as finance minister, reduced licensing regulations; lowered tariffs, duties and taxes; and opened up to international trade and investment.\n\nThe reform policies introduced after 1991 removed many economic restrictions. Industrial licensing was abolished for almost all product categories, except for alcohol, tobacco, hazardous chemicals, industrial explosives, electronics, aerospace and pharmaceuticals. \n\nOn 6 August 2014 the Indian Parliament raised the limit on foreign direct investment in the defence sector to 49% and removed the limit for certain classes of infrastructure projects: high speed railways, including construction, operation and maintenance of high-speed train projects; suburban corridor projects through PPP; dedicated freight lines; rolling stock including train sets; locomotives manufacturing and maintenance facilities; railway electrification and signalling systems; freight terminals and passenger terminals; infrastructure in industrial park pertaining to railway line, and mass rapid transport systems.\n\n"}
{"id": "5115759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5115759", "title": "MAINWAY", "text": "MAINWAY\n\nMAINWAY is a database maintained by the United States' National Security Agency (NSA) containing metadata for hundreds of billions of telephone calls made through the four largest telephone carriers in the United States: AT&T, SBC, BellSouth (all three now called AT&T), and Verizon. According to Pulitzer Prize winning journalist James Risen, MAINWAY was the most important of the four components that comprised the ThinThread program.\n\nThe existence of this database and the NSA program that compiled it was unknown to the general public until \"USA Today\" broke the story on May 10, 2006. It is estimated that the database contains over 1.9 trillion call-detail records. According to former NSA director Michael Hayden, the NSA sought to deploy MAINWAY prior to 9/11 in response to the Millennium Plot but did not do so because it did not comply with US law. Hayden wrote: \"The answer from [the Justice Department] was clear: '...you can't do this.'\" As of June 2013, the database stores metadata for at least five years.\n\nThe records include detailed call information (caller, receiver, date/time of call, length of call, etc.) for use in traffic analysis and social network analysis, but do not include audio information or transcripts of the content of the phone calls.\n\nThe database's existence has prompted fierce objections. It is often viewed as an illegal warrantless search and a violation of the pen register provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and (in some cases) the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nThe George W. Bush administration neither confirmed nor denied the existence of the domestic call record database. This contrasts with a related NSA controversy concerning warrantless surveillance of selected telephone calls; in that case they did confirm the existence of the program of debated legality. That program's code name was Stellar Wind.\n\nSimilar programs exist or are planned in other countries, including Sweden (Titan traffic database) and Great Britain (Interception Modernisation Programme).\n\nThe MAINWAY equivalent for Internet traffic is MARINA.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a related suit against AT&T on January 31, 2006, alleging that the firm had given NSA access to its database, a charge reiterated in the \"USA Today\" article.\nVerizon and BellSouth have both claimed they were never contacted by the NSA, nor did they provide any information to the agency, though US codes of law permit companies to lie about their activities when the President believes that telling the truth would compromise national security.\n\nOn May 22, 2006, it was revealed by investigative reporter Seymour Hersh and \"Wired\" magazine that the program involved the NSA setting up splitters to the routing cores of many telecoms companies and to major Internet traffic hubs. These provided a direct connection via an alleged \"black room\" known as Room 641A. This room allows most U.S. telecoms communications and Internet traffic to be redirected to the NSA. The NSA used them to eavesdrop and order police investigations of tens of thousands of ordinary Americans without judicial warrants.\n\nAccording to a security consultant who worked on the program, \"What the companies are doing is worse than turning over records ... they're providing total access to all the data,\" and a former senior intelligence official said, \"This is not about getting a cardboard box of monthly phone bills in alphabetical order ... the N.S.A. is getting real-time actionable intelligence.\"\n\nOn June 30, 2006 \"USA Today\" printed a partial retraction about its controversial article the prior month saying: \"... USA TODAY also spoke again with the sources who had originally provided information about the scope and contents of the domestic calls database. All said the published report accurately reflected their knowledge and understanding of the NSA program, but none could document a contractual relationship between BellSouth or Verizon and the NSA, or that the companies turned over bulk calling records to the NSA. Based on its reporting after the May 11 article, USA TODAY has now concluded that while the NSA has built a massive domestic calls record database involving the domestic call records of telecommunications companies, the newspaper cannot confirm that BellSouth or Verizon contracted with the NSA to provide bulk calling records to that database ...\"\n\nFive days after the story appeared, BellSouth officials said they could not find evidence of having handed over such records. \"Based on our review to date, we have confirmed no such contract exists and we have not provided bulk customer calling records to the NSA,\" the officials said. \"USA Today\" replied that BellSouth officials had not denied the allegation when contacted the day before the story was published. Verizon has also asserted that it has not turned over such records.\n\nCompanies are permitted by US securities law (15 U.S.C. 78m(b)(3)(A)) to refrain from properly accounting for their use of assets in matters involving national security, when properly authorized by an agency or department head acting under authorization by the President of the United States. This legalese essentially means that companies can falsify their accounting reports and lie about their activities when the President decides that it is in the interests of national security to do so. President Bush issued a presidential memorandum on May 5, 2006 delegating authority to make such a designation to Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte, just as the NSA call database scandal appeared in the media.\n\nThe \"USA Today\" report indicated that Qwest's then CEO, Joseph Nacchio, doubted the NSA's assertion that warrants were unnecessary. In negotiations, the NSA pressured the company to turn over the records. Qwest attorneys asked the NSA to obtain approval from the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. When the NSA indicated they would not seek this approval, Qwest's new CEO Richard Notebaert declined NSA's request for access. Later, T-Mobile explicitly stated they do not participate in warrantless surveillance.\n\nAccording to an anonymous source, the database is \"the largest database ever assembled in the world,\" and contains call-detail records (CDRs) for all phone calls, domestic and international. A call-detail record consists of the phone numbers of the callers and recipients along with time, position and duration of the call. While the database does not contain specific names or addresses, that information is widely available from non-classified sources.\n\nAccording to the research group TeleGeography, AT&T (including the former SBC), Verizon, and BellSouth connected nearly 500 billion telephone calls in 2005 and nearly two trillion calls since late 2001. It is reported that all four companies were paid to provide the information to the NSA.\n\nAlthough such a database of phone records would not be useful on its own as a tool for national security, it could be used as an element of broader national security analytical efforts and data mining. These efforts could involve analysts using the data to connect phone numbers with names and links to persons of interest. Such efforts have been the focus of the NSA's recent attempts to acquire key technologies from high tech firms in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Link analysis software, such as Link Explorer or the Analyst's Notebook, is used by law enforcement to organize and view links that are demonstrated through such information as telephone and financial records, which are imported into the program from other sources. Neural network software is used to detect patterns, classify and cluster data as well as forecast future events.\n\nUsing relational mathematics, it is possible to find out if someone changes their telephone number by analyzing and comparing calling patterns. \n\nThinThread, a system designed largely by William Binney, which pre-dated this database, but was discarded for the Trailblazer Project, introduced some of the technology which is used to analyze the data. Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA, admitted as much in an interview, saying: \"But we judged fundamentally that as good as [ThinThread] was, and believe me, we pulled a whole bunch of elements out of it and used it for our final solution for these problems, as good as it was, it couldn't scale sufficiently to the volume of modern communications.\" Where ThinThread encrypted privacy data, however, no such measures have been reported with respect to the current system.\n\n\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee was scheduled to hold hearings with NSA whistle-blower Russell Tice the week following the revelation of the NSA call database. Tice indicated that his testimony would reveal information on additional illegal activity related to the NSA call database that has not yet been made public, and that even a number of NSA employees believe what they are doing is illegal. Tice also told the \"National Journal\" that he \"will not confirm or deny\" if his testimony will include information on spy satellites being used to spy on American citizens from space.\nHowever, these hearings did not occur and the reason why is unknown.\n\nOn June 6, 2013, in the wake of well publicized leaks of top secret documents by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, conservative public interest lawyer and Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit (\"Klayman v. Obama\") challenging the constitutionality and statutory authorization of the government's wholesale collection of phone record metadata. On June 10, the American Civil Liberties Union and Yale Law School's Media Freedom and Information Clinic filed a motion with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) asking for the secret FISC opinions on the Patriot Act to be made public in the light of the \"Guardian\"'s publication of a leaked FISC court order about the collection of Verizon call records metadata. On June 11, the ACLU filed a lawsuit (\"ACLU v. Clapper\") against Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenging the legality of the NSA's telephony metadata collection program. Once the judge in each case had issued rulings seemingly at odds with one another, Gary Schmitt (former staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence) wrote in \"The Weekly Standard\", \"The two decisions have generated public confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA's data collection program—a kind of judicial 'he-said, she-said' standoff.\" The ACLU contested the decision in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\nIn 2015, the appeals court ruled that Section 215 of the Patriot Act did not authorize the bulk collection of metadata, which judge Gerard E. Lynch called a \"staggering\" amount of information.\n\nIn November 2014, an appeals court in Washington heard arguments in the case \"Klayman v. Obama\". During the hearings, Justice Department attorney H. Thomas Byron defended the NSA's collection of phone records and stated that \"the government doesn't and never has acquired all or nearly all of the telephone call data records.\" \n\nSpurred by the public disclosure of the NSA call database, a lawsuit was filed against Verizon on May 12, 2006 at the Federal District Court in Manhattan by Princeton, N.J.-based attorneys Carl Mayer and Bruce Afran. The lawsuit seeks $1,000 for each violation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and would total approximately $5 billion if the court certifies the suit as a class-action lawsuit.\n\nOn May 12, 2006, an Oregon man filed a lawsuit against Verizon Northwest for $1 billion.\n\nOn May 13, 2006, a complaint in Maine was filed by a group of 21 Maine residents who asked the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to demand answers from Verizon about whether it provided telephone records and information to the federal government without customers' knowledge or consent. Maine law requires the PUC to investigate complaints against a utility if a petition involves at least 10 of the utility's customers.\n\nShortly after the NSA call database story surfaced, a San Francisco lawsuit, \"Hepting v. AT&T\", was filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported on May 14, 2006, that the U.S. Justice Department called for an end to an eavesdropping lawsuit against AT&T Corp., citing possible damage from the litigation to national security.\n\nThe US government indicated in an April 28 Statement of Interest in the AT&T case, that it intends to invoke the State Secrets Privilege in a bid to dismiss the action.\n\nThe NSA call database was not approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) as required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The FISC was established in 1978 to secretly authorize access to call-identifying information and interception of communications of suspected foreign agents on U.S. soil. Stanford Law School's Chip Pitts provided an overview of the relevant legal concerns in The Washington Spectator.\n\nSeparate from the question of whether the database is illegal under FISA, one may ask whether the call detail records are covered by the privacy protection of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This is unclear. As the U.S. has no explicit constitutional guarantee on the secrecy of correspondence, any protection on communications is an extension by litigation of the privacy provided to \"houses and papers.\"\nThis again is dependent on the flexuous requirement of a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\".\n\nThe most relevant U.S. Supreme Court case is \"Smith v. Maryland\".\nIn that case, the Court addressed pen registers, which are mechanical devices that record the numbers dialed on a telephone; a pen register does not record call contents. The Court ruled that pen registers are not covered by the Fourth Amendment: \"The installation and use of a pen register, [...] was not a 'search,' and no warrant was required.\" More generally, \"This Court consistently has held that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he [...] voluntarily turns over to third parties.\"\n\nThe data collecting activity may however be illegal under other telecommunications privacy laws.\n\nThe 1986 Stored Communications Act (18 U.S.C. § 2701) forbids turnover of information to the government without a warrant or court order, the law gives consumers the right to sue for violations of the act.\nA governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communication service of the contents of a wire or electronic communication...only pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n\nHowever, the Stored Communications Act also authorizes phone providers to conduct electronic surveillance if the Attorney General of the United States certifies that a court order or warrant is not required and that the surveillance is required:\n\n[Telephone providers] are authorized to...intercept...communications or to conduct electronic surveillance...if such provider...has been provided with a certification in writing by...the Attorney General of the United States that no warrant or court order is required by law, that all statutory requirements have been met, and that the specified assistance is required.\n\nThe Act provides for special penalties for violators when \"the offense is committed...in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or any State.\"\n\nFinally, the act allows any customer whose telephone company provided this information to sue that company in civil court for (a) actual damages to the consumer, (b) any profits by the telephone company, (c) punitive damages, and (d) attorney fees. The minimum amount a successful customer will recover under (a) and (b) is $1,000:\n\nPresident Clinton signed into law the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994, after it was passed in both the House and Senate by a voice vote. That law is an act \"to make clear a telecommunications carrier's duty to cooperate in the interception of communications for law enforcement purposes, and for other purposes.\" The act states that a court order isn't the only lawful way of obtaining call information, saying, \"A telecommunications carrier shall ensure that any interception of communications or access to call-identifying information effected within its switching premises can be activated only in accordance with a court order or other lawful authorization.\"\n\nThe FISC was inspired by the recommendations of the Church Committee, which investigated a wide range of intelligence and counter-intelligence incidents and programs, including some U.S. Army programs and the FBI program COINTELPRO.\n\nIn 1971, the US media reported that COINTELPRO targeted thousands of Americans during the 1960s, after several stolen FBI dossiers were passed to news agencies. The Church Committee Senate final report, which investigated COINTELPRO declared that:\n\nThe legality of blanket wiretapping has never been sustained in court, but on July 10, 2008 the US Congress capitulated to the administration in granting blanket immunity to the administration and telecom industry for potentially illegal domestic surveillance. The bill was passed during the crucible of the 2008 presidential campaign, and was supported by then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., who was campaigning against Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for the presidency.\n\nObama provided qualified support for the bill. He promised to \"carefully monitor\" the program for abuse, but said that, \"Given the legitimate threats we face, providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay. So I support the compromise.\" It is difficult to argue that appropriate safeguards are in place, when CDRs from all the major telecommunications companies are provided to the NSA.\n\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has released an opinion, dated August 29, 2013, written by U.S. District Judge Claire Eagan of the Northern District of Oklahoma, in which she said \"metadata that includes phone numbers, time and duration of calls is not protected by the Fourth Amendment, since the content of the calls is not accessed.\" In the option, Judge Eagan said \"data collection is authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act that allows the FBI to issue orders to produce tangible things if there are reasonable grounds to believe the records are relevant to a terrorism investigation.\" The option authorized the FBI to \"collect the information for probes of 'unknown' as well as known terrorists.\" According to the \"New York Times\", \"other judges had routinely reauthorized the data collection program every 90 days.\"\n\n\n"}

Using this method, crew members were able to stay clean, while conserving their limited water supply.

Neosocialists came to oppose the majority of the socialists in France National Assembly and the faction was expelled from SFIO. \n\nOriginally linked to fascist politics in France, neosocialists expressed admiration for Italian fascism. This ideological orientation later emerged in a newly formed party, the Neosocialist Party, which advocated authoritarianism and antisemitic policies as well as intimate cooperation with the Nazis.\n\nIn the wake of the Great Depression, a group of right-wing members, led by Henri de Man in Belgium (the founder of the ideology of \"planisme\", i.e. planism meaning economic planning) and in France by Marcel Déat, Pierre Renaudel, René Belin, the \"neo-Turks\" of the Radical-Socialist Party (Pierre Mendès-France), opposed themselves to both gradual reformism and the idea of a Marxist-inspired popular revolution. Instead, influenced by Henri de Man's planism, they promoted a \"constructive revolution\" headed by the state and technocrats which would institute planification—the establishment of a technocratic planned economy. Such ideas also influenced the non-conformist movement on the French right.\n\nMarcel Déat published in 1930 \"Perspectives socialistes\" (\"Socialist Perspectives\"), a revisionist work closely influenced by Henri de Man's planism. Along with over a hundred articles written in \"La vie socialiste\" (\"The Socialist Life\"), the review of the SFIO's right-wing, \"Perspective socialistes\" marked the shift of Déat from classical socialism to neosocialism. Déat replaced class struggle with class collaboration and national solidarity, advocated corporatism as a model of social organisation, replaced the notion of \"socialism\" with \"anti-capitalism\" and supported a technocratic state which would plan the economy and in which parliamentarism would be replaced by political technocracy.\n\nThe neosocialist faction inside of the SFIO, which included Marcel Déat and Pierre Renaudel, were expelled during the November 1933 Congress because of their revisionist stances and admiration for Italian fascism. The neosocialists advocated alliances with the middle classes and favoured making compromises with the \"bourgeois\" Radical-Socialist Party to enact the SFIO's program one issue at a time. After having been expelled from the SFIO, Marcel Déat and his followers created the Socialist Party of France – Jean Jaurès Union (1933–1935) which was one of the main expression of neosocialism in France. Inside the General Confederation of Labour trade union, neosocialism was represented by René Belin's \"Syndicats\" (then \"Redressements\")'s faction.\n\nOn the other hand, Henri de Man's planism influenced the left-wing of the Radical Party, called \"Young Turks\" (among them Pierre Mendès-France). \"Planisme\" would later influence dirigism (\"dirigisme\"), the postwar semi-planned economy, regionalism, spatial planning as well as Mendesism, \"left-wing Gaullism\" (Louis Vallon) and socialist clubs in the 1960s (Club Jean Moulin).\n\nThe neosocialists eventually evolved toward a form of participatory and national socialism which led them to join with the reactionary right and support the collaborationist Vichy Regime during the Second World War (René Belin and Marcel Déat became members of the Vichy government). As a result, Déat's neosocialism was discredited in France after the war.\n\n"}

It was integrated with the Greek government-in-exile in a national unity government at the Lebanon conference in May 1944.\n\nThe PEEA was established on 10 March 1944 by the leftist National Liberation Front (EAM)/Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) movement, which was then in control of much of the country. Its aims, according to its founding charter, were, \"to intensify the struggle against the conquerors ... for full national liberation, for the consolidation of the independence and integrity of our country (...) and for the annihilation of domestic fascism and armed traitor formations\".\n\nThe PEEA's authority was significantly reinforced after the establishment of the National Council () in 1944. The National Council was an assembly elected by secret elections organised by the PEEA in late April 1944 in both the liberated parts of Greece and the still-occupied cities, mainly Athens. Approximately one million people took part in these elections, which are notable for the fact that for the first time in Greece, women were allowed to vote. The Council first converged in Koryschades, a mountain village of Evrytania, from 14 to 27 May 1944. Its main act was voting a resolution, an extract of which is quoted:\n\nThe PEEA's first president was Evripidis Bakirtzis, the former leader of National and Social Liberation (EKKA). On April 18 Alexandros Svolos, a prominent professor of constitutional law of the University of Athens, took his position and Bakirtzis became vice-president. Not only communist leaders but also many progressive bourgeois, who had nothing to do with communist ideas, participated in the PEEA.\n\nELAS not only resisted German and Italian occupation forces but also re-organised life in Free Greece, the mountainous areas (i.e. the biggest part of Greece) it controlled. EAM, with the co-ordination and organization of the PEEA, helped the local people organise schools, hospitalise refugees from the big cities and protect the crops from German looting. Amateur actors and musicians created travelling theatres and bands, something that most rural communities had never seen or heard before. Another achievement of ELAS (due partially to the progressive ideas and partially to the lack of men) was to promote women's rights. Young girls, who until then were working at home or the fields, had the opportunity to educate and express themselves. There were also improvised telecommunications either by telephone lines or by messengers and systems of re-distribution of food-resources, so that no village would starve.\n\n"}

The basic premise is to have demographics represented at all levels and aspects of the civilization according to national statistics.\n\nA quota system is often part of any affirmative action policies, but in those cases it is mainly used as a \"target\", within a single entity. Quotaism applies to the whole country and is enforced by legislation on all public and private entities.\n\n\n\nLocal trade unions commonly use the term \"Absolute representation\" in this regard.\n\nQuota distribution does not necessarily fit the real composition of the population;\n\nIt is complicated to keep to a quota system in equilibrium since the demographics are continually changing. Most quota systems are based on national census data, which is tends to be collected once every 5-10 years.\n\nLeaving positions unfilled in state departments can have a negative effect on service delivery. This is a very serious concern when applied in police forces of countries with high crime figures. This can also lead to slow economic growth and social mobility pigeonholing.\n\nQuota systems can have a discriminative effect on minorities;\n\nOnly elite members of the majority demographic benefits.

{"id": "23464409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23464409", "title": "Service voucher", "text": "Service voucher\n\nA service voucher is a financial instrument which allows a public authority to target social services at those it deems in need, and at the same time to promote employment and labour market integration. It effectively boosts demand for certain services which meet social policy objectives.\n\nA voucher scheme will typically start by defining services which are needed in society, but which are being supplied neither by the market nor by the public sector. These might include for example home care, household repairs, ironing, or bicycle hire and repair. The activities within the scheme will typically be agreed with trade unions and employers' organisations, to avoid concern about the disturbance of unfair competition.\n\nPotential providers of these services are identified, often from among the long-term unemployed.\n\nVouchers are sold to people who want to use the service. The price is subsidised, so that on the one hand the service is affordable - and for instance can compete with informal (illegal) work - and on the other provides decent condition working for the employees (including social insurance cover, holiday pay etc.). An example of this kind of subsidy regime can be found in Belgium, where service vouchers for house cleaning, laundry, ironing, sewing, cooking, running errands, and transport for people with reduced mobility are sold to people who require these services. Each person residing in Belgium with a National Register Number is entitled to a quota of 500 service vouchers a year, with the first 400 service vouchers sold at a rate of 9 EUR each, and remaining 100 service vouchers sold at a rate of 10 EUR. In addition, each household has a quota of maximum 1000 service vouchers, with exceptions given to single parents and people with disabilities, who may be entitled to 2000 service vouchers, depending on the circumstances. Mothers with their own business who have just given birth are also entitled to 105 extra service vouchers. This initiative was made in order to combat the black market and has resulted in the creation of many jobs. This subsidy scheme allows for domestic workers to be declared and benefit from a legal salary, health insurance, paid holidays, and a pension; benefits that were not all possible when working on the black market. For each service voucher, a domestic servant receives a salary of 22.69 EUR, paid by both the customer and the state. In addition, tax breaks are also given to the first 156 service vouchers purchased yearly, creating another incentive to purchase these services. Similar systems exists in France and in Sweden.\n\nVouchers can be defined as subsidies granting limited purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of services. In the field of personal and household services, their use has been growing in recent years, following successful experiences in some European countries. Vouchers can be seen as tools that would lie between in kind provision of services and cash distribution of income to be used (or not) for these services. Very basically, vouchers are simple means of payment. The payment can be integrally made by the user, or by a public financer, and mixed forms of payment with other actors can be imagined (e.g. companies paying for part of the cost or insurance companies providing some services through this means).\n\nIn the field of care policies, the increasing use of vouchers has sometimes been analysed as an element of a current commodification trend that corresponds to an increase in what can be labelled a “social market” logic. Social markets mainly rely on demand-side measures, the aim being to ensure that users or consumers of services are offered more choice and are, financially speaking, able to purchase personal services. The market logic involves developing the demand side with the aim of transforming “latent” demand into effective demand. These social markets thus involve competition between different modes of provision, with the user receiving direct or indirect assistance from public authorities to make their choice.\n\nIn the field of “non-care” services, vouchers are being used mostly for the same reasons as those in the care sector, that is for a series of supposed advantages in particular regarding efficiency of public spending, expected impact on undeclared labour but also quality issues (quality of services and quality of jobs). \n\n\nBelgium's service voucher sites per region:\n\nFlanders: http://www.dienstencheques-vlaanderen.be/\n\nBrussels: http://dienstencheque.brussels/\n\nWallonia: http://www.wallonie-titres-services.be/\n\n\"The Service Voucher in Belgium\", paper to EU mutual learning seminar, 26–27 October 2006\n\n\"Service vouchers - a family of instruments for employment\", Jean-François Lebrun, European Commission, 17 October 1996\n"}

Its missions are to protect the constitutional order, sovereignty, territorial integrity and military potential of Georgia from illegal acts of special services and individuals of foreign countries; to prevent violent and unconstitutional change of order and state authority. Further it is to ensure economic security and fight terrorism on national and international level, transnational organized crime and international crime as well as carry out measures towards prevention, detection and suppression of corruption. It is also responsible for protecting state secrets. The newly established independent agency is a former subordinate branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia and has been re-activated in 2015.\n\nHaving its roots in the Soviet Union, in the 1940s the State Security Agency was originally the State Security Ministry and was repeatedly reformed and merged with the Ministry of Internal Affairs over the course of several decades before both ministries ultimately merged in 2003. Until 2015 the State Security Agency was an integral part of the MIA and its primary intelligence as well as counterintelligence component. In the fight against terrorism, however, Georgia lacked a uniform coordinated force as many law enforcement units and government agencies claimed counter terrorism as their area of responsibility, despite the fact a specialised and designated anti-terror unit had already existed for many years. In order to unify the efforts of all institutions, an interagency mechanism was established in 2014 that would operate as a joint task force subordinated to a crisis management council in the event of major terrorist attacks. Nonetheless, as a result of the rapidly increasing threat of international terrorism, the Georgian government decided to reinstate the State Security Service as a separate and independent agency and task it with priority counter terrorism related missions and activities. For this task the country's most elite counter terror unit has been transferred to the SSSG for all operative measures.\n\nThe fight against terrorism is one of the main priorities of the SSSG notably due to recent developments in the Middle East. Georgia has been participating in the War on Terror from the beginning and has to some extent found itself increasingly becoming a transit country for combatants and potential Islamic terrorists as violence keeps continuously rising in the conflicted Arab nations. Even though the likelihood of a terrorist attack may be minimal to the country itself, such activities undermine and endanger the political and military efforts of allied and partner nations thus why Georgias efforts in those areas are essential to not only regional security. If direct operational and surgical means are required to effectively deter and combat terrorist threats the agency deploys two special units - one of which is part of the Special Operations Division and operates primarily on domestic level to contain individuals or entire cells that conduct radical activities which endanger national security. The Counterterrorism Center is the primary division dominantly engaged in anti-terror warfare and fields the country's most experienced and designated force in that area. In accordance to their tasks and activities the members of its tactical intervention force regularly train and retrain on all forms of combat particularly in connection with counter terrorism including among other, special sniper courses, alpine warfare, special CQB training, the search and destruction of terrorist camps, specialization on explosive devices, their defusal and deploying means to prevent and counteract the use of weapons of mass destruction. The center operates in conjunction with the nations own and foreign intelligence services including Interpol. Each of its operator undergoes foreign courses in cooperation with a number of partner nations to constantly enhance his capabilities. Material and equipment as well as infrastructural needs have been steadily upgraded over the years. The unit is also the first to engage in high risk domestic or international operations, former starting in the mid-to late 1990s and latter from 2001 on losing an undisclosed number of servicemen. Georgia is an active member and advisor of the global anti-terrorist coalition and constantly participates in multinational operations.\n\nGeorgia is the regional center for biological-and virological research and also hosts a number of soviet military- and research facilities as well as storage areas that contain radioactive and chemical substances. Those facilities are subjected to a permanent state of control and monitoring by the SSSG. However, on the occupied territories international security measures have not been implemented thus maintaining transit routes and much greater vulnerability to smuggling of CBRN material through the country than already present. Such weaknesses have been exploited on multiple occasions throughout the years. Many attempts were made to smuggle depleted and enriched uranium in or out of the country, however most of those have been prevented by investigative and operative events. In the more recent period alone over 19 individuals have been detained on charges of illicit trafficking of nuclear material in four incidents. \nGeorgia works closely with the US, UN, partner nations and the CBRN CoE and was the first nation to elaborate and adopt the Strategy and Action Plan of the EU thus becoming one of the primary members of the 28 nations initiative. One of the SSSGs prioirities is to also become member of the G7 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction.\n\nThe SSSG consists of following structural entities: \n"}

{"id": "760810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=760810", "title": "Traffic collision avoidance system", "text": "Traffic collision avoidance system\n\nA traffic collision avoidance system or traffic alert and collision avoidance system (both abbreviated as TCAS, and pronounced (\"tee-kas\") is an aircraft collision avoidance system designed to reduce the incidence of mid-air collisions between aircraft. It monitors the airspace around an aircraft for other aircraft equipped with a corresponding active transponder, independent of air traffic control, and warns pilots of the presence of other transponder-equipped aircraft which may present a threat of mid-air collision (MAC). It is a type of airborne collision avoidance system mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization to be fitted to all aircraft with a maximum take-off mass (MTOM) of over or authorized to carry more than 19 passengers. CFR 14, Ch I, part 135 requires that TCAS I be installed for aircraft with 10-30 passengers and TCAS II for aircraft with more than 30 passengers.\n\nACAS / TCAS is based on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponder signals, but operates independently of ground-based equipment to provide advice to the pilot on potential conflicting aircraft.\n\nIn modern glass cockpit aircraft, the TCAS display may be integrated in the Navigation Display (ND) or Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI); in older glass cockpit aircraft and those with mechanical instrumentation, such an integrated TCAS display may replace the mechanical Vertical Speed Indicator (which indicates the rate with which the aircraft is descending or climbing).\n\nResearch into collision avoidance systems has been ongoing since at least the 1950s. ICAO and aviation authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration were spurred into action by the Grand Canyon mid-air collision in 1956.\n\nThe implementation of TCAS added a safety barrier to help prevent mid-air collisions. However, further study, refinements, training and regulatory measures were still required, because the limitations and misuse of the system still resulted in other incidents and fatal accidents, which include:\n\nThe airline industry has been working with the Air Transport Association of America (ATA) since 1955 toward a collision avoidance system. It was not until the mid-1970s, however, that research centered on using signals from ATCRBS airborne transponders as the cooperative element of a collision avoidance system. This technical approach allows a collision avoidance capability on the flight deck, which is independent of the ground system. In 1981, the FAA announced a decision to implement an aircraft collision avoidance concept called the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The concept is based upon agency and industry development efforts in the areas of beacon based collision avoidance systems and air-to-air discrete address communications techniques utilizing Mode S airborne transponder message formats.\n\nA short time later, prototypes of TCAS II were installed on two Piedmont Airlines Boeing 727 aircraft, and were flown on regularly scheduled flights. Although the displays were located outside the view of the flight crew and seen only by trained observers, these tests did provide valuable information on the frequency and circumstances of alerts and their potential for interaction with the ATC system. On a follow-on phase II program, a later version of TCAS II was installed on a single Piedmont Airlines Boeing 727, and the system was certified in April 1986, then subsequently approved for operational evaluation in early 1987. Since the equipment was not developed to full standards, the system was only operated in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Although the flight crew operated the system, the evaluation was primarily for the purpose of data collection and its correlation with flight crew and observer observation and response.\n\nLater versions of TCAS II manufactured by Bendix/King Air Transport Avionics Division were installed and approved on United Airlines airplanes in early 1988. Similar units manufactured by Honeywell were installed and approved on Northwest Airlines airplanes in late 1988. This limited installation program operated TCAS II units approved for operation as a full-time system in both visual and instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) on three different aircraft types. The operational evaluation programs continued through 1988 to validate the operational suitability of the systems\n\nTCAS involves communication between all aircraft equipped with an appropriate transponder (provided the transponder is enabled and set up properly). Each TCAS-equipped aircraft interrogates all other aircraft in a determined range about their position (via the 1.03 GHz radio frequency), and all other aircraft reply to other interrogations (via 1.09 GHz). This interrogation-and-response cycle may occur several times per second.\n\nThe TCAS system builds a three dimensional map of aircraft in the airspace, incorporating their range (garnered from the interrogation and response round trip time), altitude (as reported by the interrogated aircraft), and bearing (by the directional antenna from the response). Then, by extrapolating current range and altitude difference to anticipated future values, it determines if a potential collision threat exists.\n\nTCAS and its variants are only able to interact with aircraft that have a correctly operating mode C or mode S transponder. A unique 24-bit identifier is assigned to each aircraft that has a mode S transponder.\n\nThe next step beyond identifying potential collisions is automatically negotiating a mutual avoidance manoeuver (currently, manoeuvers are restricted to changes in altitude and modification of climb/sink rates) between the two (or more) conflicting aircraft. These avoidance manoeuvers are communicated to the flight crew by a cockpit display and by synthesized voice instructions.\n\nA protected volume of airspace surrounds each TCAS equipped aircraft. The size of the protected volume depends on the altitude, speed, and heading of the aircraft involved in the encounter. The illustration below gives an example of a typical TCAS protection volume.\n\nA TCAS installation consists of the following components:\n\n\nThe following section describes the TCAS operation based on TCAS II, since this is the version that has been adopted as an international standard (ACAS II) by ICAO and aviation authorities worldwide.\n\nTCAS II can be currently operated in the following modes:\n\n\nTCAS works in a coordinated manner, so when an RA is issued to conflicting aircraft, a required action (i.e., \"Climb. Climb.\") has to be immediately performed by one of the aircraft, while the other one receives a similar RA in the opposite direction (i.e., \"Descend. Descend.\").\n\nTCAS II issues the following types of aural annunciations:\n\n\nWhen a TA is issued, pilots are instructed to initiate a visual search for the traffic causing the TA. If the traffic is visually acquired, pilots are instructed to maintain visual separation from the traffic. Training programs also indicate that no horizontal maneuvers are to be made based solely on information shown on the traffic display. Slight adjustments in vertical speed while climbing or descending, or slight adjustments in airspeed while still complying with the ATC clearance are acceptable.\n\nWhen an RA is issued, pilots are expected to respond immediately to the RA unless doing so would jeopardize the safe operation of the flight. This means that aircraft will at times have to manoeuver contrary to ATC instructions or disregard ATC instructions. In these cases, the controller is no longer responsible for separation of the aircraft involved in the RA until the conflict is terminated.\n\nOn the other hand, ATC can potentially interfere with a pilot's response to RAs. If a conflicting ATC instruction coincides with an RA, a pilot may assume that ATC is fully aware of the situation and is providing the better resolution. But in reality, ATC is not aware of the RA until the RA is reported by the pilot. Once the RA is reported by the pilot, ATC is required not to attempt to modify the flight path of the aircraft involved in the encounter. Hence, the pilot is expected to \"follow the RA\" but in practice this does not always happen.\n\nSome countries have implemented \"RA downlink\" which provides air traffic controllers with information about RAs posted in the cockpit. Currently, there are no ICAO provisions concerning the use of RA downlink by air traffic controllers.\n\nThe following points receive emphasis during pilot training:\n\n\nAn RA occurs on average every 1,000 flight hours on short/medium-haul aircraft and every 3,000 hours for long-haul aircraft.\nIn its December 2017 ACAS guide, Eurocontrol found in about 25% of the cases, the pilots follow the RA inaccurately.\nAirbus offers the option of an autopilot/flight director TCAS for automatic avoidance maneuvers.\n\nSafety studies on TCAS estimate that the system improves safety in the airspace by a factor of between 3 and 5.\n\nHowever, it is well understood that part of the remaining risk is that TCAS may induce midair collisions: \"In particular, it is dependent on the accuracy of the threat aircraft’s reported altitude and on the expectation that the threat aircraft will not make an abrupt maneuver that defeats the TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA). The safety study also shows that TCAS II will induce some critical near midair collisions...\" (See page 7 of Introduction to TCAS II Version 7 and 7.1 (PDF) in external links below).\n\nOne potential problem with TCAS II is the possibility that a recommended avoidance maneuver might direct the flight crew to descend toward terrain below a safe altitude. Recent requirements for incorporation of ground proximity mitigate this risk. Ground proximity warning alerts have priority in the cockpit over TCAS alerts.\n\nSome pilots have been unsure how to act when their aircraft was requested to climb whilst flying at their maximum altitude. The accepted procedure is to follow the climb RA as best as possible, temporarily trading speed for height. The climb RA should quickly finish. In the event of a stall warning, the stall warning would take priority.\n\nBoth cases have been already addressed by Version 7.0 of TCAS II and are currently handled by a corrective RA together with a visual indication of a green arc in the IVSI display to indicate the safe range for the climb or descent rate. However, it has been found that in some cases these indications could lead to a dangerous situation for the involved aircraft. For example, if a TCAS event occurs when two aircraft are descending one over the other for landing, the aircraft at the lower altitude will first receive a \"Descend, descend\" RA, and when reaching an extreme low altitude, this will change to a \"Adjust Vertical Speed, Adjust\" RA, together with a green arc indication directing the pilot to level off the aircraft. This could place the aircraft dangerously into the path of the intruder above, who is descending to land. A change proposal has been issued to correct this problem.\n\nAutomatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) messages are transmitted from aircraft equipped with suitable transponders, containing information such as identity, location, and velocity. The signals are broadcast on the 1090 MHz radio frequency. ADS-B messages are also carried on a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) in the 978 MHz band.\n\nTCAS equipment which is capable of processing ADS-B messages may use this information to enhance the performance of TCAS, using techniques known as \"hybrid surveillance\". As currently implemented, hybrid surveillance uses reception of ADS-B messages from an aircraft to reduce the rate at which the TCAS equipment interrogates that aircraft. This reduction in interrogations reduces the use of the 1030/1090 MHz radio channel, and will over time extend the operationally useful life of TCAS technology. The ADS-B messages will also allow low cost (for aircraft) technology to provide real time traffic in the cockpit for small aircraft. Currently UAT based traffic uplinks are provided in Alaska and in regions of the East coast of the USA.\n\nHybrid surveillance does not make use of ADS-B's aircraft flight information in the TCAS conflict detection algorithms; ADS-B is used only to identify aircraft that can safely be interrogated at a lower rate.\n\nIn the future, prediction capabilities may be improved by using the state vector information present in ADS-B messages. Also, since ADS-B messages can be received at greater range than TCAS normally operates, aircraft can be acquired earlier by the TCAS tracking algorithms.\n\nThe identity information present in ADS-B messages can be used to label other aircraft on the cockpit display (where present), painting a picture similar to what an air traffic controller would see and improving situational awareness.\n\nThe major demonstrated problem of the ADS-B protocol integration is this added verbosity of the extra information transmitted, which is considered unnecessary for collision avoidance purposes. The more data transmitted from one aircraft in accordance with the system design, the lesser the number of aircraft that can participate in the system, due to the fixed and limited channel data bandwidth (1 megabit/second with the 26/64 data bits to packet length bit capacity of the Mode S downlink data format packet). For every Mode S message of 64 bits, the overhead demands 8 for clock sync at the receiver and Mode S packet discovery, 6 for type of Mode S packet, 24 for who it came from. Since that leaves only 26 for information, multiple packets must be used to convey a single message. The ADS-B \"fix\" proposal is to go to a 128 bit packet, which is not an accepted international standard. Either approach increases channel traffic above the level sustainable for environments such as the Los Angeles Basin.\n\nCollision Avoidance systems which rely on transponder replies triggered by ground and airborne systems are considered passive. Ground and airborne interrogators query nearby transponders for mode C altitude information, which can be monitored by third-party systems for traffic information. Passive systems display traffic similar to TCAS, however generally have a range of less than .\n\nTCAS I is a cheaper but less capable system than the modern TCAS II system introduced for general aviation use after the FAA mandate for TCAS II in air transport aircraft. TCAS I systems are able to monitor the traffic situation around a plane (to a range of about 40 miles) and offer information on the approximate bearing and altitude of other aircraft. It can also generate collision warnings in the form of a \"Traffic Advisory\" (TA). The TA warns the pilot that another aircraft is in near vicinity, announcing \"Traffic, traffic\", but does not offer any suggested remedy; it is up to the pilot to decide what to do, usually with the assistance of Air Traffic Control. When a threat has passed, the system announces \"Clear of conflict\".\n\nTCAS II is the first system that was introduced in 1989 and is the current generation of instrument warning TCAS, used in the majority of commercial aviation aircraft (see table below). A US Airways 737 was the first aircraft certified with the AlliedBendix (now Honeywell) TCAS II system. It offers all the benefits of TCAS I, but will also offer the pilot direct, vocalized instructions to avoid danger, known as a \"Resolution Advisory\" (RA). The suggestive action may be \"corrective\", suggesting the pilot change vertical speed by announcing, \"Descend, descend\", \"Climb, climb\" or \"Adjust Vertical Speed Adjust\" (meaning reduce vertical speed). By contrast a \"preventive\" RA may be issued which simply warns the pilots not to deviate from their present vertical speed, announcing, \"Monitor vertical speed\" or \"Maintain vertical speed, Maintain\". TCAS II systems coordinate their resolution advisories before issuing commands to the pilots, so that if one aircraft is instructed to descend, the other will typically be told to climb — maximising the separation between the two aircraft.\n\nAs of 2006, the only implementation that meets the ACAS II standards set by ICAO was Version 7.0 of TCAS II, produced by three avionics manufacturers: Rockwell Collins, Honeywell, and ACSS (Aviation Communication & Surveillance Systems; an L3 Technologies and Thales Avionics joint venture company).\n\nAfter the Überlingen mid-air collision (July 1, 2002), studies have been made to improve TCAS II capabilities. Following extensive Eurocontrol input and pressure, a revised TCAS II Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) document has been jointly developed by RTCA (Special Committee SC-147) and EUROCAE. As a result, by 2008 the standards for Version 7.1 of TCAS II have been issued and published as RTCA DO-185B (June 2008) and EUROCAE ED-143 (September 2008).\n\nTCAS II Version 7.1 will be able to issue RA reversals in coordinated encounters, in case one of the aircraft doesn't follow the original RA instructions (Change proposal CP112E). Other changes in this version are the replacement of the ambiguous \"Adjust Vertical Speed, Adjust\" RA with the \"Level off, Level off\" RA, to prevent improper response by the pilots (Change proposal CP115).; and the improved handling of corrective/preventive annunciation and removal of green arc display when a positive RA weakens solely due to an extreme low or high altitude condition (1000 feet AGL or below, or near the aircraft top ceiling) to prevent incorrect and possibly dangerous guidance to the pilot (Change proposal CP116).\n\nStudies conducted for Eurocontrol, using recently recorded operational data, indicate that currently the probability of a mid-air collision for each flight hour in European airspace is 2.7 x 10 which equates to one in every 3 years. When TCAS II Version 7.1 is implemented, that probability will be reduced by a factor of 4.\n\nAlthough ACAS III is mentioned as a future system in ICAO Annex 10, ACAS III is unlikely to materialize due to difficulties the current surveillance systems have with horizontal tracking. Currently, research is being conducted to develop a future collision avoidance system (under the working name of ACAS X).\n\nOriginally designated TCAS II Enhanced, TCAS III was envisioned as an expansion of the TCAS II concept to include horizontal resolution advisory capability. TCAS III was the \"next generation\" of collision avoidance technology which underwent development by aviation companies such as Honeywell. TCAS III incorporated technical upgrades to the TCAS II system, and had the capability to offer traffic advisories and resolve traffic conflicts using \"horizontal\" as well as vertical manouevring directives to pilots. For instance, in a head-on situation, one aircraft might be directed, \"turn right, climb\" while the other would be directed \"turn right, descend.\" This would act to further increase the total separation between aircraft, in both horizontal and vertical aspects. Horizontal directives would be useful in a conflict between two aircraft close to the ground where there may be little if any vertical maneuvering space.\n\nTCAS III attempts to use the TCAS directional antenna to assign a bearing to other aircraft, and thus be able to generate a horizontal maneuver (e.g. turn left or right). However, it was judged by the industry to be unfeasible due to limitations in the accuracy of the TCAS directional antennas. The directional antennas were judged not to be accurate enough to generate an accurate horizontal-plane position, and thus an accurate horizontal resolution. By 1995, years of testing and analysis determined that the concept was unworkable using available surveillance technology (due to the inadequacy of horizontal position information), and that horizontal RAs were unlikely to be invoked in most encounter geometries. Hence, all work on TCAS III was suspended and there are no plans for its implementation. The concept has later evolved and been replaced by TCAS IV.\n\nTCAS IV uses additional information encoded by the target aircraft in the Mode S transponder reply (i.e. target encodes its own position into the transponder signal) to generate a horizontal resolution to an RA. In addition, some reliable source of position (such as Inertial Navigation System or GPS) is needed on the target aircraft in order for it to be encoded.\n\nTCAS IV has replaced the TCAS III concept by the mid 1990s. One of the results of TCAS III experience has been that the directional antenna used by the TCAS processor to assign a bearing to a received transponder reply is not accurate enough to generate an accurate horizontal position, and thus a safe horizontal resolution. TCAS IV uses additional position information encoded on an air-to-air data link to generate the bearing information, so the accuracy of the directional antenna would not be a factor.\n\nTCAS IV development continued for some years, but the appearance of new trends in data link such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) have pointed out a need to re-evaluate whether a data link system dedicated to collision avoidance such as TCAS IV should be incorporated into a more generic system of air-to-air data link for additional applications. As a result of these issues, the TCAS IV concept was abandoned as ADS-B development started.\n\nAlthough the system occasionally suffers from false alarms, pilots are now under strict instructions to regard all TCAS messages as genuine alerts demanding an immediate, high-priority response. Only Windshear Detection and GPWS alerts and warnings have higher priority than the TCAS. The FAA, EASA and most other countries' authorities' rules state that in the case of a conflict between TCAS RA and air traffic control (ATC) instructions, the TCAS RA always takes precedence (this is mainly because of the TCAS-RA inherently possessing a more current and comprehensive picture of the situation than air traffic controllers, whose radar/transponder updates usually happen at a much slower rate than the TCAS interrogations).\nIf one aircraft follows a TCAS RA and the other follows conflicting ATC instructions, a collision can occur, such as the July 1, 2002 Überlingen disaster. In this mid-air collision, both airplanes were fitted with TCAS II Version 7.0 systems which functioned properly, but one obeyed the TCAS advisory while the other ignored the TCAS and obeyed the controller; both aircraft descended into a fatal collision.\n\nThis accident could have been prevented if TCAS was able to reverse the original RA for one of the aircraft when it detects that the crew of the other one is not following their original TCAS RA, but conflicting ATC instructions instead. This is one of the features that will be implemented within Version 7.1 of TCAS II.\n\nImplementation of TCAS II Version 7.1 has been originally planned to start between 2009 and 2011 by retrofitting and forward fitting all the TCAS II equipped aircraft, with the goal that by 2014 the version 7.0 will be completely phased out and replaced by version 7.1. The FAA and EASA have already published the TCAS II Version 7.1 Technical Standard Order (TSO-C119c and ETSO-C119c, respectively) effective since 2009, based on the RTCA DO-185B and EUROCAE ED-143 standards. On 25 September 2009 FAA issued Advisory Circular AC 20-151A providing guidance for obtaining airworthiness approval for TCAS II systems, including the new version 7.1. On 5 October 2009 the Association of European Airlines (AEA) published a Position Paper showing the need to mandate TCAS II Version 7.1 on all aircraft as a matter of priority. On 25 March 2010 the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) published Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) No. 2010-03 pertaining to the introduction of ACAS II software version 7.1. On 14 September 2010 EASA published the Comment Response Document (CRD) to the above-mentioned NPA. Separately, a proposal has been made to amend the ICAO standard to require TCAS II Version 7.1 for compliance with ACAS II SARPs.\n\nICAO has circulated an amendment for formal member state agreement which recommends TCAS II Change 7.1 adoption by 1 January 2014 for forward fit and 1 January 2017 for retrofit. Following the feedback and comments from airline operators, EASA has proposed the following dates for the TCAS II Version 7.1 mandate in European airspace: forward fit (for new aircraft) 1 March 2012, retrofit (for existing aircraft) 1 December 2015. These dates are proposed dates, subject to further regulatory processes, and are not final until the Implementing Rule has been published.\n\nAmong the system manufacturers, by February 2010 ACSS certified Change 7.1 for their TCAS 2000 and Legacy TCAS II systems, and is currently offering Change 7.1 upgrade for their customers. By June 2010 Honeywell published a white paper with their proposed solutions for TCAS II Version 7.1. Rockwell Collins currently announces that their TCAS-94, TCAS-4000 and TSS-4100 TCAS II compliant systems are software upgradeable to Change 7.1 when available.\n\nWhile the safety benefits of current TCAS implementations are self-evident, the full technical and operational potential of TCAS is not fully exploited due to limitations in current implementations (most of which will need to be addressed in order to further facilitate the design and implementation of Free flight) and NextGen:\n\n\nTo overcome some of these limitations, the FAA is developing a new collision avoidance logic based on dynamic programming.\n\nIn response to a series of midair collisions involving commercial airliners, Lincoln Laboratory was directed by the Federal Aviation Administration in the 1970s to participate in the development of an onboard collision avoidance system. In its current manifestation, the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System is mandated worldwide on all large aircraft and has significantly improved the safety of air travel, but major changes to the airspace planned over the coming years will require substantial modification to the system.\n\nA set of new systems called ACAS X will use this new logic:\n\n\nThe first FAA-scheduled industry meeting was held in October 2011 in Washington DC, to brief avionics manufacturers on the development plans for \"ACAS X\" – including flight demonstrations scheduled for fiscal 2013. The FAA says its work \"will be foundational to the development of minimum operational performance standards\" for ACAS X by standards developer RTCA.\n\nIt is estimated that, if ACAS X will be further developed and certified, ACAS X will not be commercially available before mid 2020s. And it is said to be unclear at this stage whether ACAS X would provide any horizontal resolutions.\n\n\n"}

UNCF was incorporated on April 25, 1944 by Frederick D. Patterson (then president of what is now Tuskegee University), Mary McLeod Bethune, and others. UNCF is headquartered at 1805 7th Street, NW in Washington, D.C. In 2005, UNCF supported approximately 65,000 students at over 900 colleges and universities with approximately $113 million in grants and scholarships. About 60% of these students are the first in their families to attend college, and 62% have annual family incomes of less than $25,000. UNCF also administers over 450 named scholarships.\n\nUNCF's president and chief executive officer is Michael Lomax. Past presidents of the UNCF included William H. Gray and Vernon Jordan.\n\nThough founded to address funding inequities in education resources for African Americans, UNCF-administered scholarships are open to all ethnicities; the great majority of recipients are still African-American. It provides scholarships to students attending its member colleges as well as to those going elsewhere.\n\nGraduates of UNCF member institutions and scholarships have included many blacks in the fields of business, politics, health care and the arts. Some prominent UNCF alumni include Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and leader in the Civil Rights Movement; Alexis Herman, former U.S. Secretary of Labor; noted movie director Spike Lee; actor Samuel L. Jackson; General Chappie James, the U.S. Air Force’s first black four-star general; and Dr. David Satcher, a former U.S. Surgeon General and director of the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nIn 1944 William J. Trent, a long time activist for education for blacks, joined with Tuskegee Institute President Frederick D. Patterson and Mary McLeod Bethune to found the UNCF, a nonprofit that united college presidents to raise money collectively through an \"appeal to the national conscience\". As the first executive director from the organization's start in 1944 until 1964, Trent raised $78 million for historically black colleges so they could become \"strong citadels of learning, carriers of the American dream, seedbeds of social evolution and revolution\". In 2008, the UNCF shifted from using its full name to using its initials, releasing a new logo with the initials alone and featuring their slogan more prominently.\n\nThe UNCF has received charitable donations for its scholarship programs. One of the more high-profile donations made was by then-senator and future U.S. President John F. Kennedy who donated the money from the Pulitzer Prize for his book \"Profiles in Courage\" to the Fund. The largest ever single donation was made in 1990 by Walter Annenberg, who donated $50 million to the fund.\n\nBeginning in 1980, singer Lou Rawls began the \"Lou Rawls Parade of Stars\" telethon to benefit the UNCF. The annual event, now known as \"An Evening of Stars\", consists of stories of successful African-American students who have graduated or benefited from one of the many historically black colleges and universities and who received support from the UNCF. The telethon featured comedy and musical performances from various artists in support of the UNCF's and Rawls' efforts. The event has raised over $200 million in 27 shows for the fund through 2006.\n\nIn January 2004, Rawls was honored by the United Negro College Fund for his more than 25 years of charity work with the organization. Instead of Rawls' hosting and performing, he was given the seat of honor and celebrated by his performing colleagues, including Stevie Wonder, The O'Jays, Gerald Levert, Ashanti, and several others. Before his death in January 2006, Rawls' last performance was a taping for the 2006 telethon that honored Wonder, months before entering the hospital after being diagnosed with cancer earlier in the year.\n\nIn addition to the telethon, there are a number of other fundraising activities, including the \"Walk for Education\" held annually in Los Angeles, California, which includes a five kilometer walk/run. In Houston, Texas, the Cypresswood Golf Club hosts an annual golf tournament in April.\n\nIn 2014, Koch Industries Inc. and the Charles Koch Foundation made a $25 million grant to UNCF. In protest of the Kochs, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a major labor union, ended its yearly $50,000–60,000 support for UNCF.\n\nIn 1972, the UNCF adopted as its motto the maxim \"A mind is a terrible thing to waste.\" This maxim has become one of the most widely recognized slogans in advertising history. The motto was notably mangled in a 1989 address to the organization by then–Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle, who stated: \"And you take the U.N.C.F. model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.\"\nThe motto, which has been used in numerous award-winning UNCF ad campaigns, was created by Forest Long, of the advertising agency Young & Rubicam, in partnership with the Ad Council.\n\nA lesser-known slogan the UNCF also uses, in reference to its intended beneficiaries, points out about them, \"[They're] not asking for a handout, just a hand.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The party was founded on 25 March 2017 by Aleš Primc and Metka Zevnik as an electoral arm of a movement of which they are also leaders of, the Movement for Children and Families, the initial purpose of which was to overturn a law passed by the National Assembly which would recognize same sex marriage in the Republic of Slovenia.\n\nThe Movement, first called \"Coalition For the Children!\", collected a sufficient number of signatures to declare a referendum challenging the new Marriage and Family Relations Act, as per article 90 of the Slovenian Constitution. The law was subsequently rejected when the referendum was held on 20 December 2015. Primc had since proposed an alternative law, which would grant more legal rights to same-sex couples, but would not recognize same-sex marriage or put same-sex couples them on an equal footing with opposite-sex couples regarding adoption. The Movement has also proposed a law aimed mainly at prioritizing grandparents regarding adoption of children whose biological parents are deceased. The intention to derive an electoral arm of the movement was hinted at subsequent to the referendum victory and officially announced on 14 January 2017.\n\nThe political party held its founding convention on 25 March 2017 in Škofja Loka. Aleš Primc was unanimously elected as party leader. Multiple prominent party officials stated that they expect divine assistance.\n\nIn February 2018, it was revealed that the party would be joining forces with former Maribor mayor Franc Kangler's New People's Party of Slovenia to form United Right, an electoral alliance, to jointly contest the upcoming 2018 Slovenian parliamentary election.\n\nPrimc has stated that he is willing to work with all parties where there is common ground, but that he sees himself closer to the two conservative parliamentary parties; Slovenian Democratic Party and New Slovenia.\n\nPrimc also serves as president of \"Committee 2014\" (Slovene: \"Odbor 2014\"), an organization which mainly organized protests in front of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia, the central demand being the pardon of former prime minister and leader of the Slovenian Democratic Party Janez Janša and others (allegedly wrongly) convicted of corruption in the Patria case. Primc is also a founding member, has a seat on the board of, and is a frequent guest and contributor on Nova24TV, a media company which has deep ties to SDS.\n\nThere has been speculation that the party will serve as a \"satellite\" of the largest parliamentary conservative party, the Slovenian Democratic Party, as a part of its effort to politically and electorally undermine the other parliamentary conservative party, New Slovenia, for its perceived disloyalty (the parties had previously partnered in coalition governments and shared political ties, but have since seen a schism and a cooling of relations with NSi leadership stating that the two parties cannot work together as long as Janez Janša remains as leader of SDS).\n\nThe 38 point party platform principally advocates a return to traditional and Christian values (the first point of the summary states a need to a return to \"the respect of life, motherhood and fatherhood, Slovenian culture, work, Sunday's rest, and Christianity\"), binary gender identity and a traditional marriage and family structure. It states that any infraction into the life of unborn children, the old and the sick is unacceptable and rejects euthanasia and assisted suicide, advocating for free palliative care instead. It states that the Slovenian pension system and culture can survive only with a higher birth rate, which should be pursued. All workers deserve a fair wage that is adequate for a decent living. A favorable economic environment should be created to battle emigration of young people who lack job opportunities in the country and also as a more favorable alternative to a welfare state. More attention should be given to the agricultural periphery. A fairer judiciary should be pursued to better grapple crime. The platform also states that there should be \"self-defense\" training mandatory for boys (with an option of community service for conscientious objectors) and optional for girls, and that a military and police reserve should be established.\n\nThe platform also states that the greatest danger to society are people who have political and social power and think and act as to be God, but there is only one God, that the phrase \"unborn child\" should be used instead of embryo and foetus, that Sunday should be a work-free day for everyone whose work responsibility isn't essential, and that all state-owned enterprises that are structurally and economically important should remain state-owned and run responsibly and profitably, with an amendment added to the constitution that anyone found guilty of corruption or damaging the assets of state-owned companies should be forbidden from doing business with the state or managing state property for life. It is also stated that the party respects the traditional left and their advocacy of worker rights, but that it has been supplanted by militant atheism and hatred of the different-minded. It states that everyone has a right to refuse service on the basis of one's beliefs. Private medical practice should more readily be accommodated into the public healthcare system. Measures to curb all types of addictions, including to pornography and computer games, should be introduced. Asylum for Christian refugees should be prioritized.\n\nDuring the founding convention (though this was reported only by a single source), it was also stated that the party would, among other measures, seek to bestow voting rights to children aged 14 and older (though only if under supervision of their parents), and multiple votes to parents; one vote for every child under the aforementioned age (though it was not specified how the votes would be divided among the children's parents). The purpose of this measure would ostensibly be to encourage higher birth rates.\n\nAngelca Likovič, who has represented the Movement in various TV appearances, has stated that \"We are fighting so that our descendants have Slovenian roots, and that is why we encourage all mothers to give birth, even the ones who were raped.\" The movement subsequently awarded Likovič a \"White Rose\" award for her \"untiring fight for the rights of unborn children\".\n"}

The role is considered a modern-day version of what is expressed in the poem \"The White Man's Burden\" (1899) by Rudyard Kipling. The term has been associated with Africa, and certain characters in film and television have been critiqued as white savior figures. Writer Teju Cole combined the term and \"industrial complex\" (derived from military-industrial complex and similarly applied elsewhere) to coin \"White Savior Industrial Complex\".\n\nAfrica has a history of slavery and of colonization. Damian Zane of BBC News said due to the history, Africans find the \"white savior\" attitude to help them \"deeply patronising and offensive\". Zane said, \"Some argue that aid can be counter-productive, as it means African countries will continue to rely on outside help.\" Bhakti Shringarpure, writing for \"The Guardian\", said, \"Westerners trying to help poor, suffering countries have often been accused of having a 'white saviour complex': a term tied up in colonial history where Europeans descended to 'civilise' the African continent.\" \"The Washington Post\"s Karen Attiah said the white savior framework in Africa \"follows the venerable tradition\" of the novella \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899) by Joseph Conrad and that the tradition included the film \"Machine Gun Preacher\" (2011), the public relations campaign related to the documentary \"Kony 2012\" (2012), and the writings of journalist Nicholas Kristof.\n\nActor and producer Louise Linton wrote a memoir about her gap year in Zambia, \"In Congo's Shadow\", and wrote an article for \"The Telegraph\", \"How my dream gap year in Africa turned into a nightmare\", to promote the book.

Several people have described Linton's memoir as a 'white savior' fantasy.\" Zambians and other Africans negatively criticized the article on social media. Attiah said the popular Instagram account \"BarbieSavior\" was inspired by the backlash to Linton's words. Special Broadcasting Service's Amal Awad said the Instagram account was parodied \"a reckless trend\" of voluntourism (volunteering and touring) in which \"'white saviours' use the less fortunate like props in their social media profiles\". Awad said the interest in volunteering encouraged a business model that leverages a country's existing social issues and charges tourists for volunteering to be a \"saviour\".\n\nBaaz, Gondola, Marijnen, and Verweijen, writing in \"Foreign Affairs\", were critical of the \"white savior complex\" in the 2014 documentary \"Virunga\", which features the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Virunga National Park and the conservation work of its park rangers. They said, \"The movie features endless footage of a park guard hugging and playing with the gorillas, evoking the notion of the 'noble savage' who is close to nature, honest and naive, and dependent on the white man for his salvation. Rarely do we see the Congolese exercising political agency, even though there are numerous civil society activists in the region, often working at great personal risk.\"\n\nIn film, the white savior is a cinematic trope in which a white character rescues people of color from their plight. The white savior is portrayed as messianic and often learns something about themselves in the process of rescuing. The trope reflects how media represents race relations by racializing concepts like morality as identifiable with white people over nonwhite people. White saviors are often male and are sometimes out of place in their own society until they lead minorities or foreigners. \"Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness\" labels the stories as fantasies that \"are essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic\". Types of stories include white travels to \"exotic\" Asian locations, white defense against racism in the American South, or white protagonists having \"racially diverse\" helpers.\n\nStephanie Greco Larson, writing in \"Media & Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment\", said \"Diff'rent Strokes\" (1978–1986) and \"Webster\" (1983–1987) were \"shows in which white families adopt black children\" and represented versions of \"the white man's burden theme on television\". Robin R. Means Coleman said, \"In these comedies, Black children are rescued from their dysfunctional families or communities by Whites.\" In particular, \"Diff'rent Strokes\" featured the white millionaire character Philip Drummond. Film historian Donald Bogle said, \"The millionaire Drummond becomes a \"great white father figure\", able to provide the material comforts (as well as the subliminal emotional ones) and the cultural milieu that the Black community supposedly could never hope to match.\" Dustin Tahmahkera writes that Coleman labeled Drummond a \"white savior\" type who uses \"his representational power to save the day by determining a conflict resolution that appeases all parties\" including the indigenous representative Longwalker in the episode \"Burial Ground\". Tahmahkera also said a 1985 episode of \"Punky Brewster\" featured the girl protagonist telling a ghost story about her alter-ego Princess Moon helping \"ancient Indians [who] suddenly appear... as cave dwellers who need a white savior... to defeat an evil spirit and help keep their \"Last of the Dogmen\"-like secret existence intact.\"\n\nLarson said, \"Inner-city schools have been the site of white man's burden dramas on television for decades\" with TV series featuring white savior teachers. Larson identified the following series with such teachers: \"Room 222\" (1969–1974), \"Welcome Back, Kotter\" (1975–1979), \"The White Shadow\" (1978–1981), and \"Boston Public\" (2000–2004). Larson said while \"Room 222\" and \"Boston Public\" also had black teachers that \"challenge the assumption that blacks are inherently inferior... these shows continue to avoid laying blame on social institutions for the status of blacks by showing the success of the individual black teachers.\"\n\nThe TV series \"Iron Fist\" (2017–) features Finn Jones as the superhero Iron Fist. Both the originating comic book character and the TV series actor are white. Prior to the series airing \"The New York Times\" reported that the casting had received criticism for not changing the character to be Asian-American. The newspaper quoted arguments put forward by Keith Chow, editor-in-chief of \"The Nerds of Color\" pop culture blog, \"If you’re going to have all these trappings of Orientalism on top of a white savior trope, why not upend both of those things by casting an Asian-American to play the role?\" Jones denied that Iron Fist would be a white savior figure and said that the series would address critics' concerns.\n\nWriter Teju Cole coined the term \"White Savior Industrial Complex\" following the release of the documentary \"Kony 2012\" in March 2012, extrapolating the term in a seven-part response on Twitter. He later wrote an article for \"The Atlantic\" about the term.\n\nCole's response became a viral phenomenon, and \"The Guardian\"s Bhakti Shringarpure reflected on the supportive Internet response to the \"Kony 2012\" political campaign, \"With the prevalence of campaigns, apps and games calling on us to help without really putting ourselves out, it seems that the white saviour idea is still alive and well – but now, the mode is digital.\" Heather Laine Talley, writing in \"Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance\", said of the response to Cole coining the term, \"The very idea of the white savior industrial complex was met with both celebration and rage. Cole was alternately described as a truth teller and as a racist.\" Talley summarized Cole's response to his critics, \"Ultimately, Cole implores Western (white) do-gooders to rethink doing good in two ways. First, own up to the motives that drive philanthropic interventions, so that personal catharsis does not subsume the real need of others. Second, consider the structural underpinnings and historical legacies that together sustain the very infrastructure of the problems that captivate our activist hearts.\"\n\nTim Engles, writing in \"Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education\", concurred with Cole's assessment, \"The lack of real-world efficacy of their efforts, and the apparent unwillingness of most to go any further than such limited and self-aggrandizing steps, suggests that mere validation of white racial privilege was indeed the most significant outcome.\"\n\nThe removal of Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan and her medical treatment in the West has been described as an example of the \"white savior complex\". The arguments behind this were the Western media and politicians quick reaction to the incident, portraying it as their rescue of a woman from her own savage culture and people. This also allegedly was the West's justification for invading and bombing the region to save savage people from their own kind, while killing more innocent people like Malala than the Taliban has.\n\n\n"}
