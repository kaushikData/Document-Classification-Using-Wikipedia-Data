Moves towards establishing standardised funding block grants for European political parties were at this point well afoot, and the parties affiliated with UEN required a corresponding organisation to take advantage of them.\n\nAlmost immediately upon its founding, the AEN began to decline in terms of membership and influence. At its first meeting, participants included the Czech Civic Democratic Party, Portuguese CDS-PP, Israeli Likud, Irish Fianna Fáil, Italian National Alliance and the Greek Popular Orthodox Rally, all of which later left the organisation.\n\nThe AEN had a broadly national-conservative political line, but many members were uncomfortable with this. There was a strong movement for the centrist Fianna Fáil to leave AEN and join the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, which it did on 17 April 2009. Also, National Alliance, which despite its post-fascist background was a moderate national-conservative party strongly promoting European integration, grew uncomfortable with AEN and left it for the European People's Party by merging with Forza Italia to form The People of Freedom party on 27 March 2009.\n\nMEPs elected from its member-parties were expected to sit in the affiliated Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN) group in the European Parliament, but UEN collapsed in 2009 following the 2009 European Parliament elections, and MEPs from AEN member parties were scattered across the European Conservatives and Reformists and Europe of Freedom and Democracy groups, and their respective European-level parties, the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists and Movement for a Europe of Liberties and Democracy.\n\nAfter those realignments, there were too few AEN member parties left to retain its EU-funded status as a political party at European level.

Unlike some other paramilitary groups, Ansar-e Hizbullah undergoes formal training.\n\nIt is thought to be financed and protected by many senior government clerics. It is often characterized as a vigilante group as they use force but are not part of government law enforcement, although it may not meet the strict definition of the word inasmuch as the group pledge loyalty to the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei and is thought to be protected by him.\n\nIt has been described as an \"offshoot\" \nor \"vigilante associate\" of the Iranian Hezbollah, \na loose-knit movement of groups formed at the time of the Iranian Revolution to assist the Ayatollah Khomeini and his forces in consolidating power.\n\nMost of the members of Ansar e Hezbollah are either members of the Basij militias or veterans of the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nThe Ansar-e-Hezbollah is known for attacking protesters at anti-government demonstrations, in particular during the Iran student riots, July 1999. and is thought to have been behind public physical assaults on two reformist government ministers in Sept. 1998.\n\nAnsar-e-Hezbollah is thought to have been behind death threats and a \"series of physical assaults\" on philosopher and ex-hardliner Abdolkarim Soroush \"that left him bruised, battered and often in tattered clothes.\" \n\nThe organization has been associated with a crackdown on \"mal-veiling\", i.e. the wearing of a hejab by a woman such that some hair is visible, which has been blamed in Iran for inciting sexual assaults. They operate \"Yalasarat\", a newspaper and associated website that explain the official positions of hardliners in the Iranian government on female behavior.\n\nA 2000 expose of Ansar-e Hezbollah involved the murder of Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad. Ebrahim-Nejad was a university student and poet whose killing by \"plain-clothesmen\" following a peaceful protest over a newspaper closing was partially responsible for the destructive five-day-long Iran student riots in July 1999.\nIn March 2000, human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi reports a man by the name of Amir Farshad Ebrahimi appeared at her office claiming to have \nfirsthand information about his comrades who had carried out the attack on the dormitory. He said he belonged to … Ansar-e Hezbollah … and that the group's chief had thrown him in prison for trying to resign from his unit.\nEbadi made a videotape of Ebrahimi confession in which he claimed that not only had his group been involved in the attack on the dormitory where Ebrahim-Nejad was killed, but that \"During the time he was active in the group, he had also been involved in violent attacks on two reformist ministers\" in president Khatami's cabinet.\n\nHardline newspapers reported the existence of the confession, which they called the \"Tape makers\" case. In a number of inflammatory stories they claimed Ebrahimi was mentally unstable and that Ebadi and another lawyer Rohami had manipulated him into testifying, and in any case confession blemished the Islamic revolution. Ebadi and Rohami were sentenced to five years in jail and suspension of their law licenses for sending Ebrahimi's videotaped deposition to President Khatami. Ebarahimi was sentenced to 48 months jail, including 16 months in solitary confinement.\n\nOn 18 June 2009 the Los Angeles Times newspaper reported that \"hard-line Ansar-e Hezbollah militiamen warned that they would be patrolling the streets to maintain law and order.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Though created at the impetus of officials in the German-backed Protectorate government, it evolved to promote a distinctive form of \"Reich-loyal\" Czech nationalism that was viewed with concern by some quarters of the Nazi Party. Following World War II, it was banned as a fascist organization and its principal leaders put on trial. \n\nThe Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth (or Kuratorium) was established in 1941 partly on the initiative of Colonel Emanuel Moravec to provide athletic and cultural activities for Czech youth between the ages of ten to 18. Many Kuratorium leaders were functionaries or supporters of the fascist \"Vlajka\" and Livia Rothkirchen has characterized its programming as an effort at Nazi indoctrination. \nHowever, Tara Zahra has noted that at the group's camping trips and other retreats for Czech boys and girls a special focus was made in celebrating Czech culture, with \"Sicherheitsdienst\" informants reporting to the German authorities that a kind-of \"Reich-loyal\" Czech nationalism was being organically developed by the Kuratorium. \n\nMoravec was chair of the Kuratorium throughout its existence, while the organization was operationally managed by the Czech physician František Teuner.\n\nFollowing World War II, the Beneš decrees proscribed the Kuratorium as a \"fascist organization\". In 1947, leaders of the Kuratorium were tried over their involvement in the organization, resulting in the conviction of Teuner and seven others: Eduard Chalupa, Jan Svoboda, Josef Victorin, Karel Žalud, Jiri Málek, Vaclav Krigar, Jaroslav Krigar, and Karel Mihaliče.\nAccording to a 1944 report in \"The Guardian\", the Kuratorium was then putting on \"180 theatrical shows a week. In Prague alone its concerts, films, and exhibitions are visited by 13,000 children every day. It has arranged 13 great sports meetings in which 30,000 boys and girls took part. It has taught 80,000 children to swim. Some 200,000 have actively participated in its 'Art for Youth' competition, and 20,000 have been entertained at free holiday camps\".\n\nThe Kuratorium's nationalist-oriented programming reached a zenith in the summer of 1944 when the \"Week of Czech Youth\" was staged in Prague, activities during which included thousands of Kuratorium participants attired in Czech national costume singing traditional Czech songs. Observers from the Hitler Youth came to the conclusion that Kuratorium activities had essentially become nothing more than a continuation of the banned Sokol movement and were concerned that \"Reich-loyal\" Czech nationalism would transform into a dangerous \"double-edged sword\". On the one hand, the existence of the Kuratorium showcased Germany's supposed tolerance for Czech institutions and helped educate Czech youth towards an anti-communist worldview, however, on the other hand it severely undermined the ultimate goal of Germanizing the population of the Czech lands.\n\n"}

They sit in Cabinet and form the highest body of leadership in a government.\n\nIn the UK, tradition holds that the top three Ministers after the Prime Minister are the Chancellor, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary. In that order these 4 positions are referred to as the Great Offices of State, the most prestigious positions in government. However the high prestige of these positions has not always run with Cabinet rank. In the modern political era Cabinet rank is often a gift of the Prime Minister who releases a list detailing the seniority of all Cabinet ministers. Sometimes positions that one would not expect to be as high ranking as, say, the post of Foreign Secretary can in fact be placed higher than a Great Office of State. This is best displayed during the premiership of Gordon Brown when after a reshuffle of his Cabinet Peter Mandelson, the Business Secretary was ranked the 3rd most senior minister out of 23 and outranked all Great Offices of State except the Prime Minister himself.\n\nJust as traditionally lower Cabinet jobs can be placed high so can traditionally higher positions be placed low in the rankings such as when Bob Ainsworth (then Secretary of State for Defence) was ranked the 3rd lowest ranking minister in Gordon Brown's Cabinet. \n\nAfter the UK General Election of 2010 Cabinet rankings have gone back to a more traditional pattern, with the highest ranking ministers being those holding the Great Offices of State and holding quite important posts, for example the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. \n\nFollowing the United Kingdom general election, 2017, in which the number of Conservative seats fell from 330 to 317, Theresa May appointed Damian Green as her \"de facto\" Deputy Prime Minister as First Secretary of State and Minister for the Cabinet Office and with the ranking of 2nd most senior Cabinet member; above the Chancellor.

Because CSL is a safe and highly effective food additive, it is used in a wide variety of products from baked goods and desserts to packaging.\n\nAs described by the Food Chemicals Codex 7th edition, CSL is a cream-colored powder.

{"id": "56628885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56628885", "title": "Collective worship in schools", "text": "Collective worship in schools\n\nSection 70 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 stipulates that pupils of community, foundation or voluntary schools in England and Wales must take part in a daily act of Collective Worship, unless they have been explicitly withdrawn by their parents. The same requirement is applied to academy schools via their funding agreements, so it is true to say that all maintained schools in England and Wales are subject to the same rules. However, in practice there is widespread non-compliance with the legislation, which has not been monitored by Ofsted since 2004.\n\nThe responsibility for ensuring that the rules are applied rests with a school's head teacher, its governing body and the Local Education Authority. Local Education Authorities normally exercise this function via a Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education (SACRE).\n\nGuidance from the Department for Education (DfE) defines worship in this context as \"reverence or veneration paid to a divine being or power.\" It makes a distinction between the terms \"collective worship\" and \"corporate worship\", with the latter being worship amongst a group with beliefs in common.\n\nIt also describes the aims of the legislation as follows: \"Collective worship in schools should aim to provide the opportunity for pupils to worship God, to consider spiritual and moral issues and to explore their own beliefs; to encourage participation and response, whether through active involvement in the presentation of worship or through listening to and joining in the worship offered; and to develop community spirit, promote a common ethos and shared values, and reinforce positive attitudes.\"\n\nThe nature of the required daily act of collective worship in England and Wales is set out in Schedule 20 of the School Standards and Framework Act. This defines collective worship as \"a single act of worship for all pupils\" or separate acts of worship for groups of pupils. It should normally take place on school premises. The nature of the acts of worship should take into account the ages, aptitudes and family backgrounds of the pupils. \n\nSchools with a formal faith designation are required to arrange worship in accordance with their trust deed or, if they have no trust deed, in line with the practices of their designated faith. For schools without a formal faith designation, the majority of the acts of worship should be \"of a broadly Christian character\". In practical terms, this has been interpreted to mean that 51% of school days each school term must have an act of worship of a broadly Christian character.\n\nThe legislation is supplemented by non-statutory DfE guidance. This makes it clear that sixth-formers can decide for themselves whether or not to take part in collective worship. It also sets out circumstances under which a local SACRE can grant a formal determination that an individual school can provide alternatives to the \"broadly Christian\" collective worship arrangements required by the legislation.\n\nWhile head teachers have a duty to ensure that the law on collective worship is upheld within their school, they cannot themselves be required to participate in it, or to direct other teachers to participate it, against their will. Nor can they make the willingness to participate in, or lead, collective worship a condition of teachers' employment. If necessary, head teachers are required to source \"appropriate people\nfrom the local community who would be willing and able to lead collective worship\".\n\nWhen the head of Ofsted announced that it would no longer inspect the provision of Collective Worship in 2004, he stated that 76% of secondary schools were not compliant with the law. An opinion poll commissioned by the BBC in 2011 indicated that 64% of parents in England say their children do not attend a daily act of worship at school, and that 60% of the general public are not in favour of the law on collective worship being enforced.\n\nIn 2011, amendments were proposed to the law on collective worship, which would have made it optional at schools without a formal faith designation, and which would have also made it easier for pupils to opt themselves out of collective worship. The amendments were debated in the House of Lords, but were not adopted.\n\nGroups campaigning to amend the law on Collective Worship include Humanists UK and the National Secular Society, who argue that the requirement for daily worship should be replaced by a requirement for inclusive assemblies instead. The National Governors Association is also seeking an end to compulsory collective worship in schools without a religious affiliation. In 2014 a leading education spokesperson for the Church of England, Bishop Pritchard, publicly expressed a view that the term collective worship should be re-framed as \"spiritual reflection\" to make it \"more honest, and more in tune with contemporary culture.\" The Liberal Democrats have adopted a policy to make collective worship in non-religious schools optional rather than compulsory, and a change in the law has also been called for by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. In 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child called for an end to compulsory collective worship in UK schools.\nThe law on compulsory collective worship was first introduced by Section 25 of the 1944 Education Act. The legislation was subsequently developed by the Education Reform Act 1988, by Chapter III of the Education Act 1996, and, most recently, by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.\n\nCollective worship is also a daily legal requirement in Northern Ireland, although regulations on the nature of the worship are different to that of England and Wales. \n\nIn Scotland there is no requirement for collective worship, but the practice of religious observance should be available to pupils, unless the local education authority has resolved to discontinue it and this resolution has been approved by local electors.\n"}
{"id": "1220878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1220878", "title": "Commission of National Education", "text": "Commission of National Education\n\nThe Commission of National Education (, abbreviated KEN, , ) was the central educational authority in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, created by the Sejm and the King Stanisław August Poniatowski on October 14, 1773. Because of its vast authority and autonomy, it is considered the first Ministry of Education in European history and an important achievement of the Polish Enlightenment.\n\nThe chief reason behind its creation was that in Poland and Lithuania, the Jesuits ran an extensive system of educational institutions. Although the Jesuit schools were fairly efficient and provided the Polish youth with a good education, they were also very conservative. In addition, in 1773 the Pope decided to close down the Jesuit order (Dominus ac Redemptor). This threatened a complete breakdown of education in the Commonwealth.\n\nOne of the first items on the parliamentary agenda of the Partition Sejm (1773–1775), which acceded to the First Partition of Poland, was the assessment in how to best utilise the former Jesuit property and declaration of a firm intention to the continuity of the education system.\n\nThe Commission was formally created on October 14, 1773. It was one of the newly set-up \"Grand Commissions\"; organisations with the status of a ministry, albeit with a collegiate structure. Its main mastermind and chief figure was a Catholic priest, Hugo Kołłątaj; other notable supporters included Ignacy Potocki and Adam K. Czartoryski. Initially, the governing body consisted of 4 senators and 4 members of the Sejm, half of them representing the eastern \"counties\"voivodships of the Commonwealth (from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). The first head of the KEN was Prince Bishop Michał Jerzy Poniatowski. Although the other members were mostly magnate politicians, the main founders of the body were the prominent writers and scientists of the epoch: Franciszek Bieliński, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Feliks Oraczewski, Andrzej Gawroński, Dawid Pilchowski, Hieronim Stroynowski and Grzegorz Piramowicz. They were joined by Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours, the Secretary of the King of Poland (and father of the founder of the DuPont company).\n\nDespite the fact that, initially, the KEN had to face a strong opposition in the Sejm, it was supported by both the monarch and the Familia party, which accorded it almost complete independence in management of its affairs.\n\nIn 1773 the KEN was granted much of the former property of the Jesuit order, including all the schools, and many palaces and Church-owned villages. Due to this fact, the Commission had not only benefited from the necessary infrastructure, but also had its own profit-yielding farms.\n\nThe Commission supervised two universities (the Jagiellonian University in Kraków and the Vilnius University in Vilnius), 74 secondary schools and about 1600 parish schools. The third Commonwealth's university, the Lwów University, had been lost to the Austrian Partition.\n\nSoon afterwards Hugo Kołłątaj prepared a three-level-based education plan:\n\nSince all prior education in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was conducted mostly in Latin, the KEN faced the problem of an almost complete lack of books and manuals. To cope with the problem the Society of Elementary Books (\"Towarzystwo Ksiąg Elementarnych\") was, therefore, established. The Society sponsored competitions for creating the best textbooks. The scientists—working on the new Polish language textbooks—had, at times, to come up with the necessary vocabulary entries. Much of the vocabulary they invented (in relation to Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics or Grammar) is still in use up to this day.\n\nThe Commission also devised several documents, outlining the whole educational process. However, several of the new principles were considered too novel for that age, and were often ignored. These included, inter alia, the principle of 'equality of both sexes' in education. \nIn 1780, the Opposition refused to sign the Statute on Elementary Schools (which was drafted by Kołłątaj).\n\nIn 1774 the Commission took over the Załuski Library.\n\nAfter the formative period, during which the prerogatives of the Commission were established, the KEN started to convert schools to the new model. The three universities in Warsaw, Vilnius and Kraków were granted the right of curatorship over schools of lower degree. This included the schools which remained under the influence of the Roman Church. Gradually, the teachers, who were frequently former Jesuit priests, were exchanged for young lay teachers - graduates of the three academies. Thanks to this move, the opposition inside the local schools was finally broken.\n\nAfter 1789 the supporters of reforms in the Polish Sejm gradually started to lose their influence. Similarly, the KEN was deprived of many of its former privileges. During the Sejm Wielki the \"Reformers\" had to sacrifice many of those privileges in order to gain support for the Constitution of May the 3rd. Ultimately, after the victory of the Confederation of Targowica, in 1794, the KEN lost control over most of the schools in the Commonwealth and many of its members were banished or had to defect abroad. This included Hugo Kołłątaj himself, who had to escape to Dresden.\n\nAlthough the Commission had only functioned for around 20 years, it managed to completely change the shape of education in Poland. The Enlightenment-based school programmes and books influenced the whole generation of Poles. Also, although education was still far from being universal, it became accessible to a much wider group of people, including peasants. Thousands of teachers—trained in lay teachers' seminaries—became the backbone of Polish science during the Partitions and the generation, educated in the schools created and supervised by the KEN, gave rise to the most prominent personalities of the Polish Uprisings and of politics in Central Europe in the 19th century. In addition, the 27 elementary textbooks and manuals, published by the Commission, laid the foundations for the Polish language terminology in Chemistry, Physics, Logics, Grammar and Mathematics. They were used by all prominent Polish scientists and authors of the 19th century, from Adam Mickiewicz to Bolesław Prus and from the Lwów School of Mathematics to the Lwów–Warsaw School of History. The Guidebook to Chemistry, by Jędrzej Śniadecki, remained in use in the Polish schools well beyond the 1930s.\n\nIt is often argued, with quite some force, that because of the efforts of the Commission of National Education, the Polish language and culture did not disappear into oblivion, during the Partitions of Poland – heavy Russification and Germanisation notwithstanding.\n\n"}

Although common throughout the kingdom, the role was more common and important in the administration of the Azores.\n\nThe King of Portugal had by ordination, in the entire kingdom, the right to send important authorities, in his name, to correct the acts at all levels of the local administration and judiciary. To this end, since he was unable to participate directly, he established the post of \"Corregedor\".\n\nThe first Corregedor with jurisdiction over the Azores, Dr. Afonso de Matos, was nominated by King Manuel I of Portugal in 1503. Part of his obligation was that he was required to visit the Azores once per year, at the expense of the local authorities.\n\nAfter 1535, King John established a time frame for corrections to be made in each island of the Azores, and by each Captaincy. In that statement, a four-month plan was established specifically for the islands of São Jorge, Graciosa, Faial, Pico and Flores, the islands of Santa Maria and São Miguel established a specific working division and, the island of Terceira alone. In special circumstances, the Corregedor could visit each island for longer stays.\n\nThe Corregedor in the Azores was the most important judicial magistrate, judging at the second tier, providing appeals and conflicts between presiding judges and \"ouvidors\" (the counsels, of the Captains-General). The royal edict of 1767 established the predominance of the corregador, recognizing his power to judge appeals, something that the corregedors on the continent were not permitted to do. In this role, the Corregedor could suspend the jurisdiction or their powers to judge, during his visit. Similarly, the Corregedor was responsible for inspecting the functioning of the Municipal authorities () and audit the books of the public finances.\n\n\n"}

It was intended to be the principal arts and cultural component of the 1976 Summer Olympics, but was destroyed illegally on the direct order of the city's executive council, itself having been told to do so by then mayor Jean Drapeau. The exhibit showcased approximately 60 artists, and the collective efforts of hundreds more in the creation of 16 installations, with additional stages at two points along the street to host hundreds of performances throughout the duration of the games. It was considered an act of outright censorship at the time and by some measures may stand as the single largest episode of artistic censorship in Canadian history.\n\nCorridart included artworks that engaged with the history of Montreal as well as the social and economic problems that were then current within the city, province, country and world, reflecting the difficulties in striking a societal balance between increasing globalization and the desire for a national identity. Sherbrooke Street was chosen because it provided the most direct link between the urban core and the Olympic Park in the East End of Montreal, but also because it is a symbolic street in the city's history, acting as both the dividing line between rich and poor (especially before the mid-20th century), while simultaneously uniting multiple communities across two thirds of the island. Moreover, it was a street caught in the middle of Montreal's metamorphosis, as the artists were additionally commenting on the Drapeau administration's approval of the demolition of many heritage properties on that storied street.\n\nUnfortunately Corridart never officially opened to the public.

{"id": "1057595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1057595", "title": "Flag Group", "text": "Flag Group\n\nThe Flag Group was a British political party, formed from one of the two wings of the National Front in the 1980s. Formed in opposition to the Political Soldier wing of the Official National Front, it took its name from \"The Flag\", a newspaper the followers of this faction formed after leaving and regrouping outside the main and diminishing rump of the rest of the party.\n\nDuring the early 1980s the Political Soldier wing of the NF held sway within the party and was on good terms with chairman Andrew Brons who, although a Strasserite by conviction rather than a disciple of Julius Evola and ruralism, largely supported the young radicals and co-operated with them to remove Martin Webster, the former ally of Brons' predecessor John Tyndall, from the party in 1984. However cracks between the two factions soon began to show and a power struggle ensued. This culminated in 1986 when the two wings of the party split, with around 3000 of the 5000 registered NF members breaking away with Brons to form a new separate group. The immediate actual cause of the split had been the refusal of the Political Soldiers to contest elections and the Brons group made this the issue on which they started their own group, initially called the National Front Support Group before adopting their more usual Flag Group moniker. Activists such as Martin Wingfield, Ian Anderson, Joseph Pearce and Tom Acton emerged as the new leading figures within this group and the Flag Group initially grew at a much faster rate than the Official National Front, although this was in part due to the Political Soldiers closing off membership of their wing.\n\nThe Flag Group rejected the mysticism of the Political Soldiers and the ONF's technique of establishing contacts with non-white groups such as Black Power and Islamic fundamentalism activists. Despite these differences with the ONF the Flag Group was not a direct copy of the earlier NF as it was also influenced by 'left-wing' economics ideals of Strasserism, albeit whilst emphasising anti-immigration and anti-Semitism alongside this. As time went on and Brons was sidelined in favour of Wingfield and Anderson the Flag Group began to look more towards the populism of the \"Front National\", which was enjoying comparative success in France at the time, resulting in a return to more basic racist sentiments and less emphasis on economics as opposed to Strasserism. Amongst their more crudely racialist policies the Flag Group stressed the importance of having large families and included ideas about the white race being bred out of existence in their election literature. Steve Brady, formerly a leading figure in the National Party, championed this idea within the Flag Group although his other favoured idea, his opposition to Christianity in particular and religion in general and his desire to see a purely secular basis for Flag Group nationalism, was not taken up. Wingfield's strategy for growth included recruiting new members at football grounds, a tactic that initially paid dividends.\n\nBrons had a history of low-level co-operation with the British National Party whilst he and BNP leader John Tyndall went back to the early 1960s when they were both active in the National Socialist Movement and so not long after the split Brons contacted Stanley Clayton-Garnett, the BNP's Northern leader, with a view to closer co-operation. Tyndall and Brons met formally in Leeds in May 1987 to discuss the formation of a 'Nationalist Alliance' to be organised along the lines of the SDP–Liberal Alliance in existence at the time. A Liaison Committee was set up as a result of this meeting and Brons put the idea to the Flag Group's steering committee that same July. The plan however came to nothing as it was rejected by the steering committee and so disavowed by Brons in October 1987. Within the Flag Group it was widely reported that the rejection had happened because of a fear that Tyndall intended only to swallow up the party and make himself sole leader whilst within the BNP it was suggested that the Flag Group's Strasserism made them incompatible with the party. It has also been argued that \"Flag\" editor Martin Wingfield, who published an editorial denouncing notions of merger, sabotaged the move because he bore a grudge against Tyndall and his father-in-law Charles Parker after Wingfiled had attempted, unsuccessfully, to replace the latter as NF organiser in Sussex some years earlier, a struggle that resulted in Wingfield's temporary expulsion from the NF. Nonetheless the parties did continue to co-operate unofficially whilst Tom Acton also managed to win support for the Group from the influential publisher Anthony Hancock who had initially favoured the ONF in the split. As well as their monthly newspaper \"The Flag\" the group also published a monthly magazine \"Vanguard\" and \"Lonheart\", a quarterly.\n\nAs a separate group, the Flag Group contested Bristol East in the 1987 general election. By the Vauxhall by-election, 1989, they had resumed using the National Front name, even though their candidate Ted Budden faced opposition from Official National Front candidate Patrick Harrington. Other elections contested included the Epping Forest by-election of December 1988, the European Parliament election of 1989 in which the West Midlands seat was fought by Wingfield and the Mid-Staffordshire by-election of March 1990 in which the party finished behind even parody candidate Screaming Lord Sutch. This policy of contesting elections, invariably with very disappointing results, left the Flag Group with a significant funding shortage. By 1989 the Flag Group had around 1,500 members with most activity centred on the West Midlands. Another activity centre had been Tower Hamlets although following the failure of the 'Nationalist Alliance' initiative this group, which included future BNP Campaign Director Eddy Butler, switched en bloc to the BNP.\n\nAs the 1980s drew to a close, the ONF disintegrated with its place being taken by the International Third Position and the Third Way. This allowed the Flag Group to assume sole control of the name, mantle and traditions of NF and effectively signalled the end of the Flag Group as a name. Soon they would attempt to relaunch the NF as the National Democrats.\n"}
{"id": "50695350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50695350", "title": "Girlgov", "text": "Girlgov\n\nEvery year, around 100 girls travel to the State capitol building of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg. There, these girls have the chance to shadow and lobby their state representatives. This is Girlgov. The goal for the girls is to increase civic engagement and the goal for the state is to increase political representation among women and decrease the gender disparity within the state House of Representatives and the Senate. Since its start Girlgov has served over 500 girls over the years. It is one of the Women and Girls Foundation's core projects.\n\nIn 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation launched a program in conjunction with FISA Foundation, Eden Hall Foundation, and the Jewish Women’s Foundation called Girls as Grantmakers. In this program, around two dozen girls from across Allegheny County. These girls were of different race, ages, types of schools, geographic locations, and economic levels. The 2-year program took place from 2005-2007. The girls granted up to $10,000 to different organizations and groups aimed at increasing the quality of a girl within the county. Before the end of their term, these girls launched a campaign against Abercrombie & Fitch. They encouraged girl nationwide to boycott Abercrombie & Fitch for shirts containing racist and sexist imagery and themes in their 2005 Girlcott. This Girlcott successfully joined the efforts of girls across the country to pressure Abercrombie & Fitch to pull 2 of its shirts. Though the company did not take down all the shirts that the girls wanted, the experience and the coalition building inspired them to create another county based group under the title Regional Change Agents. The Allegheny County Regional Change Agents came up with the idea for Girlgov. At that time Pennsylvania was ranked low in terms of representation of women and girls in politics. Girlgov served 60 girls in 2009, its first year. This number has since increased.\n\nThe trip to Harrisburg has ranged from three days to a week. Because of the overarching goal of the program, increased political engagement among girls, the program is more than simply a day of shadowing and a trip back home. The girls do follow State Senators, Representatives, and their staff around for a day, experiencing the day in the life in the capitol, but the trip includes additional programming. In previous iterations of the trip, girls have taken part in a Mock Congress. In this Mock Congress, the girls would be split into separate committees directly mirroring committees within the state government. Each committee would read a series of proposals from real organizations in the southwestern part of the state. The Mock Congress would be allocated a set number of funds, one year this amount was $10,000, then debate until they came to a consensus about which organizations should receive the money and how much money they should hope to receive. Before doing this, they get a crash course in legislation 101. They learn of all the stops a bill takes on its path to becoming a law: committee in the Senate, community support, the House floor, etc. The girls are heavily prepared to encounter law officials. This preparation also takes the form of self care. The girls take part in activities that strengthen the bonds between each other and those that have gone before them into the male dominated world. Panels and dinners provide opportunities for the girls to encounter women in leadership positions in all fields. The girls network. In actuality, the trip more perfectly resembles a conference.\n\nReturning participants have the option to shadow a representative again or lobby. These girls would either lobby for a bill of their own choosing or lobby a bill agreed upon by the entire body of Girlgov goers. Girlgov girls have advocated for passage of the Demi Brae Bill which would introduce teen dating violence protection and education legislation. A Girlgov participant, Sarah Pesi, created her own bill. Sarah's bill was aimed at loosening the requirements to obtain restraining orders to include, minors, non-familial or romantic relationships, and varied forms of harassment. With assistance from Girlgov, Sarah oversaw and participated in the editing, networking, and lobbying of her own bill. The bill was signed into law by the acting governor of the time, Tom Corbett, in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, the girls held a rally at the Capitol too demand comprehensive science-based sexual education in schools. The Girlgov participants organized the first International Day of the Girl Celebration in 2013.\nThose that participate in the summer have the opportunity to continue their involvement during the year. In the WGF newsletter, girls are seen helping at rallies, volunteering in the offices of local officials, heading efforts to lower school bus emissions, raising awareness on the conflict in Syria, advocating for LGBT+ rights, and attending a luncheon at the White House, among other things. A few of the girls make up the Girlgov leadership council which organizes initiatives and leads activities on the trips to Harrisburg.\n\nSarah Pesi drafted a bill to fortify anti-stalker laws.\n\nJulia Johnson is a local activist for the #BlackLivesMatter movement in Pittsburgh.\n"}

The conflict was fought between the Guatemalan government and smaller leftist guerrilla groups that fought under the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG). It resulted in about 200,000 casualties and \"disappearances\", making it the deadliest armed conflict in Central America.\n\nAfter a series of dictatorships, Guatemala was greatly pressured internationally to make efforts towards reincorporating democracy. In 1985, the then ruler General Oscar Mejía Victores allowed for the formation of a Constituent Assembly, which began working on a new democratic constitution. This new constitution was then finalized and ratified on May 30, 1985. The following year, democratic elections were held and Vinicio Cerezo was sworn in as president of Guatemala.\n\nPrior to this, in 1983, the Contadora Group in Latin America, which was an initiative formed by Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, began promoting peace in the Central American countries undergoing internal conflicts (El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala). The group served as mediators in peace talks among all Central American rulers, which led to the drafting of the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America. The document did not fully receive the support of the United States and was ultimately rejected by three of the Central American countries (Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica) in 1986.\n\nAlthough the Contadora process was not successful, it was continued by President Vinicio Cerezo in his pursuit for peace as president of Guatemala. In 1986, all five Central American rulers attended a series of meetings in Esquipulas, Guatemala. In August 1987, all five countries signed the Esquipulas II Accord, which drew heavily from the previous Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation. This agreement outlined a framework for the resolution of the current Central American civil wars. Two important components of this accord were an amnesty law and an urgency to disarm rebel groups. The government would then have further peace talks with forces who accepted these terms. The Esquipulas II Accord also created the National Reconciliation Commission (NRC), which allowed for a civil influence on the peace process. Although this early accord opened the dialogue for peace in Guatemala, it did not come to a concrete close of the country's internal armed conflict.\n\nStarting in 1988 and continuing for the following years, the NRC and URNG met on several occasions and engaged in peace talks, but did not come to an end to the Guatemalan civil war. Still, the two groups signed documents, such as the Oslo Accord, Mexico Accord, and Querétaro Agreement.\n\nJorge Serrano Elías was democratically elected and became president of Guatemala in January 1991. Two years and a half into his presidency, on May 25, 1993, he attempted to proclaim sole power over the country through an autocoup. He dissolved the Guatemalan congress and fragmented the Supreme Court with the help of allies in the government and military. With this, he caused a constitutional crisis in the country. However, there was strong opposition by civilians and the Constitutional Court and Serrano Elías ultimately fled to El Salvador on June 2, failing in his attempts towards dictatorship. The congress then named Ramiro de León Carpio, who was the country's Human Rights Ombudsman, as president for the time remaining of Serrano's original presidential term.\n\nUnder Ramiro de León Carpio's presidency, the Guatemalan peace process took on new life. President de Leon made an initial proposal to restart the peace process, which was rejected by the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG). As a result, in January 1994, representatives of the government of Guatemala and the UNRG met in Mexico City and signed the Framework Agreement. This agreement resumed efforts towards peace in the country and settled a new peace process through two-way negotiations brokered by the United Nations. It also established an instrumental \"Group of Friends\" to the Guatemalan peace process that consisted of the governments of Colombia, Mexico, Norway, Spain, the United States of America and Venezuela. Another contribution of the Framework Agreement was the creation of the Civil Society Assembly (ASC) aimed towards allowing a civil, non-governmental, sector to influence and critique the bilateral negotiations.\n\nUnder this new moderation structure, the Guatemalan government and the URNG continued to make efforts to achieve a Firm and Lasting Peace in Guatemala. In 1994, four more major agreements were signed by the disputing sides in Mexico and Oslo.\n\nThe Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights signed on March 29 in Mexico City committed the government and the URNG to implement and enforce specified human rights. To achieve these human rights, the agreement addressed issues regarding impunity, regulations for bearing arms, the need for security forces to act under the law, the freedoms of association and movement, compulsory military service, security for parties protecting human rights, protection and services for victims of human rights violations, and halting harm inflicted on the Guatemalan population. Lastly, the agreement also required verification by part of the United Nations of the compliance of both negotiating parties with peace process agreements. This led to the successive creation of the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala, which was then renamed as United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) and involved a peacekeeping mission after the final peace accord was signed in the country.\n\nThe two groups also signed the on March 29. This agreement outlined a schedule for the continuing discourse and negotiations for peace in Guatemala. It set December of the same year as the anticipated culmination date for the process and the signing of a final peace accord. However, this goal was delayed and achieved two years after the planned date.\n\nPeace negotiations were also concerned with the large numbers of internally displaced populations. On June 17, the government and the URNG met in Oslo and settled the Agreement on Resettlement of the Population Groups Uprooted by the Armed Conflict. This agreement targeted the safe reintegration of the previously mentioned population into their homelands prior to the armed conflict, as well as the reestablishment of state power, much of which had been lost to municipal governments.\n\nLastly in 1994, with the Agreement on the Establishment of the Commission to Clarify Past Human Rights Violations and Acts of Violence the two parties committed to the creation of a Clarification Commission dedicated to investigating possible crimes throughout the entirety of the Guatemalan Armed Conflict, up to the final peace accords. This commission was not given any legal power but was instead expected to collect information and give recommendations to address human rights violations resulting from the conflict.\n\nOn March 31, 1995, representatives of the Guatemalan government and the URNG met again in Mexico and signed The Agreement on the Identity and Rights of Indigenous People. Later that year, the ASC and serious efforts became stagnated due to a change in focus towards upcoming elections.\n\nLater in 1995, democratic elections were held and the candidate of the National Advancement Party (PAN), Alvaro Arzú Yrigoyen, won the presidency to the populist runner-up Alfonso Portillo. When Ramiro de León Carpio completed Serrano Elías's term on January 14, 1996, Alvaro Arzú was sworn in as president.\n\nSince Alvaro Arzú's presidency accelerated the peace process between the government of Guatemala and the URNG for several reasons. Mainly, the absent ties between him and the military, and pressures from the international community and the business community in the country allowed for productive negotiations for peace. As part of the president's commitments towards peace, he appointed Gustavo Porras Castejón, a former leader of the Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres (EGP), which was affiliated with the URNG, as the president of the country's Peace Commission (COPAZ). Under this organization, the URNG and the government continued constant peace talks and signed a series of agreements leading up to the final peace accord.\n\nIn May, 1996, representatives of the two groups met in Mexico and signed the Agreement on Socio-Economic Aspects and the Agrarian Situation. This agreement concerned the economic model and structure of the country and targeted four areas: Democratisation and Participatory Development, Social Development, Agrarian Situation and Rural Development, and Modernization of Government Services and Fiscal Policy.\n\nLater that year, in September, they signed the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civil Power and the Function of the Army in a Democratic Society, which had the main goal of establishing a stable democracy and moving the country away from the previous prevalence of authoritarian military rule. In these efforts, it also created several primary organizations such as Guatemala's Civil National Police (PNC).\n\nThese two agreements then led to the final agreements in the last month before the final peace accord. These included the Agreements on a Definitive Ceasefire, Constitutional Reforms and the Electoral Regime, the Basis for Legal integration of the URNG, the Law of National Reconciliation, and the Implementation, Compliance, and Verification Timetable for the Peace Agreements.\n\nThis last one was signed in Guatemala City together with the Agreement for a Firm and Lasting Peace on December 29, 1996. This signaled the legal culmination of the Guatemalan internal armed conflict after thirty-six years.\n\nSigned on December 29, 1996, this final Accord officiated the implementation of the peace agreements signed under the Framework Agreement in the previous 10 years of attempted negotiations.\n\nThe legal document is divided into four main sections. First, it outlines a list of concepts addressed throughout the peace process and decided upon in the final agreement. In the second section, it explicitly establishes the implementation of 10 accords previously signed by the URNG and Guatemalan governments. These 10 are as follows:\nThe third section recognizes the support and role of entities such as the ASC, the United Nations, and the countries part of the Group of Friends to the Guatemalan Peace Process.\n\nLastly, the fourth section establishes the validity of the Firm and Lasting Peace document as soon as it is signed and states that the document's means and goals would be widely announced, especially through official education programs.\n\nThe agreement was then signed by representatives of the government of Guatemala, the URNG, and the United Nations.\n\nThe signing of a final peace agreement was greatly expected by the Guatemalan population. Thousands of people attended this signing ceremony, which was held in front of the National Palace and projected on large screens in the main square. The accords were well anticipated and agreed upon by Guatemalans, as the population was eager for an end to the thirty-six years of war. However, there was hesitation due to expected failure in the implementation of the accords. A poll conducted by Prensa Libre, a national newspaper, showed that 78% of respondents agreed with the accords but only 38% believed these peace negotiations \"would be respected\".\n\nAlthough the leading leftist group, URNG, signed the final peace accords with the government of Guatemala, not all smaller branches fighting under the URNG were satisfied with the agreements. The Revolutionary Organization of Armed People (ORPA) stated that they did not agree completely with the accords signed by the URNG on December 29, 1996. As a demonstration of this disagreement, they refused to attend a reconciliation ceremony in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. However, this did not impede the end of the war in the country.\n\nThe general language of the peace accords and the lack of representation of several Guatemalan groups caused challenges of implementation in the years following the signing of peace. Although the peace agreement was the start to establish significant changes to Guatemala, many problems in the third-world country have thwarted progress in several areas. Major problems have stemmed from the corruption, bureaucracy, and self-interest prevalent in political positions in the country.\n\nA problematic characteristic of this country is the extreme poverty and inequality among the population. Most of the country's population is indigenous, and have the lowest levels of education and live in the highest levels of poverty. Although the accords acknowledged the historical vulnerability and exploitation of this group, it did not outline effectively specific approaches to aid these people. This has allowed the continuation of a separated and racist society unable to collaborate with each other.\n\nAnother challenge has been the implementation of accords concerning land conflicts. Illegal occupations of land have continued and the government has not been able to address them so as to create a deterrent factor. The head of the governmental institution designated to deal with these cases resigned on the basis that they were not given the resources necessary to accomplish needed results. This, along with vague guidelines in the peace accords, has been problematic in the reincorporation of displaced populations and has not benefited the large rural and poor populations in the country.\n\nAnother characteristic promised by the accords that have failed to be accomplished or implemented properly is the topic of security in the country. The Civil National Police force, created after the war in compliance with peace agreements, is ill-trained and corrupt. In has proved unable to fight against organized crime or collaborate in prosecutions against human rights crimes. In addition, the government has also caused insecurity and distrust by being involved in corruption and defraudation cases.\n\nThe country has also found it difficult to comply with agreed targets in the areas of social welfare and tax legislation. Although the government promised to invest more money in education and healthcare budgets, it has not complied with its initial targets. In addition, as promised, in 1998 the government passed a law increasing taxes but repealed it after civil protests, and did not pursue any further changes.\n\nFurthermore, there was significant pressure from international entities who had contributed resources and money to the peace process, many of which were conditional on the right implementation of established accords. Therefore, the challenges and inability to comply with parts of the peace accords has led to budget cuts that further complicate the fulfillment of promised changes.\n\nAlthough the country has not fully implemented the 1996 peace accords, the civil war did not continue. However, there have been many accusations of human rights violations that have been faced with high levels of impunity for members involved. Cases of people \"disappeared\" by the military in the armed conflict have gone unsolved and families continue to look for justice, in many cases to no avail. In May 2013, the former Guatemalan President, Efrain Rios Montt, was found guilty of coordinating the killing of nearly 1,800 indigenous Ixil Maya from 1982 to 1983. Cases of people \"disappeared\" by the military in the armed conflict have gone unsolved and families continue to look for justice. In addition, there are still ideological frictions in the country that have created tensions among the population and psychological effects that have affected the country's progress.\n"}

Born into a poor peasant family, Hou Bo joined the Communist Party at the age of fourteen and learned photography during the Second Sino-Japanese War in order to present a better image of the Party's work to the world. After 1949, she and Xu Xiaobing lived in the same compound as Mao and took both official photos, some used for posters and publicity, which became the most widely circulated photos of Mao, and some family photos, taken informally behind the scenes.\n\nAmong her best known photographs are \"The Founding of the PRC\" (1949), \"Mao Zedong Swimming Across the Yangzi\" (1955), \"Chairman Mao at Work in an Airplane\" (1959), and \"Mao Zedong with Students from Latin America\" (1959), which won First Prize in the National Photography Exhibition of 1959.\n\nHou Bo was born in 1924 and was from a poor peasant background. She joined the Chinese Communist Party at 14. Her father, a laborer, was beaten to death by factory owner who refused to pay him, and her mother died of grief soon after. When she made her way to Yan'an, she finished school and enrolled in the Anti-Japanese Military and Politics University, where she studied politics.\n\nShe and her future husband, Xu Xiaobing, then a PLA photographer, met in Yan'an in early 1942 and he introduced her to photography. They married in the spring of 1943. Hou Bo later recalled, \"About 10 friends gathered with us in our cave; we bought jujubes and dried buns, and we all sang together\". Work assignments separated the couple for long periods of time, but Hou studied photography with Japanese prisoners. In January 1949, when the PLA entered Beiping, Hou and Xu were reunited in Mao's summer house in his Fragrant Hills temporary headquarters outside the city where Xu was photographing Mao's meetings with foreign delegations. Mao took an interest in Hou Bo, asking where she came from, and saying that she \"grew up on the millet of Yan'an, so you must serve the people.\" Mao asked her to join his group of official photographers. \nHou's photo of Mao and other new leaders on October 1, 1949, proclaiming the founding of the People's Republic of China is one of the most widely distributed photographs of modern times, but she also took less formal pictures of the leadership. She later recalled that when, \"after all present sang the national anthem, Chairman Mao solemnly declared the founding of new China, I felt so exhilarated that I forgot about the danger and leaned as far out from the rostrum guardrails as I could and took a photo of Chairman Mao as he declared the rising of the new nation.\" \n\nFrom 1950 to 1961, Hou Bo lived in the Zhongnanhai, the residence of top party officials, where she set up the Photography Department. She was joined by her husband and two children, who were reared in the Party nursery there. Mao's children called her \"Aunt Hou Bo.\" By one count, although she was the only woman on the film crew, Hou Bo took more than 400 of the 700 officially published photographs of Mao in this period. She and Xu Xiaobo became, as one China watcher put it, \"court photographers\" who took photos both of Mao in \"Stalinesque\" poses that became famous propaganda posters, and also relaxed pictures of him with his family, some on the beach at Beidaihe. Her assignment was to make a photographic record not only of Mao, but of Central Committee members including Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Liu Shaoqi. She travelled with these officials and often caught them in unguarded moments, such as \"Chairman Mao at Work on an Aeroplane\" (1957), which showed him intent on reading a document. These personal photos were not circulated to the public or the press; one print of each was for Zhongnanhai and one for the archive.\n\nHou Bo had a mixed relation with Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, who pursued photography as an avid amateur and had Hou Bo transferred from Zhongnanhai to New China News Agency in 1961. When she left Zhongnanhai, however, she recalled later, Mao told her \"For 12 years, you took a lot of very good pictures of me\". During the Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing attacked Hou. \"She said I was a fake communist, because I had joined when I was 14 even though the official age was 18,\" Hou said in a 2009 interview. \"And she said the fact I had photographed disgraced figures like Liu Shaoqi meant I was definitely a counter-revolutionary. I hate her, but she did what she believed in\".\n\nIn their later years, she and her husband also received recognition outside China. They were the subjects of a documentary film, \"Hou Bo et Xu Xiaobing, photographes de Mao\" (Claude Hudelot et Jean-Michel Vecchiet, 2003, 52 mins), and an exhibition of their photographs of Mao was presented at the Photographers' Gallery, London, during April and May 2004. \n\nAfter her husband's death in 2009 she noted that she was still a communist and an admirer of Mao Zedong's legacy. She said that she and her husband were \"just ordinary workers who gave our lives for the foundation of a new China.\" Mao made mistakes in the Cultural Revolution, and \"everyone's life was hard, but so was his. China was very poor, and he made a big contribution to provide a foundation for our country to be great.\" Bo died on 26 November 2017, aged 93.\n\n The critic Claude Hudelot remarks that the widely circulated poster of Mao in the midst of a rice field, taken from Hou's photo, shows that Hou's farm background made her comfortable among China's cultures, where she \"immersed herself with an almost childlike joy\". She shows Mao wearing a straw hat that \"seems to accentuate the effect of an Emperor of Nature, radiating rays of sunlight\". Her photography explored deeper into the history of Mao Zedong, as well as attempt to highlight and depict the features of his image that made him a historical leader in Chinese history. The poster was issued in millions of copies in 1958, just at the start of the eventually devastating Great Leap Forward.\n\nThe Taiwan photographer Zhang Zhaotang said when an exhibition of Hou and Xu's photos reached Taiwan, \"As an official photographer, Hou has managed to avoid showing rigid and affected postures; she's given her subject a natural and vivid shot, thanks to her diligence and perseverance\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11398393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11398393", "title": "Jewish Party (Romania)", "text": "Jewish Party (Romania)\n\nThe Jewish Party, in full Jewish Party of Romania (, PER; ) or Jewish National Party (\"Partidul Național Evreiesc\" or \"Evreesc\", PNE; ), was a right-wing political party in Romania, representing Jewish community interests. It originally followed an undercurrent of Zionism, promoting communitarianism as a prerequisite of resettlement in Palestine, and later progressed toward Religious Zionism and Revisionism. Founded by Tivadar Fischer, József Fischer, and Adolphe Stern, it had particularly strong sections in Transylvania and Bessarabia. In the Old Kingdom, where it registered least support, it was mainly represented by A. L. Zissu and \"Renașterea Noastră\" newspaper.\n\nThe PER was strongly opposed to the liberal and assimilationist program of Wilhelm Filderman and his Union of Romanian Jews (UER). It managed to undermine the UER's spread into Transylvania and other regions, presenting its own candidates in elections for Parliament during the 1930s, when it also became a vocal opponent of antisemitism. Effectively pushed out of national politics in unfavorable circumstances during the elections of 1933, it formed alliances with the UER, before being ultimately banned in 1938. Its support basis was scattered by territorial changes during World War II, and decimated by the Holocaust.\n\nThe PER reemerged soon after the anti-Nazi coup of 1944, clashing with the Romanian Communist Party and its satellite Jewish Democratic Committee, but also with Ihud-type Zionism. Failing to obtain recognition for its communitarian platform, the party was split between two camps. One was anti-communist, supported Zissu's platform of mass emigration into Palestine, and stood by the Revisionists in their conflict with Britain. The other, led by Mișu Benvenisti, was more open to cooperation with the communists, and was in control of the PER by 1946. Under Benvenisti, the PER adhered to a communist-controlled \"Jewish Representation\", presenting candidates in the election of 1946. Within two years, the communist regime dissolved all the Zionist organizations, imprisoning both Zissu and Benvenisti.\n\nThe PER came into being as a result of dissensions within the Jewish community. These followed the Jewish emancipation decrees of the early 1920s, and were aggravated by cultural and political differences between the regions of Greater Romania. Filderman's Union of Native Jews (as the UER was known before 1923) believed that a separate Jewish party was unnecessary, as it would isolate the Jews politically after they had struggled for decades to win Romanian citizenship. The Union stated that specific demands could be obtained more easily by participating in Romanian parties and collaborating with the Romanian government. As Filderman argued, the \"specific interests\" of the Jews \"are not in disagreement with the general interests of the Romanian state\". According to historian Henry Eaton, its stance was \"politically cooperative\" toward Romanian parties, seeking to \"deflect the charge that Jews in Romania represented a separate and alien nation\". More generally, the UER stood for a platform of Jewish assimilation: it was \"rather supportive of integration\", or even \"moderate Romanianization\". However, the UER was not fundamentally adverse to Zionism, with Filderman himself noting: \"a Romanian Jew cannot oppose the creation of a Jewish national state\".\n\nThe UER's assimilationist viewpoint was not shared by a group led by Tivadar (Theodor) Fischer, József Fischer, and Adolphe Stern. Stern, who represented the \"Old Kingdom\" regions, had been the original leader of the Union of Native Jews, serving from 1909 to 1923, in which capacity he supported emancipation and criticized the growth of violent antisemitism as embodied by the National-Christian Defense League (LANC). He had been elected to the Assembly of Deputies in 1922, as an ally of the non-Jewish Peasants' Party, caucusing with the Bukovina Zionist group headed by Mayer Ebner. The UER itself had opted for an alliance with the National Liberal Party (PNL), perceived by its Jewish sympathizers as the party of \"order and peace\".\n\nTivadar Fischer and József Fischer were Hungarian Jews from Transylvania. According to one account, they were sons of an Alba Iulia rabbi, stranded in Romania upon the end of World War I. Historian Attila Gidó writes that they were unrelated by blood, but united by their common defense of Orthodox Judaism; József Fischer had been a critic of Zionism, before being drawn into it by other Transylvanian activists, to become \"one of Transylvanian Zionism's most important personalities\".\n\nAs noted by political scientist Randolph L. Braham, the Fischers' constituency's \"political culture was forged by their earlier experiences in the Hungarian Kingdom.\" As founders of the Transylvanian Jewish National League (EZNSz/UNET) and the single-issue Transylvanian People's Party, they had expressed their opposition to the UER as early as 1923, calling for its transformation into a \"general union\" of loosely affiliated bodies. Against the position taken by pro-UER Transylvanians such as Miksa Klein, they advised in favor of communitarianism, rejecting assimilation into the Romanian mainstream.\n\nThe EZNSz/UNET formed a cartel with the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ) during the 1928 election, which won both Fischers seats in the Assembly. They coalesced into a \"parliamentary club\" with Ebner and the Bessarabian Zionist Michel Landau, calling themselves part of a \"country-wide Jewish party\". Their calls for the establishment of a registered party were poorly received by the Democratic Nationalist government. Constantin Argetoianu, the Minister of the Interior, opined: \"Beyond equality as citizens, the Israelites cannot state any demand. Those of an ethnic nature, as taken up by a national Jewish party, would trap the Israelites in a political ghetto and would render difficult the matter of their integration.\" In turn, the Jewish deputies accused government of \"inertia\" and unwillingness to confront LANC antisemitism, registering with the opposition.\n\nThe PER was formally the fusion of two other short-lived Jewish Parties: a Fischer group and a Stern group. The resulting unified Jewish Party was established on May 4, 1931, in Bucharest. It had as its symbol the menorah, but also used \"two small convex arcs joined together by a horizontal line\". It published as its central organ \"Tribuna Evreiască\" of Bucharest, and its regional newspapers were the EZNSz/UNET's \"Új Kelet\" of Cluj and \"Neue Zeit–Új Kor\" of Timișoara.\n\nIts first-ever conference elected Tivadar Fischer as party president. He was seconded by an eight-member committee, while Stern (who died later that year) was honorary president, and József Fischer led the Transylvanian wing. In Bukovina, where the PER was foremost known as the \"Jüdische Reichspartei\", its chapter came to include, alongside Ebner, the unorthodox Zionist Max Diamant, formerly of the Jewish National People's Party, and Karl Klüger, Saul Klüger, Josef Mann, Leon Mizrachi, Benedikt Kaswan, Manfred Reifer (or Reiffer), and Leon Schmelzer. Ernő (Ernest) Marton, Mișu Weissman, and Landau were other prominent members of the PER. Lawyer Eugen Kertész headed the PER chapter in Cluj, later joined by the UER defector Miksa Klein.\n\nAt a later stage, the party was joined by the Zionist writer-industrialist A. L. Zissu, who brought in his own Zionist cell, \"Renașterea Noastră\". Zissu, a \"bourgeois conservative\", also advocated \"integral\" Zionism, communitarianism and self-segregation within the \"poly-ethnic state\", whereas Filderman's stances were \"coherently liberal\". Strongly inclined to a prophetic form of Religious Zionism, Zissu defined himself as \"\"the\" political opponent\" of the UER. Such ideas were also found in Marton's own essays, which were addressed to the Hungarian Jews of Transylvania: \"The Jews\", Marton noted, \"would be able to live among the peoples only as a people.\"\n\nThe PER took part in the June 1931 election. The UER, accused by the PER of electoral fraud, preferred to join Argetoianu's \"National Union\" alliance. In the end, the PER obtained some 60,000 votes, 2.19 or 2.38% of the total—depending on the number of deputies considered as part of the PER. It formally won four seats in the Assembly of Deputies, but later received another affiliation, raising it two five seats. The Fischers, Ebner, Diamant, and Reifer all won seats; in accordance with a previous agreement that no affiliate region would go unrepresented, Tivadar Fischer was replaced by Landau, and Ebner ceded his seat to Sami Singer.\n\nThe UER failed to renew its PNL alliance before the July 1932 race, and was approached by the Zionist Lazar Margulies to negotiate a merger with the PER. The talks were inconclusive. Subsequently, the UER, absorbing into its ranks dissident Zionists from the PER's Bukovina chapter, caucused with the nationwide Traders' Council. The PER took 2.26% and 5 seats: Fischer and Landau were returned; Marton, Weissman, and Ebner won the other three seats. These elections, organized and won by the PNȚ government of Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, were noted as the least fraudulent of their time. From then on, the PER was the sole Jewish party in the Assembly, the UER having failed to win sufficient votes.\n\nThe party's electoral basin was in Romania's \"new regions\", with only a slim presence in the Old Kingdom: some 40% of its total voters were from Transylvania, where over 70% of the emancipated Jewish population voted PER. Its main competitor was the Magyar Party, which took away votes from Hungarian-assimilated Jews; Jews from the less Magyarized zones, in particular Maramureș, were predominantly PER voters. In the east, Landau's Bessarabian constituency, comprising some of the poorest and least integrated sections of Romanian Jews, provided the PER with its other main electoral resource.\n\nThe parliamentary period refined the PER's program, adopted at a general congress in November 1933, into a doctrine. It sought to raise awareness among Romanian Jews that they belonged to a larger Jewish people, while at the same time re-affirming their devotion to the country in which they lived. The party fought for legal, moral and material rights, with a view toward the spiritual development of the Jewish minority (including state support for primary and professional schools, as well as for Jewish worship). Additionally, the PER program noted the need to promote collaboration with the political groups representing Romania's other nationalities.\n\nOver these years, the PER became more supportive of Revisionist Zionism, its radicalism on this topic being spurred on by the steady growth of antisemitic intolerance in Romania, represented by groups such as the LANC and the Iron Guard. Weissman had seconded the Revisionist ideologue Ze'ev Jabotinsky during the elections for the Seventeenth Zionist Congress in June 1931, against Singer, who ran on a \"Renașterea Noastră\" list. Through the EZNSz/UNET, which continued to exist as a cultural extension, the PER gathered funds for the colonization of destitute Maramureș Jews into Mandatory Palestine, founding there the settlement Tzur Shalom. It also initiated sociological research into the impoverished communities, sponsoring a survey team headed by István Barzilay, and organized a chapter for traders and artisans.\n\nAfter the Nazi regime was established in Germany, the PER stood in solidarity with the parties that defended liberal democracy. It organized meetings to condemn the antisemitic actions in Germany and the manifestations of extreme-right sentiment then gaining currency in Romanian political life. This created a rift with the major parties of the establishment: the PNL called it a party of \"provocateurs\", whose activity actually \"stokes the right-wing extremist reaction\". In the Assembly, LANC deputy Nichifor Robu was suspended in 1932 for having hit Landau with a chair.\n\nThe PER defied an agreement between other Jewish organizations, over not presenting Jewish candidates in elections of December 1933. Its dissidence was met with anger in other community circles, and a scuffle erupted between PER supporters and their assimilationist candidates in the city of Galați. At the time, the UER called on Jewish voters to support those parties that defended \"constitutional order through the cooperation in harmony of all citizens [...], without barriers of race or creed\". A powerful setback followed: winning 1.29% of the vote, the PER lost all its seats in parliament. This fall was attributed by the party itself to the machinations of PNL Prime Minister Ion G. Duca, but may in fact have been a perverse effect of antisemitism: many Jews followed the UER stance and voted for non-Jewish democratic parties, in hopes of keeping the far-right out of parliament. Another contributing factor was the growing number of minority voters who were disenfranchised by the successive governments: 120,000 to 135,000 Jewish men were reportedly stripped of their right to vote between 1920 and 1935.\n\nThese issues highlighted the political work of Zionist radicals. In 1935, the PER, alongside the PNȚ and the Social Democrats, was approached by the illegal Romanian Communist Party (PCR) with an offer to form an antifascist \"popular front\", but the negotiations stalled. The Siguranța secret police followed Zissu, who had returned from an extended stay in Berlin, as he resumed contacts with the \"Renașterea Noastră\" group and discussed sponsoring them.\nOn January 26, 1936, the PER agreed to sign a pact of collaboration with the UER, together forming the Central Council of Romanian Jews (\"Consiliul Central al Evreilor din România\", CCER), which fought in defense of Jewish rights and against antisemitic actions. The CCER did not represent \"a third organization—added to or supplanting [the PER and UER]—nor a single body resulting from their fusion\", and declared itself apolitical, committed to the defense Jews \"within the framework of organic laws\". In its appeal to the Romanian nation, it excoriated the tenets of economic antisemitism, citing data which showed that Jews were a minority in enviable professions, and that, statistically, they were similarly exposed to the problems of the Great Depression, including homelessness and malnutrition. The CCER also defended itself against claims that it was stoking antisemitism, dismissing them as \"cynical, with the purpose of making victims into culprits.\"\n\nRunning on its own lists in the December 1937 election, the PER won 1.42% of the vote, again below the electoral threshold. The only parliamentarian still representing Jews was Rabbi Jacob Itzhak Niemirower, who held a supplementary seat in Senate. He was twice physically assaulted by LANC militants. Weissman himself briefly left the PER, heading the Revisionist list in elections for representatives to the Twentieth Zionist Congress.\n\nThe Jewish Party was touched by the antisemitic laws first reintroduced by the National Christian Party (PNC) government in 1937. Weissman, by then the PER's vice president, was suspended from the bar association, following a review of his Romanian citizenship, with some 30% of the Romanian Jews being eventually stripped of their citizenship rights. The PER was again drawn into cooperation with the UER, issuing common protests against the measure, and reestablishing the CCER. It intensified support for emigration into Palestine, and organized the \"Totzeret Haaretz\" campaign (preferential imports from Palestine, and a boycott of Romanian merchandise). The latter policy, thought of by Filderman, effectively toppled the PNC cabinet in February 1938, but could not overturn antisemitic laws.\n\nThe PER, along with all other parties extant in Romania, was dissolved by King Carol II when he established the National Renaissance Front (FRN) on March 30, 1938. Jews were banned from either joining the FRN or creating their own parties. EZNSz/UNET created an apolitical, regional, replacement for the PER. Called Social Zionist Council (\"Consiliul Sionist Social\"), it grouped together the Fischers and other former party members. It continued to exist until the Second Vienna Award, when Northern Transylvania was ceded by Romania to Hungary; it was banned in September 1940.\n\nTivadar Fischer, József Fischer, and Marton remained on Hungarian territory. In 1944, they were moved into Kolozsvár Ghetto, where the former two functioned as \"Judenrat\" members, answering to Rudolf Kastner (Fischer's son-in-law) and Dieter Wisliceny. Marton also stayed behind in Cluj, writing works which looked beyond fascism to a future \"new Emancipation\". The party was decimated by the Nazis, with all three of its Năsăud candidates in the 1931 election being killed in extermination camps. The Fischers were among the 300 Jews for whom Kastner obtained a reprieve from extermination at Auschwitz. They were instead transported by the Nazis to Bergen-Belsen, and subsequently allowed to leave for Switzerland.\n\nOther former party cells existed in Nazi-aligned Romania, where FRN officials allowed Weissman and Singer to canvass for the Jewish National Fund, and set up a Zionist Union dedicated to the emigration project. Under Ion Antonescu, the Romanian government began confiscations of Jewish property and, after the start of Operation Barbarossa, their deportation into the Transnistria Governorate. Opposing the collaborationist Central Jewish Office, both Zissu and his Zionist rival, Mișu Benvenisti, spent terms in Romanian concentration camps. The elderly Diamant stayed behind in Soviet-occupied Bukovina after 1940. He was deported to the Gulag, where he died some time after. Reifer, fearing fascism, had also opted to remain in Soviet territory, where he only narrowly escaped Diamant's plight. He was also arrested by the returning Romanians and sent to Transnistria; he eventually fled to Palestine.\n\nBy 1943, after establishing direct contacts with the bureaucrat Mihai Antonescu, Zissu obtained from the regime that Jews be allowed to leave for Palestine, as an alternative to deportation. He helped organize the sea transports through to Turkey and Palestine, and resumed contacts with Marton, together with whom he helped smuggle in Hungarian Jews. At odds with Filderman and with many of the Yishuv sponsors, he gathered crucial support from the Zionist resistance organizer, Shaike Dan Trachtenberg. In all, Zissu claimed to have personally rescued some 14,000 Jews in this manner, and was credited with fitting at least seven individual transports, including the ill-fated \"Mefküre\".\n\nRe-founded, with Zissu as president, on September 18, 1944, days after the fall of Antonescu, the PER was still organizing itself a year later. Its new opponents by then were the governing and expansive PCR and its Jewish Democratic Committee (CDE), part of the National Democratic Front. Zissu initially \"hoped for a truly democratic change in Romania, as the one chance for Jews to obtain citizenship rights\". Confronted with communization, he sketched out a two-stage plan for the Jewish community: a short-term recognition for the Jews as a distinct ethnic minority; later, its mass emigration to Palestine. This policy was rejected outright by Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa, the Minister for Minorities, who refused to award ethnic recognition to the Jews and, the PER suspected, blocked out pledges of financial support for Holocaust survivors. At the time, Zissu was denigrated in the PCR and CDE press.\n\nThe PER developed its own moderate wing, which looked more favorably on cooperation between Zionism and communism. On July 21, 1946, Zissu resigned from the PER presidency (being followed shortly after by the group's general secretary, Moți (or Motti) Moscovici); he was later forced out from the Zionist Executive by a cartel of CDE and Ihud members. The PER was then attracted, with the Ihud, into the Jewish Representation, running in the election of 1946 as a proxy of the National Democratic Front. Its main candidate was P. Rohrlich, of Botoșani County. On the campaign trail, communist leaders embraced Zionist slogans, with Vasile Luca declaring himself favorable to a Jewish state, when addressing an all-Jewish audience, and the official newspaper \"Timpul\" hosting reportage pieces about Jewish life in Palestine. During the race, an independent, religious Zionism was only represented by Mizrachi.\n\nThe PER failed to get any of its candidates elected, its votes having only helped CDE candidates. In the post-election interval, the PER returned to anti-communism. Shortly before the eruption of a civil war in Palestine, Siguranța men reported that Zissu still directed the PER from the shadows, noting his Revisionist, anti-British, stance and his support of \"terrorist action\" in Palestine. In March 1947, Benvenisti, who was Zissu's replacement, made a show of his own disappointment with the National Democratic Front government, accusing Prime Minister Petru Groza of tolerating antisemitism.\n\nIn summer 1948, following the onset of a Romanian communist regime, all the Zionist organizations were shut down. A few months later, a propaganda and intimidation campaign was taken up by the CDE and the PCR. There followed clashes between the pro-communists and religious groups such as the Bnei Akiva, which led to the Zionist issue being assigned directly to the Securitate secret police. In 1950, there were mass arrests of the Zionist militants, followed by their torturing and nine separate waves of show trials. One of these was a trial of thirteen Zionist leaders, including Zissu, Benvenisti, and Moscovici. Meanwhile, Marton, praised for his humanitarian work with deportees regaining republican Hungary, began putting out a new edition of \"Új Kelet\" from his new home in Palestine.\n\n"}
{"id": "2515352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2515352", "title": "Koliyivshchyna", "text": "Koliyivshchyna\n\nKoliyivshchyna (, ) was a major haidamaka rebellion that broke out in Right-bank Ukraine in June 1768, caused by the dissatisfaction of the peasants because of the serfdom oppression, the anti-nobility and anti-Polish moods among the Cossacks and peasants. The uprising was accompanied by violence against Poles, Jews and Roman Catholic and Uniate clergy, culminating in the massacre of Uman . The number of victims is estimated from 100,000 to 200,000\n\nThe origin of the word is not certain. Itself the word similar to Ukrainian word which means \"impaling\".\n\nOn the other hand, it could be an adaptation of the Polish words \"kolej\", \"kolejno\", \"po kolei\", which implies \"służba kolejna\" (patrolling service) so called Cossack militia on a service of aristocrats (magnate). To that etymology point such historians like Władysław Andrzej Serczyk and Volodymyr Shcherbyna.\n\nIt was simultaneous to the Confederation of Bar which originated out of the adjacent region in the city of Bar (historical Podolia) and was a \"de facto\" civil war in Poland.\n\nThe rebellion was fueled by the circulation of a fictitious proclamation of support and call to arms by Russia's Empress Catherine II, the so called \"Golden Charter\". Mostly based on rumors, the charter however had a real foundation and was connected with the Catherinian rescript that in 1765 she issued it to Archimandrite Melkhisedek and obligated the Russian ambassador in Warsaw to facilitate assertion of rights and privileges of the Right-bank Ukraine Orthodox confession. It should be noted that in 1764, on territory of the Zaporizhian Host of Right-bank Ukraine and along the southern borders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian Empire created New Russia Governorate in place of previously existing New Serbia province and was intensively militarised.\n\nPreparation to uprising and the initial raid of the Cossack detachment of Maksym Zalizniak started at the Motrynine Saint Trinity Monastery (today a covenant in Chyhyryn Raion), a hegumen of which was Archimandrite Melkhisedek (Znachko-Yavorsky) who also served as the director of all Orthodox monasteries and churches in the Right-bank Ukraine (in 1761-1768).\n\nThe peasant rebellion quickly gained momentum and spread over the territory from the right bank of the Dnieper River to the river Syan. At Uman it led to a big massacre. Poles, Jews and Uniates were herded into their churches and synagogues and killed in cold blood. \n\nIn three weeks of unbridled violence the rebels slaughtered 20,000 people, according to numerous Polish sources. The leaders of the uprising were Cossacks Maksym Zalizniak and Ivan Gonta. While being the commander of the Potocki's private Uman city Cossack militia garrison, the latter joined Zalizniak at Uman after being despatched by Polish Count Franciszek Salezy Potocki to protect it.\n\nEventually the uprising was crushed by Russian troops, aided by Polish army. Both its leaders were arrested by the Russian troops on 7 July 1768. Ivan Gonta was handed over to Polish authorities who tortured him to death, while Maksym Zalizniak was exiled to Siberia.

{"id": "49367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49367", "title": "Laurent-Désiré Kabila", "text": "Laurent-Désiré Kabila\n\nLaurent-Désiré Kabila (November 27, 1939 – January 16, 2001), or simply Laurent Kabila ( ), was a Congolese revolutionary and politician who served as the third President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from May 17, 1997, when he overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko, until his assassination by one of his bodyguards on January 16, 2001. He was succeeded eight days later by his son Joseph.\n\nKabila was born to a member of the Luba people in Baudoinville, Katanga Province, (now Moba, Tanganyika Province) in the Belgian Congo. His father was a Luba and his mother was a Lunda. It is claimed that he studied abroad (political philosophy in Paris, got a PhD in Tashkent, in Belgrade and at last in Dar es Salaam) but no proof has been found or provided.\n\nShortly after the Congo achieved independence in 1960, Katanga seceded under the leadership of Moïse Tshombe. Kabila organised the Baluba in an anti-secessionist rebellion in Manono. In September 1962 a new province, North Katanga, was established, and he became a member of the provincial assembly and served as chief of cabinet for Minister of Information Ferdinand Tumba. In September 1963 he and other young members of the assembly were forced to resign, facing allegations of communist sympathies.\n\nKabila established himself as a supporter of hard-line Lumumbist Prosper Mwamba Ilunga. When the Lumumbists formed the Conseil National de Libération, he was sent to eastern Congo to help organize a revolution, in particular in the Kivu and North Katanga provinces. In 1965, Kabila set up a cross-border rebel operation from Kigoma, Tanzania, across Lake Tanganyika.\n\nChe Guevara assisted Kabila for a short time in 1965. Guevara had appeared in the Congo with approximately 100 men who planned to bring about a Cuban-style revolution. Guevara judged Kabila (then 26) as \"not the man of the hour\" he had alluded to, being too distracted. This, in Guevara's opinion, accounted for Kabila showing up days late at times to provide supplies, aid, or backup to Guevara's men. The lack of cooperation between Kabila and Guevara contributed to the suppression of the revolt that same year.\n\nIn Guevara's view, of all of the people he met during his campaign in Congo, only Kabila had \"genuine qualities of a mass leader\"; but Guevara castigated Kabila for a lack of \"revolutionary seriousness\". After the failure of the rebellion, Kabila turned to smuggling gold and timber on Lake Tanganyika. He also ran a bar and brothel in Tanzania.\n\nIn 1967, Kabila and his remnant of supporters moved their operation into the mountainous Fizi – Baraka area of South Kivu in the Congo, and founded the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP). With the support of the People's Republic of China, the PRP created a secessionist Marxist state in South Kivu province, west of Lake Tanganyika.\n\nThe PRP state came to an end in 1988 and Kabila disappeared and was widely believed to be dead. While in Kampala, Kabila reportedly met Yoweri Museveni, the future president of Uganda. Museveni and former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere later introduced Kabila to Paul Kagame, who would become president of Rwanda. These personal contacts became vital in mid-1990s, when Uganda and Rwanda sought a Congolese face for their intervention in Zaire.\n\nKabila returned in October 1996, leading ethnic Tutsis from South Kivu against Hutu forces, marking the beginning of the First Congo War. With support from Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, Kabila pushed his forces into a full-scale rebellion against Mobutu as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL). He used children in the conflict and it was estimated that up to 10,000 children served under him.\n\nBy mid-1997, the ADFL had almost completely overrun the country and the remains of Mobutu's army. Only the country's decrepit infrastructure slowed Kabila's forces down; in many areas, the only means of transit were irregularly used dirt paths. Following failed peace talks held on board of the South African ship SAS \"Outeniqua\", Mobutu fled into exile on 16 May.\n\nThe next day, from his base in Lubumbashi, Kabila proclaimed himself president. Kabila suspended the Constitution, and changed the name of the country from Zaire to the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the country's official name from 1964 to 1971. He made his grand entrance into Kinshasa on 20 May and was sworn in on 31 May, officially commencing his term as president.\n\nKabila had been a committed Marxist, but his policies at this point were a mix of capitalism and collectivism. He declared that elections would not be held for two years, since it would take him at least that long to restore order. While some in the West hailed Kabila as representing a \"new breed\" of African leadership, critics charged that Kabila's policies differed little from his predecessor's, being characterised by authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights abuses. As early as late 1997, Kabila was being denounced as \"another Mobutu\".\n\nKabila was also accused of self-aggrandizing tendencies, including trying to set up a personality cult, with the help of Mobutu's former minister of information, Dominique Sakombi Inongo. Sakombi Inongo branded Kabila as \"the Mzee\", and posters reading \"Here is the man we needed\" () appeared all over the country.\n\nBy 1998, Kabila's former allies in Uganda and Rwanda had turned against him and backed a new rebellion of the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD), the Second Congo War. Kabila found new allies in Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, and managed to hold on in the south and west of the country and by July 1999, peace talks led to the withdrawal of most foreign forces.\n\nOn the afternoon of 16 January 2001 Kabila was shot by his bodyguard, Rashidi Muzele, who was killed as he attempted to flee the scene at Kabila's Palais de Marbre residence. According to a Rwandan former intelligence chief and allegations made by government officials, his assassination was committed by some of his bodyguards and masterminded by Rwanda. According to the documentary film \"Murder in Kinshasa\", made by Marlène Rabaud and Arnaud Zajtman, a Lebanese diamond dealer allegedly organized the logistics of the assassination.\n\nThe DRC's authorities managed to keep power, despite Kabila's assassination. The exact circumstances are still disputed. Kabila reportedly died on the spot, according to DRC's then health minister Leonard Mashako Mamba, who was in the next door office when Kabila was shot and arrived immediately after the assassination. The government claimed that Kabila was still alive, however, when he was flown to a hospital in Zimbabwe after he was shot so that DRC authorities could organize the tense succession.\n\nThe Congolese government announced that he had died of his wounds on 18 January. One week later, his body was returned to Congo for a state funeral and his son, Joseph Kabila, became president ten days later. By doing so, DRC officials were accomplishing the \"verbal testimony\" of the deceased President. Then Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo and Laurent-Désiré Kabila's aide-de-camp Eddy Kapend have reported that Laurent Kabila had told them that his son Joseph, then number two of the army, should take over, if Laurent-Désiré Kabila were to die in office.\n\nThe investigation into Kabila's assassination led to 135 people – including 4 children – being tried before a special military tribunal. The alleged ringleader, Colonel Eddy Kapend (one of Kabila's cousins), and 25 others were sentenced to death in January 2003, but not executed. Of the other defendants 64 were jailed, with sentences from six months to life, and 45 were exonerated. Some individuals were also accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow his son. Among them was Kabila's special advisor Emmanuel Dungia, former ambassador to South Africa. Many people believe the trial was flawed and the convicted defendants are innocent.\n\n"}

{"id": "3408056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3408056", "title": "Manchester Liberalism", "text": "Manchester Liberalism\n\nManchester Liberalism, Manchester School, Manchester Capitalism and Manchesterism are terms for the political, economic and social movements of the 19th century that originated in Manchester, England. Led by Richard Cobden and John Bright, it won a wide hearing for its argument that free trade would lead to a more equitable society, making essential products available to all. Its most famous activity was the Anti-Corn Law League that called for repeal of the Corn Laws that kept food prices high. It expounded the social and economic implications of free trade and \"laissez-faire\" capitalism. The Manchester School took the theories of economic liberalism advocated by classical economists such as Adam Smith and made them the basis for government policy. It also promoted pacifism, anti-slavery, freedom of the press and separation of church and state.\n\nManchester was the hub of the world's textile manufacturing industry, and had a large population of factory workers who were disadvantaged by the Corn Laws, the protectionist policy that imposed tariffs on imported wheat and therefore increased the price of food. The Corn Laws were supported by the land-owning aristocracy because they reduced foreign competition and allowed landowners to keep grain prices high. That increased the profits from agriculture as the population expanded. However, the operation of the Corn Laws meant that factory workers in the textile mills of northern England were faced with increasing food prices. In turn, mill owners had to pay higher wages, which meant that the price of finished goods was higher and the foreign trade competitiveness of their products was reduced.\n\nMercantilism holds that a country’s prosperity is dependent on large exports, but limited imports of goods. At the beginning of the 19th century, trade in Britain was still subject to import quotas, price ceilings and other state interventions. That led to shortages of certain goods in British markets, in particular corn (grains usually requiring grinding, most often, but not always wheat).\n\nManchester became the headquarters of the Anti-Corn Law League from 1839. The League campaigned against the Corn Laws, which it said would reduce food prices and increase the competitiveness of manufactured goods abroad. Manchester Liberalism grew out of that movement. That has led to the situation seen in modern Britain, where the country has become dependent upon imported food as part of a globalised interdependence.\n\nManchester Liberalism has a theoretical basis in the writings of Adam Smith, David Hume and Jean-Baptiste Say.\n\nThe great champions of the Manchester School were Richard Cobden and John Bright. As well as being advocates of free trade, they were radical opponents of war and imperialism, and proponents of peaceful relations between peoples. The \"Little Englander\" movement saw little benefit in paying taxes to defend colonies such as Canada, which contributed little trade to Manchester manufacturers and could not supply their main raw material of cotton. Manchesterism can therefore be seen as a belief in free and consensual relations amongst individuals and groups at all levels. Cobden's efforts to promote free trade were always subordinate to what he deemed the highest moral purpose, i.e. the promotion of peace on earth and goodwill among men.\n\nIn March 1848, Conservative Benjamin Disraeli first used the term \"the School of Manchester\". According to historian Ralph Raico and as indicated by the German liberal Julius Faucher in 1870, the term \"Manchesterism\" was invented by Ferdinand Lassalle (the founder of German socialism) and was meant as an abusive term.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1233715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1233715", "title": "Median voter theorem", "text": "Median voter theorem\n\nThe median voter theorem states that \"a majority rule voting system will select the outcome most preferred by the median voter\".\n\nThe median voter theorem rests on two main assumptions, with several others detailed below. First, the theorem assumes that voters can place all election alternatives along a one-dimensional political spectrum. It seems plausible that voters could do this if they can clearly place political candidates on a left-to-right continuum, but this is often not the case as each party will have its own policy on each of many different issues. Similarly, in the case of a referendum, the alternatives on offer may cover more than one issue. Second, the theorem assumes that voters' preferences are single-peaked, which means that voters have one alternative that they favor more than any other. It also assumes that voters always vote, regardless of how far the alternatives are from their own views. The median voter theorem implies that voters have an incentive to vote for their true preferences. Finally, the median voter theorem applies best to a majoritarian election system.\n\nFor the median voter theorem to be successful, there is a total of seven assumptions that are made, and each includes exceptions for when politicians decide to move away from the median voter:\n\nAs mentioned above, (1) the first assumption is that there is single-dimensional voting. Put simply, this means that there is only one issue that is being voted on at a time. Additionally, it is assumed that (2) voters' preferences are single-peaked, which is just the notion that people's preferences are a spectrum of utility, with the strongest preference at the maximum (see figures to the right). This assumption is critical because it prevents a phenomenon called \"cycling\" which is detailed below. The third assumption (3) is that voters are only choosing between two options. This is important because when there are more than two choices for voters, the median voter may not have voted for the most popular option. For example, in a population of 100 people voting between A, B, and C imagine 33 people vote for A, 33 people vote for B, and 34 people vote for C. Assuming A, B, and C lie on a spectrum (i.e. a scale from liberal to neutral to conservative) the median voter would have voted for B even though choice C was the most popular. If each choice is a candidate, and all three start at the median, any slight move captures the entire voting group on that end of the spectrum. No equilibrium exists in this situation, because every candidate has the incentive to move across the ideological spectrum based on the positions of their competitors. The fourth assumption (4) is that there is no ideology or influence with regards to the voting options. Essentially, this means that politicians only care about maximizing votes, not necessarily sticking true to their beliefs. In reality, this ignores politician’s ability to change voters’ ideologies to mirror their own. Additionally, career politicians may purposely take positions away from the ideological center in order to gain favor with specific voting bases. The fifth assumption (5) is that there is no selective voting and all eligible voters for an election will turn out to vote. The sixth assumption (6) says that money and lobbying have no effect on elections because introducing these incentives can dramatically change voting patterns. In reality, money is one of many variables that contribute to the outcome of elections. The theorem ignores the fact that politicians sometimes take positions with the primary goal of raising money for their campaigns. Political contributions can be used for advertising and campaign trips, and gaining monetary support may require moving away from the median. The final assumption (7) is the notion that all parties of elections have full information. This means that voters have knowledge on the issues, candidates have knowledge on the issues, and candidates have knowledge on voter preferences.\n\nTo appreciate the logic of the median voter model, consider a setting where three individuals, Al, Bob, and Charlie, are to choose a restaurant for lunch. Al prefers a restaurant where lunch costs $5, Bob favors somewhat better fare at a restaurant serving $10 lunches, and Charlie wants a gourmet restaurant where lunch will cost around $20. Bob can be said to be the median voter, because there are exactly the same number of people who prefer a more expensive restaurant than Bob as there are who prefer a less expensive restaurant than Bob: here one each. For convenience assume that, given any two options, each member of the lunch group prefers restaurants with prices closer to their preferred restaurant to those that are farther from it. Now consider some majority decisions over alternative restaurants:\n\nThe weak form of the median voter theorem says the median voter always casts his or her vote for the policy that is adopted. Note that Bob always votes in favor of the outcome that wins the election. Note also that Bob's preferred $10 restaurant will defeat any other. If there is a median voter, his or her preferred policy will beat any other alternative in a pairwise vote. (The median voter's ideal point is always a Condorcet winner.) Consequently, once the median voter's preferred outcome is reached, it cannot be defeated by another in a pairwise majoritarian election. The strong form of the median voter theorem says the median voter always gets his or hers most preferred policy.\n\nThe median voter theorem seems to explain some of the things that happen in majoritarian voting systems. First, it may explain why politicians tend to adopt similar platforms and campaign rhetoric. In order to win the majority vote, politicians must tailor their platforms to the median voter. For example, in the United States, the Democratic and Republican candidates typically move their campaign platforms towards the middle during congressional election campaigns. Just as sellers in a free market try to win over their competitors' customers by making slight changes to improve their products, so too do politicians deviate only slightly from their opponent's platform so as to gain votes.\n\nSecond, the median voter theorem reflects that radical candidates or parties rarely get elected. For example, a politician or party which is at an extreme end of the political spectrum will usually not get nearly as many votes as a more moderate party. Finally, the theorem may explain why two major political parties tend to emerge in majoritarian voting systems (Duverger's law). In the United States there are countless political parties, but only two established major parties play a part in almost every major election: the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the median voter theorem third parties will rarely, if ever, win elections for the same reason why extreme candidates do not tend to win. The major parties tend to co-opt the platforms of the minor parties in order to secure more votes. In many other long-established democratic countries there are several parties who each get a substantial share of the vote, although most of these have some form of proportional representation.\n\nWhile the median voter theorem traditionally applies to direct democracy, in reality most nations function as some sort of representative democracy. An adjusted version of the theorem suggests that, in representative democracy, politicians legislate and execute the laws based on the preferences of the median voter.\n\nConsider the example in the Figure to the right of two politicians, Hillary and Donny, who initially hold different views about what percentage of federal government spending should be dedicated to entitlement programs. While Hillary wants to increase the current amount by 25%, Donny represents supporters who want to see a decrease of 25%. Meanwhile, the median voter prefers that entitlement spending remain the same. To capture some of Donny's voters, Hillary decides that she will now campaign on a spending increase of 10%. To prevent her from gaining an electoral advantage, Donny counters by advocating for a 5% decrease in spending. This cycle continues until both candidates arrive at the outcome preferred by the median voter. Politicians have the incentive to reach this position because, if they don’t, they risk allowing their opponents to capture additional voters.\n\nIn his 1929 paper titled \"Stability in Competition\", Harold Hotelling notes in passing that political candidates' platforms seem to converge during majoritarian elections. Hotelling compared political elections to businesses in the private sector. He postulated that just as there is often not much difference between the products of different competing companies, so, too, there is not a stark contrast between electoral platforms of different parties. This is because politicians, just like salesmen with consumers, seek to capture the majority of voters. Duncan Black, in his 1948 paper titled \"On the Rationale of Group Decision-making\", provided a formal analysis of majority voting that made the theorem and its assumptions explicit. Black wrote that he saw a large gap in economic theory concerning how voting determines the outcome of decisions, including political decisions. Black's paper thus triggered research on how economics can explain voting systems. In 1957 with his paper titled \"An Economic Theory of Political Action in Democracy\", Anthony Downs expounded upon the median voter theorem.\n\nSeveral important economic studies strongly support the median voter theorem. For example, Holcombe analyzes the Bowen equilibrium level of education expenditures for 257 Michigan school districts and finds that the actual expenditures are only about 3% away from the estimated district average. Fujiwara also supported the theorem through his study of the 1998 Brazil general elections. He analysed the effect of an exogenous increase in the voter base on the policies implemented by the subsequent government chosen through the introduction of EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines), which enabled a large section of the less educated communities to cast their vote. The outcome of this election was an increase in policies targeted at issues affecting these communities, specifically healthcare. Thus, Fujiwara’s conclusions show that an increase in voter base shifted the median voter, and hence the middle ground for politicians, to a stance more favourable to the new total voter base, indicating that the voters do have a say in the policies implemented by candidates.\n\nThe theorem also explains the rise in government redistribution programs over the past few decades. Thomas Husted and Lawrence W. Kenny examined growth of redistribution programs especially between the years of 1950 and 1988. Tom Rice also writes that voters with the median income will take advantage of their status as deciders by electing politicians who will tax those who are earning more than the median voter, and then redistribute the money, including to those who are at the median. More specifically, Rice demonstrates that if a systematic closing of the gap between the median and mean income levels in the United States could be shown, more credibility could be given to the median voter theorem. Until the mid-1960s, Rice says that the gap between median and mean income levels tightened. Three main forces served to tighten this gap. First, the strength of the Democratic Party in the United States Congress in the decades leading up to the 1960s, as Democrats are more disposed to redistribution of wealth. Second, increased turnout at the polls, just as Husted and Kenny postulated, tightened the gap because an increase in voters means more individuals of lower income are voting. Finally, since unemployment, which causes median income families to fall below the median income, was relatively low compared to after the 1960s, this tightened the gap.\n\nHow do we choose the best outcome from an election for society? This question is the root of the median voter theorem and provides the basis for how and why this theorem was created. It starts with the idea of a \"social decision rule.\" Essentially, this is a tool that is used to aggregate preferences of all members of society that, ultimately, provides a clear-cut and consistent answer for what outcome is most preferred. This choice rests on three main principles that allow the most preferred social choice to be salient. The first (1) is weak Pareto efficiency or unanimity. This is the idea that if all voters prefers one choice to all other choices, the social decision should reflect this and this option will be the outcome. The second principle (2) is a concept called transitivity, which is analogous to the mathematical property. This phenomenon simply means that if option A is preferred to option B, and option B is preferred to option C, then option A is preferred to option C. The final principle (3) is the idea of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). This suggests that if something is not relevant to the election or the issues involved, then it should not affect the outcome or results. For example, imagine there is a vote for the Most Valuable Player in a baseball league and player A has the most votes, player B has the second most and player C has the third most. Now, say, player C is disqualified for cheating - this should not change the outcome of the vote. If the voting system was set up in a way in which aggregate votes are shifted and player B ends up with more votes, this is not a consistent aggregation method.\n\nIf any of the above-mentioned principles is violated, it could result in cycling. Cycling happens when there is no clear winner from a majority vote that results in a constant cycle of trying to determine which outcome is most preferred. This is a crucial concept because it exposes how majority voting in general and the median voter theorem can fail when assumptions are not met. There are several more failures that come about from this model that stem from this phenomenon.\n\nWith the difficulties associated with aggregating society's preferences, what are some alternatives that can be considered? Potentially, members of society could simply vote for their first choice rather than rank their preferences. Alternatively, there could be weights distributed based on the intensity and passion that members feel for specific issues. Both of these are problematic for several reasons, including the frequent occurrences of ties.\n\nIn 1972, Kenneth Arrow received the Nobel Prize in economics for a theorem based on these challenges with aggregating ranked preferences consistently. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states that there is no general solution to the abstract social choice problem which is based on ranked preferences (although his theorem does not apply to rated scores). Arrow found that the only way for the social choice problem to have any consistent solution is to (1) assume individual preferences fit some particular pattern or (2) impose a dictatorship or (3) accept a rule that violates IIA. The Median voter theorem is an example of option (1).\n\nRestrict preferences to single peaks, meaning that individuals vote on a spectrum and allow the median voter theorem to be implemented naturally.This is essentially the function of the party system mentioned briefly above. Another common solution is to allow people's intensities on issues play a factor in their vote. This is difficult to achieve since both social welfare functions and the Samuelson rule are necessary to calculate.\n\nIn reality, many of the assumptions of this model do not hold. One assumption the theorem makes is that there is only single dimensional voting. This is never true of government representatives - politicians do not only take stances on only one issue but rather several. To test the median voter theorem further, think about the Senate. If the median voter theorem holds, it would mean that the two Senators from a state should vote the same way every time because the median voter in the state would be the voter that chooses the outcome. However, when there is one democratic Senator and one republican, they typically vote opposite to each other, effectively canceling each other's votes.\n\nThe median voter theorem has several limitations. Keith Krehbiel postulates that there are many factors which prevent the political process from reaching maximum efficiency. Just as transaction costs prevent efficiency in market exchanges, the limitations of the majoritarian voting process stop it from reaching optimality. With the median voter theorem in particular, Krehbiel argues that voters' inability to directly amend legislation acts against the theorem. Sometimes, as Krehbiel writes, the policies being voted on are too complex to be placed within a one-dimensional continuum. Buchanan and Tollison also note that this is a problem for the median voter theorem, which assumes that decisions can be made on a one-dimensional field. If voters are considering more than one issue simultaneously, the median voter theorem is inapplicable. This may happen if, for example, voters may vote on a referendum regarding education spending and police spending simultaneously.\n\nLee, Moretti & Butler also show that the theorem does not hold in certain cases. They studied the US Congress to see whether voters were only voting for policies pre-decided by candidates or if they had an actual influence on where candidates stood on various political issues, i.e., made candidates converge. Their empirical evidence showed that voters had little effect on the policy stances taken by candidates, meaning that despite a large exogenous change in the probability a candidate would win an election, their policies remained unchanged. Hence, the median voter theorem, which supports the claim that voters make political candidates converge towards a middle ground, is outweighed by candidates refusing to compromise on their political standpoints.\n\nA larger problem for the median voter theorem, however, is the incentives structure for government representatives. Downs, in \"A Theory of Bureaucracy\", writes that people's decisions are motivated by self-interest, an idea deeply rooted in the writings of Adam Smith. This holds for the government system as well, because it is composed of individuals who are self-interested. One cannot guarantee the degree to which a government representative will be committed to the public good, but it is certain that, to some degree, they will be committed to their own set of goals. These goals can include a desire to serve the public interest, but most often they include the desire for power, income, and prestige. To continue obtaining these things, then, officials must secure re-election. When representatives are constantly focused on becoming re-elected, this distorts the mandate they receive from their constituents: representatives will translate the wishes of their constituents into benefits for themselves. They will tend to vote for short-term policies that they hope will get them reelected.\n\nWhile the median voter outcome simplifies the political process, the question of efficiency still remains. The social efficiency problem is best explained using the following example. Society’s marginal benefit of a public good is calculated by summing all individual marginal benefits:\n\nA town of 1,001 voters wishes to pay for a $40,040 public good by taxing every individual $40. 500 voters decide that they value the new public good at $100 each, while the remaining 501 voters will not contribute any money towards the good. Based on these revealed preferences, the total social benefit (500 * $100 = $50,000) is greater than the previously established cost. While the efficient outcome is to fund the public good, in this scenario the median voter (number 501 in the opposition) is not willing to pay, so the vote fails.\n\nInefficiency in the median voter outcome results from the intensity of preferences. While a large number of people were willing to pay a considerable sum ($100 each) to fund the good, this fact is ultimately irrelevant when the median voter favors the opposite result. In any scenario, intensity of preferences can cause the median voter outcome to be inefficient.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "346703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=346703", "title": "Mexico City policy", "text": "Mexico City policy\n\nThe Mexico City policy, sometimes referred to by critics as the global gag rule, is a United States government policy that blocks U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organizations that provide abortion counselling or referrals, advocate to decriminalize abortion or expand abortion services. The Mexico City Policy is a U.S. government policy that – when in effect – has required foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to certify that they will not \"perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning\" with non-U.S. funds as a condition for receiving U.S. global family planning assistance and, as of January 23, 2017, any other U.S. global health assistance, including U.S. global HIV (under PEPFAR) and maternal and child health (MCH) assistance.\n\nFirst implemented in 1984 by the Reagan Administration, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has enforced the policy during all subsequent Republican Administrations, and rescinded the policy at the direction of all Democratic Administrations. The on-again, off-again history of the policy along party lines is indicative that the issue is a political flashpoint in the abortion debate in the United States. After its initial enactment by President Reagan in 1984, it was rescinded by Democratic President Bill Clinton in January 1993, then re-instituted in January 2001 as Republican President George W. Bush took office, rescinded on January 23, 2009, as Democratic President Barack Obama took office and reinstated on January 23, 2017, as Republican President Donald Trump assumed the office.\n\nThe policy requires non-governmental organizations to \"agree as a condition of their receipt of [U.S.] federal funds\" that they would \"neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations\". The policy has exceptions for abortions done in response to rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions.\n\nThe policy has significant impacts internationally. All NGO's, Non Government Agencies, internationally, regionally and locally in other countries that receive United States aid cannot \"directly or indirectly\" offer abortion as a course of family planning. This includes but is not restricted to, \"providing advice and information about or offering referral for abortion, even if it is legal in said country\", \"promote changes in a country's laws or policies related to abortion as a method of family planning\", or \"conducting public information campaigns about abortion as a method of family planning\". The policy doesn't prohibit international NGO's from providing advice, a referral, or performing an abortion if the pregnancy causes a severe risk to the life of the mother or was a result of incest or rape. It is also possible for these international NGO's to answer questions about an abortion if the woman makes it clear she has decided to have a safe, legal abortion. This only applies if the country the woman is living in has abortion rights laws and the information is given \"passively\" instead of providing the information as \"medically appropriate\".\n\nNamed for Mexico City, the venue of the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development where it was announced, the policy was instituted by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The final language of the 1984 policy was negotiated by the deputy chairman of the U.S. delegation, Alan Keyes, then an Assistant Secretary of State.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Mexico City policy, organizations were required to meet its specified conditions in order to be eligible for federal funding from the United States, and as a result, several international abortion agencies no longer received a portion of their funds from this source. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) did not alter its operation and lost more than 20% of its total funding. Other family planning organizations, such as the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia and the Planned Parenthood Association of Zambia, likewise did not make the changes required by the Mexico City policy and had their funding cut. NGOs in Romania and Colombia adapted to the new U.S. guidelines and continued to qualify for federal funding.\n\nIn 1987 and 1988, the policy was challenged by two U.S. Appeals court rulings in \"DKT Memorial Fund Ltd. vs. USAID\", involving Phil Harvey and two foreign NGOs, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v. USAID\". Ultimately, the two court rulings contributed to the policy being used only against foreign NGOs, while not invoked against U.S. NGOs.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton rescinded the Mexico City policy on January 22, 1993. He referred to the policy as being \"excessively broad\" and stated that it had \"undermined efforts to promote safe and efficacious family planning programs in foreign nations\". On January 22, 2001, President George W. Bush reinstated the policy by executive order, stating, \"It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad. It is therefore my belief that the Mexico City Policy should be restored\". In September 2007, Barbara Boxer, a Senator from California, created an amendment designed to lift the funding conditions put in place by the Mexico City policy. It passed by a vote of 53–41. President Bush promised to veto any legislation which would eliminate the Mexico City policy. The policy was rescinded again by President Barack Obama on January 23, 2009, and further reinstated on January 23, 2017 by President Donald Trump. Trump not only reinstated the policy but expanded it, making it cover all global health organizations that receive U.S. government funding, rather than only family planning organizations that do, as was previously the case. This includes offices such as, USAID, the Department of State, Global Aids Coordinator, Center of Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Health, and Department of Defense.\n\nThe nature of the policy has implications for organizations in certain countries such as South Africa. Even if these organizations support the policy itself, it is illegal for them not to inform a woman seeking an abortion of her rights, and/or refer her to a facility where she may have an abortion. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was excluded from the Mexico City policy under the George W. Bush administration, but has not been excluded since the Mexico City policy was reinstated on Jan 23, 2017.\n\nIn May 2017, Rex Tillerson announced an expansion of the policy:\n\nThe policy originally enacted from 1984 to 1993 spoke to abortion only, not family planning in general. However, in 2001, the policy was re-implemented and expanded to cover all voluntary family planning activities, and critics began to refer to it as the \"global gag rule.\" These critics argue that the policy not only reduces the overall funding provided to particular NGOs, it closes off their access to USAID-supplied condoms and other forms of contraception. This, they argue, negatively impacts the ability of these NGOs to distribute birth control, leading to a downturn in contraceptive use and from there to an increase in the rates of unintended pregnancies and abortion. A study of nations in sub-Saharan Africa suggests that unintended pregnancies increased and abortions approximately doubled while the policy was in effect. Critics also argue that the ban promotes restrictions on free speech as well as restrictions on accurate medical information.\nThe European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development presented a petition to the United States Congress signed by 233 members condemning the policy. The forum has stated that the policy \"undermines internationally agreed consensus and goals\".\n\nSupporters of the policy have argued, using the example of the Philippines, that the ban prevents overseas health organizations from using U.S. government funds to contravene the contraception and abortion laws of the countries in which they operate. Supporters also argue that the policy prevents the health agencies from promoting abortion at the expense of other birth control methods.\n\nPresident Obama in his rescinding of the policy on January 23, 2009, had chosen not to act the previous day, the 36th anniversary of the \"Roe v. Wade\" decision and the day of the large March for Life in Washington. Both of Obama's predecessors had taken action on respective January 22nds at the beginnings of their first terms. The Vatican condemned Obama's repeal of the policy almost immediately.\n\nThe Sandbæk Report of the European Union, which calls for the funding of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), was seen by some Catholic commentators as a contrast to the Mexico City policy. The European commissioner Poul Nielson said that the European Union wished to \"fill the decency gap\" left by the Mexico City policy.\n\nThe UNFPA states that it does not \"provide support for abortion services\". Pro-life individuals and organizations have accused the UNFPA of supporting forced abortions by the Chinese government. The Bush administration withheld funding from the agency due to concerns about its alleged involvement. A 2002 U.S. State Department investigation found \"no evidence\" that UNFPA knowingly took part in forced abortions. The organization has stated that it \"has never, and will never, be involved in coercion in China or any part of the world\".\n\nIn 2010, the Harper government in Canada announced a maternal health development aid plan for the upcoming G8 summit which did not include financial support for abortion or contraception, drawing comparisons to the Mexico City policy.\n\nAn episode of the television series \"Boston Legal\", \"Squid Pro Quo\", which originally aired on May 9, 2006, featured a case involving USAID's withdrawal of funding to an overseas non-profit organization.\n\nAn episode of the American television series \"The West Wing\", entitled \"Privateers\", featured a \"gag rule\" amendment of a law for overseas aid.\n\n"}

Organizations like Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting have accused the military industrial media complex of using their media resources to promote militarism, which, according to Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's hypothesis, benefits the defense resources of the company and allows for a controlled narrative of armed conflicts. In this way, media coverage can be manipulated to show increased effectiveness of weapons systems and to avoid covering civilian casualties, or reducing the emphasis on them. Examples of such coverage include that of the Persian Gulf War, NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the Iraq War. It is a common practice by defense contractors and weapons systems manufacturers to hire former military personnel as media spokespersons. In 2008, the New York Times found that aproximately 75 military analysts - many with military industry ties - were being investigated by the Government Accountability Office and other federal organizations for taking part in a years long campaign to influence them into becoming \"surrogates\" for the Bush administration's military policy in the media .\n\nGeneral Electric is a subcontractor for the Tomahawk cruise missile and Patriot II missile, both of which were used extensively during the Persian Gulf War. . General Electric also manufactures components for the B-2 stealth bomber and B-52 bomber and the E-3 AWACS aircraft which were also used extensively during the conflict. During the first Gulf War, General Electric received $2 billion in defense contracts related to weapons which would be used in Gulf War and the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq by Coalition Forces. As FAIR observed, \"when correspondents and paid consultants on NBC television praised the performance of U.S. weapons, they were extolling equipment made by GE, the corporation that pays their salaries.\"\n\nDuring the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, media coverage specifically avoided mentioning civilian casualties, even when mentioning the bombing of civilian targets such as infrastructure. Media coverage relied extensively on official NATO government and military sources for reporting, and repeatedly talked about current and future weaponry of NATO in favorable and expectant terms. \n\nMedia-Military coordination was such that media executives met in the Pentagon with military officials to decide what to cover and how. In 2007, a company named Defense Solutions hired former four-star general and NBC analyst Barry McCaffrey to petition David Petraeus to buy 5000 armored vehicles from Defense Solutions. Subsequently, McCaffrey appeared on CNBC and praised Petraeus. The next month he encouraged congress in public testimony to purchase more armored vehicles, and criticized a plan that would see the purchase of vehicles from a competitor of Defense Solutions . \n\n\n"}

Salazar (born 1973) is a sociocultural anthropologist known for his transdisciplinary work on mobility and travel, the local-to-global nexus, discourses and imaginaries of 'Otherness', heritage, cultural brokering, cosmopolitanism and endurance.\n\nNoel B. Salazar was born in Dunkirk, France, of a Spanish father and a Belgian mother. He grew up in the historical Flemish town of Bruges, a celebrated cultural tourism destination. Salazar studied psychology, philosophy, and development studies at the University of Leuven (Belgium), neuropsychology at the University of Essex (UK), and anthropology and African studies at the University of Pennsylvania (United States). He is currently research professor in anthropology at the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Leuven, where he founded CuMoRe (Cultural Mobilities Research). In addition, he is visiting professor at the University of Bergamo (Italy). His ethnographic fieldwork so far has focused on Indonesia, Tanzania, Chile and Belgium. Salazar currently lives in Brussels, the \"capital of Europe\", together with his spouse and two daughters.\n\nNoel B. Salazar's main research interests include anthropologies of (im)mobility and travel, the local-to-global nexus, discourses and imaginaries of alterity, cultural brokering, cosmopolitanism and endurance. His anthropological work synthesizes ethnographic findings with conceptual frameworks developed within anthropology, sociology, geography, cultural studies, tourism studies, philosophy and psychology. Salazar has won numerous grants for his research projects (including from the National Science Foundation, the EU Seventh Framework Programme, and FWO).\n\nWhile at the University of Pennsylvania, Salazar experienced first-hand the benefits of transdisciplinary research. His involvement within the Department of Anthropology's Public Interest Anthropology project taught him the necessity of bridging the divide between academia and the wider public. Together with archaeologist Benjamin W. Porter, now professor at the Near Eastern Studies Department, UC Berkeley, he applied the public interest perspective to heritage tourism. Understanding the changing meaning and value of (intangible) cultural heritage is still high on his research agenda.\nIt forms part of Salazar's broader work within the subfield of the anthropology of tourism. He uses the findings from his intended ethnographic fieldwork to shift the predominant focus in tourism studies on tourist and impact studies to a study of tourism service providers, showing their crucial role as intermediaries. In his book, \"Envisioning Eden: Mobilizing Imaginaries in Tourism and Beyond\" (2010), he critically analyses the circulation and dynamics of tourism imaginaries, illustrated with ethnographic data from Yogyakarta (Indonesia) and Arusha (Tanzania).\n\nOne of Salazar's key concepts is the one of \"imaginaries\", which he describes as \"culturally shared and socially transmitted representational assemblages that are used as meaning-making devices (mediating how people act, cognize, and value the world)\". He is currently using this concept to research the role of dominant discourses and images of (im)mobility in cultures across the globe. Salazar conceives mobility as a locally circulating socio-cultural construct that positively values the ability to move, the freedom of movement, and the tendency to change easily or quickly. Salazar tries to bridge the academic gap between tourism and migration studies by studying the analytical purchase of (im)mobility as an overarching concept. More concretely, his cultural mobilities research helps us to understand the complex (dis)connections between tourism imaginaries and ideas of transcultural migration. This work happens in close collaboration with established anthropologists such as Nina Glick Schiller (University of Manchester), Nelson H. H. Graburn (University of California, Berkeley) and Alan Smart (University of Calgary).\n\n\n\n\n\nNoel B. Salazar serves on the editorial boards of, among others, \"American Anthropologist\", \"Annals of Tourism Research\", \"Journal of Sustainable Tourism\", \"Transfers\", \nand \"Applied Mobilities\". He is editor of the \"Worlds in Motion Book Series (Berghahn)\" and \nco-editor of the \"Anthropology of Tourism Book Series (Lexington)\". \nFrom 2011 until 2015, he served on the Executive Committee of the European Association of Social Anthropologists. In 2013, Salazar was elected as President of the association. Within EASA, he founded the Anthropology and Mobility Network (AnthroMob). In 2018, he was elected as Secretary-General of the International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences for a five-year period, after having served a five-year term as Vice-President of the organization. Between 2013 and 2018, he was also a member of the Young Academy of Belgium. Salazar regularly travels around the world as a keynote speaker to present his work (in English, Spanish, French and Dutch).\n\nSalazar is a founding member of the American Anthropological Association Anthropology of Tourism Interest Group (USA). From 2012 until 2018, he was chair of the Commission on the Anthropology of Tourism of the International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. He is an expert member of the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Committee and the UNESCO-UNITWIN Network 'Culture, Tourism and Development'. In addition, Salazar is on UNESCO's and UNWTO's official roster of consultants. He has applied his expertise on tour guiding by giving professional tour guide trainings, and this in countries as varied as China, Indonesia, Tanzania, Malawi, and Belgium.\n\n"}
{"id": "15879402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15879402", "title": "Philadelphia Election riot", "text": "Philadelphia Election riot\n\nThe Philadelphia Election Riot in 1742 was a riot occurred due to political disagreements among the constituents of the increasingly diverse population in the city. Politics in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia, had long been dominated by the Quakers but, with their political dominance being increasingly threatened by the predominantly Anglican Proprietary party, tensions grew in the city of Brotherly-Love. The Quakers and Anglicans were predominantly led by Isaac Norris II and William Allen, both of whom were well respected and held significant political power. In an attempt to swing the vote, the Proprietary party \"hired armed sailors\" to disrupt the Quakers who, in their own attempt, were bringing \"unnaturalized Germans from the country to vote\". On voting day, October 1, 1742, violence broke out between the two sides.\n\nThe Quakers had dominated the political landscape of Philadelphia for years and the growing German population seemed to be a means by which they could continue this domination. Realizing this, John Kinsey and, particularly, Isaac Norris II led the Quakers in attempting to convince the Germans to vote along their interests. Attempts to persuade the increasing German population seemed to be paying off, as voter turnout tripled between 1739 and 1740. The German population found the Pacifism of the Quakers attractive, as the former saw it as protection from the draft and high taxes. However, John Isaac also drew the Germans to their cause by making property available to them, in addition to doing regular business with the Germans.\n\nAlthough the Quakers had won the favor of the German citizens, they, like the Anglicans, resented the Germans who had begun migrating to the colony after 1715. By the 1750s the German population of Pennsylvania had increased greatly, with 40% of the colony's constituents being German. Throughout the same decade, the German vote was effectively split and didn't play much of a factor in elections; however, it began to change in the 1760s, when the Propriety party began to recruit the equally disliked Dutch to their side, and the Quakers saw it necessary to double down on their attempts to gain the support of the Germans. The Germans were much more fond of farming than politics, thus, rather than striving to gain political power themselves, they fancied their position as the swing votes, as it ensured that they would benefit from those who needed their support.\n\nFailing to win the favor of the German vote, William Allen and his fellow Anglicans sought to amend the election process by reviving a 1739 election law that provided party-specific election inspectors. In part, this was because of the distrust of the Quakers which derived from their prior electoral day shenanigans. The Quakers, from 1739 to 1741, had taken advantage of the voting process, in which the election official would collect the filled out ballot from the citizen and run it upstairs to the counting area, by blocking the stairs and only allowing favorable ballots through. Allen hoped that the revival of the election law would allow for a fair vote. However the two sides could not agree on the means by which to guarantee a fair election and, as such, the distrust grew between the two sides.\n\nWith election day coming fast, both sides had damning rumors swirling around their base. The Quakers believed that the Anglicans were going to attack the polls with a large number of vigilantes, which they were, as a few dozen sailors had been hired. On the other hand, the Anglicans believed that the Quakers were upping their effort to obstruct the voting officials by bringing even more Germans, which they were, and other citizens who were seen as unqualified to vote.\n\nOn October 1, 1742, the \"Bloody Election\" as scholars refer to it, violence broke out between the Quakers and Proprietary party. The voting was to take place in the \"Market Place\" for the City of Philadelphia and Philadelphia County elections at 9:00 am, and city officials had asked that no weapons be carried due to a fear of violence. At the polls, the two sides debated once more over who should be the inspectors of the election. While the debate was occurring, about fifty to eighty sailors carrying blunt objects, mostly clubs, gathered among the crowd. Just as Isaac Norris II was chosen as an inspector, the mob of sailors violently assaulted the crowd.\n\nEven though the sailors were destroying property and injuring many, when Allen was asked to call the sailors off, he claimed they had as much right to be there as the Dutch and Germans. Eventually, German and Dutch citizens picked up makeshift weapons of their own to beat back the assailant sailors, who retreated to their ships.\n\nWilliam Allen was widely blamed for the riots and, thus, the riot politically benefitted the Quakers, who did better in the coming elections, as the Anglican's Proprietary party lost the election in a landslide. Reports show that many voters had altered their original ballots, crossing out their original vote for the proprietary party and instead voting for the Quaker Party.\n\nFifty-four sailors and party leaders were jailed. Allen, the proprietary leader, in an effort to clear his name, sued one of the Quaker leaders for claiming that Allen had planned to assault. The matter was turned over to the Quaker-led Assembly (over Allen's objections) for investigation. The Assembly cast the investigation as the result of public outcry, when it is likely none truly existed. After questioning 49 witnesses, most of whom were Quakers and including none of the sailors, the Assembly ruled that Allen, his business partner, the mayor and two others (all Anglicans) should be investigated for being negligent in their duties and subverting the Pennsylvania Charter. Allen was ruled the instigator of the riot. After months of investigation, they turned the matter over to the Quaker-controlled Supreme Court.\n\nThe Governor, an Anglican, stated that the city's Mayor's Court had jurisdiction, meaning the Recorder, Alderman and Mayor (all Anglicans) would hear the case. The Assembly protested that the Mayor was one of the accused and would be hearing his own case. Eventually, a Quaker-devised compromise was reached. Charges were withdrawn, as was the original slander suit, and steps were taken to define election procedures and prevent future riots.\n\nThe Philadelphia Election Riot, along with other riots taking place during the same time period in cities like New York and Boston, are important in examining the American Revolution. Riots taking place in these cities represented a radical change in the way that citizens interacted with their government. \"This transformation involved quiescent lower-class elements; the organization of political clubs, caucuses, and tickets; the employment of political literature and inflammatory political rhetoric as never before; the involvement of the clergy and churches in politics; and the organization of mobs and violence for political purposes.\"\n\n"}

The method studies the evolution of policy change, including the evolution of conflicts. The theory suggests that most social systems exist in an extended period of stasis, which are later punctuated by sudden shifts in radical change. The theory was largely inspired from the biological theory of punctuated equilibrium developed by paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould.\n\nThe punctuated equilibrium model of policy change was first presented by Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones in 1993, and has increasingly received attention in historical institutionalism. The model states that policy generally changes only incrementally due to several restraints, namely the \"stickiness\" of institutional cultures, vested interests, and the bounded rationality of individual decision-makers. Policy change will thus be punctuated by changes in these conditions, especially in party control of government, or changes in public opinion. Thus policy is characterized by long periods of stability, punctuated by large—though less frequent—changes due to large shifts in society or government. This has been particularly evident in current trends of environmental and energy policy. Gun control and U.S. federal tobacco policy have also been found to follow punctuated changes. A 2017 study demonstrates that these patterns are also found in policy-making by international organizations, such as the United Nations or the African Union. A recent study by Michael Givel found that despite a significant mobilization to change state tobacco policy, U.S. state tobacco policymaking from 1990 to 2003 was not characterized by punctuated policy change, which also favored the pro-tobacco policy agenda. \n\nConnie Gersick's research on the evolution of organizational systems (1988, 1991) revealed patterns of change mirroring those in biological species. Gersick examined models of change in six domains - developmental patterns of adults, groups and organizations, the history of science, physical science, and biological evolution - and found evidence for punctuated equilibria (as opposed to steady, incremental change) across those disparate systems. Applications of the theory have been in organizational theory, in the study of small work groups, in research on geographic communities and corporate behavior, and in the study of technological change. \n\nAs some researchers have noted, the biological applications of punctuated equilibrium have rejuvenated a new \"theory about change within entities.\" At the same time, social scientific applications of the punctuated equilibrium concept have been criticized for losing sight of a core idea in the original biological theory of punctuated equilibrium: the notion that geographic location plays a significant role in determining which populations are subject to abrupt changes at a given time.\n"}
{"id": "46401819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46401819", "title": "Racial bias on Wikipedia", "text": "Racial bias on Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia has been criticized for having a systemic racial bias in its coverage, due to an under-representation of people of color within its editor base. The past president of Wikimedia D.C., James Hare, noted that \"a lot of black history is left out\" of Wikipedia, due to articles predominately being written by white editors. Articles that do exist on African topics are, according to some, largely edited by editors from Europe and North America and thus reflect only their knowledge and consumption of media, which \"tend to perpetuate a negative image\" of Africa. Maira Liriano of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, has argued that the lack of information regarding black history on Wikipedia \"makes it seem like it's not important.\"\n\nDifferent theories have been provided to explain these racial discrepancies. Jay Cassano, writing for \"Fast Company\" magazine, argued that Wikipedia's small proportion of black editors is a result of the small black presence within the technology sector, and a relative lack of reliable access to the Internet. Katherine Maher, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, has argued that the specific focuses in Wikipedia's content are representative of those of society as a whole. She said that Wikipedia could only represent that which was referenced in secondary sources, which historically have been favourable towards and focused on white men. “Studies have shown that content on Wikipedia suffers from the bias of its editors – [who are] mainly technically inclined, English-speaking, white-collar men living in majority-Christian, developed countries in the Northern hemisphere”.\n\nAccording to Maira Liriano, the associate chief librarian at New York City’s Schomburg Center, one of the biggest challenges is getting new editors to keep editing Wikipedia after the edit-a-thon is over. One challenge with retaining new editors is that the “[n]erdy white guys” who predominate as Wikipedia editors “…aren't always warm and nurturing” to new editors. For example, when new editors add content on Black history, their content may be deleted by established editors. As well, when new editors are trying to advocate for the inclusion of Black history content on Wikipedia’s talk pages (each article has an associated talk page for discussion of changes), the “[c]omments [to new editors] on [Wikipedia article] talk pages can be very blunt.” An issue for women of colour is that “women in many communities have less leisure time than men,” according to Siko Bouterse, the director of community resources at the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\nAnother challenge for editors trying to add Black history articles to Wikipedia is the requirement that potential article topics, such as historical individuals or events, meet Wikipedia’s “” criteria. ‘’HuffPost’’ states that the Wikipedia notability criteria “…is a troubling problem for those fighting for more content about women and minorities”, because “…there's simply less [published] documentation on many accomplished women and minorities throughout history -- they were often ignored, after all, or forced to make their contributions as someone else's assistant”.\n\nMaher states that one issue is that “…content on Wikipedia has to be backed up by secondary sources, sources that she says throughout history have contained a bias toward white men”; “…people of color have not been represented in mainstream knowledge creation or inclusion in that knowledge,” as “…encyclopedias of old were mostly written by European men.” Another issue is the “often abusive relationships between editors” on talk pages, which “…can make Wikipedia a less than welcoming place for …minority groups looking to get involved” in editing Wikipedia. The Wikipedia editing \"...community can also appear hostile, both to outsiders looking in and to those involved in it\" by editing articles; indeed, article \"[t]alk pages [discussions about articles] routinely devolve into seemingly petty arguments\".\n\nThere has been \"...criticism of bias [on Wikipedia], both on individual pages [articles] and as a systemic mind-set that the editing network has as a whole.\" William Beutler, author of the blog The Wikipedian and a consultant on Wikipedia issues for clients, states that \"...certain areas of Wikipedia, including certain political areas of Wikipedia...tend to be controlled by a small number of editors who tend to see things the same way.\" Various communities have raised concerns about \"...Wikipedia and its editors, saying that the pages had obvious systemic bias against them.\"\n\nAttempts have been made to rectify racial biases through edit-a-thons, organised events at which Wikipedia editors attempt to improve coverage of certain topics and train new editors. In February 2015, multiple edit-a-thons were organised to commemorate Black History Month in the United States. One such edit-a-thon was organized by the White House to create and improve articles on African Americans in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The Schomburg Center, Howard University, and National Public Radio, also coordinated edit-a-thons to improve coverage of black history. \"Wikipedia editors… have held 'edit-a-thons,'\" to \"...encourage others to come learn how to…contribute content on subjects that have been largely ignored.” Liriano has endorsed Wikipedia edit-a-thons, stating that for Wikipedia’s content to \"…be representative, everyone has to participate.\"\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, the Schomburg Center held a “Black Lives Matters” edit-a-thon to coincide with Black History Month. Volunteer editors added coverage about Black historical individuals and about key concepts in black culture (e.g., about the Harlem Book Fair and about Black costume designer Judy Dearing) New articles about Black history and Black historical individuals were also created. The 2016 edit-a-thon was organized by AfroCROWD.\n\nWikipedia editors Michael Mandiberg and Dorothy Howard have organized diversity-themed edit-a-thons to “…help raise awareness of some of the glaring holes on Wikipedia, and the need for people with diverse backgrounds and knowledge to fill them”. Liriano stated “It's really important that people of color know that there's this gap” of coverage of Black history on Wikipedia “…and they can correct it” by participating as editors. In the US, the National Science Foundation has provided $200,000 to fund research on the issue of bias in the coverage of topics in Wikipedia. The National Science Foundation has commissioned two studies of why there is bias in Wikipedia editing.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is trying to deal with the issue of racial bias in Wikipedia. In 2015, it was reported that the Wikipedia Foundation made numerous grants “…to organizations in the \"Global South\" -- including Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East -- with plans to improve [coverage of Global South topics in] Wikipedia.“ While Wikipedia supports these edit-a-thons, the organization has always stressed that adequate citations must always be present and neutrality must always be maintained. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has stated that the Wikimedia Foundation has “completely failed” to meet its goals of resolving the lack of diversity amongst Wikipedia editors.\n\n"}

Comfort started Living Waters Publications and \"The Way of the Master\" in Bellflower, California, and has written a number of books.\n\nAccording to Comfort's autobiography, his parents put \"Methodist\" on his birth certificate but he was given no religious instruction as a child. Comfort identifies himself as both Christian and Jewish.\n\nIn 1989, Comfort accepted an invitation to join the pastoral staff at the non-denominational Calvary Chapel in Southern California.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Comfort persuaded Kirk Cameron, star of the cancelled hit sitcom \"Growing Pains\", to become an evangelist. In 2002, the pair formed an organization called \"The Way of the Master\", with the intention of teaching the church to more effectively preach the message of evangelical Christianity.\n\nComfort says that evangelism is the main reason the Christian Church exists and that many of the evangelistic methods used over the last century have produced false conversions to Christianity. Comfort often uses the Ten Commandments to speak about sin before presenting the gospel of Jesus. In the mid-1980s he formulated two sermons entitled \"Hell's Best Kept Secret\" and \"True and False Conversions.\"\n\nComfort speaks professionally at churches and evangelism seminars, and preaches in Huntington Beach, California. As well as co-hosting the former \"The Way of the Master Radio\" with Kirk Cameron, he is co-host of \"The Way of the Master Television Show\".\n\nIn 2006, Comfort recorded a segment for \"The Way of the Master\"'s television show in which he argued that the banana was an \"atheists' nightmare\", arguing that it displayed many user-friendly features that were evidence of intelligent design. Comfort retracted the video upon learning that the banana is a result of artificial selection by humans, and that the wild banana is small and unpalatable.\n\nOn 13 April 2001, Comfort appeared at the 27th National Convention of American Atheists in Orlando, Florida, where he debated Ron Barrier, the National Spokesperson for American Atheists. Comfort later stated that \"they laughed at my humor, and although there was unified mockery at some of the things that I said, I was able to go through the Ten Commandments, the fact of Judgment Day, the reality of Hell, the Cross, and the necessity of repentance, and no one stopped me.\"\n\nOn 5 May 2007, Comfort and Cameron participated in a televised debate with Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Connor of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church in Manhattan. The debate focused on the existence of God, which Comfort claimed he could prove scientifically without relying on faith or the Bible. \"Nightline\" correspondent Martin Bashir moderated the event. During the debate, Cameron and Comfort repeatedly referenced the Ten Commandments and denied the theory of evolution.\n\nIn February 2009, Comfort challenged Richard Dawkins to a debate, offering to donate $10,000 to him. Dawkins, who had previously stated a general policy not to debate with creationists, said he would agree to do it if Comfort made a $100,000 donation to the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science non-profit organization. Comfort raised his offer to $20,000, which according to PZ Myers was \"not enough.\"\n\nAccording to Comfort, he has designed dozens of gospel tracts since the 1970s, and sells millions of Living Waters tracts each year. Some of his tracts are designed to resemble paper money, including fake $100, $1,000 and $1 million bills. Others employ novelties intended to amuse, such as a \"ticket to heaven\" that invites the reader to tear it if they do not need it; the ticket is printed on a polymer substrate, making it extremely durable. The tracts typically attempt to persuade the reader that on judgment day, they will certainly be found guilty of breaking one or more of the Ten Commandments, and therefore will be sent to hell, unless they say a prayer to acknowledge Christ's substitutionary atonement.\n\nIn June 2006, agents of the US Secret Service confiscated thousands of Ray Comfort's \"Million Dollar Bill\" gospel tracts from Darrel Rundus, president of Great News Network. A federal district court judge ruled that the tracts, which were marked as \"not legal tender\", did not violate federal law and ordered their return.\n\nIn October 2010, \"The New Zealand Herald\" reported that elderly people received \"appointment cards\" by Comfort's California-based publishing company, Living Waters, asking them to fill out information regarding the date and time of their deaths, and advising them to contact evangelists in order to avoid hell. Recipients of these cards expressed anger and horror over receiving them, and contacted police over the matter, with one of them commenting, \"It's disgusting. It was quite spooky. I just couldn't comprehend why anyone would ask you to predict the date of your death.\" \"The New Zealand Herald\" summarized a statement from Living Waters spokesperson Lisa Law as saying that \"the cards were a way of raising awareness of human mortality in order to spark discussion about Jesus\", and that Law \"did not know who sent [the tracts]\".\n\nRay Comfort has authored more than 80 books and tracts. His 2009 book \"You Can Lead an Atheist to Evidence, But You Can't Make Him Think\", ranked #1 in Amazon.com's atheism and apologetics categories when it debuted in February 2009.\n\nIn November 2009, Comfort released an edited and abridged version of Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\", with a 50-page foreword detailing creationist arguments against the theory of evolution. The book was given away for free at selected schools around the United States. Stan Guffey, a biologist at the University of Tennessee, alleged that most of Comfort's section on Darwin's life was plagiarised from his work.\n\nAccording to Comfort's website, \"nothing has been removed from Darwin's original work\", but Eugenie C. Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), noted that Comfort deleted four chapters by Darwin that described the evidence for evolution, adding that two of the omitted chapters, Chapters 11 and 12, showcased biogeography, some of Darwin's strongest evidence for evolution. She wrote that Comfort's foreword is \"a hopeless mess of long-ago-refuted creationist arguments, teeming with misinformation about the science of evolution, populated by legions of strawmen, and exhibiting what can be charitably described as muddled thinking\".\n\nOn his website, Comfort said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted in order to make the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, and that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms. The NCSE arranged a campaign at colleges across the US to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction, a one-page flier, and \"the NCSE Safety Bookmark\" in the shape of a banana, a reference to Comfort's presentation of the banana as an argument for the existence of God.\n\n\nIn 2011, Comfort wrote and produced a 33-minute documentary film called \"180: Changing the Heart of a Nation\". The film was criticized by \"The Huffington Post\" for its comparison of abortion to the Holocaust.\n\nComfort's 2016 film \"The Atheist Delusion\" premiered at the Ark Encounter, a Christian theme park operated by the Christian apologetics and young Earth creationist organization Answers in Genesis on 22 October 2016.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1720888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1720888", "title": "Recruitment in the British Army", "text": "Recruitment in the British Army\n\nThe British Army came into being with the unification of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. The new British Army incorporated Regiments that had already existed in England and Scotland. The Army has traditionally relied on volunteer recruits, the only exceptions to this being during the latter part of the First World War until 1919, and then again during the Second World War when conscription was brought in during the war and stayed until 1960.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, the standing strength of the British Army was reduced after the Treaty of Ryswick, and stood at 7,000 troops at home and 14,000 based overseas, with recruits ranging from 17 to 50 years of age. The army was kept small by the government during peacetime, mainly due to the fear that the army would be unduly influenced by the Crown or used to depose the government. The Bill of Rights of 1689 specifies that Parliamentary authority is needed to maintain a standing army in peacetime.\n\nFor much of the 18th century, the army was recruited in a wide variety of places, and many of its recruits were mercenaries from continental Europe, including Danes, Hessians and Hanoverians. These mercenaries were hired out by other rulers on contracted terms. Other regiments were formed of volunteers such as French Huguenots. By 1709, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the British Army totalled 150,000 men, of whom 81,000 were foreign mercenaries. The rest of the army consisted of natives of the British Isles who, apart from the officers, were mainly recruited from the poorest sections of society. Each regiment was responsible for the recruitment of its own troops, and individual colonels would lead recruiting parties on tours of the towns and villages. This was emphasized by a popular play of the time called \"The Recruiting Officer\". Other powers were given by the British government to allow the forcible enlistment of vagrants and vagabonds. Some of these powers were abused by recruiting officers desperate to fill their quotas, although a legalized Royal Navy press-gang system would not be implemented yet, even though normal recruiting methods failed to supply the required annual influx of troops, as the army was not a popular profession, with low pay, flogging and other barbarous disciplinary measures. The army's recruiting methods and treatment of its soldiers would remain the same for the rest of the 18th century.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, a policy similar to the Royal Navy's Press Gangs was introduced. Two acts were passed, the Recruiting Act 1778 and the Recruiting Act 1779, for the impressment of individuals. For some men this would have been for being drunk and disorderly. The chief advantages of these acts was in the number of volunteers brought in under the apprehension of impressment. To avoid impressment, some recruits incapacitated themselves by cutting off the thumb and forefinger of the right hand. Both acts were repealed in 1780. The British Government also released criminals and debtors from prison on the condition they joined the army. Three entire regiments during the American Revolution were raised from this early release programme. Of the Volunteer recruits, some would find they had been enticed to take the King's shilling under false pretenses and many men would find they had signed to a lifetime in the army.\n\nAfter the defeat of Great Britain by the American revolutionaries, the British Army fell into dereliction (it should be noted that the army in 1775 was in a poor state anyway), morale and discipline were low, and troops levels fell. The Army was neglected as never before and its total strength in 1793 stood at 40,000 men.\n\nThe United Kingdom's struggle with France during the Napoleonic wars required the British Army to expand rapidly. Ordinary recruiting methods failed to supply the number of men required to fill the Army ranks. The main methods used for recruiting were: private individuals were recruited for their own interests, volunteers from the militia and placing obligations on communities to enlist. Generals called for conscription for the first time in British History, although this was never enacted for the regular army. During this period, Great Britain was at a disadvantage to her enemy, as due to the Industrial Revolution potential recruits were instead drawn to the cities to earn more money in the many factories now being built in the country, while France was still largely an agrarian society.\n\nCompetition from civilian occupations was intense and highlighted in the disparity in pay; where a private could earn 7s per week in 1806, a dockworker could expect to earn 28s. However soldiers would expect to supplement this meagre income with promotion and loot on campaign. During the early phases of the war, joining the Army could still mean effectively joining for life, which was frequently brutally cut short. For instance, a posting to the Caribbean in 1790 was seen as a near death sentence, as thousands of men died or were disabled by disease there. The Army still struggled to raise the troops required to replace the discharged, wounded and dead as the war against France continued. As early as 1794, 18,596 soldiers died on active service and another 40,639 men were discharged. This would remain a constant theme during the Napoleonic wars, and the British Army also used foreign volunteers, such as French Royalists, Germans, Greeks and Corsicans to supplement its forces. In 1813 one fifth of the army, 52,000 men, were such volunteers. The British Army in 1813 contained over 250,000 men, though this was much larger in comparison to the army at the beginning of the war, the all volunteer British army was still much smaller than that of France, which with conscription had an army over 2.6 million.\n\nFrom 1798 onwards, structural, training and logistical reforms implemented or authorised by the Duke of York (as commander-in-chief of the army) slowly improved the lot of the ordinary soldier. York oversaw a crackdown on corruption and removed the threat of corporal punishment for a large number of petty offences (while it was still retained for serious derelictions of duty). He also stamped down on the abuse of buying officer commissions, making it necessary for officers to serve two full years before either promotion or purchase to captain and six years before becoming a major The establishment of the Royal Military Academy for officers was instigated due to York's influence, while regular recruits to the army were allowed to join under contract for limited periods, rather than for life. Men such as Sir John Moore, Thomas Sydney Beckwith and Rowland Hill characterised the new breed of officers who sought to improve the relationship between officers and men, motivating troops through mutual respect, reward and promotion rather than by relying on punishment. The Shorncliffe System for light infantry was established, being devised by Lt-Col Kenneth Mackenzie, and trained soldiers to think for themselves and act on initiative while the light infantry officers drilled alongside the men fostering comradeship. In addition, the introduction of new tactical and organisational flexibility contributed a great deal to the successes of the Peninsula and Waterloo.\n\nAfter the victory in the Napoleonic wars, there followed 40 years of peace in Europe during which the army would again revert to its peacetime role. The Army that won the war was again neglected in the peace. The Government's immediate priority was to cut taxes, to lessen the burden of taxation on the economy, which had remained high over the previous 20 years, to pay for the expensive war that enabled Britain to be victorious over France. The British Army funding would be cut drastically in the short term, but as became evident this would apply for the next 40 years. The budget was cut from £43 million in 1815, to £10.7 million in 1820, £8 million in 1836 and only rose slightly 10 years later to £9.5 million. With the budget cuts, troop levels were inevitably cut from 233,592 men in 1815 to 102,529 men by 1828. There were further reductions in 1838, after which troop strength stood at 91,388. With the constant cuts, recruiting parties would achieve their reduced recruiting targets with greater ease.\n\nThe army during peacetime was deliberately kept small and the recruitment methods would only change once the Cardwell reforms were implemented in the 1870s. The Crimean War nevertheless highlighted several defects and weaknesses in the Army's organisation. Although in theory, 70,000 soldiers were stationed in Britain, it was found that this number included several units in transit from distant outposts of the Empire, and some underdeveloped recruits and many old soldiers whose constitution had been ruined by harsh climate and disease and who were no longer capable of serving in the field. As a result, the provision of an expeditionary force of only 25,000 in the Crimea stripped Britain of almost every trained soldier.\n\nSome of the Cardwell's reforms included the abolition of sale of commissions, the banning of flogging and other measures, such as reducing the length of service, to make recruitment more appealing. An Enlistment Act saw a change in the terms of enlistment, which could at last produce some trained reserves and also made soldiering a more tempting career. A Localisation Scheme resulted in the pairing of single-battalion regiments via administrative depots on a county-based system.\n\nOfficers of the British army prior to the late 18th century were mainly recruited from a narrow segment of society, with a majority coming from the landed gentry and the aristocracy or often officers were from families with a military tradition. (This contrasted with the Navy, whose officers were more often from a middle-class background.) The second son of King George III, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, did much to improve the standard of officer recruitment from his position as Commander in Chief of the Army (from 1795 to 1809, then from 1811 to 1827). The sale of commissions, finally abolished in the Cardwell reforms in 1868–1874, and the further Childers Reforms. In spite of its abolition, the status of an officer being from a privileged background and that of another rank being from a less privileged one has, for the most part remained.\nThe Royal Family traditionally had its members serve in the Armed Forces, usually with the Royal Navy though many have served with the Army. This occasionally warped operations in the field, for example at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir, where Wolseley was forced to leave an entire brigade of Guards in reserve to avoid harm coming to Queen Victoria's third son, the Duke of Connaught. The tradition has continued into the 21st century, with Prince Harry and Prince William both joining the Army as officers. However, Royals are no longer deliberately kept out of harm's way; Prince Harry saw active service in Afghanistan until the publicity posed a threat to the troops serving with him, while Prince Andrew served as a front-line helicopter pilot with the Royal Navy during the Falklands War.\n\nForeign Royals have also served in the Army, such as Eugène Bonaparte, the son of Napoléon III, who was commissioned into the Royal Artillery, but was killed in 1879 while serving in South Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War. Later in the 20th century, King Abdullah II of Jordan served as a Second Lieutenant with the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen Mary's Own), and Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said of Oman served with the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles).\n\nAt the start of 1914, the British Army had a reported strength of 710,000 men including reserves, of which 247,432 were regular troops, also including 80,000 regular troops formed as the British Expeditionary Force. The recruitment drive would be spearheaded by Lord Kitchener once war had been declared in August 1914.\nIt was abundantly clear that the army that the Kaiser had referred to as a \"contemptible little army\" would need thousands more recruits. Young Britons answered the call, for King and Country, and voluntarily joined the British Army. By early 1915 much of the regular army had been killed and were now replaced by the part-time volunteers of the Territorial Force and Kitchener's new volunteer army. A feature of the volunteer army was the Pals battalions, recruited from single communities or even factories, who were allowed to serve together. The Kitchener recruitment campaign had proved to be very successful, as on 1 September 1914, over 30,000 men enlisted. With each day passing, thousands more were clamouring to be taken. The British Government soon realized the main drawback of this campaign, as opposed to the French and German conscriptions, which selected each individual men, a high proportion of men from skilled industries left their works, which would prove to be costly in the war effort. A better-controlled enlistment program would be required.\n\nThe Military Service Bill was enacted with effect from January 1916 and specified that men from the ages of 18 to 41 were liable to be called up for service unless they were married (or widowed with children), or else served in one of a number of reserved professions. By the end of World War I, almost a quarter of the total male population of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland had joined up, over five million men.\n\nAfter the Great war and the inevitable defence cuts that would follow, the army was reduced in size, and by 1920 had fallen to a strength of 370,000. There were a number of factors for the reductions in the size of British Army, and the cuts to the budget of the Army. The army now had competition from the new armed service, the Royal Air Force, which could patrol far greater land areas, and keep the far flung corners of the Empire policed from the sky at a relatively cheaper cost. The defence budget for the army was repeatedly cut yearly, as in 1923 the army defence budget was 43.5 million pounds sterling, and during the Great Depression in 1932 to just under 36 million pounds sterling. Only with the rise of Germany, would the budget for the British army again increase, by 1938 to 123 million pounds sterling; the army again started a rapid recruitment program.\n\n\"Further information:\" \"Conscription in the United Kingdom during Second World War\"\n\nThe pre-war army was an all-volunteer army and recruits were allotted to the corps of their wishes. The only pre-conditions placed on candidates were an interview with a recruiting officer, who could only glean partial information on a recruit, a medical examination, and some educational tests. If these requirements were met, the recruit was posted to the arm of his choice, there was no scientific selection process unlike the rapidly growing German army. This led to men being allocated to the wrong or unsuitable corps. The Secretary of State for War, Leslie Hore-Belisha attempted to address these problems, and the wider problems of the British army. The process of allocating men would remain ad hoc at the start of the war. The army would be without the quotas of men required from skilled professions and trades, which modern warfare demanded. With the army being the least popular service compared to the navy and airforce, a higher proportion of army recruits were said to be dull and backward.\n\nThe following memorandum to the Executive Committee of the Army Council highlighted the growing concern. \n“The British Army is wasting manpower in this war almost as badly as it did in the last war. A man is posted to a Corps almost entirely on the demand of the moment and without any effort at personal selection by proper tests.”\n\nOnly with the creation of the Beveridge committee in 1941, and their subsequent findings in 1942, would the situation of skilled men not being assigned correctly, be addressed. The findings led directly to the creation of the General Service Corps, and would remain in place long after the war. Hore-Belisha had sought permission to introduce conscription in 1938 but was rebuffed by Neville Chamberlain, who would not agree to increased defence spending. In early 1939, he was finally allowed to introduce conscription to meet the threat of Germany, with the Military Training Act of 27 April 1939. The act required all men aged 20 and 21 to take six months military training. This act was extended on the declaration of the war, to include all fit men between the ages of 18 and 41. Conscription was gradually brought in, starting in October 1939 and applying to all fit men between 20–23, and the age group was increased as the war continued.\n\nAt the start of the Second World War, the British Army Strength stood at 897,000 men including reserves. By the end of 1939, the strength of the British Army stood at 1.1 million men, and further increased to 1.65 million men during June 1940.\n\nThe Local Defence Volunteers was formed early in 1940. Very large numbers of civilians too old or too young for the Army, or barred from serving if they were in reserved occupations, volunteered for the new force. The organisation was eventually renamed the \"Home Guard\" and was to be part of the defence of Britain in the advent of a German invasion of Britain.\n\nAs with the previous World War, the end of wartime conscription saw the army reduced in size and reverting to its peacetime role of maintaining the Empire. In 1947, British India was given Independence, which meant the loss of the British Indian Army and thousands of volunteer soldiers. The British Government had relied on the British Indian Army for Imperial matters. Now, without this army, the regular British Army was judged to be too small for the demands of an impending Cold War and maintaining the Empire. To meet this demand, which volunteers alone would not, peacetime conscription was enacted by the government and passed by the House of Commons in 1947. In the United Kingdom, it is this period of peacetime conscription that is usually referred to as 'National Service'. It remains the only period of peacetime conscription in UK history, apart from the periods immediately before and after World War II. The majority of National Servicemen went into the Army and, by 1951, National Servicemen made up half the force, leading to a reduced level of voluntary recruitment to the regular army. The last intake of National Servicemen took place in 1960, with the last National Serviceman being demobbed on 16 May 1963. The army reverted to an all professional volunteer service, which it remains to this day.\n\nThe decision to abolish National Service was taken in 1957 with the 1957 Defence White Paper, which led to an enormous reduction in the number of soldiers between 1958–63, from about 330,000 to 165,000 by the end of National Service. In the decades that followed, cuts in the Army were the constant theme, although they were never on a large scale until the end of the cold war. Between 1963 and 1992, strength was reduced to 153,000. In 1990, the Government started another defence review, which concluded with the Defence White Paper of 1992. In a post-Soviet world, the white paper would again further reduce the army by 50,000, effectively ending the British Army of the Rhine. The current strength of the British army is approximately 102,000 regular personnel.\n\nThe Army mainly recruits within the United Kingdom, and normally has a recruitment target of around 25,000 soldiers per year. Low unemployment in Britain has resulted in the Army having difficulty in meeting its target, and in the early years of the 21st century there has been a marked increase in the number of recruits from mostly Commonwealth countries.\n\nThe minimum recruitment age is 16 years, after the end of GCSEs, although soldiers may not serve on operations below 18 years; the maximum recruitment age was raised in January 2007 from 26 to 33 years. The normal term of engagement is 22 years; and, once enlisted, soldiers are not normally permitted to leave until they have served at least four years. Soldiers are now Enlisted on a 24-year engagement known as versatile engagement (VEng). After 22 years service a soldier may be offered a 2-year extension. After the 2 years the soldier or officer maybe after a further 2 years service and thereafter until they reach 55 years of age.\n\nDuring both World Wars, subjects throughout the British Empire volunteered to help the United Kingdom. During World War I, the Dominions raised their own armies, but were under the British command structure, and very much integrated into the British fighting forces. Over 2.5 million men, which included Canada sending 418,000 men overseas, Australia sending 322,000,South Africa sending 230,000, New Zealand sending 124,000, and other volunteers from the Crown Colonies.\n\nDuring peacetime, British Empire soldiers were usually recruited into indigenous regiments, such as the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, to garrison their own land, thus ensuring that the Army did not have to allocate its own units to garrison the territories. One of the oldest regiments raised from the empire was the West India Regiment, which was raised in 1795, and was formed as an integral part of the regular British Army. The recruits of the West India Regiment were originally raised from freed slaves from North America and by the purchase of slaves in the West Indies; the regiment was disbanded in 1927. The Fiji Infantry Regiment, which was raised in 1920 and consisted of a single battalion, garrisoned the Pacific territory. One of the largest units was the multi-battalion Royal West African Frontier Force, which garrisoned British West Africa and included The Nigeria Regiment.\n\nThe largest of the colonial military forces was the British Indian Army. Up to Indian independence, this was a volunteer army, raised from the native population and staffed by British officers. The Indian Army served both as a security force in India itself and, particularly during the World Wars, in other theatres. The Indian Army proved a very useful adjunct to British forces wherever it served. Recruitment was entirely voluntary; about 1.3 million men served in the First World War, many on the Western Front, and 2.5 million in the Second. Initially the soldiers and NCOs were Indian, with British officers, but later Indian officers were promoted King's Commissioned Indian Officer.\n\nGurkhas have been employed as an integral part of the Indian Army since the early 19th century. After Indian independence, some Gurkha units were transferred to the British Army. There are approximately 3,500 Gurkhas currently serving in the British Army. Joining the British Army is one of the few ways Nepalese people have of escaping poverty and earning a good salary. As a result, each year, there are thousands of applicants, as in 2007 when over 17,349 applied for just 230 posts. In some years, there are over 60,000 applying to join, and from 2010, women were allowed to join for the first time. Candidates must be between 17½ and 21 years of age.\n\nIrishmen have served in large numbers with the British army since its inception in the early 18th century and into the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars and beyond. During this time, 20 to 40 percent of soldiers in English regiments of the Army were Irish born which, together with a high proportion of Scots, meant there were, on occasion, more Irish soldiers than English in some English regiments. Levels would remain high, although recruitment steadily dropped from the period of the Irish Famine until 1900, but the Irish would remain over represented compared to the size of the population. At the turn of the 20th century, the number of Irish volunteers reduced, as the criticism by nationalists of recruitment to the army grew. Over 28,000 Irishmen served in the army during the Second Boer War, but by 1910 recruitment levels had fallen to 9 percent and for the first time were below Ireland's share of the UK population. During World War I, over 200,000 Irish soldiers volunteered to serve; many recruits from the new Southern state were known as National Volunteers. During World War II, over 70,000 were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and 38,000 from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe importance of the Irish in the British Army was summed up by Rudyard Kipling, who lost his son, Lt John Kipling of the Irish Guards, in World War I,\"For where there are Irish there’s bound to be fighting,\nAnd when there's no fighting it’s Ireland no more.\"\n\nUntil 1998 there were restrictions on the enlistment of Commonwealth citizens in the British Army. Commonwealth citizens could generally join if they had been resident in the United Kingdom for five years. In 1998 the restrictions were lifted, following recruiting difficulties among British citizens. Under the new provisions Commonwealth citizens were permitted to enlist directly in any one of the British services and significant numbers did so in subsequent years. \n\nThe Ministry of Defence later capped the number of recruits from Commonwealth countries at 10% of any corps or regiment in the Army, although this did not affect the Gurkhas. The cap was debated, as some feared the army's \"Britishness\" was being diluted, and employing too many could make the army seem as employing too many mercenaries.\n\nIn 2008, Commonwealth origin volunteers comprised approximately 6.7% of the Army's total strength. In total, 6,600 foreign soldiers from 42 countries were represented in the Army, not including Gurkhas, i.e. Nepalis. After Nepal, the nation with most citizens in the British Army was Fiji, with 1,900, followed by Jamaica and Ghana with 600 each; soldiers also came from more prosperous countries, such as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. There are also volunteers from the Republic of Ireland – the level of recruitment among Irish nationals has been increasing, and figures for recruitment in Northern Ireland show that 16% came from south of the border during 2008.\n\nHowever, in 2013 the previous restraints were reintroduced with immediate effect, in the context of reduced establishment numbers. From July 2013, all Commonwealth citizens except for those from Ireland, Cyprus, and Malta must have resided for 5 years in the UK before being allowed to join. As of May 2016, commonwealth citizens can enlist in the British army in limited roles without meeting the residence requirements. On 5 November 2018 the Ministry of Defence once again removed the requirement of residing in the country for five years. This now meant that any citizen of the Commonwealth could join the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy as of 6 November 2018. However, the British Army will open applications early 2019. \n\n\n\n"}

It was not recognized internationally. The name \"Krajina\" (\"Frontier\") was adopted from the historical Military Frontier of the Habsburg Monarchy and Austria-Hungary, which had a substantial Serb population and existed up to the late 19th century. The RSK government waged a war for ethnic Serb independence from Croatia and unification with FR Yugoslavia and Republika Srpska (in Bosnia and Herzegovina). \n\nThe government of Krajina had \"de facto\" control over central parts of the territory while control of the outskirts changed with the successes and failures of its military activities. The territory was legally protected by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).\n\nIts main portion was overrun by Croatian forces in 1995 and the Republic of Serbian Krajina was ultimately disbanded as a result; a rump remained in eastern Slavonia under UNTAES administration until its peaceful reintegration into Croatia in 1998.\n\nThe name \"Krajina\" (meaning \"frontier\") stemmed from the Military Frontier which Austria carved out of parts of the crown lands of Croatia and Slavonia between 1553–1578 with a view to defending itself against the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. Many Croats, Serbs and Vlachs immigrated from nearby parts of the Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Bosnia and Serbia) into the region and helped bolster and replenish the population as well as the garrisoned troops in the fight against the Ottomans. The Austrians controlled the Frontier from military headquarters in Vienna and did not make it a crown land, though it had some special rights in order to encourage settlement in an otherwise deserted, war-ravaged territory. The abolition of military rule took place between 1869 and 1871. In order to attract Serbs to become part of Croatia, on 11 May 1867, the Sabor solemnly declared that \"the Triune Kingdom recognizes the Serbian/Vlach people living in it as a nation identical and equal with the Croatian nation\". Subsequently, the Military Frontier was incorporated into Habsburg Croatia in 1881.\n\nFollowing the end of World War I in 1918, the regions formerly forming part of the Military Frontier came under the control of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, where they formed part of the Sava Banovina, along with most of the old Croatia-Slavonia. Between the two World Wars the Serbs of the Croatian and Slavonian Krajinas, as well as those of the Bosnian Krajina and of other regions west of Serbia, organized a notable political party, the Independent Democratic Party under Svetozar Pribićević. In the new state there existed much tension between the Croats and Serbs over differing political visions, with the campaign for Croatian autonomy culminating in the assassination of a Croatian leader, Stjepan Radić, in the parliament, and repression by the Serb-dominated security structures.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1941, in an attempt to resolve the Croat-Serb political and social antagonism in the first Yugoslavia, the kingdom established an autonomous Banovina of Croatia incorporating (amongst other territories) much of the former Military Frontier as well as parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1941 the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia and in the aftermath the Independent State of Croatia (which included whole of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Serbia (Eastern Syrmia) as well) was declared. The Germans installed the Ustaše (who had allegedly plotted the assassination of the Serbian King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in 1934) as rulers of the new country; the Ustaše authorities promptly pursued a genocidal policy of persecution of Serbs, Jews and Croats (from opposition groups), leading to hundreds of thousands being killed. During this period, individual Croats coalesced around the ruling authorities or around the communist anti-fascist Partisans. Serbs from around the Knin area tended to join the Chetniks, whilst Serbs from the Banovina and Slavonia regions tended to join the Partisans.\n\nAt the end of World War II in 1945, the communist-dominated Partisans prevailed and the Krajina region became part of the People's Republic of Croatia until 7 April 1963, when the federal republic changed its name to the Socialist Republic of Croatia. Tito suppressed the autonomous political organisations of the region (along with other movements such as the Croatian Spring); however, the Yugoslav constitutions of 1965 and 1974 did give substantial rights to national minorities - including to the Serbs in SR Croatia.\n\nThe Serbian \"Krajina\" entity to emerge upon Croatia's declaration of independence in 1991 would include three kinds of territories:\n\n\nLarge sections of the historical Military Frontier lay outside of the Republic of Serb Krajina and contained a largely Croat population - these including much of Lika, the area centred around the city of Bjelovar, central and south-eastern Slavonia.\n\n \nThe Serb-populated regions in Croatia were of central concern to the Serbian nationalist movement of the late 1980s, led by Slobodan Milošević. In September 1986 the Serbian Academy's memorandum on the status of Serbia and Serbs was partially leaked by a Serbian newspaper. It listed a series of grievances against the Yugoslav federation, claiming that the situation in Kosovo was 'genocide', and complained about alleged discrimination of Serbs at the hands of the Croatian authorities. Among the claims that it makes is that 'except for the time under the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbs in Croatia have never been as jeopardized as they are today’. Tension was further fuelled by the overthrow of Vojvodina and Montenegro's government by Milošević's loyalists, and the abrogation of Kosovo's and Vojvodina's autonomy in 1989, which gave Milošević 4 out of 8 votes on the Yugoslav Federal Presidency, thus gaining the power to block every decision made by the Presidency. Furthermore, a series of Serb nationalist rallies were held in Croatia during 1989, under pressure from Serbia. On 8 July 1989 a large nationalist rally was held in Knin, during which banners threatening JNA intervention in Croatia, as well as Chetnik iconography were displayed, stunning the Croatian public. The Croatian pro-independence party victory in 1990 made matters more tense, especially since the country's Serb minority was supported by Milošević. At the time, Serbs comprised about 12.2% (581,663 people) of Croatia's population (1991 census).\n\nSerbs became increasingly opposed to the policies of Franjo Tuđman, elected president of Croatia in April 1990, due to his overt desire for the creation of an independent Croatia. On 30 May 1990, the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) of Jovan Rašković broke all ties to the Croatian parliament. The following June in Knin, the SDS-led Serbs proclaimed the creation of the Association of Municipalities of Northern Dalmatia and Lika. In August 1990, the Serbs began what became known as the Log Revolution, where barricades of logs were placed across roads throughout the South as an expression of their secession from Croatia. This effectively cut Croatia in two, separating the coastal region of Dalmatia from the rest of the country. The Constitution of Croatia was passed in December 1990, which reduced the status of Serbs from \"constituent\" to a \"national minority\" in the same category with other groups such as Italians and Hungarians. Some would later justify their claim to an independent Serb state by arguing that the new constitution contradicted the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, because in their view, Croatia was still legally governed by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, although this ignores the fact that Serbia's constitution, promulgated three months before Croatia's, also contained several provisions violating the 1974 Federal Constitution.\n\nSerbs in Croatia had established a Serbian National Council in July 1990 to coordinate opposition to Croatian independence. Their position was that if Croatia could secede from Yugoslavia, then the Serbs could secede from Croatia. Milan Babić, a dentist by profession from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. At his ICTY trial in 2004, he claimed that \"during the events [of 1990–1992], and in particular at the beginning of his political career, he was strongly influenced and misled by Serbian propaganda, which repeatedly referred to the imminent threat of a Croatian genocide perpetrated on the Serbs in Croatia, thus creating an atmosphere of hatred and fear of Croats.\" The rebel Croatian Serbs established a number of paramilitary militia units under the leadership of Milan Martić, the police chief in Knin.\n\nIn August 1990, a referendum was held in Krajina on the question of Serb \"sovereignty and autonomy\" in Croatia. The resolution was confined exclusively to Serbs so it passed by an improbable majority of 99.7%. As expected, it was declared illegal and invalid by the Croatian government, who stated that Serbs had no constitutional right to break away from Croatian legal territory - as well as no right to limit the franchise to one ethnic group.\n\nBabić's administration announced the creation of a Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (or \"SAO Krajina\") on 21 December 1990. On 16 March 1991 another referendum was held which asked \"Are you in favour of the SAO Krajina joining the Republic of Serbia and staying in Yugoslavia with Serbia, Montenegro and others who wish to preserve Yugoslavia?\". With 99.8% voting in favour, the referendum was approved and the Krajina assembly declared that \"the territory of the SAO Krajina is a constitutive part of the unified state territory of the Republic of Serbia\". On 1 April 1991, it declared that it would secede from Croatia. Other Serb-dominated communities in eastern Croatia announced that they would also join SAO Krajina and ceased paying taxes to the Zagreb government, and began implementing its own currency system, army regiments, and postal service.\n\nCroatia held a referendum on independence on 19 May 1991, in which the electorate—minus many Serbs, who chose to boycott it—voted overwhelmingly for independence with the option of confederate union with other Yugoslav states - with 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum by 93 percent. On 25 June 1991, Croatia and Slovenia both declared their independence from Yugoslavia. As the JNA attempted unsuccessfully to suppress Slovenia's independence in the short Slovenian War, clashes between revolting Croatian Serbs and Croatian security forces broke out almost immediately, leaving dozens dead on both sides. Serbs were supported by remnants of the JNA (whose members were now only from Serbia and Montenegro), which provided them weapons. Many Croatians fled their homes in fear, or were forced out by the rebel Serbs. The European Union and United Nations unsuccessfully attempted to broker ceasefires and peace settlements.\nAround August 1991, the leaders of Serbian Krajina and Serbia allegedly agreed to embark on a campaign which the ICTY prosecutors described as a \"joint criminal enterprise\" whose purpose \"was the forcible removal of the majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from approximately one-third of the territory of the Republic of Croatia, an area he planned to become part of a new Serb-dominated state.\" According to testimony given by Milan Babić in his subsequent war crimes trial, during the summer of 1991 the Serbian secret police (under Milošević's command) set up \"a parallel structure of state security and the police of Krajina and units commanded by the state security of Serbia\". Paramilitary groups such as Wolves of Vučjak and White Eagles, funded by the Serbian secret police, were also a key component of this structure.\n\nA wider-scale war was launched in August 1991. Over the following months, a large area of territory, amounting to a third of Croatia, was controlled by the rebel Serbs. The Croatian population suffered heavily, fleeing or evicted with numerous killings, leading to ethnic cleansing. The bulk of the fighting occurred between August and December 1991 when approximately 80,000 Croats were expelled (and some were killed). Many more died and or were displaced in fighting in eastern Slavonia (this territory along the Croatian/Serbian border was not part of the Krajina, and it was the JNA that was the principal actor in that part of the conflict). The total number of exiled Croats and other non-Serbs range from 170,000 (ICTY) up to a quarter of a million people (Human Rights Watch).\n\nIn the latter half of 1991, Croatia was beginning to form an army and their main defenders, the local police, were overpowered by the JNA military who supported rebelled Croatian Serbs. The RSK was located entirely inland, but they soon started advancing deeper into Croatian territory. Among other places, they shelled the Croatian coastal town of Zadar killing over 80 people in nearby areas and damaging the Maslenica Bridge that connected northern and southern Croatia, in the Operation Coast-91. They also tried to overtake Šibenik, but the defenders successfully repelled the attack by JNA, in the Battle of Šibenik. The main city theatre was also bombed by JNA forces. The city of Vukovar, however, was completely devastated by JNA attacks. The city of Vukovar that warded off JNA attacks for months eventually fell, ending the Battle of Vukovar. 2,000 defenders of Vukovar and civilians were killed, 800 went missing and 22,000 were forced into exile. The wounded were taken from Vukovar Hospital to Ovcara near Vukovar where they were executed.\n\nOn 19 December 1991, the SAO Krajina proclaimed itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The Constitution of Serbian Krajina came into effect the same day. On 26 February 1992, the SAO Western Slavonia and SAO Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia were added to the RSK, which initially had only encompassed the territories within the SAO Krajina. The Serb Army of Krajina (Srpska Vojska Krajine, SVK) was officially formed on 19 March 1992. The RSK occupied an area of some 17,028 km² at its greatest extent.\n\nUnder the Vance plan, signed in November 1991, Presidents Tuđman and Milošević agreed to a United Nations peace plan put forward by Cyrus Vance.\nA final ceasefire agreement, the Sarajevo Agreement, was signed by representatives of the two sides in January 1992, paving the way for the implementation of the Vance plan. Four United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) were established in Croatian territory which was claimed by RSK, and the plan called for the withdrawal of the JNA from Croatia and for the return of refugees to their homes in the UNPAs.\n\nThe JNA officially withdrew from Croatia in May 1992 but much of its weaponry and many of its personnel remained in the Serb-held areas and were turned over to the RSK's security forces. Refugees were not allowed to return to their homes and many of the remaining Croats and other nationalities left in the RSK were expelled or killed in the following months. On 21 February 1992, the creation of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was authorised by the UN Security Council for an initial period of a year, to provide security to the UNPAs.\n\nThe agreement effectively froze the front lines for the next three years. Croatia and the RSK had effectively fought each other to a standstill. The Republic of Serbian Krajina was not recognised de jure by any other country or international organisation. Nevertheless, it gained support from Serbia's allies, like Russia.\n\nUNPROFOR was deployed throughout the region to maintain the ceasefire, although in practice its light armament and restricted rules of engagement meant that it was little more than an observer force. It proved wholly unable to ensure that refugees returned to the RSK. Indeed, the rebel Croatian Serb authorities continued to make efforts to ensure that they could \"never\" return, destroying villages and cultural and religious monuments to erase the previous existence of the Croatian inhabitants of the Krajina. Milan Babić later testified that this policy was driven from Belgrade through the Serbian secret police—and ultimately Milošević—who he claimed were in control of all the administrative institutions and armed forces in the Krajina. This would certainly explain why the Yugoslav National Army took the side of the rebelled Croatian Serbs in spite of its claims to be acting as a \"peacekeeping\" force. Milošević denied this, claiming that Babić had made it up \"out of fear\".\n\nThe Army of Serbian Krajina frequently attacked neighbouring Bihać enclave (then in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) with heavy artillery.\nWith the creation of new Croatian counties on 30 December 1992, the Croatian government also set aside two autonomous regions (\"kotar\") for ethnic Serbs in the areas of Krajina:\n\nHowever, Serbs considered this too late, as it was not the amount of autonomy they wanted, and by now they had declared de facto independence.\n\nThe districts never actually functioned since they were located within the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina. Existence of the Autonomous District of Glina was also provided in the draft of the Z-4 plan, that was rejected.\nAfter Operation Storm, the application of the law which allowed autonomy would be temporarily suspended. In 2000 this part of the law was formally repealed.\n\nThe partial implementation of the Vance Plan drove a wedge between the governments of the RSK and Serbia, the RSK's principal backer and supplier of fuel, arms and money. Milan Babić strongly opposed the Vance Plan but was overruled by the RSK's assembly.\n\nOn 26 February 1992, Babić was deposed and replaced as President of the RSK by Goran Hadžić, a Milošević loyalist. Babić remained involved in RSK politics but as a considerably weaker figure.\n\nThe position of the RSK eroded steadily over the following three years. On the surface, the RSK had all the trappings of a state: army, parliament, president, government and ministries, currency and stamps. However its economy was wholly dependent on support from the rump Yugoslavia, which had the effect of importing that country's hyperinflation.\n\nThe economic situation soon became disastrous. By 1994, only 36,000 of the RSK's 430,000 citizens were employed. The war had severed the RSK's trade links with the rest of Croatia, leaving its few industries idle. With few natural resources of its own it had to import most of the goods and fuel it required. Agriculture was devastated, and operated at little more than a subsistence level. Professionals went to Serbia or elsewhere to escape the republic's economic hardships. To make matters worse, the RSK's government was grossly corrupt and the region became a haven for black marketeering and other criminal activity. It was clear by the mid-1990s that without a peace deal or support from Yugoslavia the RSK was not economically viable. This was especially evident in Belgrade, where the RSK had become an unwanted economic and political burden for Milošević. Much to his frustration, the rebel Croatian Serbs rebuffed his government's demands to settle the conflict. \nIn July 1992 the RSK issued its own currency, the Krajina dinar (HRKR), in parallel with the Yugoslav dinar. This was followed by the \"October dinar\" (HRKO), first issued on 1 October 1993 and equal to 1,000,000 Reformed Dinar, and the \"1994 dinar\", first issued on 1 January 1994, and equal to 1,000,000,000 October dinar.\nThe RSK's weakness also adversely affected its armed forces, the Vojska Srpske Krajine (VSK). Since the 1992 ceasefire agreement, Croatia had spent heavily on importing weapons and training its armed forces with assistance from American contractors. In contrast, the VSK had grown steadily weaker, with its soldiers poorly motivated, trained and equipped. There were only about 55,000 of them to cover a front of some 600 km in Croatia plus 100 km along the border with the Bihać pocket in Bosnia. With 16,000 stationed in eastern Slavonia, only about 39,000 were left to defend the main part of the RSK. Overall, only 30,000 were capable of full mobilization, yet they faced a far stronger Croatian army. Also, political divisions between Hadžić and Babić occasionally led to physical and sometimes even armed confrontations between their supporters; Babić himself was assaulted and beaten in an incident in Benkovac.\n\nIn January 1993 the revitalized Croatian army attacked the Serbian positions around Maslenica in southern Croatia which curtailed their access to the sea via Novigrad.\n\nIn mid-1993, the RSK authorities started a campaign to formally create a United Serbian Republic.\n\nIn a second offensive in September 1993 the Croatian army overran the Medak pocket in the southern Krajina in a push to regain Serb-held Croatian territory. This action was halted by international diplomacy but although the rebel Croatian Serbs brought reinforcements forward fairly quickly, the strength of the Croatian forces proved superior. Hadžić sent an urgent request to Belgrade for reinforcements, arms and equipment. In response, around 4,000 paramilitaries under the command of Vojislav Šešelj (the White Eagles) and \"Arkan\" (the Serb Volunteer Guard) arrived to bolster the VSK.\n\nFollowing the rejection by both sides of the Z-4 plan for reintegration, the RSK's end came in 1995, when Croatian forces gained control of SAO Western Slavonia in Operation Flash (May) followed by the biggest part of occupied Croatia in Operation Storm (August). The Krajina Serb Supreme Defence Council met under president Milan Martić to discuss the situation. A decision was reached at 16:45 to \"start evacuating the population unfit for military service from the municipalities of Knin, Benkovac, Obrovac, Drniš and Gračac.\" The RSK was disbanded and most of its Serb population (from 150,000 to 200,000 people) fled. Only 5,000 to 6,000 people remained, mostly the elderly. Croatian historian Ivo Goldstein wrote, \"The reasons for the Serb exodus are complex. Some had to leave because the Serb army had forced them to, while others feared the revenge of the Croatian army or of their former Croat neighbours, whom they had driven away and whose homes they had mostly looted (and it was later shown that this fear was far from groundless).\".\n\nMost of the refugees ended up in Serbia, Bosnia and eastern Slavonia. Some of those who remained were murdered, tortured and forcibly expelled by the Croatian Army and police.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2012, the ICTY had prosecuted Croatian generals Ante Gotovina, Mladen Markač and Ivan Čermak in the Trial of Gotovina et al for their involvement in crimes committed during and in the aftermath of Operation Storm. The indictment and the subsequent trial on charges of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war described several killings, widespread arson and looting committed by Croatian soldiers. In April 2011, Gotovina and Markač were convicted to prison sentences, while Čermak was acquitted. Gotovina and Markač appealed the verdict and in November 2012 the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY overturned their convictions, acquitting them.\n\nThe parts of the former RSK in eastern Croatia (along the Danube) remained in place, in what was previously the SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia.\n\nIn 1995, Milan Milanović, formerly a Republic of Serbian Krajina official, signed the Erdut Agreement as a representative of the Serbian side. This agreement, co-signed by the representative of the Croatian Government, was sponsored by the United Nations, and it set up a transitional period during which the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) peacekeeping mission would oversee a peaceful reintegration of this territory into Croatia, starting on 15 January 1996. In 1998, the UNTAES mission was complete and the territory was formally returned to Croatia. Based on the Erdut Agreement, the Joint Council of Municipalities was established in the region in 1997.\n\nAfter the peaceful reintegration, two Croatian islands on the Danube, the Island of Šarengrad and the Island of Vukovar, remained under Serbian military control. In 2004, Serbian military was withdrawn from the islands and replaced with Serbian police. The islands remain an open question as the Croatian side insists on applying Badinter Arbitration Committee decisions.\n\nIn 1995 a Croatian court sentenced former RSK president Goran Hadžić \"in absentia\" to 20 years in prison for rocket attacks on Šibenik and Vodice. In 1999 he was sentenced to an additional 20 years for war crimes in Tenja, near Osijek, and in 2002 Croatia's state attorney brought another indictment against him for the murder of almost 1,300 Croats in Vukovar, Osijek, Vinkovci, Županja and elsewhere. On 4 June 2004, the ICTY indicted him on 14 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. In 2011 he was arrested and extradited to the Hague, where his initial trial hearing was held on 25 July the same year.\n\nAccording to the indictment of prosecutor Carla Del Ponte against Slobodan Milošević at the ICTY, the Croat and non-Serb population from the 1991 census was approximately as follows:\nThus Serbs comprised 52.3% and Croats 35.8% of the population of SAO Krajina respectively in 1991.\n\nAccording to data set forth at the meeting of the Government of the RSK in July 1992, its ethnic composition was 88% Serbs, 7% Croats, 5% others. As of November 1993, less than 400 ethnic Croats still resided in UNPA Sector South, and between 1,500 and 2,000 remained in UNPA Sector North.\n\nTowns which were at one point part of RSK or occupied by the RSK's army:\n\nSerbian Krajina has been described as a \"proto-state\" and \"parastate\".\n\nDuring its existence, this entity did not achieve international recognition. On 29 November 1991, the Badinter commission concluded that Yugoslavia was \"in dissolution\" and that the republics – including Croatia – should be recognized as independent states when they asked so. They also assigned these republics territorial integrity. For most of the world this was a reason to recognize Croatia. However, Serbia did not accept the conclusions of the commission in that period and recognized Croatia only after Croatian military actions (Oluja and Bljesak) and the Dayton agreement.\n\nOn 20 November 1991 Lord Carrington asked Badinter commission: \"Does the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as one of the constituent peoples of Yugoslavia, have the right to self-determination?\" The commission concluded on 11 January 1992 \"that the Serbian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia is entitled to all the rights concerned to minorities and ethnic groups[...]\" and \"that the Republics must afford the members of those minorities and ethnic groups all the human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized in international law, including, where appropriate, the right to choose their nationality\".\n\nMilan Babić, former President of Serbian Krajina, testified to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) that Krajina was provided with weapons by Slobodan Milošević's government in Serbia, and that Krajina was economically and financially dependent upon Serbia. Babić testified that Milošević held \"de facto\" control over both the Army of Serbian Krajina and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) during its actions in Krajina via an alternate chain of command through the Serbian police.\n\n\n\n\nThere existed a self-proclaimed government in exile for the Republic of Serbian Krajina. This government existed for a short time period after Operation Storm, but was reconstituted in 2005. This self-proclaimed government has changed the official name of the Republic of Serbian Krajina to Republic of Serb-Krajina. At the Belgrade meeting, the former legislators declared themselves to be the legitimate continuation of the RSK government and called for the re-creation of the RSK on the basis of the 1994 Z-4 plan, which had called for Krajina to have a status of \"more than , less than independence\" within Croatia. They announced that a parliamentary election would be held and that the new name of the self-proclaimed state would be \"Republic of Serb-Krajina\". The meeting elected Milorad Buha, member of the Serbian Radical Party, as prime minister as well as six ministers without portfolio whose names were not revealed.\n\nThis move was criticized by many, including top Serbian and Croatian government officials, as well as senior representatives of Serbs in Croatia. They all stated that such a meeting would harm Serb-Croat reconciliation and relations between the communities in Croatia. It was pointed out that the Krajina Serb legislators had rejected the Z-4 proposal when it had originally been put forward. Some Serbian nationalists also criticized the move, saying that a government in exile should have been created as soon as possible after Operation Storm, not 10 years later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "286527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286527", "title": "Separatism", "text": "Separatism\n\nA common definition of separatism is that it is the advocacy of a state of cultural, ethnic, tribal, religious, racial, governmental or gender separation from the larger group. While it often refers to full political secession, separatist groups may seek nothing more than greater autonomy. While some critics may equate separatism with religious segregation, racist segregation, or sexist segregation, most separatists argue that separation by choice may serve useful purposes and is not the same as government-enforced segregation. There is some academic debate about this definition, and in particular how it relates to secessionism, as has been discussed online.\n\nSeparatist groups practice a form of identity politics, or political activity and theorizing founded in the shared experiences of injustice visited upon members of certain social groups. Such groups believe attempts at integration with dominant groups compromise their identity and ability to pursue greater self-determination. However, economic and political factors usually are critical in creating strong separatist movements as opposed to less ambitious identity movements.\n\nGroups may have one or more motivations for separation, including:\n\n[[File:Battle of Kenesaw Mountian.png|thumb|upright|right|In 1861, the [[American Civil War]] started after a separatist movement of [[Confederate States of America|southern US states]] seceded from the [[United States]].]]\nHow far separatist demands will go toward full independence, and whether groups pursue constitutional and nonviolent or armed violence, depend on a variety of economic, political, social and cultural factors, including movement leadership and the government's response. Governments may respond in a number of ways, some of which are mutually exclusive. Some include:\nSome governments suppress any separatist movement in their own country, but support separatism in other countries.\n\n[[Ethnic]] separatism is based more on cultural and linguistic differences than [[Religion|religious]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] differences, which also may exist. Ethnic separatist movements include the following:\n\n[[File:Paisos catalans belfast.jpg|thumb|upright|right|190px|Mural for Catalan independence in [[Belfast]].]] [[Image:3 Marsz Autonomii 012.jpg|thumb|upright|right|190px|[[Silesia]]ns demonstrating in [[Katowice]] (in Silesia).]][[Image:StDavidsDay.jpg|thumb|upright|right|190px|Welsh demonstrating in [[Cardiff]].]] [[File:2015-04-24.

They oppose interracial marriage and integration with other races and seek separate schools, businesses, churches and other institutions; and often separate societies, territories, countries, and governments.\n[[File:Aztlán in United States (US48).svg|thumb|upright|Territories considered for \"Aztlán\"]]\n\n[[Religion|Religious]] separatist groups and sects want to withdraw from some larger religious groups and/or believe they should interact primarily with coreligionists.\n\n\nThe relationship between gender and separatism is complex and warrants more research. [[Separatist feminism]] is women's choosing to separate from ostensibly male-defined, male-dominated institutions, relationships, roles and activities. [[Lesbian separatism]] advocates [[lesbian]]ism as the logical result of feminism.

It is the armed wing of the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP).\n\nThe Shan State Army was founded in 24 April 1964 and The Shan State Progress Party was founded in 1971, for the political wing of SSA. In 1989, the SSPP signed a ceasefire in 1989 after negotiations with the SLORC and was able to obtain a degree of autonomy for the areas under its control, establishing the \"Special Region 3\" of the Shan State. This area included Nam Kham, Langkho, Hsipaw, Kyauk Mae, Mong Hsu, Tang Yang, Mongyai, Kehsi and Lashio Township. The size of the armed group at that time was of about 4.000 fighters. Even after having signed a ceasefire, the Burmese military continued to attack the Shan State Army-North areas.\n\nAlthough the SSA-N is more conciliatory towards the government than other armed Shan separatist groups, in 2005 it abandoned its base rather than disarm. At one point the Burmese government wished the Shan State Army - North to join its border guard force. Two of the three brigades reportedly agreed to join the border guard, while the other refused.\n\nIn 2014 the group has clashed with the Burmese army in Kehsi Mansam Township, home to the SSA-N Wanhai headquarters.\n\nBeginning on 6 October 2015 a large scale offensive by the Tatmadaw comprising 20 Burma Army battalions has been launched in central Shan State. The aim of the military is to seize Shan ceasefire territories in Kehsi, Mong Nawng, Mong Hsu and Tangyan townships, using heavy artillery and with fighter jet and helicopter gunship air support to indiscriminately shell and bomb civilian areas. These attacks have displaced thousands of Shan, Palaung, Lisu and Lahu people causing a new humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe SSA-N originally had three brigades: the 1st, 3rd, and 7th brigades, but currently only has two.\n\n\n"}

Forms of subsidies include direct housing subsidies, non-profit housing, public housing, rent supplements, and some forms of co-operative and private sector housing. In the United States, subsidized housing is often called \"affordable housing.\"\n\nThere are scientific research suggesting that actions to facilitate people's access to housing contribute to lower poverty situations.\n\nSome co-operative housing may offer subsidized units, but its main mandate is not subsidization. Its operating mandate is to offer non profit housing, where the rents or housing charges as they are called, goes back into the maintenance of the building instead of the profit of a landlord. Co-operative housing is controlled by the members of the co-op, which is run by a board of directors. There is no outside landlord. In most cases, all residents of the co-op become members and are owners, and agree to follow certain by-laws. Some co-ops are subsidized housing because they receive government funding to support a rent-geared-to-income program for low-income residents. There are other co-ops that are market-rate and limited equity, these types of cooperatives do not receive government funding and are not subsidized housing. In addition to providing affordable housing, some co-ops serve the needs of specific communities, including seniors, artists, and persons with disabilities.\n\nExamples of co-operative housing include: College Houses, Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), and Habitat '67, and regular rental housing be they regular looking apartments, townhouses or high end buildings such as those overlooking Central Park in New York City.\n\nHousing subsidies are government financial assistance to help provide housing. The largest housing subsidy in the US is the home mortgage interest deduction, which allows homeowners with mortgages on first homes, second homes, and even boats with bathrooms to lower their taxes owed. The cost to the federal government of the mortgage interest deductions in 2012 was approximately $110 billion. Some states also have the mortgage interest deduction provision. The majority of the home mortgage interest deduction goes to the top 5% income earners in the United States. Some housing subsidies are also provided to low income tenants in renting housing. These subsidies are often defined by whether the subsidy is given to the landlord and then criteria are set for the tenants they can lease to or whether the subsidy is given to the tenant, typically as a voucher, and they are allowed to find suitable private housing. The subsidy amount is typically based on the tenant's income, usually the difference between the rent and 30% of the tenant's gross income, but other formulas have been used.\n\nIn rare cases a financial institution or non-profit organization will provide mortgage loans at rates that are not profitable for the sake of a specific group. In Canada one such organization is Non-Profit Housing Subsidies Canada which provides subsidized mortgage loans to employees and volunteers of other non-profit organizations.\n\nNon-profit housing\n\nNon-profit housing is owned and managed by private non-profit groups such as churches, ethnocultural communities or by governments. Many units are provided by community development corporations (CDCs). They use private funding and government subsidies to support a rent-geared-towards-income program for low-income tenants.\n\nPublic housing is real property owned and managed by the government. Tenants must meet specific eligibility requirements.\n\nRent supplements are subsidies paid by the government to private landlords who accept low-income tenants. The supplements make up the difference between rental \"market price\" and the amount of rent paid by tenants, for example 30% of the tenants income. A notable example of a rent supplement in the United States is Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937 ().\n\nAccording to a 2018 study, major cuts in rental subsidies for poor households in the United Kingdom led to lowered house prices.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26600238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26600238", "title": "Swing producer", "text": "Swing producer\n\nSwing producer is a supplier or a close oligopolistic group of suppliers of any commodity, controlling its global deposits and possessing large spare production capacity. A swing producer is able to increase or decrease commodity supply at minimal additional internal cost, and thus able to influence prices and balance the markets, providing downside protection in the short to middle term. Examples of swing producers include Saudi Arabia in oil, Russia in potash fertilizers, and, historically, the De Beers Company in diamonds.\n\nBy modeling the swing producer behavior, John Morecroft describes two modes: normal swing mode and punitive mode. Usually in the normal mode, the swing producer responds to market price fluctuations by marginally increasing or decreasing its output in order to maintain stable prices for all producers. However, independent participants can take unjust advantage of the reduced supply and increase their output in order to win a larger market share. In such cases, the swing producer switches to the punitive mode and greatly increases its product output in order to reduce prices, causing losses for other producers and making them cooperate.\n\n\n"}

One (officially numbered as Question 3) concerned transitional justice and the treatment of contentious properties acquired by the Kuomintang, whilst a counter-referendum (Question 4) was initiated by the Kuomintang on alleged corruption in politics. The referendum was considered to be a dress rehearsal for a more contentious referendum on support for Taiwan admission to the United Nations to be held in March.\n\nAlthough a majority of voters voted in favour of both proposals, voter turnout was only 26%, well below the 50% required to make the results valid. The legislative elections had a turnout of around 58%.\n\nThis question was officially championed by former premier Yu Shyi-kun.\nThis question was officially championed by former finance minister Wang Chien-shien.\n\nThe Kuomintang urged voters to boycott both referendums to prevent them from reaching the 50% voter turnout needed to for validate the result, and there was much pre-election controversy over the format and structure of the balloting. Initially, the Kuomintang was in favor of a two-step balloting system where voters would vote for the legislative elections and then for the referendum, while the DPP was in favor of a one-step system in which voters would get all four ballots to vote. The final system was a one-step, two-table system in which voters would get the ballots at separate tables but would mark the ballot papers together.\n\n"}

{"id": "12320795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12320795", "title": "The Elders (organization)", "text": "The Elders (organization)\n\nThe Elders is an international non-governmental organisation of public figures noted as elder statesmen, peace activists, and human rights advocates, who were brought together by Nelson Mandela in 2007. They describe themselves as \"independent global leaders working together for peace and human rights\". The goal Mandela set for the Elders was to use their \"almost 1,000 years of collective experience\" to work on solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems such as climate change, HIV/AIDS, and poverty, as well as to \"use their political independence to help resolve some of the world's most intractable conflicts\".\n\nThe Elders is, as of November 2018, chaired by Mary Robinson, and consists of eight Elders and five Elders Emeritus. Kofi Annan served as chair from 2013 until his death in 2018; Desmond Tutu served for six years as chair before stepping down in May 2013, and remains an Elder Emeritus.\n\nThe group was initiated by Richard Branson and musician and human rights activist Peter Gabriel, together with anti-apartheid activist and former South African President Nelson Mandela. Mandela announced the formation of the group on his eighty-ninth birthday on 18 July 2007 in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nAt the launch ceremony, an empty chair was left on stage for Aung San Suu Kyi, the human rights activist who was a political prisoner in Burma/Myanmar at the time. Present at the launch were Kofi Annan, Jimmy Carter, Graça Machel, Nelson Mandela, Mary Robinson, Desmond Tutu, Muhammad Yunus, and Li Zhaoxing. Members who were not present at the launch were Ela Bhatt, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Lakhdar Brahimi, and Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Martti Ahtisaari joined The Elders in September 2009, Hina Jilani and Ernesto Zedillo in July 2013, and Ricardo Lagos in June 2016. In June 2017, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also joined the group.\n\nThe Elders are funded by a group of donors who are named on the advisory council.\n\n\n\n\nThe work of The Elders is coordinated and supported by a small team based in London. The team is headed by David Nussbaum, who was appointed chief executive officer (CEO) in October 2016.\n\nThe Elders are independently funded by a group of donors, who also make up The Elders' Advisory Council: Richard Branson and Jean Oelwang (Virgin Unite), Peter Gabriel (The Peter Gabriel Foundation), Kathy Bushkin Calvin (The United Nations Foundation), Jeremy Coller and Lulit Solomon (J Coller Foundation), Randy Newcomb (Humanity United), Jeffrey Skoll and Sally Osberg (Skoll Foundation), Amy Towers (The Nduna Foundation), Jeff Towers (Jeffrey Towers and Associates), and Marieke van Schaik (Dutch Postcode Lottery). Mabel van Oranje, former CEO of The Elders, sits on the advisory council in her capacity as Advisory Committee Chair of \"Girls Not Brides\".\n\nThe Elders publish annual reports detailing the organisation's income and spending activity.\n\nThe Elders carry out initiatives in two broad areas: promoting dialogue and building peace; and supporting efforts to alleviate human suffering, particularly caused by extreme poverty, injustice, or intolerance.\n\nAt the Women Deliver conference in May 2016, The Elders launched a new initiative to campaign for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as part of their efforts to support and implement the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe initiative focuses on four areas: \n1) Promoting UHC as the best way to achieve the health Sustainable Development Goal. \n2) Promoting UHC's health, economic and political benefits; \n3) Prioritising women, children and adolescents in UHC's implementation; \n4) Reiterating the role of public financing in sustainably funding UHC.\n\nIn September 2016, Gro Harlem Brundtland delivered a keynote speech at a high-level event on the sidelines of the 71st UN General Assembly in New York. Joined by Margaret Chan, Director-General of the WHO and health ministers of South Africa and Thailand, she called for courageous leadership to achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2030.\n\nIn January 2017, Kofi Annan sent letters to Indian leaders to commend the progress made in reforming the Indian healthcare system, and Gro Harlem Brundtland and Ernesto Zedillo delivered keynote speeches at the Prince Mahidol Awards Conference in Bangkok, Thailand. Gro Harlem Brundtland highlighted the importance of inclusive health policy and Ernesto Zedillo explained how to sustainably implement Universal Health Coverage.\n\nHighlighting the link between access to affordable health care and gender equality, in January 2017, two members of The Elders expressed concern at the re-introduction of the Mexico City Policy by the recently inaugurated President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. The pro-abortion activist Gro Harlem Brundtland said: \"This decision puts the health of women and children at risk\" and warned that \"vulnerable people will die unnecessarily.\"\n\nIn October 2015, Kofi Annan, Gro Brundtland and Hina Jilani joined UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein and the Director General of the International Organization for Migration William L. Swing at an event on the refugee and migration crisis at the Graduate Institute in Geneva.\n\nDuring the event, Gro Harlem Brundtland said \"Too many leaders are not only shy when it comes to making this case to their people, they fundamentally lack the courage to do so…\". Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein also rejected the dehumanising rhetoric adopted by some politicians towards refugees and migrants.\n\nAhead of the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants in September 2016, Kofi Annan, Maarti Ahtisaari and Lakhdar Brahimi visited Germany to launch a report calling for political will to ensure that responsibility is truly shared between countries, and for the vulnerable are protected. They met the then-Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and Federal President Joachim Gauck, and also visited a refugee resettlement centre in Berlin to hear directly from new arrivals to Germany.\n\nThe report \"In Challenge Lies Opportunity: How the world must respond to refugees and mass migration\" outlined four key principles which The Elders believe should be at the heart of the international response to refugees and mass migration:\n\n\nThree Elders attended the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September 2016, which was held during the 71st Session of the United Nations' General Assembly. Martti Ahtisaari, Hina Jilani and Mary Robinson spoke at the high-level Round Tables which addressed different aspects of the topic: vulnerabilities of refugees and migrants, responsibility-sharing and respect for international law, and addressing the drivers of migration, respectively.\n\nIn January 2017, The Elders condemned the US refugee ban, enacted by the recently inaugurated President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Kofi Annan said: \"It is deeply regrettable that a nation of immigrants should turn its back so harshly on refugees escaping violence and war.\n\nAt the Munich Security Conference in February 2015, the Elders launched the \"Stronger UN\" initiative, which promoted a series of reforms to strengthen the United Nations. This included a review of the composition of the Security Council and of the appointment of the Secretary-General.\n\nNoting that seventy years since its founding, the UN was still falling short of its Charter pledge \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\", The Elders proposed to:\n\n\nAt the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016, several Elders featured in a video alongside Salil Shetty, Secretary-General of Amnesty International and Simon Adams, Executive-Director of the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect, calling for veto restraint and increased cooperation amongst the Permanent Members of the UN Security Council to prevent mass atrocities and save lives.\n\nIn 2016, some of The Elders' recommendations on the selection of the new Secretary-General were adopted by the UN. For the first time, the names of candidates for the position of Secretary-General were publicly circulated, and all declared candidates participated in public hearings in the General Assembly. These changes led to a notable increase in the transparency of the selection process.\n\nPrior to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, The Elders launched the Climate Change initiative together with their grandchildren. The Elders believe that strong leadership is required at all levels in order to deliver a sustainable future. They strongly welcomed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change reached at the COP21 summit in December 2015, and are working to ensure it is now implemented fully and fairly.\n\nThe Elders believe that as climate change goes hand in hand with sustainable development, a holistic policy approach that is able to incorporate the voice of civil society and grassroots activities is needed. In this regard, in 2012, The Elders engaged with four young activists in an inter-generational debate on the change needed to secure a sustainable future for the planet, in the run-up to the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Similarly, in 2016, Elders such as Mary Robinson and Gro Harlem Brundtland participated in the Social Good Summit in New York, in which they took part in dialogues with global climate and young activists.\n\nWhile The Elders condemned the announcement in June 2017 by President Trump of his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, they note that this has in fact galvanised action by states and cities. They maintain the need to hold governments and businesses to their word so that the deal is implemented in full and in good faith, with adequate means to ratchet up ambition and have reiterated this in subsequent meetings including with Pope Francis and President Macron in late 2017.\n\nCommitment to gender equality is a cornerstone of The Elders' engagement in securing dignity and rights for all. From Universal Health Coverage to climate change and mass migration, to peacebuilding and protecting human rights defenders, The Elders believe that women and girls have specific needs that demand appropriately-tailored policy responses.\n\nThis includes considering the impact of religion and tradition on women's rights, addressing the harmful practice of child marriage, supporting efforts to promote women as peacemakers, highlighting the specific burdens and responsibilities women face in societies most threatened by climate change, highlighting the scale of violence against women, addressing the effect of impunity in prolonging the occurrence of sexual violence in conflict —including exploitation by UN Peacekeeping missions—and prioritising the health needs of women in the implementation of Universal Health Coverage.\n\nIn July 2009 The Elders called for an end to harmful and discriminatory practices that are justified on the grounds of religion and tradition. Fernando Henrique Cardoso said that \"the idea that God is behind discrimination is unacceptable\" Jimmy Carter stated that the Elders call upon \"all leaders to challenge and change the harmful teachings and practices, no matter how ingrained, which justify discrimination against women. We ask, in particular, that leaders of all religions have the courage to acknowledge and emphasise the positive messages of dignity and equality that all the world's major faiths share\". \"New York Times\" columnist Nicholas Kristof later wrote that \"The Elders are right that religious groups should stand up for a simple ethical principle: any person's human rights should be sacred, and not depend on something as earthly as their genitals.\"\n\nWhen Nelson Mandela founded The Elders in 2007, he told the group to listen to the marginalised – especially young people. The Elders' work with young people has consisted in meeting many passionate young people on peace, equality and protecting the environment. \nIn 2012, The Elders and four young activists began an inter-generational debate about the change needed to secure a sustainable future, in the run-up to the U N Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20).\n\nBeside collaborating with young climate activists, The Elders have also hold roundtable discussions on African leadership, debated Egypt's revolution with young people in Cairo, discussed the refugee crisis and UN reform with young students at Sciences Po in Paris and, featured guest blogs from youth contributors on their website.\n\nThe Elders support greater openness and dialogue between Iran and the international community, and encourage Iran to play a stabilising role in the wider Middle East.\n\nIn their first visit to Iran as a group, The Elders travelled to Tehran in January 2014 to meet privately with the Iranian leadership. Delegation leader Kofi Annan and fellow Elders Martti Ahtisaari, Desmond Tutu and Ernesto Zedillo held a series of productive meetings on the easing of regional tensions; the spread of extremist violence internationally; human rights; and the Syrian crisis. They were encouraged by Iran's new spirit of openness and dialogue with the outside world.\n\nIn February 2015, The Elders met again with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, on the margins of the Munich Security Conference, to encourage a successful conclusion of the P5+1 nuclear negotiations and to discuss solutions to regional security issues.\n\nIn July 2015, The Elders welcomed the agreement reached on Iran's nuclear programme between Iran, the P5+1 countries (US, Russia, China, UK, France and Germany) and the EU. They believe the agreement represents a historic opportunity to end decades of animosity between Iran and the West, especially the US, and to rebuild relationships on the basis of trust and mutual respect.\n\nIn 2016, The Elders issued a press release welcoming the lifting of sanctions against Iran as part of the implementation of the P5+1 nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which they continued to support throughout the year.\n\nIn January 2017 The Elders issued a statement following the death of former Iranian President Rafsanjani, stating that \"Iran has lost one of its most influential leaders and a strong voice for reform and for the improvement of regional relations.\"\n\nAt the Munich Security Conference in February 2017 Ernesto Zedillo and Lakhdar Brahimi met again with Javad Zarif. They also hosted a panel debate to defend the Iran Nuclear Agreement, joined by HRH Prince Turki of Saudi Arabia and HE Sheikh Hamad of Qatar.\n\nThe long-running Israeli–Palestinian conflict has been one of The Elders' top priorities since the group was founded. Given the far-reaching impact of the unresolved conflict and the power imbalance between the parties, The Elders believe the international community has a vital role to play in helping Israelis and Palestinians reach a lasting solution. Particularly, they insist that the peace efforts must be based on the respect for universal human rights and international humanitarian law, as well as that the siege on Gaza must be permanently lifted and that the boundaries between Israel and a viable Palestinian state must be based on the 1967 borders, including a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.\n\nIn this regard, in August 2009, The Elders visited Israel and the West Bank to draw attention to the impact of the long-running conflict on ordinary people, and to support efforts by Israelis and Palestinians to promote peace. They were joined on the trip by Richard Branson and Jeff Skoll. The Elders met Israeli President Shimon Peres, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, and local peace activists involved in non-violent demonstrations. The report of their visit said they hoped it would \"spur leaders and ordinary citizens alike to actions that will further peace, human rights and justice for all in the Middle East\".\n\nFour Elders, Mary Robinson, Ela Bhatt, Lakhdar Brahimi, and Jimmy Carter, returned to the Middle East in October 2010 to visit Egypt, Gaza, Israel, Jordan, Syria and the West Bank. The aim was to encourage peace efforts with an emphasis on the need to reach \"a just and secure peace for all\" based on international law. Throughout the trip, The Elders held discussions on the peace process with political leaders, representatives of human rights organisations, student and youth groups, women's groups, business, civil society and opinion leaders.\n\nDuring the trip, Mary Robinson said that \"As Elders, we believe the two-state solution has the potential to deliver peace – but a more energetic and comprehensive approach is needed.\" The Elders also called for an immediate end to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, describing it as an \"illegal collective punishment\" and \"an impediment to peace.\" The Elders released a report outlining their conclusions following the visit, which they hoped would \"be a helpful contribution to peace efforts.\"\n\nIn October 2012, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson returned to the region, travelling to Israel, the West Bank and Egypt.\n\nIn May 2015, Jimmy Carter and Gro Harlem Brundtland visited Israel and Palestine and ended their visit to Israel and Palestine with a call for meaningful steps to stop the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and reconcile the different Palestinian factions. They held talks with President Mahmoud Abbas and senior political figures from both Israel and Palestine, civil society groups and ordinary citizens to hear their perspectives and convey The Elders' commitment to a fair and enduring resolution to the conflict.\n\nThe Elders supported the diplomatic efforts led by the French Government to keep the two-state solution alive through high-level conferences in Paris in June 2016 and in January 2017. They also welcomed the UN Security Council Resolution in December 2016 that called on Israel to immediately halt all settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nThey fully support the Arab Peace Initiative, which calls for normal, peaceful and secure relations between Israel and the Arab world, in return for Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\n\nIn 2017 the Elder's condemned Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel stating this, 'greatly harms peace processes.'\n\nA delegation of Elders visited Myanmar for the first time as a group in September 2013. In their meetings with senior officials in the government, political leaders, religious leaders and civil society groups, Martti Ahtisaari, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Jimmy Carter explored how best they could support peace and inclusive development in the country.\n\nThe Elders returned to Myanmar in March and December 2014. In the first trip, they travelled to Nay Pyi Taw and Myitkyina, Kachin State, in Myanmar and to Mae Sot and Chiang Mai in Thailand and deepened their relations key interlocutors and focused particularly on representatives of the country's ethnic minorities. In the second one, they visited Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar and Chiang Mai in Thailand, and they reaffirmed their efforts to encourage sustained progress in Myanmar's transition process and called for an immediate end to the conflict.\nThe Elders welcomed the elections in Myanmar in November 2015 and the victory of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) in forming a civilian-led government.\n\nIn August 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi invited Kofi Annan to chair an independent Commission to assess the situation in Rakhine State, including the Rohingya community. The Commission published its final report in August 2017 and put forward recommendations to surmount the political, socio-economic and humanitarian challenges that currently face Rakhine State.\n\nOn publishing the report, Kofi Annan said: \"Unless concerted action – led by the government and aided by all sectors of the government and society – is taken soon, we risk the return of another cycle of violence and\" radicalisation\", which will further deepen the chronic poverty that afflicts Rakhine State.\"\n\nThe Elders supported Kofi Annan in this role, which he undertook in his own capacity.\n\nAt their October 2017 board meeting, The Elders issued a statement expressing their deep dismay and concern at the wave of violence and destruction that swept through Rakhine State from August 2017, displacing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims. They called on Myanmar's government and military leaders to allow displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh and other countries to return, and for their human rights and safety to be protected.\n\nZimbabwe has been a key focus of concern for The Elders since the group was formed in 2007. Once one of Africa's strongest economies, Zimbabwe has suffered sustained political and economic crises over the last two decades and its leaders are failing in their responsibilities to the country's people.\n\nIn November 2008, three members of the Elders – Jimmy Carter, Graça Machel and Kofi Annan – planned to visit Zimbabwe to draw attention to the country's escalating humanitarian and economic crises. A day before their planned travel to Harare, they were informed that they would be refused entry. Jimmy Carter said it was the first time he had been denied permission [link] to enter any country. The three Elders stayed in Johannesburg and were briefed by Zimbabwean political and business leaders, aid workers, donors, UN agencies and civil society representatives, many of whom travelled from Zimbabwe to see them. The Elders also held meetings with the leaders of South Africa and Botswana. At a press conference after their meetings, they said the situation was \"worse than they could have imagined\" and called for greater regional and global effort to alleviate the suffering of Zimbabweans. Graça Machel said that \"the state is no longer able to offer basic services. It can no longer feed, educate or care for its citizens. It is failing its people.\"\n\nFollowing the resignation of President Robert Mugabe in November, 2017 The Elders urged all stakeholders in Zimbabwe and the region to work together for a genuine democratic transition. In 2018 and beyond they will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe, civil society and human rights defenders in holding the country's new leaders to account.\n\nThe Elders are committed to ending the practice of child marriage. In June 2011, Desmond Tutu, Gro Brundtland and Mary Robinson visited Amhara, Ethiopia, to learn about child marriage in a region where half of all female children are married before the age of 15.[109]\n\nAlongside their fellow Elder Ela Bhatt, Tutu, Brundtland and Robinson also travelled to Bihar, India in February 2012. Together, they visited Jagriti, a youth-led project aimed at preventing child marriage, and encouraged the state government's efforts to tackle the issue.\n\nIn 2011, The Elders initiated Girls Not Brides: The Global Partnership to End Child Marriage, which brings together civil society organisations from around the world that work to tackle child marriage. The global partnership aims to support activists working for change at the grassroots and call on governments and global organisations to make ending child marriage an international priority. Girls Not Brides became a fully independent organization, spun off from The Elders, in 2013.\n\nIn July 2016, The Elders welcomed action taken by leaders in The Gambia, Tanzania and Uganda to end child marriage, as part of the African Union's continent-wide campaign to eradicate the harmful practice.\n\nFollowing widespread violence after long-awaited presidential elections in November 2010, The Elders committed to support efforts by the Ivorian government and civil society to promote reconciliation and healing in the country. Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan and Mary Robinson visited Ivory Coast on 1–2 May 2011 during which, they not only \"encouraged reconciliation and healing\", but they also emphasised the importance of improving the country's security situation. Beside meeting the President Alassane Ouattara, Prime Minister Guillaume Soro and former President Laurent Gbagbo, they also brought together civil society organisations, including women's groups seeking a role in the peace process, and encouraged them to work together towards national reconciliation. They also visited a camp for internally displaced people to hear directly from ordinary people affected by the conflict.\n\nKofi Annan returned to Ivory Coast in January 2012 and October 2013 to support the ongoing reconciliation process. During his visit, he noted the progress that had been made and encouraged all Ivorians to participate in \"the task of reconciliation and healing.\" in order to build an inclusive future and prepare for peaceful elections in 2015.\n\nThe Elders began working on Cyprus in September 2008, when the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities formally entered into peace negotiations. Since then, they have visited the island four times to support all efforts to build peace, enhance trust, and sharing their experiences with leaders and civil society in order to encourage dialogue.<ref name=\"http://theelders.org/cyprus\"></ref> Additionally, they worked with the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus and the Cyprus Friendship Programme to film the documentary \"Digging the Past in Search of the Future\" with the hope that this could help Cypriots to reach a common understanding about their shared past.\n\nIn October 2008, the Elders visited the island to support the newly begun peace talks between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders. Desmond Tutu said that \"These opportunities don't come around very often\". Elders Jimmy Carter, Lakhdar Brahimi and Desmond Tutu met political leaders, civil society representatives and young people from both communities. Throughout the visit they made it clear that they were visiting the island to offer support and not to get formally involvement in the peace process.\n\nGro Harlem Brundtland and Lakhdar Brahimi visited Athens, Ankara and Cyprus in September 2009 to encourage efforts to reunify the island. In Ankara they met Turkish President Abdullah Gül, and President George Papandreou in Athens. In Nicosia they met Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat and Greek Cypriot leader Dimitris Christofias. The Elders also met local media and leading women from politics, business and civil society on the island.\n\nIn December 2009, Desmond Tutu, Jimmy Carter and Lakhdar Brahimi returned to Cyprus. They convened a public meeting on how trust could be engendered between conflicting communities and together with the Committee on Missing Persons filmed the documentary, \"Cyprus: Digging the Past in Search of the Future\". Such documentary follows the three Elders as they accompany four young Cypriots to learn about the search for the remains of thousands of missing people who were killed in the violence of the 1960s and 1970s. It was launched in early 2011 with special screenings in Nicosia and at the Houses of Parliament in London.. In Cyprus, Desmond Tutu and Gro Brundtland also met the newly elected leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, Derviş Eroğlu and the leader of the Greek Cypriot community, Demetris Christofias, and called for a renewed spirit of leadership in Cyprus. The Elders also met the Archbishop of the Church of Cyprus, Chrysostomos II, to discuss the role of religious leaders in peacebuilding.\n\nThe Elders launched their Korean Peninsula initiative in April 2011, when a delegation led by Jimmy Carter made a six-day visit to the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and China. Jimmy Carter, together with Martti Ahtisaari, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Mary Robinson, aimed to alleviate tensions on the Peninsula, particularly by encouraging dialogue and addressing security and humanitarian concerns such as reported food shortages in North Korea. In all three countries they met senior government officials, diplomats, UN representatives, humanitarian agencies, researchers, think tanks and North Korean refugees who fled to South Korea. Throughout the visit they made it clear that they were acting independently and did not intend \"to replace or intervene in any official process\".\n\nIn a report released following the Elders' visit, Jimmy Carter stated: \"On relations between North and South Korea, there are no quick fixes…and progress will require greater flexibility, sincerity and commitment from all parties\". Martti Ahtisaari and Gro Harlem Brundtland later travelled to Brussels to brief senior European Union officials on their findings.\n\nPeace in Sudan became a top priority for The Elders as soon as the group was founded. Indeed, The Elders' first mission was to Sudan, from 30 September to 4 October 2007. Desmond Tutu, Lakhdar Brahimi, Jimmy Carter and Graça Machel travelled to the country to learn more about the humanitarian situation in Darfur and to affirm the group's support for the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which was negotiated between North and South Sudan in 2005 to end its 22-year civil war. The Elders published a report on their findings titled 'Bringing Hope, Forging Peace: The Elders' Mission to Sudan'.\n\nIn 2008, the Elders encouraged states to provide urgently needed helicopters for peacekeepers in Darfur. In March 2009 the Elders called for aid agencies to be given access to Sudan following their expulsion by the Sudanese government.\n\nAhead of South Sudan's self-determination referendum in January 2011, The Elders warned of a risk of renewed violence in Sudan and urged 'swift and bold action' by the international community in support of the peace process. Particularly, Jimmy Carter and Kofi Annan led the Carter Center delegation to observe the referendum on self-determination in South Sudan.\n\nIn 2012, prompted by the \"worsening relations between Sudan and South Sudan, deteriorating economic conditions in both countries, and renewed conflict in the Sudanese states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan\", The Elders decided to make a series of visits to Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia. They aimed to highlight the growing humanitarian crisis and encourage further peace talks between the governments of Sudan and South Sudan. In May 2012, Lakhdar Brahimi and Jimmy Carter met Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in Khartoum. In July 2012, Martti Ahtisaari, Mary Robinson and Desmond Tutu travelled to South Sudan to meet President Salva Kiir and civil society representatives, and to visit Yusuf Batil refugee camp near the border with Sudan. They also travelled to Ethiopia, where they met Hailemariam Desalegn and members of the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel on Sudan (AUHIP), including Thabo Mbeki and Pierre Buyoya. At the conclusion of their visit, Ahtisaari, Tutu and Robinson urged presidents Bashir and Kiir to meet as soon as possible and recommit to peace. Desmond Tutu stated: \"Peace, peace, peace is what the people of Sudan and South Sudan need most. Recent months have seen increased hardship and suffering in both countries. It is a fragile time and I hope that the leaders will do what their people need, which is to recommit to working together to build two viable states.\"\n\nThe Elders have closely followed developments in Sri Lanka and spoken out on several occasions since the end of the decades-long conflict in 2009. Particularly, The Elders have persistently emphasised the importance of achieving reconciliation and accountability for violations committed during the conflict.\n\nIn November 2009, the Elders wrote to Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa as well as major donors, calling on the government to protect the rights of displaced civilians following years of war. Desmond Tutu said the government had \"an obligation to serve all Sri Lanka's citizens – including the Tamil and other minority communities\".\n\nIn August 2010, The Elders expressed disappointment at the Sri Lankan government's clampdown on domestic critics and \"disdain for human rights\". The Elders added that meaningful progress on reconciliation on the island was still \"desperately needed\".\n\nIn February 2012, Mary Robinson and Desmond Tutu wrote an op-ed in The Guardian, urging the member states of the United Nations Human Rights Council \"to support a resolution that seeks accountability for the terrible violations of international law that have taken place, and establishes mechanisms to monitor progress on the steps the government is taking on accountability\". The U.S.-backed resolution on 'Promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka' was adopted by the Council on 22 March 2012. Robinson and Tutu wrote a further op-ed published in The Times, The Times of India and the Tribune de Genève in March 2013, calling on the Council and the Commonwealth to exert pressure on Sri Lanka's government to implement the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).\n\nThe organisation has also issued statements on a range of topics including those relating to Tibet, Pakistan, Norway, the International Criminal Court, and the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nWidespread violence erupted in Kenya in December 2007, following disputes over the results of national elections. In January 2008, the African Union established a Panel of Eminent African Personalities to mediate a solution to the crisis, headed by Kofi Annan and including Graça Machel and former Tanzanian Prime Minister Benjamin Mkapa. Earlier, the Kenyan churches had launched an unsuccessful mediation attempt headed by South African Archbishop and Elders chair, Desmond Tutu. While three Elders were involved in efforts to resolve Kenya's crisis, this was not an initiative of The Elders. The Elders issued a brief statement in January 2008 calling for an end to the violence.\n\nFollowing major demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, The Elders stated that they stood in solidarity with \"all those crying out for freedom and basic rights\". In an interview with CNN, Desmond Tutu called on the international community to bring pressure to bear on Muammar Gaddafi to relinquish power.\n\nIn November 2011, a few weeks after elections to Tunisia's Constituent Assembly, Martti Ahtisaari, Mary Robinson and Lakhdar Brahimi travelled to Tunis to attend the annual gathering of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. In an interview with the BBC following her meeting with Tunisian bloggers, Mary Robinson described the \"sense of buoyant democracy\" in the country.\n\nGro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson travelled to Cairo in October 2012. During their meetings with President Mohamed Morsi, senior officials and diplomats, representatives of civil society organisations and young people, the Elders emphasised the importance of \"an inclusive, democratic transition.\"\n\nBrundtland and Carter both visited Egypt earlier in 2012, where they met civil society organisations and spoke to students at the American University in Cairo. Carter also travelled to Egypt with The Carter Center to witness the country's presidential and parliamentary elections in January and May 2012.\n\nOutside of their role as Elders, Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi have individually been involved in the international efforts to try to resolve the conflict in Syria. In February 2012, Annan was appointed Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and League of Arab States on the Syrian Civil War. He was succeeded in the role by Brahimi, who was appointed Joint Special Representative in August 2012, a position he held until May 2014.\n\nThe Elders held a three-day visit to Moscow in April 2015. Kofi Annan, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Martti Ahtisaari, Lakhdar Brahimi, Jimmy Carter and Ernesto Zedillo held talks on geopolitical issues with Russian officials, including President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nTogether with civil society partners, The Elders marked their 10th anniversary by launching #WalkTogether, a year-long global campaign to inspire hope and bridge the deepening global fault lines of division, hate and xenophobia. \nThe campaign is intended to celebrate those communities whose work is a great demonstration of empathy, where their actions benefit 'the many', create a sense of unity, and address global and local challenges in a compassionate way. In other words, #WalkTogether aims to lift the voices of courageous moral leadership in communities around the world, who are working for the freedoms aligned to those to which Nelson Mandela dedicated his life. These Freedoms include the broad themes of Peace, Health, Justice and Equality. \nThe campaign ran for twelve months from 18 July 2017 – the tenth anniversary of the group's founding – to 18 July 2018, the centenary of Nelson Mandela's birth.\n\nThe Every Human Has Rights (EHHR) campaign was launched on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 10 December 2007, in Cape Town, South Africa. The Elders launched the initiative in partnership with a diverse group of global NGOs, civil society organisations and businesses to highlight UDHR principles, including the right to health, women's rights, and freedom of expression. Launch partners included ActionAid, Amnesty International, the Center for Women's Global Leadership, International PEN, WITNESS, Realizing Rights, Save the Children and UNICEF. The EHHR campaign also included partners from civil society organisations in the developing world through networks like CIVICUS. The campaign aimed to \"empower global citizens to protect and realize the first-ever comprehensive agreement on human rights among nations\". Throughout the campaign, over one billion people signed the Universal Declaration, taking responsibility and pledging to speak to protect the freedom and the rights of others in their communities.\n\nA year later, in December 2008, The Elders joined award-winning human rights journalists, leaders in civil society, and business and government leaders to celebrate the Every Human Has Rights campaign and participate in the EHHR Media Awards.\n\n"}

{"id": "144704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144704", "title": "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch", "text": "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch\n\n\"There is no such thing as a free lunch\" (alternatively, \"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch\" or other variants) is a popular adage communicating the idea that it is impossible to get something for nothing. The acronyms TANSTAAFL, TINSTAAFL, and TNSTAAFL are also used. The phrase was in use by the 1930s, but its first appearance is unknown. The \"free lunch\" in the saying refers to the nineteenth-century practice in American bars of offering a \"free lunch\" in order to entice drinking customers.\n\nThe phrase and the acronym are central to Robert Heinlein's 1966 science-fiction novel \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\", which helped popularize it. The free-market economist Milton Friedman also popularized the phrase by using it as the title of a 1975 book, and it is used in economics literature to describe opportunity cost. Campbell McConnell writes that the idea is \"at the core of economics\".\n\nThe \"free lunch\" refers to the once-common tradition of saloons in the United States providing a \"free\" lunch to patrons who had purchased at least one drink. Many foods on offer were high in salt (e.g., ham, cheese, and salted crackers), so those who ate them ended up buying a lot of beer. Rudyard Kipling, writing in 1891, noted how he\n\n...came upon a bar-room full of bad Salon pictures, in which men with hats on the backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter. It was the institution of the \"free lunch\" I had struck. You paid for a drink and got as much as you wanted to eat. For something less than a rupee a day a man can feed himself sumptuously in San Francisco, even though he be a bankrupt. Remember this if ever you are stranded in these parts.\n\nTANSTAAFL, on the other hand, indicates an acknowledgement that in reality a person or a society cannot get \"something for nothing\". Even if something appears to be free, there is always a cost to the person or to society as a whole, although that may be a hidden cost or an externality. For example, as Heinlein has one of his characters point out, a bar offering a free lunch will likely charge more for its drinks.\n\nAccording to Robert Caro, Fiorello La Guardia, on becoming mayor of New York in 1933, said \"È finita la cuccagna!\", meaning \"Cockaigne is finished\" or, more loosely, \"No more free lunch\"; in this context \"free lunch\" refers to graft and corruption. The earliest known occurrence of the full phrase (except for the \"a\"), in the form \"There ain't no such thing as free lunch\", appears as the punchline of a joke related in an article in the \"El Paso Herald-Post\" of June 27, 1938 (and other Scripps-Howard newspapers about the same time), entitled \"Economics in Eight Words\".\n\nIn 1945, \"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch\" appeared in the \"Columbia Law Review\", and \"there is no free lunch\" appeared in a 1942 article in the \"Oelwein Daily Register\" (in a quote attributed to economist Harley L. Lutz) and in a 1947 column by economist Merryle S. Rukeyser.\n\nIn 1949, the phrase appeared in an article by Walter Morrow in the \"San Francisco News\" (published on 1 June) and in Pierre Dos Utt's monograph \"TANSTAAFL: A Plan for a New Economic World Order\", which describes an oligarchic political system based on his conclusions from \"no free lunch\" principles.\n\nThe 1938 and 1949 sources use the phrase in relating a fable about a king (Nebuchadnezzar in Dos Utt's retelling) seeking advice from his economic advisors. Morrow's retelling, which claims to derive from an earlier editorial reported to be non-existent, but closely follows the story as related in the earlier article in the \"El Paso Herald-Post\", differs from Dos Utt's in that the ruler asks for ever-simplified advice following their original \"eighty-seven volumes of six hundred pages\" as opposed to a simple failure to agree on \"any major remedy\". The last surviving economist advises that \"There ain't no such thing as free lunch.\"\n\nIn 1950, a \"New York Times\" columnist ascribed the phrase to economist (and army general) Leonard P. Ayres of the Cleveland Trust Company: \"It seems that shortly before the General's death [in 1946]... a group of reporters approached the general with the request that perhaps he might give them one of several immutable economic truisms that he had gathered from his long years of economic study... 'It is an immutable economic fact,' said the general, 'that there is no such thing as a free lunch.'\"\n\nThe September 8, 1961, issue of \"LIFE magazine\" has an editorial on page 4, \"'TANSTAFL,' It's the Truth,\" that closes with an anecdotal farmer explaining this slight variant of TANSTAAFL.\n\nIn 1966, author Robert A. Heinlein published his novel \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\", in which TANSTAAFL was a central, libertarian theme, mentioned by name and explained. This increased its use in the mainstream.\n\nEdwin G. Dolan used the phrase as the title of his 1971 book \"TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch) – A Libertarian Perspective on Environmental Policy\".\n\nIn the sciences, TANSTAAFL means that the universe as a whole is ultimately a closed system. There is no source of matter, energy, or light that draws resources from something else which will not eventually be exhausted. Therefore, the TANSTAAFL argument may also be applied to natural physical processes in a closed system (either the universe as a whole, or any system that does not receive energy or matter from outside). (See Second law of thermodynamics.) The bio-ecologist Barry Commoner used this concept as the last of his famous \"Four Laws of Ecology\".\n\nAccording to American theoretical physicist and cosmologist Alan Guth \"the universe is the ultimate free lunch\", given that in the early stage of its expansion the total amount of energy available to make particles was very large.\n\nIn economics, TANSTAAFL demonstrates opportunity cost. Greg Mankiw described the concept as follows: \"To get one thing that we like, we usually have to give up another thing that we like. Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another.\" The idea that there is no free lunch at the societal level applies only when all resources are being used completely and appropriately – i.e., when economic efficiency prevails. If not, a 'free lunch' can be had through a more efficient utilization of resources. Or, as Fred Brooks put it, \"You can only get something for nothing if you have previously gotten nothing for something.\" If one individual or group gets something at no cost, somebody else ends up paying for it. If there appears to be no direct cost to any single individual, there is a social cost. Similarly, someone can benefit for \"free\" from an externality or from a public good, but someone has to pay the cost of producing these benefits. (See Free rider problem and Tragedy of the commons).\n\nIn mathematical finance, the term is also used as an informal synonym for the principle of no-arbitrage. This principle states that a combination of securities that has the same cash-flows as another security must have the same net price in equilibrium.\n\nIn statistics, the term has been used to describe the tradeoffs of statistical learners (e.g., in machine learning). That is, any model that claims to offer superior flexibility in analyzing data patterns usually does so at the cost of introducing extra assumptions, or by sacrificing generalizability in important situations.\n\nTANSTAAFL is sometimes used as a response to claims of the virtues of free software. Supporters of free software often counter that the use of the term \"free\" in this context is primarily a reference to a lack of constraint (\"libre\") rather than a lack of cost (\"gratis\"). Richard Stallman has described it as \"'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer'\".\n\nThe prefix \"TANSTAA-\" (or \"TINSTAA-\") is used in numerous other contexts as well to denote some immutable property of the system being discussed. For example, \"TANSTAANFS\" is used by electrical engineering professors to stand for \"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Noise-Free System\".\n\nBaseball Prospectus coined the abbreviation \"TINSTAAPP\", for \"There Is No Such Thing As A Pitching Prospect\", as many young pitchers hurt their arms before they can be effective at a major league level.\n\nHungarian prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány used this adage to justify his social reforms in the mid-2000s. As a post-socialist country, Hungary struggled with the illusion of the state as a caring and giving, independent entity, rather than being the embodiment of the community. The saying \"there is no free lunch\" represented that even if the state provides welfare or something else for the people in need, it is in fact bought or provided by other people of the same community through taxes. Therefore, the state cannot provide everything for everyone, and increased provisions given by the state can only be financed by economic growth or increased taxes.\n\nSome exceptions from the \"no free lunch\" tenet have been put forward, such as the Sun and carbon dioxide. It was argued in particular that metabolism evolved to take advantage of the free lunch provided by the Sun, which also triggers production of vital oxygen in plants. However, these too fall short in that the viewpoint is an open system, the earth, with \"free\" inputs from the Sun. When viewed from the larger system context, the Sun/Earth or Solar System, there is a net energy exchange, and still \"no free lunch.\" \n\n"}
