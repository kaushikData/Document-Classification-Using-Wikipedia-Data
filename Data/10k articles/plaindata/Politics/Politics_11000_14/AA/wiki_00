December 5, 1983) opened fire at the Youth With A Mission training center in Arvada, Colorado, killing two and wounding two others before escaping. Later that afternoon, he attacked the New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, with a number of firearms, killing two more people and injuring three before being shot by Jeanne Assam, a member of the church's safety team, who was carrying a licensed private firearm. Murray subsequently died from a gunshot wound to the head, which reports indicate was inflicted either by himself, or possibly by Assam.\n\nAround 12:30 a.m. MST (07:30 UTC), following a Christmas banquet that had taken place earlier that night, Matthew Murray knocked on the door of the Youth With A Mission facility. Murray asked personnel in the youth center if he could stay overnight; when he was refused, Murray opened fire, killing Tiffany Johnson, the center's Director of Hospitality, and staff member Philip Crouse, as well as wounding Dan Griebenow in the neck and Charlie Blanch in the leg.\n\nAfter the incident, the YWAM base evacuated its 80 people to the mountain campus in Black Hawk, 45 of whom were in the building at the time of the shooting. Local police quickly conducted a canine search of the surrounding area, searching for the shooter; they hoped that fresh snow would help them track the suspect, but were unable to locate him. A reverse 911 call went out to residents of the neighborhood to let them know a shooting suspect might be in their area.\n\nAt about 1:00 p.m. MST (20:00 UTC), more than thirty minutes after the 11:00 a.m. sermon had ended at New Life Church, Murray opened fire in the church parking lot, shooting at the Works family as they entered their vehicle, causing the worst fatal consequences at New Life Church that day: the deaths of two of the Works' family's four daughters: Stephanie Works, 18, and Rachel Works, 16, as well as the near-death of their father, David Works, who was shot multiple times.\n\nChurch member and bystander Judy Purcell was wounded in the shoulder when attempting to enter her vehicle; she survived her injuries. Murray directed gunfire towards other vehicles during his shooting spree within the New Life Church parking lot, including narrowly missing church patron Christina Wilke after riddling her vehicle with a volley of bullets from his semi-automatic rifle, missing Wilke with his gunfire by approximately four inches. Murray then entered the building's main foyer where he wounded Larry Bourbonnais, as Bourbonnais was attempting to yell at Murray distract Murray from hurting others; Bourbonnais was minorly wounded in the forearm with shrapnel. At this point, church member Jeanne Assam, a private security guard working for New Life Church, who was herself a former Minneapolis Police Department law enforcement officer, opened fire upon Murray. The incident was fully witnessed by Larry Bourbonnais, who later repeatedly conveyed to national news interests that, \"It was the bravest thing I've ever seen.\" Assam later gave her testimony publicly, stating that she felt that she was spiritually called to serve on the security team for the church that morning, and that she had been personally fasting and praying in preparation due to a supernatural \"calling from God.\" While the official coroner's report states that Murray subsequently killed himself, some reports indicate that Assam suspects that she was the one who potentially administered the fatal wound upon Murray. The police themselves have not stated on-record whom they believe fired the fatal shot upon Murray.\n\nAfter the New Life Church shooting, Assam later stated that \"God guided me and protected me [and I] did not think for a minute to run away.\"\n\nOn December 13, 2007, Murray's family issued a statement saying that it was \"groping for answers\" and issued an apology.\n\nThe pastor of the church stated that Assam shot Murray before he entered inside the building, after she encountered him in the hallway, and that Assam probably saved \"over 100 lives.\"\n\nFollowing the shooting spree, Colorado Springs Police Department officers searched the church campus looking for suspicious devices. Colorado governor Bill Ritter ordered state authorities to help investigate. The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also came to the site to assist.\n\nIt was not immediately known whether the shootings were related to an earlier Arvada missionary shooting, away. However, prior to the second shooting, police were already conducting an investigation at Murray's home.\n\nPolice said the description of the gunman in the second shooting was similar to the first: a white male wearing a dark hat and dark jacket.\n\nOn December 10, 2007, the gunman in both the YWAM Arvada and New Life Church shootings was identified as 24-year-old Matthew J. Murray, one of two sons of a Colorado neurologist. Reportedly, Murray was homeschooled in a deeply religious Christian household, and he attended, but did not complete, a missionary training program at the YWAM Arvada facility in 2002. Court records indicated that Murray was bitter over his expulsion from the 12-week missionary training program. His expulsion from the school was confirmed by Cheryl Morrison, whose husband, George Morrison, is pastor of the Faith Bible Chapel adjacent to YWAM Denver. She didn't know specifics of the conflict. \"I don't think that ‘run-in’ is the word, but they did have to dismiss him. It had to be something of significance, because they go the nth degree with people.\" Murray was expelled from the school due to \"strange behavior,\" which included playing perceived-frightening rock music and him claiming to hear voices. Before the second shooting, Murray left several violent and threatening messages on several religious websites, espousing his hatred for fundamental Christianity and his intentions on killing as many Christians as possible.\n\nOne message quoted Eric Harris of the Columbine High School massacre; it read: \"I'm coming for EVERYONE soon and I WILL be armed to the ...teeth and I WILL shoot to kill. ...God, I can't wait till I can kill you people. Feel no remorse, no sense of shame, I don't care if I live or die in the shoot-out. All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you ... as I can especially Christians who are to blame for most of the problems in the world.\"\n\nIn another of his very last posts, made that morning to a Usenet newsgroup, he identified himself as being a member of a local branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis. According to the chapter leader, Murray had attended their events for one or two years, but his request for membership was turned down and he was asked to leave in either September or October.\n\nMatthew Murray was also baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in late 2006, according to the church's records.\n\nAccording to investigators, Murray descended into extreme anti-Christian psychosis over a period of several months, and his web-postings became increasingly violent, despondent and hateful. Some of the users tried to counsel Murray and one psychologist, Dr. Marlene Winell, who is recognized as the first mental health professional to identify the condition of \"Religious Trauma Syndrome,\" offered her services after reading his poem called \"Crying all alone in pain in the nightmare of Christianity.\" Years later, Dr. Winell's one-time distant attempt to reach out to provide council to a young man (through a public posting via the Internet, her only way of communication with the unknown subject), whom she perceived and recognized as disturbed and unstable, was, years later, eventually revealed as James Holmes, who became the mass murderer responsible for Colorado's July 20, 2012 Aurora movie theater's \"Batman movie\" killings. The horrific event drew increased national attention to Dr. Winell's enlightening studies and began to further shed light on her studies into \"Religious Trauma Syndrome\" and it's potentially-harmful consequences upon society at large.\n\nIn his online postings, Murray alleges psychological abuse at the hands of his parents and church leaders as the main reason for his hatred of Christianity.\n\n"}

Parabolic acoustic mirrors are widely used in parabolic microphones to pick up sound from great distances, employed in surveillance and reporting of outdoor sporting events. Pairs of large parabolic acoustic mirrors which function as \"whisper galleries\" are displayed in science museums to demonstrate sound focusing.\n\nBetween the World Wars, before the invention of radar, parabolic sound mirrors were used experimentally as early-warning devices by military air defence forces to detect incoming enemy aircraft by listening for the sound of their engines. During World War 2 on the coast of southern England, a network of large concrete acoustic mirrors was in the process of being built when the project was cancelled owing to the development of the Chain Home radar system. Many of these mirrors are still standing today.\n\nBefore World War II and the invention of radar, acoustic mirrors were built as early warning devices around the coasts of Great Britain, with the aim of detecting incoming enemy aircraft by the sound of their engines. The most famous of these devices still stand at Denge on the Dungeness peninsula and at Hythe in Kent. Other examples exist in other parts of Britain (including Sunderland, Redcar, Boulby, Kilnsea and Selsey Bill), and Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq in Malta. The Maltese sound mirror is known locally as \"the ear\" (il-Widna) and appears to be the only sound mirror built outside Great Britain.\n\nThe Dungeness mirrors, known colloquially as the \"listening ears\", consist of three large concrete reflectors built in the 1920s–1930s. Their experimental nature can be discerned by the different shapes of each of the three reflectors: one is a long curved wall about high by long, while the other two are dish-shaped constructions approximately in diameter. Microphones placed at the foci of the reflectors enabled a listener to detect the sound of aircraft far out over the English Channel. The reflectors are not parabolic, but are actually spherical mirrors. \nSpherical mirrors can be used for direction finding by moving the sensor rather than the mirror; another unusual example is the Arecibo Observatory.\n\nAcoustic mirrors had a limited effectiveness, and the increasing speed of aircraft in the 1930s meant that they would already be too close to engage by the time they had been detected. The development of radar put an end to further experimentation with the technique. Nevertheless, there were long-lasting benefits. The acoustic mirror programme, led by Dr William Sansome Tucker, had given Britain the methodology to use interconnected stations to pinpoint the position of an enemy in the sky. The system they developed for linking the stations and plotting aircraft movements was given to the early radar team and contributed to their success in World War II; although the British radar was less sophisticated than the German system, the British system was used more successfully.\n\nParabolic acoustic mirrors called \"whisper dishes\" are used as participatory exhibits in science museums to demonstrate focusing of sound. Examples are located at Bristol's We The Curious, Ontario Science Centre, Baltimore's Maryland Science Center, Oklahoma City's Science Museum Oklahoma, San Francisco's Exploratorium, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Jodrell Bank Observatory, and Parkes Observatory in Australia. A pair of dishes, typically in diameter, is installed facing each other, separated by around a hundred metres. A person standing at the focus of one can hear another person speaking in a whisper at the focus of the other, despite the wide separation between them.\n\nParabolic microphones depend on a parabolic dish to reflect sound coming from a specific direction into the microphone placed at the focus. They are extremely directional: sensitive to sounds coming from a specific direction. However, they generally have poor bass response because a dish small enough to be portable cannot focus long wavelengths. Small portable parabolic microphones are used to record wildlife sounds such as birdsongs, in televised sports events to pick up the conversations of players, such as in the huddle during American Football games, or to record the sounds of the sport, and in audio surveillance to record speech without the knowledge of the speaker.\n\nAcoustic aircraft detection mirrors are known to have been built at:\n\nModern acoustic mirrors built for entertainment \n\n\n\n"}

The AAA was founded 23 April 1995. Although many of their activities were reported as serious participation in conferences or protests against the militarization of space, some were also considered art pranks, media pranks, or elaborate spoof. The AAA had numerous local chapters which operated independently of one another, with the AAA effectively operating as a collective pseudonym along the lines of Luther Blissett (nom de plume).\n\nThe Association's ostensible five-year mission, a reference to \"Star Trek\", was to \"establish a planetary network to end the monopoly of corporations, governments and the military over travel in space\". Artists who became involved were often connected to the zine scene or mail art movements. The five-year mission's completion was marked at the 2000 Fortean Times conference. Some chapters have continued activities to the present day. Several AAAers have experienced zero-gravity training flights.\n\nThe writer Tom Hodgkinson described participants as \"a loose bunch of Marxists, futurists, and revolutionaries on the dole\", going on to explicate their mission as \"reclaim[ing] the idea of space travel for the common man\". To the AAA, he said, \"space travel represented an ideal of freedom\". Annick Bureaud of \"Leonardo/OLATS\" viewed their work as \"space art\" that \"combine[d] freely space, cyberspace, raves, esoteric things, techno-music, etc.\", calling attention to \"how they recycle ... key images (the MIR Space Station, the astronauts on the Moon, etc.) ... mixed with science-fiction (and specially Star Trek) buzz-words or images\" and then subjected these \"sacred icons\" to \"iconoclastic treatments\".\n\nIn his book \"Unleashing the Collective Phantoms,\" the theorist Brian Holmes said of the AAA: \"The ideas sound fantastic, but the stakes are real: imagining a political subject within the virtual class, and therefore, within the economy of cultural production and intellectual property that had paralyzed the poetics of resistance.\" \n\nThe London chapter participated in the J18 Carnival Against Capitalism protests during that year's G8 summit, with a contingent of AAA members dressed in space suits delivering a petition against the militarisation of space to the headquarters of Lockheed.

Typically, it is either geographically distinct from the rest of the country or populated by a national minority. Decentralization of self-governing powers and functions to such divisions is a way for a national government to try to increase democratic participation or administrative efficiency or to defuse internal conflicts. Countries that include autonomous areas may be federacies, federations, or confederations. Autonomous areas can be divided into territorial autonomies, subregional territorial autonomies, and local autonomies.\n\n\nJersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man are self-governing Crown dependencies which are not part of the United Kingdom; however, the UK is responsible for their defence and international affairs. Gibraltar is a self-governing overseas territory of the UK. Most of the other 13 British Overseas Territories also have autonomy in internal affairs through local legislatures.\n\n\nNew Zealand maintains nominal sovereignty over three Pacific Island nations. The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing countries in free association with New Zealand that maintain some international relationships in their own name. Tokelau remains an autonomous dependency of New Zealand. The Chatham Islands—despite having the designation of \"Territory\"—is an integral part of the country, situated within the New Zealand archipelago. The territory's council is not autonomous and has broadly the same powers as other local councils, although notably it can also charge levies on goods entering or leaving the islands.\n\n\nThe Faroe Islands and Greenland are two autonomous countries within the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n\nAruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten are autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, each with their own parliament. In addition they enjoy autonomy in taxation matters as well as having their own currencies.\n\n\nThe French constitution recognises three autonomous jurisdictions. Corsica, a region of France, enjoys a greater degree of autonomy on matters such as tax and education compared to mainland regions. New Caledonia, a \"sui generis\" collectivity, and French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity, are highly autonomous territories with their own government, legislature, currency and constitution. They do not, however, have legislative powers for policy areas relating to law and order, defense, border control or university education. Other smaller overseas collectivities have a lesser degree of autonomy through local legislatures. The five overseas regions, French Guiana, Guadaloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and Réunion, are generally governed the same as mainland regions; however, they enjoy some additional powers, including certain legislative powers for devolved areas.\n\nIn Ethiopia, \"special woredas\" are a subgroup of \"woredas\" (districts) that are organized around the traditional homelands of an ethnic minority, and are outside the usual hierarchy of a \"kilil\", or region. These \"woredas\" have many similarities to autonomous areas in other countries.\n\nOther areas that are autonomous in nature but not in name are areas designated for indigenous peoples, such as those of the Americas:\n\n\nWorks cited\n"}

She organized the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) from 1958 to 1963, edited the national DOB magazine \"The Ladder\" from 1963–66, and worked closely with Frank Kameny in the 1960s on the first picket lines that brought attention to the ban on employment of gay people by the largest employer in the US at that time: the United States government. Her early experiences with trying to learn more about lesbianism fueled her lifetime work with libraries. In the 1970s, Gittings was most involved in the American Library Association, especially its gay caucus, the first such in a professional organization, in order to promote positive literature about homosexuality in libraries. She was a part of the movement to get the American Psychiatric Association to drop homosexuality as a mental illness in 1972. Her self-described life mission was to tear away the \"shroud of invisibility\" related to homosexuality, which had theretofore been associated with crime and mental illness.\n\nShe was awarded a lifetime membership in the American Library Association, and the ALA named an annual award for the best gay or lesbian novel the Barbara Gittings Award. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) also named an activist award for her. At her memorial service, Matt Foreman, the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said, \"What do we owe Barbara? Everything.\"\n\nBarbara Gittings was born to Elizabeth (née Brooks) Gittings and John Sterett Gittings in Vienna, Austria, where her father was serving as a U.S. diplomat. Barbara and her siblings attended Catholic schools in Montreal. She was so immersed in Catholicism at one point in her childhood that she considered becoming a nun. Her family returned to the United States at the outbreak of World War II and settled in Wilmington, Delaware. Although aware of her attraction to other girls, Gittings said she first heard the word \"homosexual\" when she was rejected for membership in the National Honor Society in high school. Despite being an excellent student, a teacher who had reservations about her character took her aside and told her that the rejection was based on what the teacher believed were \"homosexual inclinations\".\n\nWhile majoring in drama at Northwestern University, Gittings developed a close but non-sexual friendship with another female student, prompting rumors that the two were lesbians, which led Gittings to examine her own sexual orientation. In her attempts to understand it, she had her suspicions confirmed by a psychiatrist who offered to cure her. Not having enough money to make regular visits, she was unable to get the money from her father, who reasoned there were no problems a psychiatrist could solve that a priest could not. A close friend suggested they see less of each other so as not to further encourage the rumors about them.\n\nHaving no one to talk to about the issues that were consuming her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as \"deviants\", \"perverts\", and \"abnormal\" in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. She recalled in a 2001 interview, \"I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better\". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, \"My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal.\"\n\nAt age 17, she returned from Northwestern \"in disgrace\" after failing out of school and unable to tell her family why. But she was compelled to continue her search for information. She found some in the novels available at the time: \"Nightwood\", \"The Well of Loneliness\", and \"Extraordinary Women\". Soon thereafter, her father discovered \"The Well of Loneliness\" in a pile of other things in her bedroom. He was so appalled at what he found that he instructed her to burn the book, but did so in a letter as he was unable to speak to her about it face to face. Still eager to learn more about homosexuality, Gittings took a night course in abnormal psychology where she met a woman, with whom she had a brief affair, her first. At age 18, she left home to be on her own and moved to Philadelphia.\n\nGittings began to hitchhike on weekends to New York City, dressed as a man, to visit gay bars since she knew of none in Philadelphia, and knew of no other places to go to get \"plugged into the gay community.\" In a 1975 interview, she recalled, \"I wore drag because I thought that was a way to show I was gay. It's changed now, but in the early 50s there were basically two types of women in the gay bars: the so-called butch ones in short hair and plain masculine attire and the so-called femme ones in dresses and high heels and makeup. I knew high heels and makeup weren't my personal style, so I thought...I must be the other kind!\" However, Gittings found very little in common with the women she met in the bars, and after witnessing a gay male acquaintance get beaten up after leaving a bar, began to focus her energies on collecting books. \n\nIn 1956, Gittings traveled to California on the advice of Donald Webster Cory, to visit the office of the new ONE, Inc., an early homophile organization that dedicated itself to providing support to homosexuals in the US. While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. \"She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack — I'd never seen anything like it. Or her\", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. \"Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits.\"\n\nIn 1958, Martin and Lyon asked Gittings to start a chapter in New York City, which she did when less than a dozen women responded to her notice in the Mattachine Society newsletter asking for \"all women in the New York area who are interested in forming a chapter of the DOB\" on September 20, 1958. Gittings served as the chapter's first president for three years, from 1958 until 1961, the year she met Kay Tobin. \n\nIn 1982, Gittings remembered, \"I joined the movement in 1958, when the subject of homosexuality was still shrouded in complete silence. There were no radio talk shows or TV documentaries. In all the United States, there were maybe a half dozen groups, two hundred people active in all.\" The Daughters of Bilitis served as a social alternative to bars for lesbians, but took great care to deny that they were \"arranging for 'immoral contacts'.\" While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting. They met twice a month and often invited doctors, psychiatrists, ministers and attorneys to address their meetings, even if the message was clearly disparaging to lesbians. Gittings recalled, \"At first we were so grateful just to have people — anybody — pay attention to us that we listened to and accepted everything they said, no matter how bad it was...anything that helped to break the silence, no matter how silly or foolish it may look to us today, was important.\"\n\nGittings admitted that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals could see that gays and lesbians were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure that she would be fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.\n\nFrom 1963-66, she edited the organization's magazine, \"The Ladder,\" following both Lyon and Martin as editors. Although the Daughters of Bilitis did take a political stand in the 1959 San Francisco mayoral race, Martin and Lyon preferred \"The Ladder\" to remain apolitical. Gittings was impressed with how her influence as editor impacted the magazine and the opinions of its readers. \"I discovered the power of the press, the power to put in what you want in order to influence readers,\" she said.\n\nAt the 1963 convention of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that \"the exclusive homosexual\" was a psychopath. Articles and essays in \"The Ladder\" sometimes carried these viewpoints, since it was difficult to get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, \"People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure ... We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward.\" However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, \"My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality ... Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions.\"\n\nGittings began to implement changes in \"The Ladder\" that included adding \"A Lesbian Review\" underneath the title on the cover and replacing the line drawings on the cover with photographs of actual lesbians, often taken by her partner, Kay Lahusen. Gittings distributed \"The Ladder\" in six bookstores in New York and Philadelphia, and one Greenwich Village store displayed the magazine prominently, selling 100 copies a month. The focus of the magazine shifted as well to tackling more controversial issues to spark debate, printing such articles titled \"I Hate Women\" remarking on women who are politically apathetic, and \"To Act or to Teach?\" that was a back-and-forth debate on whether it was more effective to educate the public or take political action.\n\nGittings participated in many of the earliest LGBT actions in the United States. In 1965, Gittings marched in the first gay picket lines at the White House, the US State Department, and at Independence Hall in Philadelphia to protest the federal government's policy on discrimination of homosexuals, holding a sign that read \"Sexual preference is irrelevant to federal employment.\" The men who agreed to picket had to wear suits and ties, and the women who participated were to wear dresses, heels, and pantyhose so as to look employable by the federal government. Reactions from passersby were varied. A tourist witnessing the demonstration remarked, \"I still don't believe it. Somebody's kidding.\" A stunned high school student pointed out, \"They all look so normal.\"\n\nGittings recalled, \"I remember a man said to his kids, 'Hold your noses — it's dirty here.' And there was a woman dragging a string of kids who said, very angrily, 'You should all be married and have children like me.'\" Leaflets were distributed to passersby that described their reasons for picketing, surprising some recipients who were unaware gays and lesbians could be fired so easily, and disgusting others. Gittings remembered, \"It was risky and we were scared. Picketing was not a popular tactic at the time. And our cause seemed outlandish even to most gay people.\" The evening prior to the group's picketing the State Department, Secretary of State Dean Rusk announced the pickets at a press conference. Gittings connected the high-profile visibility with a \"breakthrough into mainstream publicity.\"\n\nFrom 1965-69, she and Frank Kameny led the Annual Reminder, picketing at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 4, until the Stonewall Riots in June 1969. After the riots, the annual Gay Pride Parade commemorating the riots took its place.\nDifferences in Gittings' political stance and the leadership of the DOB began to show, and came to a culmination in 1966 when she was ousted as the editor of \"The Ladder\" for, as one source claims, creating the issue that reported on the DOB convention late, but according to another source because she removed \"For Adults Only\" on the cover of the magazine without consulting the DOB.\n\nIn November 1967, Gittings and Kameny worked together as co-counsel in hearings held by the Department of Defense to discredit an expert witness named Dr. Charles Socarides, who testified that homosexuals could be converted to heterosexuality, and to call in question the policy held by the Department of Defense that homosexual employees could be fired for being named as homosexuals. \"Publicity was the objective\", Gittings recalled many years later. Kameny and Gittings dressed conservatively, but wore buttons that said \"Gay is Good\" and \"Pray for Sodomy.\" \"We held press conferences for the benefit of sharp-eyed reporters. When we first went into a hearing room, we made certain to shake hands with all ... participants so (they) could not avoid reading our buttons. Although neither was an attorney, at the end of their cross-examination, the Department of Defense removed Socarides from their lists of expert witnesses.\n\nGittings made hundreds of appearances as a speaker in the late 1960s. She carried on her mission to convince heterosexuals and homosexuals alike that homosexuality is not an illness, stating in a letter in 1967:\nI keep trying to convince people in the movement that the charge of sickness is perhaps our greatest problem ... we can't really progress in other directions until the unsubstantiated assumption of sickness...is demolished! It's almost always there, however slyly or covertly or even unconsciously, however 'sympathetic' the person: the attitude that homosexuality is somehow undesirable, some sort of twist or malfunction or failure or maladaptation or other kind of psychic sickness. And in our society sick people, by any definition of sick, just DO \"not\" get equal treatment. Equal treatment — no more, no less — is what we want! And compassion — which many homosexuals gladly swallow because they think it represents an improvement in attitudes toward them — is not equal treatment.\n\nIn the 1970s, Gittings continued her search for resources in libraries that addressed homosexuality in a positive, supportive way. In discussing her pursuit of the improvement of materials for gays and lesbians in libraries, she said, \"For years I would haunt libraries and secondhand book shops trying to find stories to read about my people, and then I became active in other arenas of the gay rights movement, but I always kept an eye on the emerging literature...It began to talk about homosexuals who were healthy and happy and wholesome and who had good lives...That rang the bells for me—libraries, gay books!\"\n\nGittings found a home in the gay group that formed in 1970 in the American Library Association, the first gay caucus in a professional association, and became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner \"Hug a Homosexual,\" with a \"women only\" side and a \"men only\" side. When no one took advantage of it, she and \"Patience and Sarah\" author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, \"We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map.\"\n\nGittings made an appearance on the \"Phil Donahue Show\" in 1970 and on PBS' \"David Susskind Show\" in 1971, along with six other lesbians, including Lilli Vincenz and Barbara Love. They were among the first open lesbians to appear on television in the US, and debated long-held stereotypes about gays with Susskind. A week after her appearance on the \"David Susskind Show\", a middle-aged couple approached Gittings in the supermarket to claim, \"You made me realize that you gay people love each other just the way Arnold and I do.\"\n\nIn 1972, Gittings and Kameny organized a discussion with the American Psychiatric Association entitled \"Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue\", where a panel of psychiatrists were to discuss homosexuality. When Gittings' partner Kay Tobin Lahusen noticed that all the psychiatrists were heterosexual, she protested. Gittings remembered, \"My partner, Kay, said, 'This isn't right—here you have two psychiatrists pitted against two gays, and what you really need is someone who is both.' The panel moderator, Dr. Kent Robinson, agreed to add a gay psychiatrist if we could find one. In 1972 who would come forward? ... Kay and I wrote letters and made phone calls around the country.\" A gay psychiatrist in Philadelphia finally agreed to appear on the panel in heavy disguise, and with a voice distorting microphone, calling himself \"Dr. H. Anonymous\". He was John E. Fryer, and he discussed how he was forced to be closeted while practicing psychiatry. Gittings read aloud letters from psychiatrists she had solicited who declined to appear for fear of professional ostracism. She described the event as \"transformative\".\n\nIn 1973, homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental disorder, and Gittings celebrated by being photographed with the Philadelphia newspaper headlines, \"Twenty Million Homosexuals Gain Instant Cure.\"\n\nGittings spent 16 years working with libraries and campaigning to get positive gay and lesbian-themed materials into libraries and to eliminate censorship and job discrimination. She wrote \"Gays in Library Land: The Gay and Lesbian Task Force of the American Library Association: The First Sixteen Years.\", a brief history of the group. She helped start what was then called the National Gay Task Force, later to be named the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) in 1973. Gittings served on the board of the NGLTF throughout the 1980s. She inspired nurses to form the Gay Nurses Alliance in 1973. She held exhibits at APA conventions in 1972, 1976, and 1978, her last one being \"Gay Love: Good Medicine\" that portrayed gays as happy and healthy.\n\nGittings appeared in the documentary films \"Gay Pioneers\", \"Before Stonewall\", \"After Stonewall\", \"Out of the Past\", and \"Pride Divide\". In 1991 she remembered her decisions to be as open as she was throughout her life when she said, \"Every time I had to make a decision to put myself forward or to stay back, to use my real name or not, to go on television or decline, to get out on some of the earliest picket lines or remain behind. I usually took the public position because there weren't many of us yet that could afford the risk.\"\n\nIn 1999, Gittings was honored for her contributions to the LGBT cause at the seventh annual PrideFest America, in Philadelphia. The organization described Gittings as \"the Rosa Parks of the gay and lesbian civil rights movement\".\n\nGittings was renowned for her \"ferocious dedication to the cause with a cock-eyed optimism, kindness, and gentle sense of humor.\" As recognition for Gittings' contributions to the promotion of gay and lesbian literature, in 2002 the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table of the ALA renamed one of their three book awards the Stonewall Book Award-Barbara Gittings Literature Award. In 2001, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation honored her by bestowing her the first Barbara Gittings Award, highlighting dedication to activism. The same year, the Free Library of Philadelphia announced its Barbara Gittings Collection of books dedicated to gay and lesbian issues. There are more than 2000 items in the collection, the second largest gay and lesbian collection of books in the US outside that of the San Francisco Public Library.\n\nIn 2003, the American Library Association rewarded her with its highest tribute, lifetime honorary membership. She also earned the first John E. Fryer Award from the American Psychiatric Association in 2006 with Frank Kameny. The award goes to people who have made a significant impact on the mental health of gays and lesbians. In October 2006, The Smithsonian Institution acquired a sign she carried in her picketing in 1965, donated by Frank Kameny. In 2007, readers of \"The Advocate\" included Gittings on a list of their 40 favorite gay and lesbian heroes.\n\nOn October 1, 2012, the city of Philadelphia named a section of Locust Street \"Barbara Gittings Way\" in Gittings' memory. Also in 2012 she was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people.\n\nGittings was an avid music lover, most interested in Baroque and Renaissance music. She sang in choral groups for most of her life, spending over 50 years in the Philadelphia Chamber Chorus. She was also a hiking and canoeing enthusiast. She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: \"We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to Boston [to see her] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not care what the world thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her and kissed her. That was not being done in 1961.\"\n\nGittings and Lahusen were together for 46 years. They donated copies of some materials and photographs covering their activism to the Cornell University Rare and Manuscript Collections. In 2007, Lahusen donated all of their original papers and photographs to the New York City Public Library (NYPL), whose head, Paul LeClerc, said, \"The collection donated by Barbara Gittings and Kay Tobin Lahusen is a remarkable first-hand chronicle detailing the battles of gays and lesbians to overcome the prejudice and restrictions that were prevalent prior to the activism and protest movements that started in the 1960s.\"\n\nThe University of Massachusetts Amherst main library received a donation of over 1,000 of Gittings' and Lahusen's books in 2007; it is the Gittings-Lahusen Gay Book Collection, Call no.: RB 005.\n\nIn 1997, Gittings and Lahusen pushed the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to grant couple's membership to them, for a reduced price on health insurance. One of her last acts as an activist was to come out in the newsletter published by the assisted living facility they reside in. On February 18, 2007, Gittings died in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania after a long battle with breast cancer. She is survived by her life partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen, and her sister, Eleanor Gittings Taylor. In 1999, Gittings summed up her inspiration for her activism: \"As a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn about myself and what it meant to be gay. Now for 48 years I've had the satisfaction of working with other gay people all across the country to get the bigots off our backs, to oil the closet door hinges, to change prejudiced hearts and minds, and to show that gay love is good for us and for the rest of the world too. It's hard work — but it's vital, and it's gratifying, and it's often fun!\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "732646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=732646", "title": "Camp Cropper", "text": "Camp Cropper\n\nCamp Cropper was a holding facility for security detainees operated by the United States Army near Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. The facility was initially operated as a high-value detention site (HVD), but has since been expanded increasing its capacity from 163 to 2,000 detainees. Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was held there prior to his execution.\n\nCamp Cropper was established by the Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) of the 115th Military Police Battalion in April 2003. It is named for Staff Sgt. Kenneth Cropper, a member of the Maryland Army National Guard who died in March 2002 while supporting security operations at the Pentagon. The facility was originally established as a High Value Detainee (HVD) holding area. Shortly after being established, its mission was expanded to also be a Corps Holding Area (CHA). Initially, the facility was meant to serve as \"central booking\" for the US forces operating in Baghdad and central Iraq, though detainees from northern Iraq were brought there as well. The original concept called for a small temporary camp that could hold up to 300 detainees for no more than 72 hours. After being processed at Camp Cropper detainees were supposed to be shipped to other detention facilities in Baghdad and throughout Iraq. However, in practice, this proved unworkable since most other prisons in Baghdad were badly damaged by looting after the fall of the Baath regime.\n\nAdditional units to operate Camp Cropper include:\n\nIn August 2006, a combat support hospital was opened on Camp Cropper that would treat both coalition soldiers and detainees from Camp Cropper. The hospital was initially staffed by members of the 21st Combat Support Hospital from Fort Hood, Texas who transferred to the new facility after the closure of the Abu Ghraib detention facility. The 21st CSH was later replaced by the 31st Combat Support Hospital from Fort Bliss, Texas.\n\nOn March 15, 2007 military officials announced plans to once again expand Camp Bucca and Camp Cropper. Officials stated that this increase in capacity would be necessary to handle the detainees generated from the increased security operations in Baghdad.\n\nIn the summer of 2010 the Camp Cropper facility was turned over to the Iraqi government and renamed Karkh Prison.\n\nA portion of Camp Cropper was still in use by the US Army until December 2011 through the 40th MP Battalion 15th MP Brigade, the 105th MP Battalion, 3rd Brigade 4th Infantry Division MP platoon, and 108th MP Company 16th MP Brigade.\n\nOn 2004-06-16, The Pentagon confirmed a report in \"The New York Times\" that former CIA chief George Tenet had been allowed by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to have an Iraqi prisoner secretly detained at Camp Cropper since November, but denied they were trying to hide the prisoner from the International Committee of the Red Cross. Rumsfeld later told reporters that the prisoner was treated humanely. In 2003, the Red Cross was given regular and open access to the facility and the detainees, the Red Cross documented severe living conditions, harsh treatment by guards, and poor medical care.\n\nIn October 2006, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported the wounding of one American soldier to date by detainees. The attack was reported to have been under suspicious circumstances.\n\nSince the closure of Abu Ghraib and the subsequent relocation to Camp Cropper, the now-larger prison has seen criticism for abuses of detainees and a hotbed of insurgent recruitment. Between October and December 2006, the MNF-I reported the deaths of three detainees at Camp Cropper. One from injuries inflicted by other detainees on October 29, two on November 30 and December 2 from natural causes. Other detainees died on 2007-04-04, 2007-05-26 and 2007-07-07.\n\nIn late April 2007, the former commander of Camp Cropper, Lieutenant Colonel William H. Steele was reported to be held in a military prison in Kuwait to await an Article 32 hearing. He was charged with various breaches of military law, including supplying an unmonitored cellphone to a detainee and inappropriate relationship with a detainee's daughter. On October 19, 2007, a military judge found Steele not guilty on the charge of aiding the enemy, but guilty of \"unauthorized possession of classified documents, behavior unbecoming an officer for an inappropriate relationship with an interpreter and failing to obey a lawful order\". Steele faced a possible maximum 6-year sentence for the charges he previously pleaded guilty to, as well as an additional 10 years for the charges for which he was convicted. Instead, he was sentenced to 2 years confinement, minus time already served, loss of his military retirement, forfeiture of pay and allowances and a dismissal from the military.\n\n"}

The 79 Group was another internal grouping within the SNP that was attempting to turn the party into an expressly socialist party. The Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland formed itself to try to ensure that the SNP avoided traditional debates of left and right, arguing that the cause of Scottish independence transcended such arguments. It had the support of prominent traditionalists inside the party such as Winnie Ewing who had been a Member of Parliament in the 1960s and was by this stage a Member of the European Parliament.\n\nSNP leader Gordon Wilson was determined to end factionalism inside the SNP, and at the party conference of 1982 internal groupings were banned. This was largely a reaction to the growth of the 79 Group who faded in significance after this decision was taken. After the 79 Group fell apart the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland did likewise (however, many of the members of the 79 group were readmitted, and indeed came to lead the party).\n"}

It is known as \"queen of waxes\" and in its pure state, usually comes in the form of hard yellow-brown flakes. It is obtained from the leaves of the carnauba palm by collecting and drying them, beating them to loosen the wax, then refining and bleaching the wax.\n\nCarnauba consists mostly of aliphatic esters (40 wt%), diesters of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (21.0 wt%), ω-hydroxycarboxylic acids (13.0 wt%), and fatty alcohols (12 wt%). The compounds are predominantly derived from acids and alcohols in the C26-C30 range. Distinctive for carnauba wax is the high content of diesters as well as methoxycinnamic acid.\n\nCarnauba wax is sold in several grades, labeled T1, T3, and T4, depending on the purity level. Purification is accomplished by filtration, centrifugation, and bleaching.\n\nCarnauba wax can produce a glossy finish and as such is used in automobile waxes, shoe polishes, dental floss, food products such as sweets, instrument polishes, and floor and furniture waxes and polishes, especially when mixed with beeswax and with turpentine. Use for paper coatings is the most common application in the United States. It was commonly used in its purest form as a coating on speedboat hulls in the early 1960s to enhance speed and aid in handling in salt water environments. It is also the main ingredient in surfboard wax, combined with coconut oil.\n\nBecause of its hypoallergenic and emollient properties as well as its shine, carnauba wax appears as an ingredient in many cosmetics formulas where it is used to thicken lipstick, eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, foundation, deodorant, various skin care preparations, sun care preparations, etc. It is also used to make cutler's resin.\n\nIt is the finish of choice for most briar tobacco or smoking pipes. It produces a high gloss finish when buffed on to wood. This finish dulls with time rather than flaking off (as is the case with most other finishes used).\n\nAlthough too brittle to be used by itself, carnauba wax is often combined with other waxes (principally beeswax) to treat and waterproof many leather products where it provides a high-gloss finish and increases leather's hardness and durability.\n\nIt is also used in the pharmaceutical industry as a tablet-coating agent. Adding the carnauba wax aids in the swallowing of tablets for patients. A very small amount (less than a hundredth of one percent by weight, i.e., 30 grams for a 300 kg batch) is sprinkled onto a batch of tablets after they have been sprayed and dried. The wax and tablets are then tumbled together for a few minutes before being discharged from the tablet-coating machine. \n\nIn 1890, Charles Tainter patented the use of carnauba wax on phonograph cylinders as a replacement for a mixture of paraffin and beeswax.\n\nCarnauba wax may be used as a mold release agent for manufacture of fibre-reinforced plastics. An aerosol mold release agent is formed by dissolving carnauba wax in a solvent. Unlike silicone or PTFE, carnauba is suitable for use with liquid epoxy, epoxy molding compounds (EMC), and some other plastic types and generally enhances their properties . Carnauba wax is not very soluble in chlorinated or aromatic hydrocarbons.\nCarnauba is used in melt/castable explosives to produce an insensitive explosive formula such as Composition B, which is a blend of RDX and TNT.\n\nIn 2006, Brazil produced 22,409 tons of carnauba wax, of which 14% was solid wax, and 86% was in powder form.\n\nThere are 20-25 exporters of carnauba wax in Brazil who buy the carnauba wax from middlemen or directly from farmers. The exporters refine the wax before exporting it to the rest of the world. \nThe four largest exporters of carnauba wax are Pontes, Brasil Ceras, Foncepi, and Carnauba do Brasil, who together account for around €25 million of the export market. According to the German television program , conditions for many carnauba production workers are quite poor; one Brazilian Labor Ministry official found conditions \"that could be described as slavery.\"\n\nAccording to the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade, the major destinations for exported carnauba wax are:\n\n\n"}

In some geographies the role is assumed by the chief counsel, in others by a corporate or company secretary. \n\nThe role is likely to grow in prominence as corporate governance requirements - in voluntary codes or law - grow and mature. The heads of several governance-related functions may report to the CGO, including community relations / public affairs, corporate strategy, business continuity management, business performance management, compliance management / internal controls, corporate communication, corporate philanthropy, enterprise risk management, ethics management, internal audit, investor relations, legal services, stakeholder management and sustainability management. Also, the appointment of a CGO with clout is both a signal to the market that the company takes corporate governance seriously and a way to increase the market value of a firm if, as research by McKinsey shows, investors will pay a premium for the stock of well-governed companies.\n\nAs corporations add the necessary functions, several issues arise. First is the risk that the functions overlap, evolve into silos, create misunderstanding internally and externally and act at cross purposes. Second is the opportunity for enhanced impact through synergy between these functions. Risk managers, compliance officers and business performance managers often need to manage change in order to achieve their objectives. Without a sponsor at top management level their efforts may fail when the magnitude of resistance to change overwhelms their limited powers of influence. Third, the serial introduction of new processes may simply require more attention, time and enthusiasm than line managers can realistically offer. A single phased plan for enabling good governance could mitigate the risks and preempt any wasteful expenditure. Last, the complexity of the interactions between the different functions compounded by the infancy of the new disciplines may require continuous conceptual interpretation for top management and the board.\n\nCompanies that have appointed CGOs include Allianz, Kodak, Krispy Kreme, Prudential, Telkom, and Vodacom.\n"}

This agency was created originally to implement the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP). Subsequently the DRDAs were entrusted with number of programmes of both state and central governments. From April 1999a separate DRDA Administration has been introduced to take care of the administrative costs. This aims at strengthening the DRDAs and make them more professional in managing the anti-poverty programmes and be an effective link between the ministry and the district level.\n\nRural development and poverty alleviation programmes are implemented on a decentralised basis, keeping in view the large geographical areas, the administrative requirements and the need to involve grassroots-level officials and the community in the implementation of the programmes. At the central level the Ministry of Rural Areas & Employment has been implementing these programmes. The Ministry is responsible for the release of central share of funds, policy formulation, overall guidance, monitoring and evaluation of the programmes. At the State level Prl Secretary, Rural Development and the Commissioner of Rural Development are overall incharge for implementation of the rural development programmes. At the District level, the programmes are implemented through the DRDAs (District Rural Development Agencies). The governing body of DRDA includes Members of Parliament (MPs), Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs), District level officials of Development Departments, Bankers, NGO's and representatives of weaker sections of the society. The District Collector used to be (but not always at present) the Chairman of the Governing Board. The Governing body at the district level provides guidance and directions to DRDA. The body in DRDA responsible for actual implementation is headed by an Additional District Collector.\n\nMany Schemes of the Central and State Governments are introduced from time to time. Several schemes are available providing support to different components of Rural Development. Schemes are also periodically modified to reflect the experience over the years. The task of DRDA has been to identify the needs of the rural population and reach the appropriate schemes where they are needed. In implementing the schemes, the role of the DRDA has been Technical, Managerial and Financial. Thus DRDA is not only a body to disburse the funds for the schemes but also provide appropriate Managerial and Technical support.\n\nDistrict Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs) are district level development execution and monitoring agencies created under the Indian Societies Registration Act. Substantial sums of rural development funds of government of India were transferred and routed through them under various Centrally Sponsored\nSchemes. From purely a financial resource from Rural Development point of view the DRDAs are extremely important institutions at the district level. kalyan kumar\n\nWith the adoption of the Constitutional mandate for decentralization of powers that privileged those self-government institutions in planning for economic development and social justice, the proposal to re-think the status of DRDAs and also to merge them with the panchayats had emerged. Under the section on 'devoluton of functionaries' the 1st Round Table had adopted a resolution, number IV(i), for reconceiving the role of District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs). DRDAs were to be progressively merged with the District Panchayats and their technical expertise made available to all tiers of Panchayats.\n\nAt an all India level, the progress reported in this regard is far from satisfactory. There are some vexed issues, one among which is the 'reported' reluctance on the part of some of the institutions of Union Government for the proposal of merger of DRDAs with the district Panchayats. The complete merger seems to have happened only in Kerala and Karnataka. The latter has a much longer history of doing this. In both the States the DRDAs function as if they were the cells for poverty alleviation/ rural development schemes within the Zilla Panchayats.\n\nWest Bengal is reported to have taken similar steps; yet, it does not measure up to the yardstick of complete merger. Rajasthan and Lakshadweep State/ UT Profile make a similar assertion; this report is unable to confirm this.\n\nIn 10 States/ UTs the DRDAs continue to be separate with the only linkage established with the ZPs is making the President of ZP the Chairperson of the DRDA. These are Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha , Punjab, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Lakshadweep. In Gujarat the District Development Officer, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Panchayat, continues to chair the DRDA. In nine States/ UTs either the Collector continues as the Chair or some other arrangement has been made in this regard. These are Assam, Goa, Haryana, Jharkhand, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, and Pondicherry. Andhra Pradesh has made the Zilla Panchayat President the Chair of the DRDA while designating the Collector as the Executive Chairperson. Similarly, in Maharashtra,\nwhile the President Zilla Panchayat is made the Chair of the DRDA, the Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Panchayat is designated as the Executive Chairman of the Management Committee.\n\nTable : Status of DRDAs in the States\n\n"}

{"id": "78326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78326", "title": "Flag of Luxembourg", "text": "Flag of Luxembourg\n\nThe flag of Luxembourg (, , ) consists of three horizontal stripes, red, white and blue, and can be in 1:2 or 3:5 ratio. It was first used between 1845 and 1848 and officially adopted on 23 June 1972.\n\nLuxembourg had no flag until 1830, when patriots were urged to display the national colours. The flag was defined as a horizontal tricolour of red, white, and blue in 1848, but it was not officially adopted until 1972. The tricolour flag is almost identical to that of the Netherlands, except that it is longer and its blue stripe and red stripe are a lighter shade. The red, white, and blue colours were derived from the coat of arms of the House of Luxembourg.\n\nThe colours of the flag of Luxembourg were first adopted around 1830 during the Belgian Revolution. They were probably derived from the counts, dukes and later grand-dukes of Luxembourg's coat of arms which in turn was derived from the combination of the dukes of Limbourg's Lion and the supposed striped banner of the early counts of Luxembourg. The three-colored horizontal design was fixed on 12 June 1845.\n\nIt took until 23 June 1972 before a law was passed regulating the flag of Luxembourg. The same law also prescribed ensign and roundel for aircraft and ships registered in Luxembourg.\n\nOne important clarification brought by this law was that the color blue was defined as being a very bright blue, in contrast to the flag of the Netherlands (exactly the same design, but the Dutch flag uses dark blue and a less oblong shape).\n\nThe heraldric blazon for the flag is \"per fess Gules and Azure, a fess Argent\".\n\nThe red lion is the official ensign for ships registered in Luxembourg. It is used for river and sea shipping, as well as for aviation. This flag is based on the coat of arms of Luxembourg (a banner of arms) and is used as the ensign to avoid the possibility of Luxembourg's ensign being confused for that of the Netherlands. Ten white and blue stripes serve as the field for a red lion with a yellow tongue, claws and crown. The proper ratio for this ensign is 5:7.\n\nThe \"Réglement Grand-Ducal\" of 27 July 1993 defined the ensign's colours as follows:\n\nThe roundel of Luxembourg is seen on the AWACS aircraft used by NATO.\n\nThe resemblance of the Luxembourgish flag with the Dutch flag has given rise to a national debate to change it.\n\nOn 5 October 2006, MP Michel Wolter introduced a legislative proposition to replace the current red-white-blue national flag with the red lion ensign. He argued that the current flag was commonly confused with that of the Netherlands and that the red lion on the other hand was more popular, more aesthetic and of greater historic value. Wolter also claimed he had personally discussed the matter with some three hundred people, most of whom expressed their support for his initiative. On the other hand, many national politicians (including leading members of Wolter's own CSV) and VIPs have expressed astonishment in the local media concerning both the timing and necessity for such a change. Wolter was supported in his initiative by the centre-right ADR.\n\nOn 24 October 2006, a local initiative called \"Initiativ Roude Léiw\" (\"Red Lion Initiative\") held a press conference explaining their intention to support Wolter's project on a non-partisan basis. Their first actions would include distribution of red lion bumper stickers, a petition and a poll. During sporting events like the Tour de France supporters for Luxembourg participants now overwhelmingly use the Ensign instead of the Flag.\n\nIn 2015, a citizen submitted a formal petition to the Chamber of Deputies to replace the current national flag with the \"Roude Léiw\".\n\nFor historic reasons, the adjacent Belgian province of Luxembourg uses a flag that also features a lion superimposed on horizontal stripes. Elsewhere, similar designs can also be found, for instance in the Belgian city of Bruges and the German state of Hesse.\n\nOn 6 July 2007, the Government stated that the \"Roude Léiw\" would be accepted as a Civil flag only within the territory of the Grand-Duchy along with the National flag keeping the same proportions, i.e. 1:2 or 3:5 as the National flag to avoid confusion with the Civil ensign.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "197051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197051", "title": "German East Africa", "text": "German East Africa\n\nGerman East Africa () (GEA) was a German colony in the African Great Lakes region, which included present-day Burundi, Rwanda, and the mainland part of Tanzania. GEA's area was , which was nearly three times the area of present-day Germany, and double the area of metropolitan Germany then.\n\nThe colony was organised when the German military was asked in the late 1880s to put down a revolt against the activities of the German East Africa Company. It ended with Imperial Germany's defeat in World War I. Ultimately, GEA was divided between Britain and Belgium and was reorganised as a mandate of the League of Nations.\n\nLike other colonial powers, the Germans expanded their empire in the Africa Great Lakes region, ostensibly to fight slavery and the slave trade. Unlike other imperial powers, however, they never formally abolished either, preferring instead to curtail the production of new \"recruits\" and regulate the existing slaving business.\n\nThe colony began when Carl Peters, an adventurer who founded the Society for German Colonization, signed treaties with several native chieftains on the mainland opposite Zanzibar. On 3 March 1885, the German government announced that it had granted an imperial charter, which was signed by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck on 27 February 1885. The charter was granted to Peters' company and was intended to establish a protectorate in the African Great Lakes region. Peters then recruited specialists who began exploring south to the Rufiji River and north to Witu, near Lamu on the coast.\n\nThe Sultan of Zanzibar protested, claiming that he was the ruler of both Zanzibar and the mainland. Chancellor Bismarck then sent five warships, which arrived on 7 August 1885 and trained their guns on the Sultan's palace. The British and Germans agreed to divide the mainland between themselves, and the Sultan had no option but to agree.\n\nGerman rule was established quickly over Bagamoyo, Dar es Salaam, and Kilwa. The caravans of , Wilhelm Langheld, Emin Pasha, and Charles Stokes were sent to dominate \"the Street of Caravans.\" The Abushiri Revolt of 1888 was put down with British help the following year. In 1890, London and Berlin concluded the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty, which returned Heligoland to Germany and decided the border between GEA and the East Africa Protectorate controlled by Britain, although the exact boundaries remained unsurveyed until 1910.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1894, the Hehe people, led by Chief Mkwawa, resisted German expansion. They were defeated because rival tribes supported the Germans. After years of guerrilla warfare, Mkwawa himself was cornered and committed suicide in 1898.\n\nThe Maji Maji Rebellion occurred in 1905 and was put down by Governor Gustav Adolf von Götzen. Scandal soon followed, however, with allegations of corruption and brutality. In 1907, Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow appointed Bernhard Dernburg to reform the colonial administration.\n\nGerman colonial administrators relied heavily on native chiefs to keep order and collect taxes. By 1 January 1914, aside from local police, the military garrisons of the \"Schutztruppen\" (protective troops) at Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Iringa, and Mahenge numbered 110 German officers (including 42 medical officers), 126 non-commissioned officers, and 2,472 Askari (native enlisted men).\n\nGermans promoted commerce and economic growth. Over were put under sisal cultivation, which was the largest cash crop. Two million coffee trees were planted, rubber trees grew on , and there were large cotton plantations.\n\nTo bring these agricultural products to market, beginning in 1888, the Usambara Railway was built from Tanga to Moshi. The Central Railroad covered and linked Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Tabora, and Kigoma. The final link to the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika was completed in July 1914 and was cause for a huge and festive celebration in the capital with an agricultural fair and trade exhibition. Harbor facilities were built or improved with electrical cranes, with rail access and warehouses. Wharves were remodeled at Tanga, Bagamoyo, and Lindi. In 1912, Dar es Salaam and Tanga received 356 freighters and passenger steamers and over 1,000 coastal ships and local trading-vessels. Dar es Salaam became the showcase city of all of tropical Africa. By 1914, Dar es Salaam and the surrounding province had a population of 166,000, among them 1,000 Germans. In all of the GEA, there were 3,579 Germans.\n\nGold mining in Tanzania in modern times dates back to the German colonial period, beginning with gold discoveries near Lake Victoria in 1894. The Kironda-Goldminen-Gesellschaft established one of the first gold mines in the colony, the Sekenke Gold Mine, which began operation in 1909 after the finding of gold there in 1907.\n\nGermany developed an educational program for Africans that included elementary, secondary, and vocational schools. \"Instructor qualifications, curricula, textbooks, teaching materials, all met standards unmatched anywhere in tropical Africa.\" In 1924, ten years after the beginning of the First World War and six years into British rule, the visiting American Phelps-Stokes Commission reported, \"In regards to schools, the Germans have accomplished marvels. Some time must elapse before education attains the standard it had reached under the Germans.\"\n\nThe Swahili word \"shule\" means school and has been borrowed from the German word \"schule\".\n\nIn the most populous colony of the German Empire, there were more than 7.5 million locals compared to around 10,000 Europeans, who resided mainly in coastal locations and official residences. In 1913, only 882 German farmers and planters lived in the colony. About 70,000 Africans worked on the plantations of GEA.\n\nGeneral Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, who had served in German South West Africa and Kamerun, led the German military in GEA during World War I. His military consisted of 3,500 Europeans and 12,000 native Askaris and porters. Their war strategy was to harry the British/Imperial army of 40,000, which was at times commanded by the former Second Boer War commander Jan Smuts. One of Lettow-Vorbeck's greatest victories was at the Battle of Tanga (3–5 November 1914), where German forces defeated a British force more than eight times larger.\n\nLettow-Vorbeck's guerrilla warfare compelled Britain to commit significant resources to a minor colonial theatre throughout the war and inflicted more than 10,000 casualties. Eventually, the weight of numbers, especially after forces coming from the Belgian Congo had attacked from the west (Battle of Tabora), and dwindling supplies forced Lettow-Vorbeck to abandon the colony. He withdrew south into Portuguese Mozambique, then into Northern Rhodesia where he agreed to a ceasefire three days after the end of the war after receiving news of the armistice between the warring nations.\n\nLettow-Vorbeck was acclaimed after the war as one of Germany's heroes. His \"Schutztruppe\" was celebrated as the only colonial German force during World War I that was not defeated in open combat, although they often retreated when outnumbered. The Askari colonial troops that had fought in the East African campaign were later given pension payments by the Weimar Republic and West Germany.\n\nThe SMS \"Königsberg\", a German light cruiser, also fought off the coast of the African Great Lakes region. She was eventually scuttled in the Rufiji delta in July 1915 after running low on coal and spare parts, and was subsequently blockaded and bombarded by the British. The surviving crew stripped out the remaining ship's guns and mounted them on gun carriages, before joining the land forces, adding considerably to their effectiveness.\n\nAnother and smaller campaign was conducted on the shores of southern Lake Tanganyika over 1914–15. This involved a makeshift British and Belgian flotilla, and the \"Reichsheer\" garrison at Bismarckburg (modern day Kasanga).\n\nThe Supreme Council of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference awarded all of German East Africa (GEA) to Britain on 7 May 1919, over the strenuous objections of Belgium. The British colonial secretary, Alfred Milner, and Belgium's minister plenipotentiary to the conference, , then negotiated the Anglo-Belgian agreement of 30 May 1919 where Britain ceded the north-western GEA provinces of Ruanda and Urundi to Belgium. The conference's Commission on Mandates ratified this agreement on 16 July 1919. The Supreme Council accepted the agreement on 7 August 1919.\n\nOn 12 July 1919, the Commission on Mandates agreed that the small Kionga Triangle south of the Rovuma River would be given to Portugal, with it eventually becoming part of independent Mozambique. The commission reasoned that Germany had virtually forced Portugal to cede the triangle in 1894.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 July 1919, although the treaty did not take effect until 10 January 1920. On that date, the GEA was transferred officially to Britain, Belgium, and Portugal. Also on that date, \"Tanganyika\" became the name of the British territory.\n\nMost place names in German East Africa continued to bear German spellings of the local names, such as \"Udjidji\" for Ujiji and \"Kilimandscharo\" for Mount Kilimanjaro, as well as German translations of some local phrases, such as \"Kleinaruscha\" for Arusha-Chini and \"Neu-Moschi\" for the city now known as Moshi. (Kigoma was known for a time as \"Rutschugi\".)\n\nThe few exceptions to the rule included:\n\n\nThe governors of German East Africa were as follows:\n\n\nIn 1914 a series of drafts were made for proposed Coat of Arms and Flags for the German Colonies. However, World War I broke out before the designs were finished and implemented and the symbols were never actually taken into use. Following the defeat in the war, Germany lost all its colonies and the prepared coat of arms and flags were therefore never used.\n\n\n\n"}

The case is known in Italy as the \"Imam Rapito affair\". Before that, Guido Salvini was in charge of investigations, since July 1988, concerning Italy's strategy of tension during the 1970s.\n\nAccording to Rome prosecutor, Pietro Salvitti, quoted by \"La Repubblica\", Guido Salvini was one of the targets of a \"network\" which aimed at slamdering various political opponents of Silvio Berlusconi via the Mitrokhin Commission, headed by senator Paolo Guzzanti, by claiming they worked for or were manipulated by the KGB, the former intelligence agency of the Soviet Union, dissolved in 1991. These targets included former Prime minister Romano Prodi, his staff, General Giuseppe Cucchi (current director of the CESIS), Milan prosecutor Armando Spataro, also in charge of the \"Imam Rapito\" case, as well as \"La Repubblica\" reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe D'Avanzo, who discovered the Yellowcake forgery manipulations.

He indicted in 1998 David Carrett, officer of the US Navy, on charges of political and military espionage as well as participation in the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing. He also indicted Sergio Minetto, Italian official member of Gladio, and \"pentito\" Carlo Digilio, indicted in the Piazza Fontana investigation.

It was founded in 1919 by an Act of Parliament (N. 1753/1919) and the legal framework for its function was reformed in 1927. The current name is specified in Law 3022/2011.\n\nThe Hellenic Coast Guard Force is currently under the authority of the Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy. The Hellenic Coast Guard Force is headed by the Senior Coast Guard Officer who has the rank of vice admiral (\"Antinavarchos\").\n\nThe basic roles of the Hellenic Coast Guard are law enforcement at sea, search and rescue, marine safety, preventing sea pollution, fisheries patrolling, preventing illegal immigration and drug interdiction.\n\nIn order to perform these roles, the Coast Guard operate a number of patrol boats of various sizes (6m to 60m) and different types (RIBs, coastal patrol boats, offshore patrol boats, lifeboats and pollution control vessels).

She taught seminars internationally, and was the first Director of Education at the Haven Institute.\n\nBorn premature and abandoned at birth, she struggled with physical developmental challenges as a child; she experienced chronic, unrelenting pain every day of her adult life. Rather than succumb to a passive life of victimhood, she worked with her challenges, and excelled academically. Her own experiences of suffering gave her particular insight and empathy for others with difficulties, and she was known as a caring, empathetic counsellor and teacher. But she was also disciplined and rigorous, and expected her students to embrace personal responsibility without complaint, as she had done.\n\nPeterson earned a B.A. at Willamette University (1956), M.S.W. at University of Washington (1958), Dip.C. from the Haven Institute (1990) and Ph.D. from the \"Open International University\" (2000).

{"id": "192669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192669", "title": "Lord-lieutenant", "text": "Lord-lieutenant\n\nA lord-lieutenant () is the British monarch's personal representative in each county of the United Kingdom. Historically, each lieutenant was responsible for organising the county's militia. In 1871, the lieutenant's responsibility over the local militia was removed. However, it was not until 1921 that they formally lost the right to call upon able-bodied men to fight when needed.\n\nLord-lieutenant is now an honorary titular position usually awarded to a retired notable person in the county.\n\nLieutenants were first appointed to a number of English counties by King Henry VIII in the 1540s, when the military functions of the sheriff were handed over to him. He raised and was responsible for the efficiency of the local militia units of the county, and afterwards of the yeomanry, and volunteers. He was commander of these forces, whose officers he appointed. These commissions were originally of temporary duration, and only when the situation required the local militia to be specially supervised and well prepared; often where invasion by Scotland or France might be expected.\n\nLieutenancies soon became more organised, probably in the reign of his successor King Edward VI, their establishment being approved by the English parliament in 1550. However, it was not until the threat of invasion by the forces of Spain in 1585 that lieutenants were appointed to all counties and counties corporate and became in effect permanent. Although some counties were left without lieutenants during the 1590s, following the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the office continued to exist, and was retained by King James I even after the end of the Anglo-Spanish War.\n\nThe office was abolished under the Commonwealth, but was re-established following the Restoration under the City of London Militia Act 1662, which declared that:\n\nAlthough not explicitly stated, from that date lieutenants were appointed to \"counties at large\", with their jurisdiction including the counties corporate within the parent county. For example, lieutenants of Devon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries appointed deputy lieutenants to the City of Exeter, and were sometimes described as the \"Lieutenant of Devon and Exeter\" The one exception was Haverfordwest, to which a lieutenant continued to be appointed until 1974. The origin of this anomaly may have lain in the former palatine status of Pembrokeshire.\n\nThe City of London was uniquely given a commission of lieutenancy, and was exempt from the authority of the lieutenant of Middlesex. The Constable of the Tower of London and the Warden of the Cinque Ports were \"ex-officio\" lieutenants for the Tower Hamlets and Cinque Ports respectively, which were treated as counties in legislation regarding lieutenancy and militia affairs.\n\nThe official title of the office at this time was His or Her Majesty's \"Lieutenant for the county of x\", but as almost all office-holders were peers of the realm, they were referred to as \"Lord-Lieutenant\".\n\n\"An Act to make the Militia of this Kingdom more useful\" (Geo 2, c.9) was passed by the Parliament of Ireland in 1715. This provided for the issuing of commissions to appoint persons as \"his Majesty's lieutenant or lieutenants, governor or governors, and commissioners of array for the several and respective counties, cities, and places of Ireland\". The lieutenants were empowered to embody militia regiments. When the Irish Free State became independent of the UK in 1922, British rule ceased to exist.\n\nIn 1921, with the establishment of Northern Ireland, lord lieutenants continued to be appointed through the Governor of Northern Ireland to the six counties and two county boroughs. In 1973 the counties and county boroughs were abolished as local government units in Northern Ireland, and lord-lieutenants are now appointed directly by the Queen to \"counties and county boroughs... as defined for local government purposes immediately before 1 October 1973\".\n\nAlthough Colin, Earl of Balcarres was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Fife in 1688, and lieutenants were appointed to a few counties from about 1715, it was not until 1794 that permanent lieutenancies were established by Royal Warrant. By the Militia Act 1797, the lieutenants appointed \"for the Counties, Stewartries, Cities, and Places\" were given powers to raise and command county militia units.\n\nThe Lord Provosts of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Dundee are, by virtue of office, also the lord-lieutenant of their respective city.\n\nWhile in their lieutenancies, lord-lieutenants are among the few individuals in Scotland officially permitted to fly the banner of the Royal Arms of Scotland, or \"The Lion Rampant\" as it is more commonly known.\n\nThe Militia Act 1802 provided for the appointment of lieutenants to \"Lieutenants for the Counties, Ridings, and Places\" in England and Wales, and gave them command of the county militia. In the case of towns or cities which were counties of themselves, the \"chief magistrate\" (meaning the mayor, chief bailiff or other head of the corporation) had the authority to appoint deputy lieutenants in the absence of an appointment of a lieutenant by the crown. \nThe Regulation of the Forces Act 1871 removed the lieutenant as head of the county militia, as the jurisdiction, duties and command exercised by the lieutenant were revested in the crown, but the power of recommending for first appointments was reserved to the lieutenant.\n\nThe Militia Act 1882 revested the jurisdiction of the lieutenants in the crown.\n\nThe lieutenancies were reestablished on a new basis by Section 29 of the 1882 Act which stated that \"Her Majesty shall from time to time appoint lieutenants for the several counties in the United Kingdom\". Counties for lieutenancy purposes were also redefined as \"a county at large, with the exception that each riding of the county of York shall be a separate county\". The text of the letters patent appointing lieutenants under the act stated they were to be:\n\nThis was a formal recognition of the situation that had existed since 1662 that the lieutenancies for the majority of counties corporate in England were held jointly with their associated county—for example a lieutenant was now appointed for \"the County of Gloucester, and the City and County of Gloucester, and the City and County of City of Bristol\".\n\nHaverfordwest was permitted to retain a lieutenant while the Tower Hamlets and Cinque Ports were to continue to be regarded as counties for lieutenancy purposes.\n\nFrom 1889 lieutenancy counties in England and Wales were to correspond to groupings of administrative counties and county boroughs established by the Local Government Act 1888. The creation of a new County of London also led to the ending of the Tower Hamlets lieutenancy. The Act also extinguished the lieutenancy of the Cinque Ports.\n\nSection 69 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 realigned the lieutenancy counties with the new administrative counties created by the Act. The one exception was County Tipperary, which although administered by two county councils, was to remain united for lieutenancy. In contrast to the legislation in England and Wales, each county borough was to have its own lieutenant, and those counties corporate not made county boroughs were abolished. The effect of this was to create a lieutenant for the county boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, and to abolish those for the city of Kilkenny, borough of Drogheda and town of Galway.\n\nThe office of lieutenant was honorary and held during the royal pleasure, but virtually for life. Appointment to the office is by letters-patent under the great seal. Usually, though not necessarily, the person appointed lieutenant was also appointed custos rotulorum or keeper of the rolls. Appointments to the county bench of magistrates were usually made on the recommendation of the lieutenant.\n\nThe Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 established County Territorial Force Associations, of which the lieutenant was to be head, styled president of the county association. It restated the combination of counties and counties corporate as lieutenancy counties.\n\nIn 1921, with the establishment of Northern Ireland, lieutenants continued to be appointed through the Governor of Northern Ireland to the six counties and two county boroughs. The creation of the Irish Free State in the following year saw the remaining county lieutenancies in Ireland abolished. In 1973 the counties and county boroughs were abolished as local government units in Northern Ireland, and lord-lieutenants are now appointed directly by the sovereign to \"counties and county boroughs... as defined for local government purposes immediately before 1 October 1973\". In 1975 the term lord-lieutenant officially replaced that of lieutenant.\n\nLocal government reform in England in 1965 led to the appointment of lieutenants to Greater London and Huntingdon and Peterborough, and the abolition of those of the counties of London, Middlesex and Huntingdon.\n\nA more fundamental reform of local government throughout England and Wales (outside Greater London) created a new structure of metropolitan, non-metropolitan and Welsh counties in 1974. Section 218 of the Local Government Act 1972 that established the new system stated: \"Her Majesty shall appoint a lord-lieutenant for each county in England and Wales and for Greater London...\" The Act appears to be the first statutory use of the term \"lord-lieutenant\" for lieutenants to counties.\n\nExisting lord lieutenants were assigned to one of the corresponding new counties wherever possible. Where this could not be done, the existing office-holder became a lieutenant of a county, junior to the lord-lieutenant. For example, the Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Powys, with those of Breconshire and Radnorshire each being designated as simply \"Lieutenant of Powys\". This measure was temporary, and no lieutenants have been appointed in this way since 1974, although the power still exists.\n\nIn 1975 counties ceased to be used for local government purposes in Scotland. The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 replaced the counties with regions, and each region was to have one or more lord-lieutenants appointed. The areas to which they were appointed approximated to the counties and were based and were defined in terms of the new local government districts.\n\nIn 1996 Scottish regions and districts were abolished on further local government reorganisation, and since that date lord-lieutenants have been appointed to \"lieutenancy areas\", roughly equivalent to the old Scottish counties.\n\nPartial reform of local government in England since 1995 has led to the creation of so-called ceremonial counties to which lord-lieutenants are now appointed. The Lieutenancies Act 1997 is the most recent piece of primary legislation dealing with Lieutenancies in England and includes the definitive list of the current areas used. Ceremonial counties may comprise combinations of county council areas and unitary authorities.\n\nSince the local government re-organisation of 1996 in Wales, lord-lieutenants are now appointed to \"preserved counties\", i.e. the counties used for administrative purposes from 1974 to 1996.\n\nThe City of London was unaffected by changes introduced since 1882. It has a Commission of Lieutenancy rather than a single lord-lieutenant. The head of the commission is the Lord Mayor of the City of London.\n\nLord-lieutenants are the monarch's representatives in their respective lieutenancies. It is their foremost duty to uphold the dignity of the Crown, and in so doing they seek to promote a spirit of co-operation and good atmosphere through the time they give to voluntary and benevolent organisations and through the interest they take in the business and social life of their counties.\n\nThe modern responsibilities of lords-lieutenant include:\n\nAs the sovereign's representative in his or her county, a lord-lieutenant remains non-political and may not hold office in any political party. They are appointed for life, although the customary age of retirement is 75 and the sovereign may remove them.\n\nEach lord-lieutenant is supported by a vice lord-lieutenant and deputy lieutenants that he or she appoints. The vice lord-lieutenant takes over when the lord-lieutenant is abroad, ill, or otherwise incapacitated. The lord-lieutenant appoints between thirty and forty deputy lieutenants depending on the county's population.\n\nThey are unpaid, but receive minimal allowances for secretarial help, mileage allowance and a driver. Male lord-lieutenants receive an allowance for the ceremonial uniform, worn when receiving members of the Royal Family and on other formal occasions. There is no uniform for a female lord-lieutenant, but there is a badge which can be worn on ceremonial occasions.\n\nSince at least the eighteenth century a military-style uniform has been worn by male lieutenants (appropriate to the military origins of the post). Since 1831 this has been analogous to the uniform worn by a general staff officer, but with silver lace in place of the gold worn by regular officers. Over time, the design of the uniform changed in line with changes made to army uniform. At present, it is a dark blue uniform in the style of a General Officer's (but with buttons, shoulder-boards, sash etc. in silver rather than gold). A cap is worn, and a sword with a steel scabbard. The badge on the cap etc. varies depending on where the Lieutenant's County is situated: a rose is worn in England, shamrocks in Northern Ireland, a thistle in Scotland and Prince-of-Wales feathers in Wales. The uniform for a male vice lord-lieutenant and for deputy lieutenants is of a similar style, but with features to distinguish it from that of a lord-lieutenant.\n\nThe Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was the head of the British administration in Ireland until the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922.\n\n\nIn the colonies of the English Empire, and subsequently the British Empire, the duties of lords lieutenant were generally performed by the commander-in-chief or the governor. Both offices may have been occupied by the same person.\n\nBy way of an example, this is still the case in Britain's second, and oldest remaining, colony, Bermuda, where the Royal Navy's headquarters, main base, and dockyard for the North America and West Indies Station was established following independence of the United States of America. The colony had raised militia and volunteer forces since official settlement in 1612 (with a troop-of-horse added later), and a small force of regular infantry from 1701 to 1783. A large regular army garrison was built up after 1794, and the reserve forces faded away following the conclusion of the American War of 1812 as the local government lost interest in paying for their upkeep. From this point until the 1960s, governors were almost exclusively senior officers of the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers who were also military commanders-in-chief (and initially also vice admirals). Attempts to rekindle the militia without a Militia Act or funds from the colonial government were made throughout the century under the authorisation of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, but none proved lasting. The colonial government was finally compelled to raise militia and volunteer forces (the Bermuda Militia Artillery and the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps) by act in the 1890s (the Bermuda Cadet Corps, Bermuda Volunteer Engineers, and Bermuda Militia Infantry were added at later dates), and these fell under the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, as well as under operational control of his junior, the brigadier in charge of the Bermuda Command (or Bermuda Garrison), which included the regular as well as the part-time military (as opposed to naval) forces in the colony. Although the Royal Naval and the regular army establishments have been withdrawn from Bermuda, the Governor of Bermuda remains the Commander-in-Chief (though most recent office holders have not been career army officers) of the Royal Bermuda Regiment (a 1965 amalgam of the BMA and BVRC, which had both been reorganised in line with the Territorial Army after the First World War).\n\nIn France and Italy, the role of Prefect (\"préfet\" in French, \"prefetto\" in Italian) is different to that of lord-lieutenant, as the regional and departmental prefects of France are responsible for delivering as well as control functions of public services. In Sweden \"Landshövding\" and Norway \"Fylkesmann\", the regional governor is responsible for administrative control functions of services delivered and decisions made by local and county municipalities, as well as representing the king in the region. In the Netherlands, King's Commissioner (\"Commissaris van de Koning\" in Dutch) is appointed by the monarch, but unlike a lord-lieutenant, belongs to a political party.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43441300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43441300", "title": "Matzpen", "text": "Matzpen\n\nMatzpen (, lit. 'Compass') is the name of a revolutionary socialist and anti-Zionist organisation, founded in Israel in 1962 which was active until the 1980s. Its official name was the Socialist Organisation in Israel, but it became better known as Matzpen after its monthly publication.\n\nThe organisation was founded by former members of the Israeli Communist Party – Maki – who opposed that party's unquestioned support for the international policies of the Soviet Union. They offered a more radical analysis of and opposition to Zionism. An early analysis of the Arab–Israeli conflict, written before they left the Communist Party, by Moshe Machover and Akiva Orr (using a pseudonym, N. Israeli), appeared in Hebrew in 1961 under the title of \"Shalom, Shalom ve'ein Shalom\" (שלום, שלום, ואין שלום; Peace, Peace When There is No Peace – an English translation was completed in 2009; although still unpublished as of August 2016, the translation is available online). Matzpen drew together Jewish and Arab activists with various backgrounds in left-wing organisations and affiliations. Prominent among them was Jabra Nicola, a Palestinian-Israeli intellectual and activist who helped shape the theoretical orientation of the nascent organisation. It published a magazine of the same name in Hebrew and Arabic. The organisation grew in the period after the 1967 Six-Day War and Israel's occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories.\n\nIn a statement titled \"Down with the Occupation”, from 1 January 1969, Matzpen distinguished itself – together with the Communist Party (Rakah) – as the only forces conducting \"a consistent struggle against the continued occupation of the territories conquered in June '67\". Faced with a situation in which \"Israel controls the whole of the Palestine Mandate territory as well as vast tracts of Egyptian territory and a region in the south of Syria\", Matzpen asserted in \"General Declaration by the ISO\" in March 1968, that \"It is both the right and duty of every conquered and subjugated people to resist and to struggle for its freedom. The ways, means and methods necessary and appropriate for such struggle must be determined by the people itself and it would be hypocritical for strangers - especially if they belong to the oppressing nation – to preach to it, saying, 'Thus shalt thou do, and thus shalt thou not do.'\" It added, that despite its recognition of \"the unconditional right of the conquered to resist occupation\", as an organization it could support politically \"only such organizations which, in addition to resisting occupation, also recognize the right of the Israeli people for self-determination\" in order to enable \"a joint struggle of Arabs and Jews in the region for a common future.\"\n\nIn this context, Matzpen's aim was to create a broad front of people opposed to the occupation and in favour of a de-Zionized Israel, which would form part of a socialist federation of the entire Middle East. In contrast to the Communist Party and the Zionist Left, Matzpen insisted that the 1967 occupation was but one stage in the long history of Zionist settlement, and reversing it would be a necessary but not sufficient condition for overall solution to the problems of the Middle East. For such a solution, political mobilization of Arabs, Jews, and other national minorities in the region would be needed. The political framework for this mobilization became known as the Arab Revolution, which combined national and socialist tasks in the process of struggle against Zionism, imperialism and Arab reaction. To advance these aims, Matzpen established links with New Left organisations in Europe and other parts of the world, and also with progressive Palestinian organisations, such as the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\nMany of the original analyses and statements of the organisation were included in a published collection under the title \"The Other Israel: The Radical Case Against Zionism\", edited by Arie Bober (Doubleday, 1972).\nBober's book provided an overview of the positions held by Matzpen at the time on a range of issues, and thus is an essential resource on the organisation's analysis of Israeli society and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the introduction to the book he says: \n\"This book is the result of five years' collective effort by a small group of Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel to penetrate the dense net of illusion and myth that today dominates the thinking and feeling of most Israelis and, at the same time, largely determines the prevailing image of Israel in the Western world. According to the Zionist fairy tale, the state of Israel is an outpost of democracy, social justice and enlightenment, and a homeland and haven for the persecuted Jews of the world. This outpost, so the story goes, though earnestly seeking peace with its neighbors finds itself in a state of perpetual siege because of the greed of Arab rulers, the inherent “unreasonableness” of the Oriental mind and the innate Gentile proclivity toward hatred of the Jews.\n\n\"The reality, this book demonstrates, is utterly different. The Zionist state was born in the violent expropriation and expulsion from their country of the Palestinian Arabs, and that process continues today. In open alliance with Western, especially United States, imperialism, and in scarcely hidden collusion with the most reactionary forces in the Arab world, the Zionist state actively sets itself against every step, no matter how faltering, taken by the Arab masses to alleviate the centuries’ old misery imposed on them by colonialism and imperialism. Within the territories occupied since 1967, the Zionist state employs a system of direct military repression to expel Palestinian Arabs from their lands and secure Jewish colonization of them, and to crush every expression of Palestinian resistance. Within its own borders, the Zionist state engages in systematic national oppression of its minority of Arab citizens. The dark-skinned majority of the privileged Jewish community itself increasingly feels the sting of racist discrimination, as economic inequality increases and social conditions deteriorate. Far from offering a haven to the persecuted Jews of the world, the Zionist state is leading new immigrants and old settlers alike toward a new holocaust by mobilizing them in a colonial enterprise and a counterrevolutionary army against the struggle of the Arab masses for national liberation and social emancipation – a struggle that is not only just but will eventually be victorious. This state of affairs is, moreover, in no sense accidental. It was the inevitable outcome of the success of the Zionist project to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. And to change this reality requires not merely a change of government or a modification of one or another specific policy, but a revolutionary transformation of the very foundations of Israeli society.\"\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, supporters of Matzpen abroad published \"Israca\" (Israeli Revolutionary Action Committee Abroad). The magazine included many articles published in \"Matzpen\". Some of \"Matzpen\" was censored and that material was republished in \"Israca\". Moshé Machover, Eli Lobel, Haim Hanegbi, and Akiva Orr were all part of the editorial board. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, supporters of the organisation and other radical left academics and activists formed another journal in the UK, \"Khamsin\", in which they published their analyses of current events. A selection of material from \"Khamsin\" was published under the title \"Forbidden Agenda: Intolerance and Defiance in the Middle East\" (Saqi Books, 2000).\n\nIn 1970 the organisation started going through a process of ideological and organisational fragmentation, with some members leaving to form new groups, such as Avangard with a Trotskyist orientation, led by Menahem Carmi and Sylvain Cypel, and Ma'avak (Revolutionary Communist Alliance), with a Maoist orientation, led by Ilan Albert and Rami Livneh. A further split within the latter organisation saw the formation of the Revolutionary Communist Alliance - Red Front, led by Udi Adiv and Dan Vered. Avangard also underwent splits, which saw the formation of the Spartacist League in 1974 and the Nitzotz group in 1977.\n\nThe theoretical debates that led to the splits in Matzpen had to do with the conceptualization of the relations between class struggle and nationalism in the struggle for socialism. Avangard regarded Israel as a normal capitalist society in which the working class was the primary revolutionary agent. Hence, it saw its goal as the mobilization of that class to create an Israeli socialist republic. It regarded Matzpen's focus on the Israeli-Palestinian national conflict and on the colonial origins of Israeli society as a distraction from the class struggle. Ma'avak, in contrast, saw Matzpen as not emphasizing enough the colonial character of Israeli society. It saw its goal as that of facilitating the Palestinian national liberation struggle as a necessary step towards socialism. In response to both groups, Matzpen re-asserted its combination of support for national and social struggles.\n\nA major split within the core group of mainstream Matzpen took place in 1972, and both factions kept the name Matzpen for their respective journals, an issue that gave rise to sharp dispute between them. The obvious value of the 'Matzpen' label as a marker of radical left-wing politics was behind that decision. Most of the original leadership remained in what became known as Matzpen Tel Aviv, while the other faction became known as Matzpen Jerusalem. That latter group adopted the name Matzpen Marxist, to distinguish itself from its rivals. In 1975 it changed its name to Revolutionary Communist League, section of the Fourth International, while retaining the title Matzpen Marxist for its regular publication. The Tel Aviv group also changed its name subsequently (in 1978) to the Socialist Organization in Israel and dropped the adjective 'Israeli' in order to avoid possible association with Zionism. Both groups retained the original Matzpen dual focus on class and national liberation. Machover, Orr and Haim Hanegbi remained with the Tel Aviv based group, while the Jerusalem-based group was led by Arieh Bober and Michel Warschawski (Mikado). A youth movement known as Hafarperet (mole) was affiliated with the latter group, and was active in the mid-1970s, mostly in Haifa.\n\nOne of the organizations to emerge from Matzpen, the Red Front, had a brief history of just over a year. At the end of 1972 many of its members were arrested and charged with espionage and collaboration with the enemy (Syrian military intelligence), based on a secret trip some of them took to Damascus. None of the activists detained and charged were members of Matzpen at the time, or at the time they committed their alleged offences against state security. In a well-publicised trial in 1973 five members of the Red Front were sentenced to various periods in prison. Many of the defendants stated that they had been subjected to torture and other forms of physical and mental harassment by the Israeli security services before the trial, to force confessions out of them. It is obvious that none of them had any interest in working with the Syrian or other Arab regimes, and their sole interest consisted in establishing links with other revolutionary organizations in the region, primarily Palestinian ones. Statements before the trial, submitted by the leading defendants – Daud Turki and Ehud Adiv – allow us to get a clear idea of their perspective.\n\nTurki, A Palestinian-Arab citizen of Israel, defined their goal as socialism: “the common goal of all workers, peasants and those who are persecuted in Israeli society. The Jews have a share, and they must have a share, because they are members of the organization on a footing of equality with me, in establishing a new government and a new regime which will allow both the Jewish people and the Arab people to play an effective part in the struggle of the Arab people for liberation”. Turki went on to criticise Zionism, which “instead of adopting, as it should, a neutral attitude, or one of support for the Arab struggle for national and socialist liberation, it has stood beside this movement's enemies, beside the Americans who are persecuting the Vietnamese people, beside American imperialism which is exploiting the peoples of Latin America and the peoples of Asia and Africa, and setting the Jewish people against the Arab people forever. I think that this attitude amounts to a crime against both the Jewish people and the Arab people.” In his view, Jews should support the Arab struggle for liberation rather than a struggle that supersedes nationalism, although both groups have “the same future and would live together in a single homeland under the rule of a single state, a state liberated from all foreign influence and all social exploitation.”\n\nThe same approach was displayed by Adiv. Accepting that “all trends of Matzpen” had “a sound theory”, he argued that they lacked “the chapter entitled ‘what is to be done’ to reach the multi-national socialist Middle East they talk of, and in their political activity they restrict their talk to the Jewish state of Israel. That is to say they are preoccupied with convincing the Jews, and completely disregard the Arab struggle, and in particular the Palestinian Arab struggle against Zionism and the state of Israel.” A change of focus was needed to convert the national conflict into a class struggle. This could be done only “if the Jews will prove to the Arabs, who have been fighting Zionism for dozens of years, that they [the Jews] are on their side, that they are prepared to sacrifice everything they have, to be subjected to the same ‘treatment’ and to share everything with them. Without this no Arab will have confidence that the sincerest Jewish revolutionary is really revolutionary. No ideology, not even the most equitable and progressive, can convince the Arabs unless it is accompanied by action on the part of those who adhere to it.”\n\nWith the rise of new, vibrant and less ideologically rigid protest movements in the 1980s, in opposition to the continued occupation and to the war in Lebanon (Committee for Solidarity with Birzeit University, committees against torture and house demolitions, Yesh Gvul, Alternative Information Center, Workers Advice Center, and so on), the different factions of Matzpen lost much of their raison d'etre. The space for overall left-wing organizations, with comprehensive political agendas, shrank with the growing focus on the occupation and its consequences. Many activists sought new organizational forms in order to enhance their ability to make an effective contribution to the political struggle, without carrying cumbersome ideological and organizational baggage. Much of the energy of the Revolutionary Communist League, for example, went into creating and maintaining the Alternative Information Center, which effectively depleted the League of its own organizational capacity. As a result, most of the Matzpen factions ceased to have a distinct organizational existence by the late 1980s, if not before that. Many of their former members though, continue to participate as dedicated individuals in various activities against the occupation and for workers and human rights.\n\nA documentary about the group, entitled \"Matzpen\", was made by Eran Torbiner in 2003. Another documentary about Avangard was produced in 2009 by Tom Carmi (son of two former leaders of the group) and presented at the Tel Aviv Docaviv festival. It is titled \"Away from the Tribe's Centre\", and was awarded second prize in the students' films competition. In these documentaries as well as most other books by and interviews with members who ended-up in different factions, the doctrinal differences that led to their divergent paths disappear from view. The focus almost invariably is on activities against the occupation, anti-Zionist positions, the sense of dissent, and so on, which they all shared, rather than on what had set them apart.\n\nDespite the absence of organizational activity, some of the original Matzpen members continue to write and be active politically. Haim Hanegbi and Michel Warschawski played a key role in writing the 2004 Olga Document, which is a statement of the anti-Zionist position and a radical critique of Israeli policies and practices, and Warschawski published his political memoir in English, \"On the Border\" (South End Press, 2004; original French in 2002). He further published, together with Lebanese academic and activist Gilbert Achcar, a book titled \"The 33-Day War: Israel's War on Hezbollah in Lebanon and Its Consequences\" (Paradigm Publishers, 2007), in which the war is covered with a focus on both Israeli and Lebanese perspectives. Sylvain Cypel wrote a historical and political analysis of Israeli society under the title \"Walled: Israeli Society at an Impasse\" (Other Press, 2007; original French in 2006). Moshe Machover has continued to publish theoretical papers analyzing Israel/Palestine within the broader Middle Eastern framework, and in 2009, together with Ehud Ein-Gil, he published an article in the UK journal \"Race & Class\", titled \"Zionism and Oriental Jews: a dialectic of exploitation and co-optation\", in which they analyze the question of ethnic divisions within Israel society.\n\nA new book on Matzpen was published in Israel in September 2010, under the title \"Matzpen: Conscience and Fantasy\" (Tel Aviv: Resling, 2010). It is the most comprehensive account to date of the organization's history, based on interviews with former activists and a study of documents.\n\n"}
{"id": "34194673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34194673", "title": "Metaxism", "text": "Metaxism\n\nMetaxism () is a totalitarian nationalist ideology associated with Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas. It called for the regeneration of the Greek nation and the establishment of a modern, culturally homogenous Greece. Metaxism disparaged liberalism, and held individual interests to be subordinate to those of the nation, seeking to mobilize the Greek people as a disciplined mass in service to the creation of a \"new Greece.\"\n\nMetaxas declared that his 4th of August Regime (1936–1941) represented a \"Third Greek Civilization\" which was committed to the creation of a culturally purified Greek nation based upon the militarist societies of ancient Macedonia and Sparta, which he held to constitute the \"First Greek Civilization\"; and the Orthodox Christian ethic of the Byzantine Empire, which he considered to represent the \"Second Greek Civilization.\" The Metaxas regime asserted that true Greeks were ethnically Greek and Christian, intending to deliberately exclude Albanians, Slavs, and Turks residing in Greece from Greek citizenship.\n\nAlthough the Metaxas government and its official doctrines are often described as Fascist, academically it is considered to have been a conventional totalitarian-conservative dictatorship akin to Francisco Franco's Spain or António de Oliveira Salazar's Portugal. The Metaxist government derived its authority from the conservative establishment and its doctrines strongly supported traditional institutions such as the Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek Monarchy; essentially reactionary, it lacked the radical theoretical dimensions of ideologies such as Italian Fascism and German Nazism.\n\nThe ideology of Metaxism was associated with Metaxas' political party, the Freethinkers' Party and the 4th of August Regime. In the post-war period it has been advocated by the 4th of August Party and the Golden Dawn party.\n\n\nThe ideology developed by Metaxas began with Metaxas' response to the revolution of 1922 that put in a pro-republican government in Greece. Metaxas formed the Freethinkers' Party, a monarchist party that originally supported the advancement of civil liberties, though this changed with Metaxas' evolving political views. Metaxas supported the failed counterrevolution by monarchists against the republican-oriented government on October 23, 1923 that collapsed within a week, an arrest warrant was issued for Metaxas who fled Greece to exile in Norway. The pro-republican government achieved its aim in 1924 when the Greek monarchy was deposed and a Greek republic was established. In 1924, Metaxas officially changed his position from opposition to the republic to acceptance of its institutions.\n\nIn the 1926 general election, Metaxas' Freethinkers' Party won 54 out of 250 seats in the Greek parliament, resulting in the party becoming part of Greece's coalition government and Metaxas becoming Minister of Communications. However the Freethinkers' Party collapsed in public support in the 1928 election, losing almost all of its seats, including Metaxas' own seat.\n\nBy the 1930s, Metaxas openly condemned the parliamentary system in Greece. In 1935, Metaxas' party joined other monarchist parties in an electoral coalition known as the United Royalists that called for the restoration of the monarchy, however the Freethinkers' Party won only seven seats in the election. However, a monarchist government was formed in Greece in 1935 resulting in the restoration of King George II of Greece as head of state.\n\nKing George II had held close relations with Metaxas in the past and appointed Metaxas as Prime Minister of Greece in May 1936. Upon becoming Prime Minister, Metaxas made clear his discontent with the political deadlock between feuding political blocs in Greece's parliament and the rising labour unrest being exploited by the Communist Party of Greece. Metaxas quickly sought to crush dissent including labour unrest in the form of decrees that did not require acceptance by the Greek parliament.\n\nOn August 4, 1936, Metaxas gained the King's support for a decree that dissolved parliament. He declared martial law, suspended civil rights such as liberty of the subject, and mobilized transport and public workers to support him. Metaxas justified these actions as necessary to prevent communist revolution. Numerous arrests were made of leftist leaders and others following these proclamations. Metaxas abolished all political parties including his own, ruling as an official independent. This date is considered the beginning of Metaxas' totalitarian rule known as the 4th of August Regime.\n\nMetaxas was referred to by supporters as the \"Archigos\" (Leader) and promised to create a \"New State\" in Greece that called for Greeks to wholly commit themselves to the nation with self-control as the Spartans had done. Supporters of the 4th of August Regime justified Metaxas' dictatorship on the basis that the \"First Greek Civilization\" involved the Athenian dictatorship of Pericles who had brought ancient Greece to greatness.\n\nMetaxas introduced widespread strict censorship of the press and banned literature of authors considered taboo by the regime, including literature by Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Immanuel Kant.\n\nMetaxas sought the creation of a disciplined younger generation as being critical for the future of Greece and for the strengthening of his regime and its principles that world entrench the Third Greek Civilization. In October 1936 the regime created the National Youth Organization of Greece (EON) that gained 200,000 members by 1938 and by 1939 when youth membership in the EON became mandatory, it absorbed the Boy Scouts of Greece. Members of the EON took an oath of fidelity to the principles of the 4th of August that included: embracing the institutions of the monarchy; support of national pride and faith of the Greek civilization; opposition to parliamentarianism and communism; support of the development of egalitarian, non-individualistic, virtuous citizens.\n\nIn spite of the Metaxas regime's ties to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany it was drawn into World War II opposite the Axis Powers after the Italian invasion of Greece, Metaxas then aligned his government with the allies until Greece capitulated and yielded to occupation by the Axis powers following the Battle of Greece. Metaxas died on 29 January 1941, leaving an unfinished plan (never published), concerning a \"new constitution\" for Greece aiming to a new form of government without the disadvantages of the old parliamentary system.\n\nIn religious affairs, the regime followed the tradition of the state controlling and using the religious and ecclesiastic institutions. The regime was tolerant towards the religious minorities (mainly Jews and Muslims). It was not antisemitic and prohibited antisemitic publications by certain newspapers.\n\nThe social control which was established by Metaxas and the ideas passed to the youth, especially through the National Youth Organisation, had a significant influence on the Greek society and the post-war political system. Some examples are the censorship, which was in use until the Metapolitefsi, and the surviving elements of a police state. In the immediate post-war era Metaxism was advocated by the 4th of August Party. The ideas of the 4th of August Regime was also an extra motive for the group of right-wing army officers who seized power in a coup d'état and led to the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. Today the only party of the Greek parliament which claims to follow the ideas of Metaxas is the right-wing extremist Golden Dawn.\n\n"}
{"id": "57103198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57103198", "title": "Minimum wage in South Korea", "text": "Minimum wage in South Korea\n\nThe South Korean government enacted the Minimum Wage Act on December 31, 1986. The Minimum Wage System began on January 1, 1988. At this time the economy was booming, and the minimum wage set by the government was less than 30 percent of that of real workers. The Minister of Employment and Labor in Korea requests the Minimum Wage Commission to review the minimum wage by March 31 every year. The Minimum Wage Commission must submit the minimum wage bill within 90 days after the request has been received by the 27 committee members. If there is no objection, the new minimum wage will then take effect from January 1. The minimum wage committee decided to raise the minimum wage in 2018 by 16.4% from the previous year to 7,530 won(US$7.03) per hour. This is the largest increase since 2001 when it was increased by 16.8%.\n\nArticle 32 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea: Every citizen has the right to work. The country should make efforts to enhance the employment of its workers and ensure proper wages in social and economic ways, and implement the minimum wage system as provided under the law.\n\nSouth Korea has guaranteed its workers the minimum wage through 'the Minimum Wage Act'.\n\nArticle 1 of the Minimum Wage Act(Objective): This act aims to ensure the minimum level of wages for workers so as to contribute to the sound development of the national economy by promiting the stabilization of their livelihood and the qualitative improvement of their workforce.\n\nThe minimum wage in the Republic of Korea is determined by the Minimum Wage Commission under the Ministry of Employment and Labor. The Minimum Wage Commission consists of 27 employees, 9 of which are employee commissioners, user committee members and public interest committee members. The Minimum Wage Commission reviews and decides the minimum wage level each year, deliberates and reviews the minimum wage, deliberates on the classification of the minimum wage application, and studies and suggests for the development of the minimum wage system. Other important matters concerning the minimum wage are the functions of the Minister of Employment and Labor to review matters to be held at the meeting. \n\nThe purpose of the Minimum Wage Commission is to contribute to the sound development of the national economy by ensuring the lowest level of wages for workers and thereby improving the quality of workers.\n\nThe Minister of Employment and Labor in Korea requests the Minimum Wage Commission to review the minimum wage by March 31 of each year. The Minimum Wage Commission shall submit the minimum wage bill within 90 days (June 29) of the day after the request has been received by the 27 committee members. When the minister of employment and labor receives the minimum wage bill, it shall notify it. At this time, the person representing the employee and the person representing the employer may file a complaint with the Minister of Employment and Labor within 10 days from the date of notification. If there is no objection, the minimum wage will be notified and the minimum wage will be determined by August 5 every year. The new minimum wage will take effect from January 1. \n\nThe South Korean government enacted the Minimum Wage Act on December, 31, 1986, and implemented the Minimum Wage System starting from January 1, 1988. However, in 1988, when the economy was booming, the minimum wage set by the government was less than 30 percent of that of real workers. The minimum annual wages announced by the Ministry of Employment and Labor are as follows, and include the main holiday allowance paid by working more than 15 hours a week(Article 55 of the Labor Standards Act).\n\nUser should not lower their existing wage levels because of the minimum wage under the Labor Standards Act. The Minimum Wage Law provides the following for penalties for minimum wage violations.\n\nArticle 28 (penalty) \n\n① A person who pays less than the minimum wage in violation of Article 6, paragraph 1 or 2, or who has lowered the previous wage for a minimum wage is sentenced to less than three years in prison or 20 million won. In this case, prison terms and fines may be serious (Article 28 of the Minimum Wage Act), as a result, for those who pay the minimum wage, as well as for those who are paid less than that.\n\nArticle 30 (billionable regualtion) \n\n①If a representative of a corporation, an agent, a user, or any other employee commits a breach of Article 28 in respect of its business, he or she shall punish the person. \n\n②The contractor shall carry out the joint responsibility in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 7. Even though the superintendent ordered him to carry out the joint responsibility, the contractor shall carry it out within the time limit of 6.\n\nA case of minimum wage violations can be consulted at the Civil Affairs Center of the Ministry of Employment and Labor(1350). However, only counseling, and not reporting, is possible in 1350. If an employees wants to receive a report, they can report it on 'Civil Service 24' website that integrates and provides government services, complaints, policies and information. If the employee wishes to receive a petition for the relief of their rights due to the understudy of minimum wage, they may visit the local employment office of the plant or file a petition via the Internet.\n\nIn 2016, the Ministry of Employment and Labor presided over a total of 1,278 minimum wage violation cases. However, only 17 cases led to actual judicial proceeding, meaning less than 2 percent of cases received legal proceeding. About 98 percent of the cases were demarcated for 'corrective action'. Employers who violated the minimum wage law have been able to avoid charges or legal proceedings by taking corrective action. As a result of the lack of legal enforcement, according to the Bank of Korea's analysis report on the latest minimum wage trend and evaluation in 2016, the number of workers receiving less than the minimum wage continues to soar.\n\nSince the Minimum Wage Act was enacted in 1986, the minimum wage has been steadily rising. However, there are endless discussions over minimum wage laws and minimum wage increases. \n\nThe following table summarizes the pros and cons of minimum wage.\nLast year, the minimum wage committee decided to raise the minimum wage in 2018 by 16.4% from the previous year to 7,530 won. This is the largest increase (1060 won) in the past and the maximum increase in 16 years since 2001 (16.8 percent). \n\nThe effectiveness and feasibility of minimum wage increases are greatly debated topics. Both conservative newspapers and liberal pundits across South Korea were quick to denounce the new minimum wage measures. The Chosun Ilbo reported on the day after the 2018 minimum wage increase was announced that SMEs and small business owners were opposed to raising the minimum wage. They said, \"The minimum wage increase is a measure that does not take into account the imminent reality of small and medium sized companies suffering from sluggish sales.\" The Dong-A Ilbo also criticized the government's minimum wage increase on the same day, reporting on the criticism of the 'Small Business Federation' and 'Korea Employers Federation'. The JoongAng Ilbo reported on the support measures for small businesses and small businesses, which amount to 4 trillion won, and criticized it as \"unpopular populism all over the world.\" In addition, the Dong-A Ilbo reported on companies that decided to move the factory overseas with a minimum wage increase. Ju Jin-hyung, who has served as general affairs policy committee chairman of the Democratic Party, pointed out through a Facebook post that the promise of the \"minimum wage 10,000 won\" promise and ambiguity, and lack of standard and impression standards.\n\nMany scholars, however, welcome and endorse the minimum wage increase. Jeong Tae-in, an economist and chief of the Karl Polanyi Center for Socio-Economic Studies, wrote a column in the progressive journalist Kyunghyang Shinmun. He argued in the column that the minimum wage increase does not affect employment: first, college students and young people who work part-time will reduce labor hours if the minimum wage goes up. Second, if the self-employed are concerned about the minimum wage increase, it is likely that it is due to the pressures of a franchise headquarters. Third, he argues reducing business hours to 8 hours a day would not reduce the sales of consumer goods by one-third, as some insist. If the minimum wage increase is the policy priority, shortening the operating hours will be a policy to compensate. Convenience stores, franchisees, and manufacturing subcontractors, in short, the government only have to assure the right to organize 'Eul(을)'.\n\nKim Chang-hwan, a professor of sociology at the University of Kansas, USA, also objected to Ju Jin-hyung's argument. In his blog, he wrote, \"The effect of the minimum hourly rate on the labor market is not established academically. The theory of economics suggests that if the minimum hourly rate is increased, the employment rate decreases. But the reality is that the minimum rate is cleaner than the theory.\" He also pointed out that there is a disagreement about whether it is bad for employment to decline by raising the minimum wage, and that high wages have the effect of promoting structural reforms and forcing productivity improvements. He said, \"If businesses and self-employed people who can not afford the minimum wage are closed, the capital is absorbed into capital that can give more than the minimum wage, rather than being publicly decomposed.\" \"In this case, the productivity of the economy as a whole is improved and structural upgrading is forced.\" Professor Kim also pointed out that the conservative press, which is promoting the 'minimization of employment by the minimum wage', is using the 'minimum wage increase' as a means of ideological struggle even though the new minimum wage is not applied yet. And he criticized Ju Jin-hyung, \"If the minimum wage increase was a big problem, you should criticize the increase by 9% over 1989 and 12 times over 30 years. Until now, you have been quiet, but once the minimum wage raised the 16%, you can not criticize the minimum wage increase policy. If the Korean economy was ruined because the minimum wage was high, it would have been ruined.\"\n"}

Modified starches are used in practically all starch applications, such as in food products as a thickening agent, stabilizer or emulsifier; in pharmaceuticals as a disintegrant; or as binder in coated paper. They are also used in many other applications.\n\nStarches are modified to enhance their performance in different applications. Starches may be modified to increase their stability against excessive heat, acid, shear, time, cooling, or freezing; to change their texture; to decrease or increase their viscosity; to lengthen or shorten gelatinization time; or to increase their visco-stability.\n\nAcid-treated starch (INS 1401), also called thin boiling starch, is prepared by treating starch or starch granules with inorganic acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid breaking down the starch molecule and thus reducing the viscosity.\n\nOther treatments producing modified starch (with different INS and E-numbers) are:\nand combined modifications such as \n\nModified starch may also be a cold-water-soluble, pregelatinized or instant starch which thickens and gels without heat, or a cook-up starch which must be cooked like regular starch. Drying methods to make starches cold-water-soluble are extrusion, drum drying, spray drying or dextrinization.\n\nOther starch derivatives, the starch sugars, like glucose, high fructose syrup, glucose syrups, maltodextrins, starch degraded with amylase enzyme are mainly sold as liquid syrup to make a sweetener.\n\nPre-gelatinized starch is used to thicken instant desserts, allowing the food to thicken with the addition of cold water or milk. Similarly, cheese sauce granules (such as in Macaroni and Cheese or lasagna) or gravy granules may be thickened with boiling water without the product going lumpy. Commercial pizza toppings containing modified starch will thicken when heated in the oven, keeping them on top of the pizza, and then become runny when cooled.\n\nA suitably modified starch is used as a fat substitute for low-fat versions of traditionally fatty foods, e.g. industrial milk-based desserts like yogurt or reduced-fat hard salami having about 1/3 the usual fat content. For the latter type of uses, it is an alternative to the product Olestra.\n\nModified starch is added to frozen products to prevent them from dripping when defrosted. Modified starch, bonded with phosphate, allows the starch to absorb more water and keeps the ingredients together. Modified starch acts as an emulsifier for French dressing by enveloping oil droplets and suspending them in the water. Acid-treated starch forms the shell of jelly beans. Oxidized starch increases the stickiness of batter.\n\nCarboxymethylated starches are used as a wallpaper adhesive, as textile printing thickener, as tablet disintegrants and excipients in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nCationic starch is used as wet end sizing agent in paper manufacturing.\n\nModified starch should not be confused with genetically modified starch, which refers to starch from genetically engineered plants, such as those that have been genetically modified to produce novel fatty acids or carbohydrates which might not occur in the plant species being harvested. In the United States the term can also refer to foods that have been created by traditional cross-breeding rather than gene splicing. In Europe the term \"Genetically Modified Organism\" is used solely where \"the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally through fertilisation and/or natural recombination\". The modification in \"genetically modified\" refers to the genetic engineering of the plant DNA, whereas in the term \"Modified Starch\" seen on mandatory ingredient labels it refers to the later processing or treatment of the starch or starch granules.\n\nGenetically modified starch is of interest in the manufacture of biodegradable polymers and noncellulose feedstock in the paper industry, as well as the creation of new food additives. For example, researchers aim to alter the enzymes within living plants to create starches with desirable modified properties, and thus eliminate the need for enzymatic processing after starch is extracted from the plant.\n\n\n"}

The appellative also refers to the product of either of those initiatives.\n\nThe provision in the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines allowing for a \"people's initiative\" as one of the modes for constitutional amendment has been called the \"people's initiative clause.\" The other modes allowed by the Constitution involve a Constituent Assembly (or \"Con-Ass\") or a Constitutional Convention (or \"Con-Con\"), both of which also allow a total revision of the charter.\n\nThe appellation (also known as \"PI\") also refers to the act—allowed by the law-given right of the Filipino people—of directly initiating statutes or calling for referenda on both the national and the local government level.\n\nThe process of amending the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines is popularly known to many Filipinos as Charter Change.

The initiative, a multisectoral alliance-driven proposition to criminalize pork barrel fund creation and spending, was led by various groups and individuals including Cebu Archbishop Jose S. Palma, the broad #AbolishPorkMovement, the Catholic Church-backed Cebu Coalition Against the Pork Barrel System, the Church People's Alliance Against Pork Barrel, ePIRMA (Empowered People's Initiative and Reform Movement Alliance), the Makabayan Coalition (principally through Bayan Muna party-list representative Neri Colmenares), the Solidarity for Transformation, Youth Act Now, the Scrap Pork Network, and former Philippine Supreme Court Chief Justice Reynato Puno. The Cebu congress was immediately followed by a signature rally at Luneta Park, on August 25, 2014.\n\nThe proposition was one of civil society's resulting reactions to the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam of 2013 and the Million People March and other protests that followed. An exploratory \"people's congress\" to draft an initiative on spending public funds was first convened by the ePIRMA at the Asian Institute of Management Conference Center on November 9, 2013, with Puno, Colmenares and ePIRMA's legal-team head Jose M. Roy III leading the conference that was attended by representatives from various groups coming from all over the country. ePIRMA and the \"people's congress\" alliance later scheduled its first draft to be completed by January 2014 while it was awaiting the Supreme Court's decision on prior petitions against both the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and the \"presidential pork\" disbursements under Benigno Aquino III's government's Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP).\n\nPetitions against the PDAF were first filed with the Supreme Court by the Social Justice Society on August 28, 2013, by Greco Belgica et al. on September 3, 2013, and by Pedrito Nepomuceno on September 5, 2013.

The petitioners included the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, GABRIELA Women's Party, Bayan Muna, Ang Kapatiran, and Belgica, among others. On November 19, 2013, the Supreme Court declared the PDAF unconstitutional; a decision on the DAP came out seven and a half months later, on July 1, 2014, also declaring basic parts of the program as unconstitutional.\n\nUnder the PIAP's proposed Pork Barrel Abolition Act, all budgets submitted to any legislative body shall contain only itemized appropriations, except funds for relief and rescue operations during calamities and funds for intelligence work and security. The proposed legislation also called for the abolition of the Presidential Social Fund, which has also been described as a form of pork barrel. Violators of this law were to be banned for life from holding public office.\n\nOn November 25, 2014, the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer \"reported that the Philippine Commission on Elections received the first 10,000 signatures from the initiative thrust in Quezon City. The signatures were from the city's first six districts, a first installment of the required 177,000 signatures from the entire city territory. Meanwhile, PIAP-Metro Manila coordinator Mark Lui Aquino said they had yet to submit to the Comelec the 50,000 to 100,000 signatures they had gathered in the metropolis. PIAP-Quezon City spokesperson Malou Turalde said, however, that Quezon City was not the first to submit to the Comelec gathered signatures for the initiative, adding that other legislative districts \"just want to be quiet.\" Aquino also expressed fear that the \"Comelec seems unready\" and added that, based on his group's monitoring, the Comelec offices in the different cities and municipalities \"do not know what to do with the signatures.\"\n\nOn September 4, 2014, Rep. Neri Colmenares announced that the ruling Liberal Party was trying to undermine the people's initiative against the pork barrel system. During his interpellation on the same day, at the Philippine Congress budget committee hearing on the 2015 budget for the Philippine Commission on Elections, Colmenares noticed that the Malacañang Palace and its allies in Congress took out the budget that they had placed for a charter change (Cha-Cha) referendum they were planning to launch. Colmenares asked for the budget to be reinserted for the people's initiative plebiscite, but budget committee vice-chair Dakila Cua (Liberal Party, formerly Lakas Kampi CMD) said that Colmenares's motion should be made during the committee deliberations on the budget. A number of Liberal Party leaders and spokesmen earlier announced their wish to amend the Constitution to allow President Benigno Aquino III to run for re-election; as under the present Constitution the President cannot run again for the same office after his single six-year term.\n\nFurthermore, groups against the pork barrel noted that the Aquino government had drafted a national budget for 2015 that still contained \"pork\" in the form of \"special purpose funds,\" thus ignoring the earlier SC ruling on such funds' unconstitutionality as well as salient points in the PIAP. The groups further noted that this pork budget allocation had ballooned to 27 billion pesos, from the previous year's PHP25 billion pesos.The groups urged Congress to junk the budget. On November 25, during the Senate plenary session tackling the said budget, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago raised the same points raised by the Makabayan group in the House of Representatives hearings, boosting the Makabayan position on the budget bill amendments.\n\nIn January 2015, Palma reiterated the importance of the initiative, saying that although the Supreme Court had already declared the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) as unconstitutional funds, members of Congress continued to enjoy discretionary funds under other forms.\n\nOn September 29, 2014, minutes after the anti-pork forum in Tagum City, Davao del Norte, which also launched the PIAP in the province, Dexter Ian Selebrado, 32, of the group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas - Davao del Norte (Farmers' Movement of the Philippines - Davao del Norte) and one of the local campaigners against pork barrel funds, was attacked by motorcycle-riding gunmen. As of October 1, the farmer-activist was still in critical condition.\n\nIn his January 2015 conference with the press, Palma lamented the intervention of politicians in the turnout of citizens at the signature centers in his parishes. Apart from a lack of knowledge about the pork barrel, Palma claimed that a low turnout was also a result of there being families who had children enrolled in schools under politicians' pork-funded scholarships whose relatives then refused to sign the proposition. Turnout results in other dioceses were also not good, he said. He promised, however, that the Church would not be disheartened and cited the strong support of people in such dioceses as Calbayog City.\n\nIn his blog of July 4, 2016, direct democracy advocate Jojo Soria de Veyra, a member of ePIRMA, confessed that after the initiative's launch \"the signature gathering was mostly left to certain parishes of the more organized Catholic Church, the primary backing of the Cebu Coalition. Sporadic rallies of support were organized by the Makabayan group and provincial groups. Other members of ePIRMA were seen to have moved on to various other national concerns. Manny SD Lopez—ePIRMA's leading convenor and most active campaigner on the road—would also busy himself with organizing the Christian Peace Alliance, one of the groups advocating for a drastic review of some provisions of the then-in-its-final-thrust Bangsamoro Basic Law. Lopez would also form the EdlSA 2.22.15 Coalition, a group that called for President Benigno Aquino III's resignation after the Mamasapano mishap. I submit that in this latter period I was not privy anymore to how the signature-gathering for the initiative on the pork barrel was progressing. I did hear of some pockets of resistance to the initiative, as well as the Comelec's seeming lack of enthusiasm towards verifying the signatures, but that's about it. . . . Then came the various noises leading to the 2016 general election, within which news concerning the initiative's progress were nowhere anymore to be found on Google.\" De Veyra, also a convenor of a Facebook group called Forum for Direct Democracy, then proceeded in his blog to propose amendments to the Initiative and Referendum Act that would make the law easier for the people to use as well as obligate Comelec to do its part in the initiative process within a limited time period.\n\nMeanwhile, on August 31, Senator Panfilo Lacson told the media that \"the ₱3.35-trillion proposed budget presented by Malacañang [under the newly-elected Duterte administration] to the Senate for congressional approval is laden with 'pork' and violated the Supreme Court rulings on the Priority Development Assistance Fund and Disbursement Acceleration Program.\"\n\n\n"}

Since then, it has come to signify specifically the private sector's participation in the losses taken in cases of sovereign debt write downs.\n\nThe private sector involvements covers measures such as the rescheduling, reprofiling, and restructuring of the state-debt holdings of private creditors, in the context of the resolution of a sovereign debt crisis. According to the International Monetary Fund, the measures of the private sector involvement process are appropriate in order to \"have the burden of crisis resolution shared equitably with the [state] sector,\" as well as to \"strengthen market discipline.\"\nECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi has warned in 2011 that the enforcement of private sector involvement in resolving a financial crisis inside the Eurozone would incur \"a series of problems\": The taxpayers of the creditor countries would suffer in any case; patient investors, who have stuck to their investment, would be punished; the measure would destabilize the financial markets of the Eurozone by creating incentives for short-term speculative behavior; and it would delay the return of the debtor nation to the markets since market participants would be unwilling to start reinvesting in the country for a long period. This, Smaghi stated, would oblige the state sector to eventually increase its financial contribution.\n\nAlthough the term used to denote any kind of private-sector participation into an existing government program, such as, for example, family planning, or health care, it has come to signify the private sector's participation in the losses taken in cases of sovereign debt write downs, and, more specifically, \"any kind of...contributions of the private sector in the context of sovereign financial distress.\"\n\nIn the view of the International Monetary Fund, private sector involvement \"in the resolution of financial crises is appropriate in order to have the burden of crisis resolution shared equitably with the official sector, strengthen market discipline, and, in the process, increase the efficiency of international capital markets and the ability of emerging market borrowers to protect themselves against volatility and contagion.\" The Fund claims that \"a broad consensus has emerged among IMF member countries on the need to seek PSI in the resolution of crises.\" According to William R. Cline, “'PSI' has been the 1990s equivalent of 'bailing in the banks' in the 1980s.\"\n\nThe most prominent case of PSI occurred in the process of the sovereign-debt restructuring of Greece, after a significant haircut of it was agreed, in early 2012. The so-called \"world's biggest debt-restructuring deal in history\" affecting some €206bn of bonds, occurred in February 2012, when the Eurogroup finalized a second bailout package for Greece. \n\nEU member-states agreed to a new €100 billion loan and a retroactive lowering of the bailout interest rates, while the International Monetary Fund would provide \"a significant contribution\" to that loan. Part of that deal was the agreement for private-sector involvement (PSI), whereby private investors were asked to accept to write off 53.5% of the face value of the Greek governmental bonds they're holding, the equivalent to an overall loss of around 75%.\n\nIf not enough private-sector bondholders were to agree to participate in the bond swap per the PSI requirement, the Greek government threatened to retroactively introduce a collective action clause to enforce participation. Eventually, private-sector involvement reached 83,5% of Greek bond holders. The Bank of Greece, in its 2011/12 report, commented that \"the successful completion of the PSI, creates a new operating framework for the Greek economy in the years ahead.\"\n\nCertain official measures executed during Greece's state debt restructuring process and the subsequent private sector involvement were not covered by existing ISDA provisions for CDS contracts, as the International Monetary Fund conceded. \n\nTherefore, according to the IMF, the typically expected credit event was not officially triggered, the negative contingencies to private holders of state debt were increased, while the credibility of the sovereign-CDS market was undermined. The measures undertaken included the \"persuasion\" of certain Greek debt-holders to accept large haircuts under a supposedly “voluntary PSI\" agreement. Accordingly, Greece achieved a \"very high creditor participation\" of 97 percent of debt held, despite the restructuring being preemptive and, as assessed by the IMF, having a \"very large\" target of a 70 percent haircut of the bonds' face value.\n"}

This first wave of SCALPs, developing alongside the alternative rock movement, disbanded in the early 1980s. An attempt to unite the different groups under a proposed National Anti-Fascist Representative Committee (\"Coordination nationale antifasciste,\" CNAF) never took off, the Paris section of SCALP splintering in 1990.\n\nAfter one or two years of dormancy, elements of the original Paris SCALP who had been running the magazine \"REFLEXes\" (so named because most contributors were former students of Paris X University) revived SCALP, using the acronym and the mythos surrounding it to attract the interest of young recruits. At the same time, the new SCALP distanced itself from the autonomist movement (elements of the original SCALP loyal to this movement dedicated themselves to other organizations and projects such as Karoshi and the CNT-AIT), opting to align itself more closely with traditional libertarian groups. Some members later left to join the National Confederation of Labour.\n\nIn 1992, the new SCALP organized itself into a national network called No Pasaran Network - a federation of the different local SCALP groups. The Paris group became known as SCALP-REFLEX (\"Réseau d'études sur le fascisme et de lutte contre l'extrême droite et la xénophobie\" - Network for the study of fascism and the fight against the far right and xenophobia). The radical measures taken by the network during their actions resulted in damage to premises and public property.\n\nIn 2004, more individuals quit the group, later going on to found the Libertarian and Social Offensive (\"Offensive libertaire et sociale,\" OLS).\n\nIn 2006 SCALP-REFLEX participated in demonstrations and university \"assemblées générales\". They were involved in the occupation of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (\"École des hautes études en sciences sociales\", EHESS). Activists from the group clashed with those of the far right at a rally outside the Sorbonne on March 14, 2006.\n\nOn May 9, 2007 the group, along with other libertarian and student organisations (Alternative Libertaire, Union syndicale Solidaires, CNT), called for a counter-demonstration to be held to physically oppose a demonstration by the far right and to \"show them they don't own the street.\" Fearing a police crackdown, the organisers - with the exception of SCALP - called for the counter-demonstration to be canceled. Several activists who attended the rally were arrested.\n\nIf current estimates of the group's strength as between 400 and 500 members are correct, more than 6000 people may have passed through its ranks since its founding.\n\nPornographic actress Ovidie is a former member of SCALP.\n\n\"No Pasaran\", the monthly publication of the network, is circulated in libraries and sectional offices. Numerous pamphlets on the far right have also been authored by the group.\n\nIn 2005 SCALP published \"Comme un indien Métropolitain\" (Like a French Indian), which deals with the history of the movement between 1984 and 1992.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31199225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31199225", "title": "Shadow government (conspiracy)", "text": "Shadow government (conspiracy)\n\nThe shadow government (cryptocracy, secret government, or invisible government) is a family of conspiracy theories based on the notion that real and actual political power resides not with publicly elected representatives but with private individuals who are exercising power behind the scenes, beyond the scrutiny of democratic institutions. According to this belief, the official elected government is subservient to the shadow government which is the true executive power.\n\nSome of the groups proposed by these theories as constituting the shadow government include central banks; Freemasons, intelligence agencies; think tanks; organized Jewry; the Vatican; secret societies; Jesuits; moneyed interests; globalist elites and supranational organizations who seek to manipulate policy in their own interest or in order to serve a larger agenda that is hidden from the general public.\n\nLiterature on the subject postulates the existence of a secret government which is the true power behind the apparent government. Examples of such literature include works by Dan Smoot, William Guy Carr, Jim Marrs, Carroll Quigley, Gary Allen, Alex Jones, Des Griffin, G. Edward Griffin, David Icke, and Michael A. Hoffman II. Some of these authors believe members of the secret government may represent or be agents for groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, CIA and MI6 in co-operation with international banks and financial institutions such as the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements. Also popularizing the idea was the hit US television show, \"The X-Files\".\n\nMilton William Cooper claimed that the shadow government was in cooperation with extraterrestrial aliens. His 1991 book \"Behold A Pale Horse\", influential among \"UFO and militia circles\", describes \"the doings of the secret world government\" and \"a variety of other covert activities associated with the Illuminati's declaration of war upon the people of America\". Cooper claimed to have seen secret documents while in the Navy describing governmental dealings with aliens. Cooper linked the Illuminati with his beliefs that extraterrestrials were secretly involved with the US government, but later retracted these claims. He accused Dwight D. Eisenhower of negotiating a treaty with extraterrestrials in 1954, then establishing an inner circle of Illuminati to manage relations with them and keep their presence a secret from the general public. Cooper believed that aliens \"manipulated and/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and the occult\", and that even the Illuminati were unknowingly being manipulated by them.\n\nCooper described the Illuminati as a secret international organization, controlled by the Bilderberg Group, that conspired with the Knights of Columbus, Masons, Skull and Bones, and other organizations. Its ultimate goal, he said, was the establishment of a New World Order. According to Cooper the Illuminati conspirators not only invented alien threats for their own gain, but actively conspired with extraterrestrials to take over the world. Cooper believed that James Forrestal's fatal fall from a window on the sixteenth floor of Bethesda Hospital was connected to the alleged secret committee Majestic-12, and that JASON advisory group scientists reported to an elite group of Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations executive committee members who were high-ranking members of the Illuminati.\n\n\"The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation.\"—John Hylan, Mayor of New York City, 1922\"Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.\"—From the Platform of President Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive (\"Bull Moose\") Party.\"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.\"—Edward Bernays, the \"father of public relations\", writing in his influential 1928 book \"Propaganda\". “But quite frankly there is an outside source which we refer to as the 'deep state' or the 'shadow government'. There is a lot of influence by people which are actually more powerful than our government itself, our president,”. \"— Ron Paul, former U.S. Representative, November 2016 (following Donald Trump presidential election win).\n\n"}

{"id": "333341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333341", "title": "Stewart Brand", "text": "Stewart Brand\n\nStewart Brand (born December 14, 1938) is an American writer, best known as editor of the \"Whole Earth Catalog\". He founded a number of organizations, including The WELL, the Global Business Network, and the Long Now Foundation. He is the author of several books, most recently \"Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto\".\n\nBrand attended Phillips Exeter Academy. He studied biology at Stanford University, graduating in 1960. In 1966, he married mathematician Lois Jennings, an Ottawa Native American. As a soldier in the U.S. Army, he was a parachutist and taught infantry skills; he later expressed the view that his experience in the military had fostered his competence in organizing. A civilian again in 1962, he studied design at San Francisco Art Institute, photography at San Francisco State College, and participated in a legitimate scientific study of then-legal LSD, in Menlo Park, California.\n\nBrand has lived in California since the 1960s. He and his second wife live on \"Mirene\", a -long working tugboat. Built in 1912, the boat is moored in a former shipyard in Sausalito, California. He works in \"Mary Heartline\", a grounded fishing boat about 100 yards (90 metres) away. A favorite item of his is a table on which Otis Redding is said to have written \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\". (Brand acquired it from an antiques dealer in Sausalito.)\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Brand became associated with author Ken Kesey and the \"Merry Pranksters\". With his partner Ramón Sender Barayón, he produced the Trips Festival in San Francisco, an early effort involving rock music and light shows. This was one of the first venues at which the Grateful Dead performed in San Francisco. About 10,000 hippies attended, and Haight-Ashbury soon emerged as a community. Tom Wolfe describes Brand in the beginning of his 1968 book, \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\".\n\nIn 1966, Brand campaigned to have NASA release the then-rumored satellite image of the entire Earth as seen from space. He sold and distributed buttons for 25 cents each asking, \"Why haven't we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?\". During this campaign, Brand met Richard Buckminster Fuller, who offered to help Brand with his projects. In 1967, a satellite, ATS-3, took the photo. Brand thought the image of our planet would be a powerful symbol. It adorned the first (Fall 1968) edition of the \"Whole Earth Catalog\". Later in 1968, a NASA astronaut took an Earth photo, \"Earthrise\", from Moon orbit, which became the front image of the spring 1969 edition of the \"Catalog\". 1970 saw the first celebration of Earth Day. During a 2003 interview, Brand explained that the image \"gave the sense that Earth's an island, surrounded by a lot of inhospitable space. And it's so graphic, this little blue, white, green and brown jewel-like icon amongst a quite featureless black vacuum.\"\n\nIn late 1968, Brand assisted electrical engineer Douglas Engelbart with The Mother of All Demos, a famous presentation of many revolutionary computer technologies (including hypertext, email, and the mouse) to the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco.\n\nBrand surmised that given the necessary consciousness, information, and tools, human beings could reshape the world they had made (and were making) for themselves into something environmentally and socially sustainable.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s about 10 million Americans were involved in living communally. In 1968, using the most basic approaches to typesetting and page-layout, Brand and his colleagues created issue number one of \"The Whole Earth Catalog\", employing the significant subtitle, \"access to tools\". Brand and his wife Lois travelled to communes in a 1963 Dodge truck known as the \"Whole Earth Truck Store\", which moved to a storefront in Menlo Park, California. That first oversize \"Catalog\", and its successors in the 1970s and later, reckoned a wide assortment of things could serve as useful \"tools\": books, maps, garden implements, specialized clothing, carpenters' and masons' tools, forestry gear, tents, welding equipment, professional journals, early synthesizers, and personal computers. Brand invited \"reviews\" (written in the form of a letter to a friend) of the best of these items from experts in specific fields. The information also described where these things could be located or purchased. The \"Catalog\"s publication coincided with the great wave of social and cultural experimentation, convention-breaking, and \"do it yourself\" attitude associated with the \"counterculture\".\n\nThe influence of these \"Whole Earth Catalog\"s on the rural back-to-the-land movement of the 1970s, and the communities movement within many cities, was widespread throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia. A 1972 edition sold 1.5 million copies, winning the first U.S. National Book Award in category Contemporary Affairs.\n\nTo continue this work and also to publish full-length articles on specific topics in the natural sciences and invention, in numerous areas of the arts and the social sciences, and on the contemporary scene in general, Brand founded the \"CoEvolution Quarterly\" (CQ) during 1974, aimed primarily at educated laypersons. Brand never better revealed his opinions and reason for hope than when he ran, in \"CoEvolution Quarterly\" #4, a transcription of technology historian Lewis Mumford's talk \"The Next Transformation of Man\", in which he stated that \"man has still within him sufficient resources to alter the direction of modern civilization, for we then need no longer regard man as the passive victim of his own irreversible technological development.\"\n\nThe content of \"CoEvolution Quarterly\" often included futurism or risqué topics. Besides giving space to unknown writers with something valuable to say, Brand presented articles by many respected authors and thinkers, including Lewis Mumford, Howard T. Odum, Witold Rybczynski, Karl Hess, Orville Schell, Ivan Illich, Wendell Berry, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gregory Bateson, Amory Lovins, Hazel Henderson, Gary Snyder, Lynn Margulis, Eric Drexler, Gerard K. O'Neill, Peter Calthorpe, Sim Van der Ryn, Paul Hawken, John Todd, Kevin Kelly, and Donella Meadows. During ensuing years, Brand authored and edited a number of books on topics as diverse as computer-based media, the life history of buildings, and ideas about space colonies.\n\nHe founded the \"Whole Earth Software Review,\" a supplement to the \"Whole Earth Software Catalog,\" in 1984. It merged with \"CoEvolution Quarterly\" to form the \"Whole Earth Review\" in 1985.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1979, Brand served as \"special adviser\" to the administration of California Governor Jerry Brown.\n\nIn 1985, Brand and Larry Brilliant founded The WELL (\"Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link\"), a prototypical, wide-ranging online community for intelligent, informed participants the world over. The WELL won the 1990 Best Online Publication Award from the Computer Press Association. Almost certainly the ideas behind the WELL were greatly inspired by Douglas Engelbart's work at SRI International; Brand was acknowledged by Engelbart in \"The Mother of All Demos\" in 1968 when the computer mouse and video conferencing were introduced.\n\nDuring 1986, Brand was a visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab. Soon after, he became a private-conference organizer for such corporations as Royal Dutch/Shell, Volvo, and AT&T Corporation. In 1988, he became a co‑founder of the Global Business Network, which explores global futures and business strategies informed by the sorts of values and information which Brand has always found vital. The GBN has become involved with the evolution and application of scenario thinking, planning, and complementary strategic tools. In other connections, Brand has been part of the board of the Santa Fe Institute (founded in 1984), an organization devoted to \"fostering a multidisciplinary scientific research community pursuing frontier science\". He has also continued to promote the preservation of tracts of wilderness.\n\nThe \"Whole Earth Catalog\" implied an ideal of human progress that depended on decentralized, personal, and liberating technological development—so‑called \"soft technology\". However, during 2005 he criticized aspects of the international environmental ideology he had helped to develop. He wrote an article called \"Environmental Heresies\" in the May 2005 issue of the MIT \"Technology Review\", in which he describes what he considers necessary changes to environmentalism. He suggested among other things that environmentalists embrace nuclear power and genetically modified organisms as technologies with more promise than risk.\n\nBrand later developed these ideas into a book and published the \"Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto\" in 2009. The book examines how urbanization, nuclear power, genetic engineering, geoengineering, and wildlife restoration can be used as powerful tools in humanity's ongoing fight against global warming.\n\nBrand is co‑chair and President of the Board of Directors of The Long Now Foundation. Brand chairs the foundation's Seminars About Long-term Thinking (SALT). This series on long-term thinking has presented a large range of different speakers including: Brian Eno, Neal Stephenson, Vernor Vinge, Philip Rosedale, Jimmy Wales, Kevin Kelly, Clay Shirky, Ray Kurzweil, Bruce Sterling, Cory Doctorow, and many others.\n\nStewart Brand is the initiator or was involved with the development of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The work occupies seminal status in the comparative analysis of the welfare states of Western Europe and other advanced capitalist economies. The work called into question well-established ways of thinking about differences among welfare states in advanced capitalist democracies. At the time of writing this book, Gøsta Esping-Andersen was Professor at the European University Institute, Florence.\n\nIn \"The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism\", Esping-Andersen outlines a typology of welfare capitalism in an attempt to classify contemporary Western welfare states as belonging to one of three \"worlds of welfare capitalism.\" The three types are characterised by a specific labour market regime and also by a specific post‐industrial employment trajectory.\n\nThe three types are:\n\nSince its publication the typology has been widely used in academic research and theory, and has generated much debate on the subject of the nature of the welfare state. The desirability of the work's approach has been stated by various comparative welfare state scholars.\n\nIn the book Esping-Andersen criticized earlier theoretical models of the welfare state as \"inadequate\", arguing that their analysis relied too heavily upon the misleading comparison of aggregate welfare state expenditure, and also argued that public expenditure should no longer be a measure of comparison and that we should seek to replace it with other measures. in the place of expenditure, Esping-Andersen built his typology on a rich database of detailed programme characteristics.\n\nWhile using three categories in his typology, the author notes that East Asia may not strictly fit in a single category but may be seen as a hybrid of liberal and conservative models.\n\n"}

In 2002, he was awarded the Homo Homini Award for human rights activism by the Czech group People In Need, which he shared with Thích Huyền Quang and Thadeus Nguyễn Văn Lý.\n\nThích Quảng Độ was born in the Thái Bình Province of North Vietnam, at 14 he became a monk. At age 17 he witnessed his religious master executed by the revolutionary People's Tribunal.\n\nWhile a member of the leadership of the UBCV, Thích Quảng Độ became an activist, fighting against the anti-Buddhist policies of Ngô Đình Diệm. After a police raid of Buddhist monasteries in Hue and Saigon, Quảng Độ was arrested on August 20, 1963. He and thousands of other Buddhists endured torture and persecution while imprisoned by the Diem government. As a result of imprisonment, Độ struggled with tuberculosis before having a lung operation.\n\nIn 1975 Vietnam was under communist control, and the UBCV was once again unwelcome in Vietnam. As a result, the UBCV facilities were seized, and documents burned. Quảng Độ was active in protesting the governments actions, and after attempting to gather Buddhists from other regions in non-violent opposition, he was arrested on charges of anti-revolutionary activities and undermining national solidarity. He spent 20 months at the Phan Dang Luu Prison in solitary confinement, before he was trialed and released in December, 1978. Later that year he was nominated by Betty Williams and Mairead Maguire to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn 1982 the Vietnamese Government created a Buddhist alternative, called the Vietnam Buddhist Church, which was state sponsored and controlled by the Vietnam Fatherland Front. Because of Quảng Độ's opposition to the new church, he was again jailed. Quảng Độ would spend the next 10 years in exile in the village of Vu Doai.\n\nYet again in 1995, while attempting to expose government abuse of the UBCV, he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nThích Quảng Độ became the President of the UBCV's Institute for the Dissemination of the Dharma in 1999, meaning that he was the second-ranking UBCV dignitary after patriarch Thich Huyen Quang. In 2008, as one of his last wishes Patriarch Quang named Thích Quảng Độ as the new patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam.\n\nIn 2001, Thích Quảng Độ received the Hellman-Hammet Award for persecuted writers.\n\nIn 2002, Thích Quảng Độ, together with Father Nguyễn Văn Lý, received Vietnam Human Rights Award from Vietnam Human Rights Network.\n\nIn 2003, Thích Quảng Độ was honored with the Homo Homini Award for human rights activism by the Czech group People in Need, which he shared with Thích Huyền Quảng and Father Nguyễn Văn Lý.\n\nIn 2006, Thích Quảng Độ was awarded the Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize, in recognition of \"personal courage and perseverance through three decades of peaceful opposition against the communist regime in Vietnam, and as a symbol for the growing democracy movement\". Thích Quảng Độ was unable to the receive the award, as the government prevented him from attending the ceremony.\n\nIn 2006, Thích Quảng Độ was also awarded the Democracy Courage Tribute by the World Movement for Democracy.\n\nIn January 2008, the Europe-based magazine \"A Different View\" chose Độ as one of the 15 Champions of World Democracy. Others in the list include Nelson Mandela, Lech Wałęsa, Corazon Aquino, and Aung San Suu Kyi. \n\n9 time Nobel Peace Prize nominee.\n\n\n"}

It replaced the post of Prime Minister.\n\nPierre Buyoya, a former President (1987–1993) who seized power in a 1996 military coup, was sworn in as President of the Republic on 11 June 1998. He appointed Frédéric Bamvuginyumvira, a Hutu member of the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), as 1st vice-president. Mathias Sinamenye, a Tutsi member of Buyoya's Union for National Progress (UPRONA) party, was appointed 2nd vice-president.\n\nAccording to the transitional constitution, the vice-presidency consisted of two posts: The 1st vice-president (Responsible for political and administrative affairs) and the 2nd vice-president (Responsible for economic and social affairs).\n\nA new transitional power-sharing government took office on 1 November 2001. Interim president Pierre Buyoya became transitional president for a period of 18 months. At the end of his term in 2003, Hutu Vice-President Domitien Ndayizeye took office and appointed a Tutsi (Alphonse-Marie Kadege) as vice-president. In November 2004, Kadege was sacked as vice-president and replaced by Frédéric Ngenzebuhoro. Although Ndayizeye's term was due to end in late 2004 following elections, the transitional period was extended and planned elections were delayed. Elections were held in mid-2005 and the transitional period is due to end on 26 August 2005, when the newly elected president takes office.\n\nBurundi's new constitution, approved in a 28 February 2005 constitutional referendum, calls for a two-member vice-presidency (similar to that of the interim period). The 1st vice-president will be responsible for political and administrative affairs, while the 2nd vice-president will handle social and economic affairs. One vice-president will be an ethnic Hutu and the other a Tutsi. Nominees must be approved by both chambers of parliament in order to take office.\n\nOn 29 August 2005, President Pierre Nkurunziza nominated Martin Nduwimana and Alice Nzomukunda for the posts of 1st and 2nd vice-president. Both received approval from parliament and were immediately sworn in. Nzomukunda resigned on 5 September 2006. She was replaced by Marina Barampama two days later.\n\nIn February 2007, Barampama was replaced by Gabriel Ntisezerana. In November 2007, Nduwimana was replaced by Yves Sahinguvu.\n\nIn August 2010, Sahinguvu was replaced by Therence Sinunguruza and Ntisezerana was replaced by Gervais Rufyikiri.\n\nNew constitutional amendments were approved in a referendum in May 2018. The post of second vice-president will be abolished. The remaining vice-president, who will have limited powers, will be selected from a political party and ethnic group that differs from those of the President.\n\n\n\n"}
