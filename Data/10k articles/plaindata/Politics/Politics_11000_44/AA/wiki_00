{"id": "23125806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23125806", "title": "2009 Peruvian political crisis", "text": "2009 Peruvian political crisis\n\nThe 2009 Peruvian political crisis resulted from the ongoing opposition to oil development in the Peruvian Amazon by local Native Americans; they protested Petroperú and confronted the National Police. At the forefront of the movement to resist the development was Asociación Interétnica de Desarrollo de la Selva (AIDESEP), a coalition of indigenous community organizations in the region.\n\nFollowing the government's decision to pass regulations allowing companies access to the Amazon, natives conducted more than a year of declared opposition and advocacy to change this policy, including 65 straight days of civil disobedience. In June 2009, the Garcia government suspended civil liberties, declared a state of emergency, and sent in the military to stop the protests. The military intervention, referred to as the \"Baguazo\", resulted in two days of bloody confrontations, resulting in a total of 23 police deaths, 10 native/civilians deaths and more than 150 native wounded.\n\nThis conflict has been described as Peru's worst political violence in years and is the worst crisis of President Alan García's presidency. Prime Minister Yehude Simon was forced to resign his post in the aftermath, and Congress repealed the laws that led to the protests.\n\nA free trade agreement negotiated between Peru and the United States that came into effect in February 2009 required certain changes in law allowing private companies access to the Amazon for development of resources. The Congress of Peru granted the government authority to implement the required regulatory changes. Indigenous tribes insisted that some of the new government regulations introduced by President Alan García in 2008 threatened the safety of their natural resources and would enable foreign companies to exploit them. Protests ensued in August 2008, and Congress repealed two laws and promised to examine and vote on others. When that didn't happen, protests and blockades resumed in April 2009.\n\nIn the early 21st century, exploitation of mineral resources has been criticized by researchers based on the link they have shown between the abundance of natural resources (particularly minerals and oil) of a country and its poor growth performance, as well as poor governmental policies and institutions (subject to ills such as corruption, weak governance, rent-seeking, plunder). They found this relationship is especially related to development of 'point source' minerals such as mines and oil fields, which produce high value for few people, as opposed to agricultural diffuse development, which involves large quantities of workers, forcing benefits to be shared. Some believe that Peruvian oil development functions in such a model of 'point source', providing grievances and low benefit to local populations.\n\nIn 2008 an oil scandal shook the government of Alan García when audio tapes revealing corruption and conflict of interest were released to the press. The tapes contained the conversations of Rómulo León, an important member of the ruling Apra party negotiating bribes from foreign companies in order to allow them to drill for petroleum in the Peruvian Amazon region. Romulo León was imprisoned, yet his daughter, Luciana León, a member of congress, continues to work in the parliament despite e-mail messages found by investigators that revealed that she was aware of and participating in her father's activities.\n\nIn June 2009, as the dispute worsened, the government ordered the military in to assist the police. The deaths resulted in two clashes fought in the Amazon jungle on 5 and 6 June 2009.\n\nOn 5 June 2009, at least 32 people were killed in clashes between security forces and indigenous people on the \"Devil's Curve\" jungle highway close to Bagua, over 1,000 kilometres north of Lima, as the security forces attempted to break down a road blockade. The deaths came when police decided to break down a blockade of 5,000 protesters. 23 of the dead were native tribesmen and 9 were members of the police force. The tribes accused the police of using helicopters to fire on those protesting peacefully below. Alberto Pizango, an indigenous leader, told journalists that the government was responsible for the massacre. Police said the natives had first shot at them; the President said the tribes had \"fall[en] to a criminal level\".\n\nOn 6 June 2009, an additional nine police officers were killed at a petroleum facility belonging to a national oil company, Petroperú, which had been seized by the protesting indigenous tribes. Prime Minister Simon said the officers were killed as they tried to rescue 38 kidnapped police officers believed held. \nGarcía criticised the protesters, claiming they had behaved like terrorists and suggested that they may have been \"incited by foreigners\". There was considerable confusion about the events, as it was reported that several police had been taken hostage, although 22 were freed and 7 were missing. This number was later revised to one missing policeman. The government announced a 3:00 p.m. – 6:00 a.m. curfew effective immediately.\n\nAccording to Amazon Watch, the police staged a violent raid on the unarmed indigenous people who were participating in a peaceful blockade to revoke the \"free trade\" decrees, issued by President Garcia in the context of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States. During that day, over 600 police attacked several thousand unarmed Awajun and Wamba indigenous peoples (including many women and children) and forcibly dispersed them using tear gas and live ammunition. \\\\\n\nAfter the police started shooting at the protesters, some indigenous wrestled away their guns and fought back, shooting and killing nine policemen. The confrontation resulted in the 25 civilian deaths and more than 150 wounded. The police were accused of burning bodies to hide the death toll.\n\nAt least 155 were injured, one third by bullet wounds; 72 people were arrested. The casualty toll was expected to rise. Not since the conflict with the Shining Path had so many people been killed or injured in political clashes of this nature in Peru.\n\nOn 9 June, the government of Peruvian President Alan García still refused to meet with the indigenous coalition AIDESEP. The government sought to arrest Alberto Pizango on charges of sedition; he is a Shawi Indian leader of the protesters and head of their organization, AIDESEP. Pizango entered Nicaragua's embassy in Lima on 8 June and was granted political asylum the next day. Four other AIDESEP leaders were accused of disturbing the peace and advocating sedition and revolt, and faced up to six years in prison.\n\nIn the week following the clashes, Congress suspended two of the offending government decrees. The indigenous protesters vowed to continue until the decrees were repealed and not just suspended. On 18 June, Congress repealed two of the decrees, and the protesters lifted their blockade.\n\nCarmen Vildoso, minister for Women's Issues and Social Development, resigned on 8 June to protest the government's actions.\n\nPrime Minister Yehude Simon negotiated the deal to repeal the two decrees mentioned above and announced on 16 June that he would resign \"in the coming weeks\" over the government's handling of the crisis. President Alan García had appointed Simon, who is politically to the left of García, in October 2008 in an effort to mollify the country's poor and hard-line leftist nationalists.\n\nIn June 2009, Human Rights Watch condemned the Peruvian government's decision to revoke the broadcast license of a local radio station stating that \"The timing and circumstances of the revocation suggest that it may have been an act of censorship, or punishment, in response to coverage of anti-government protests on June 5, 2009.\"\n\n\"If there is in fact credible evidence that a radio station has actively supported or incited violence, then the broadcasters should be subject to investigation and sanction, with all appropriate judicial guarantees\", said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \"But closing down a station this way certainly looks like retaliation for coverage the government didn't like.\"\n\nThe film \"When Two Worlds Collide\" is composed of footage shot from 2007 through 2013, and presents a view of events that is sympathetic toward the protestors. It premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2016.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1568479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1568479", "title": "Anti-Apartheid Movement", "text": "Anti-Apartheid Movement\n\nThe Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM), originally known as the Boycott Movement, was a British organisation that was at the centre of the international movement opposing the South African apartheid system and supporting South Africa's non-White population who were persecuted by the policies of apartheid. The AAM changed its name to in 1994, when South Africa achieved majority rule through free and fair elections, in which all races could vote.\n\nIn response to an appeal by Albert Luthuli, the Boycott Movement was founded in London on 26 June 1959 at a meeting of South African exiles and their supporters. Members included Vella Pillay, Ros Ainslie, Abdul Minty and Nanda Naidoo.\n\nJulius Nyerere would summarize its purpose:\n\nWe are not asking you, the British people, for anything special. We are just asking you to withdraw your support from apartheid by not buying South African goods.\n\nThe boycott attracted widespread support from students, trade unions and the Labour, Liberal and Communist parties. On 28 February 1960, the movement launched a March Month, Boycott Action at a rally in Trafalgar Square. Speakers at the rally included Labour Party Leader Hugh Gaitskell, Liberal MP Jeremy Thorpe, Conservative peer John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham, and Tennyson Makiwane of the African National Congress.\n\nThe Sharpeville massacre occurred on 21 March 1960, when 69 unarmed protesters were shot dead by the South African police, triggered an intensification of action. The organisation was renamed the \"Anti-Apartheid Movement\" and instead of just a consumer boycott the group would now \"co-ordinate all the anti-apartheid work and keep South Africa's apartheid policy in the forefront of British politics\", and campaign for the total isolation of apartheid South Africa, including economic sanctions.\n\nAt the time, the United Kingdom was South Africa's largest foreign investor and South Africa was the UK's third biggest export market. The ANC was still committed to peaceful resistance: armed struggle through Umkhonto we Sizwe would only begin a year later.\n\nThe AAM scored its first major victory when South Africa was forced to leave the Commonwealth in 1961. It held a 72-hour vigil outside the Commonwealth Secretariat venue, Marlborough House, and found willing allies in Canada, India and the newly independent Afro-Asian Commonwealth member states. In 1962, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on all member states to impose a trade boycott against South Africa. In 1963, the UN Security Council called for a partial arms ban against South Africa, but this was not mandatory under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.\n\nAbdul Minty, who took over from Rosalynde Ainslie as the AAM's Hon. Secretary in 1962, also represented the South African Sports Association, a non-racial body set up in South Africa by Dennis Brutus. In the same year, he presented a letter to the International Olympic Committee meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany about racism in South African sports. The result was a ruling that suspended South Africa from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. South Africa was finally expelled from the Olympics in 1970.\n\nIn November 1962, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 1761, a non-binding resolution establishing the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid and called for imposing economic and other sanctions on South Africa. All Western nations refused to join the committee as members. This boycott of a committee, the first such boycott, happened because it was created by the same General Assembly resolution that called for economic and other sanctions on South Africa, which at the time the West strongly opposed.\n\nFollowing this passage of this resolution, the Anti-Apartheid Movement spearheaded the arrangements for international conference on sanctions to be held in London in April 1964. According to Lisson, \"The aim of the Conference was to work out the practicability of economic sanctions and their implications on the economies of South Africa, the UK, the US and the Protectorates. Knowing that the strongest opposition to the application of sanctions came from the West (and within the West, the UK), the Committee made every effort to attract as wide and varied a number of speakers and participants as possible so that the Conference findings would be regarded as objective.\"\n\nThe conference was named the \"International Conference for Economic Sanctions Against South Africa\". Lisson writes:\n\nThe Conference established the necessity, the legality and the practicability of internationally organised sanctions against South Africa, whose policies were seen to have become a direct threat to peace and security in Africa and the world. Its findings also pointed out that in order to be effective, a programme of sanctions would need the active participation of Britain and the US, who were also the main obstacle to the implementation of such a policy.\n\nThe AAM was enthusiastic with the results of the conference for two key reasons. First, because of \"the new seriousness with which the use of economic sanctions is viewed.\" Second, because the AAM was able to meet for the first time with the \"UN Special Committee on Apartheid\", a meeting that established a long-lasting working relationship between the two parties.\n\nHowever, the conference was not successful in persuading the UK to take up economic sanctions against South Africa. Rather, the British government \"remained firm in its view that the imposition of sanctions would be unconstitutional \"because we do not accept that this situation in South Africa constitutes a threat to international peace and security and we do not in any case believe that sanctions would have the effect of persuading the South African Government to change its policies\".\"\n\nThe Anti-Apartheid Movement tried to make sanctions an election issue for the 1964 UK general election. Candidates were asked to state their position on economic sanctions and other punitive measures against the South African government. Most candidates who responded answered in the affirmative. After the Labour Party's victory at the 1964 general election after thirteen years in opposition; commitment to the anti-apartheid cause dissipated. In short order, UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson told the press that his Labour Party was \"not in favour of trade sanctions partly because, even if fully effective, they would harm the people we are most concerned about; the Africans and those White South Africans who are having to maintain some standard of decency there.\" Even so, Lisson writes that the \"AAM still hoped that the new Labour Government would be more sensitive to the demands of public opinion than the previous Government.\" But by the end of 1964, it was clear that the election of the Labour Party had made little difference in the governments overall unwillingness to impose sanctions.\n\nLisson summarises the UN situation in 1964:\n\nAt the UN, Britain consistently refused to accept that the situation in South Africa fell under Chapter VII of the [United Nations] Charter. Instead, in collaboration with the US, it worked for a carefully worded appeal on the Rivonia Trial and other political trials to try to appease Afro-Asian countries and public opinion at home and abroad; by early 1965 the issue of sanctions had lost momentum.\n\nThe Anti-Apartheid Movement was instrumental in initiating an academic boycott of South Africa in 1965. The declaration was signed by 496 university professors and lecturers from 34 British universities to protest against apartheid and associated violations of academic freedom. They made a special reference to the issue of banning orders against two South African academics named Jack Simons and Eddie Roux, who were two well-known progressive academics.\n\nA part of the declaration:\n\nFaced with the failure to persuade the West to impose economic sanctions, in 1966 the AAM formulated a strategy whereby they would shift toward spearheading \"an international campaign against apartheid under the auspices of the United Nations.\" AAM's proposed strategy was approved by the UN Special Committee on Apartheid and then by the General Assembly. This new partnership formed the basis for all future action against apartheid. The man originally responsible for the new strategy gives this summary:\n\nThe strategy was to press for a range of measures to isolate the regime, support the liberation movement and inform world public opinion; to continue pressing for effective sanctions as the only means for a peaceful solution, and at the same time to obtain action on other measures which could be decided by a majority vote in the General Assembly; to isolate the major trading partners of South Africa by persuading other Western countries to co-operate in action to the greatest feasible extent; and to find ways to promote public opinion and public action against apartheid, especially in the countries which were the main collaborators with the South African regime. This also meant that we built the broadest support for each measure, thereby welcoming co-operation rather than alienating governments and organisations which were not yet prepared to support sanctions or armed struggle.\n\nThe Anti-Apartheid Movement continued to operate in the UK until 1994. After the first democratic elections in South Africa, AAM changed its name to .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22460873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22460873", "title": "Asset (economics)", "text": "Asset (economics)\n\nAn asset in economic theory is a durable good which can only be partially consumed (like a portable music player) or input as a factor of production (like a cement mixer) which can only be partially used up in production. The necessary quality for an asset is that value remains after the period of analysis so it can be used as a store of value. As such, financial instruments like corporate bonds and common stocks are assets because they store value for the next period. If the good or factor is used up before the next period, there would be nothing upon which to place a value.\n\nAs a result of this definition, assets only have positive futures prices. This is analogous to the distinction between consumer durables and non-durables. Durables last more than one year. A classic durable is an automobile. A classic non-durable is an apple, which is eaten and lasts less than one year. Assets are that category of output which economic theory places prices upon. In a simple Walrasian equilibrium model, there is but a single period and all items have prices. In a multi-period equilibrium model, while all items have prices in the current period. Only assets can survive into the next period and thus only assets can store value and as a result, only assets have a price today for delivery tomorrow. Items which depreciate 100% by tomorrow have no price for delivery tomorrow because by tomorrow it ceases to exist.\n\nThe subfield of asset pricing (or valuation) is the financial evaluation of the value of such assets; the primary method used by today's financial analysts is the discounted cash flow method. With this method, an asset's future cash flows are either assumed to be known with certainty (as in a treasury bond which is risk free) or estimated. These future cash flows are discounting used present values.\n\nThe Flow of Funds tables from the Federal Reserve System provide data about assets, which are tangible assets and financial assets, and liabilities. The difference, assets minus liabilities, is net worth.\n\n\n"}

The AUA as a global organisation seeks to spread, uphold and enhance the Assyrian name in the world, to secure the human rights of the Assyrian people in their homeland and to attain an autonomous state in the Assyrian homeland.\n\nThe AUA has held 28 world congresses in which representatives of the Assyrian federations, organizations and political parties have participated, voicing the concerns of their respective communities and partaking in directing the affairs of the nation. Each AUA World Congress has convened in a different country to strengthen the relation between the AUA, the Assyrians and the government of that host country. The AUA World Congress has been held in the US, Europe, Australia, Iran and Iraq. The AUA had not been able to hold its World Congress in Iraq, the Assyrian homeland, until 2010 in Erbil as the aspirations of the Assyrian people were in direct conflict with the policies of the ruling Baath regime, which continuously denied Assyrians their national identity and status as the indigenous people of Iraq and persisted in its attempts to Arabize them.\n\nThe current Secretary-General of the AUA is Yonathan Betkolia, an Assyrian representative in the Iranian parliament. The current affiliates of the AUA include: the Assyrian National Congress of Georgia, Assyrian National Council of Iran, Assyrian Association of Armenia, Assyrian Australian National Federation and the Assyrian Federation of Russia.\n\nAfter the inception of the AUA, a serious effort was undertaken to address the need of the Assyrian nation to have its own official flag. The worldwide effort netted a large number of designs which were presented in front of the AUA congress and a final design was approved at the 6th AUA congress in Yonkers, New York which was designed by Mr. George Bit-Atanus.\n\nThe AUA does not see itself as a political party, rather as a collective that functions with political parties and leans towards appropriate institutions. The founding document of the AUA declares \"Assyrian\" as the \"singular name for all members of our nation [umtan]\" and lists the various churches of Syriac heritage.\n\nThe AUA's founding principles are centred around: \"One name for one nation, One language for one nation, One leadership for one nation, A homeland for one nation.\n\nOn the 6th of August 1991, the Assyrian Universal Alliance became a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, representing Assyria.\n\nThe AUA has continuously pushed for Assyrian rights during UNPO gatherings such as the General Assembly held in Taiwan, where the AUA presented the critical conditions of Assyrians living in Iraq and introduced a resolution that called the UNPO General Assembly to support an autonomous status (self-administered region) for Assyrians in Iraq.\n\nIn August 1996, AUA delivered a statement to the UN sub-commission, voicing concerns over the discrimination against Assyrians in Northern Iraq as well as being deprived of preserving their identity. Thus, the AUA called for a civil administration to be put in place in Northern Iraq in order to provide the necessary services. In September 1996, an Assyrian delegation and the UNPO met with the assistant to the UN Special Rapporteur on Iraq to brief him on the situation of Assyrians.\n\nJohn J. Nimrod, former secretary-general of the AUA, served as chairman of the UNPO General Assembly from 1992-2004.\n\nThe Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation (AUAF), a non-profit organization, was established in Chicago in 1978 as a response to the mass migration of Assyrian refugees to the United States, with the intent to assist with the resettlement process.\n\nAUAF has since expanded its mission beyond social services to include humanitarian relief efforts, as well as educational and cultural programs. AUAF has developed multiple community programs such as a Fine Arts Program that identifies talented Assyrian Americans and engage their talents to become effective leaders, tutoring services for Assyrians in secondary school, scholarships, and the Ashurbanipal Library which was founded in the 1980s and is home to the largest and most extensive collection of Assyrian texts in the world.\n\n\n"}

Dunphey\n\nCharles Patrick Dunphey (born November 22, 1992) is an American author from Staten Island, New York who lives in southern Mississippi.\n\nHis debut work, a science fiction horror novel titled \"Plane Walker\", was released in April 2016. Dunphey is also a film reviewer, and founder of Gehenna and Hinnom Books.\n\nDunphey holds a bachelor's in English from the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\nC. P. Dunphey was born in Staten Island, New York before moving to Brooklyn, New York. After his father received a job offer in Mississippi, Dunphey and his family moved to Meridian, Mississippi before settling in Picayune, Mississippi. From a very young age, Dunphey was fascinated with science fiction and horror, often filling composition notebooks front to back with space operas and horror stories. He was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder at a very young age, often citing this disease as the source of his creativity. After graduating from Picayune Memorial High School, Dunphey would attend Pearl River Community College in Poplarville, Mississippi where he would receive his Associate's in Arts. Then he moved to Hattiesburg, Mississippi and received his Bachelor's in English from the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\nC. P. Dunphey's first credited publication was in December 2012 when he was 19 years old. The novel titled \"Lazarus\", which would evolve into \"Plane Walker\" four years later, was released independently, self-published through Amazon's subsidiary company Createspace. Dunphey has expressed that he wasn't necessarily proud of this work, citing many different reasons. According to an interview with Dunphey on J. Scott Coatsworth's blog, Dunphey called the first book \"rushed\" and \"lacking of patience\" in narrative. From 2012-2016, Dunphey worked on the manuscript he originally published and ended up adding over a hundred pages of content while also having the manuscript undergo extensive edits and reconstruction. The publication of \"Plane Walker\" and the formation of Gehenna Publishing House followed a period in Dunphey's life where he was practically homeless, inciting a desire for change in him that led to his dedication to his writing.\n\nDunphey had also been published in columns of the comic books \"Haunt\" and \"Spawn\", though these were merely guest interviews concerning the plots and characters of the series where he was able to speak with such writers and artists as Todd McFarlane and Greg Capullo, respectively.\n\nIn April 2016, the finished product of \"Plane Walker\" was released on Amazon through Dunphey's small press, Gehenna Publishing House (also known as Gehenna & Hinnom Books). The novel received primarily positive reviews, Dunphey's writing being compared to that of Thomas Ligotti, H.P. Lovecraft, Philip K. Dick, and John Carpenter, among others. Dunphey's philosophical and often poetic language has been the center of most discussion. On the contrary, veteran science fiction magazine \"Amazing Stories\" felt the novel was \"slow to start\" and that it \"focuses too much on minutia\" even if work itself was \"well-written.\"\n\n\"Plane Walker\" became a Five Star Reader's Favorite, a Pitch Perfect Pick winner on Underground Book Reviews, was nominated for the Eric Hoffer Award, and became a bestseller on Amazon in the genre of Hard Science fiction in May 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Dunphey has several upcoming short stories announced to be published in anthologies. Most notably, the Lovecraft Lunatic Asylum's anthology series is publishing two of Dunphey's stories in two separate anthologies, set for release in mid-2017. Dunphey also announced on social media in late-2016 that he plans to release the sequel to \"Plane Walker\" along with a short story collection by the end of the year.\n\nC. P. Dunphey has cited several authors of being inspirations to him as an author. Most notably, he has called H.P. Lovecraft his favorite author while stating Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" as his favorite novel. Other inspirations that have been mentioned are H.P. Lovecraft, Thomas Ligotti, Stephen King, J.R.R. Tolkien, and others. Readers and reviewers have described Dunphey's style as poetic and lyrical while maintaining a horror and science fiction scope. Dunphey is also a self-proclaimed science fiction and horror nut, finding inspiration for his writing in such films as \"Event Horizon\", \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\", \"Jacob's Ladder\", \"The Alien Franchise\", \"The Terminator Franchise\", and video game series such as \"Dead Space\".\n\nIn November 2015, C. P. Dunphey founded the company Gehenna Publishing House with the hopes of reaching out to and signing authors from the southeastern United States, having felt they were underrated and generally unspoken for. Signing on several authors within the first few months, the company quickly became too much for Dunphey to maintain on his own as he tried to helm the entire company by himself, stating this on social media in late 2016. Since then, the company has formed into Gehenna & Hinnom Books, a small press still operated by Dunphey with the hopes to provide classic works of science fiction and horror to young readers.\n\nIn April 2017, Gehenna & Hinnom Books revealed a call for submissions on their new site. The topic of the anthology will be body horror and the expected release date is November 2017, with the tentative title, \"Year's Best Body Horror 2017 Anthology\". In celebration of the genre, Gehenna & Hinnom started a review series of films and novels within the subgenre of visceral horror, their first reviews being for the 2016 Science fiction horror film, \"The Void\", and the 2016 horror film, \"The Eyes of My Mother\".

A small group of Yugoslav officers led by Draža Mihailović did not accept capitulation of the Yugoslav Army and organized resistance and their headquarter on Ravna Gora. As soon as the news about this resistance movement reached Belgrade, many intellectuals and members of numerous non-communist political parties supported it. This group of people in Belgrade became a nucleus of CNK which coordinated their activities with rebel headquarter on Ravna Gora.\n\nThe CNC was established in the end of August 1941 as consultative body. According to some sources, the CNK was established in September 1941. \n\nThe Chetniks (Yugoslav Army in Homeland) established the Mountain Staff No. 1 and Central National Committee, making ideological substance of the Chetnk movement - For Democracy, Against All Dictatorships - their aim of the war. The CNK was composed of the political representatives of all prewar opposition parties.\n\nThe members of its Executive Board were Dragiša Vasić, Mladen Mlađa Žujović and Stevan Moljević. After some time regional committees were established in Montenegro () and in Split () which were not directly subordinated to the CNK although they supported Mihajlović.\n\nThe CNK did not have particular importance. For the first two years only its Executive Board was active. At the beginning of 1943 the CNC was expanded and joined by Aleksandar Aksentijević, Đuro Đurović, Mustafa Mulalić and Đuro Vilović.\nThe CNK began with resistance to Axis occupying forces immediatelly after it was established.\nAccording to the decisions of the Conference in the village Ba, the CNK was designated to acquire political responsibility and cooperation with Allies until liberation from Fascists and Communists and also with the government of the future Yugoslav Federation composed of three federal units, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. The vicepresident of CNK was Mustafa Mulalić who hoped to collect all Muslim sympatizers of the Yugoslav Federation as projected by the Chetniks.\n\nThe official organ of the CNK was \"Glas Yugoslavije\", initiated on 10 July 1944. It was edited by the Executive Board of the CNK, mainly by dr. Đura Đurović who was board's secretary in period between June and September 1944.\n\nFacing the entrance of pro-Partisan Communist Red Army troops into Axis occupied Yugoslavia the CNK reached decision to follow advices received from the USA to gather their forces in Banja Luka and wait for invasion of Allied forces on Dalmatian coast and their infiltration into Bosnia and other parts of Yugoslavia. On 21 February 1945 Pavle Đurišić organized a conference and concluded that they should retreat to Slovenia until more favorable political situation for their national cause is reached, inviting Mihailović and CNK to follow their conclusions. In the absence of the reply from Mihailović on 1 March 1945 Đurišić organized new broader conference of the \"National Committee of Higher Military Commanders and Intellectuals from Montenegro, Boka and Old Ras\" with the same conclusions. Mihailović and CNK rejected decisions of this conference and condemned Đurišić.\n\nSome members of the CNK, including its president Dragiša Vasić, joined Đurišić and began their journey toward Slovenia, contrary to the decisions of Mihailović. After the Battle of Lijevče Field they were all captured and together with Đurišić and other captured Chetnik officers taken to Jasenovac death camp where they were all killed in April 1945.\n\nMany authors emphasize that Stevan Moljević and his work Homogeneous Serbia had crucialy important role in preparation of a coherent set of Chetnik war objectives with establishment of the Greater Serbia as one of the most important Chetnik war objectives. John R. Lampe pointed to secondary status of the Central National Committee and Moljević rising to prominence in this committee only in 1943, as significant details that undercut the perception about Moljević's \"Homogeneous Serbia\" being the centerpiece of coherent set of Chetnik war objectives.\n\n"}

{"id": "496727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=496727", "title": "Colonial mentality", "text": "Colonial mentality\n\nA colonial mentality is the internalized attitude of ethnic or cultural inferiority felt by people as a result of colonization, i.e. them being colonized by another group. It corresponds with the belief that the cultural values of the colonizer are inherently superior to one's own. The term has been used by postcolonial scholars to discuss the transgenerational effects of colonialism present in former colonies following decolonization. It is commonly used as an operational concept for framing ideological domination in historical colonial experiences. In psychology colonial mentality has been used to explain instances of collective depression, anxiety, and other widespread mental health issues in populations that have experienced colonization. Notable Marxist influences on the postcolonial concept of colonial mentality include Frantz Fanon's works on the fracturing of the colonial psyche through Western cultural domination, as well as the concept of cultural hegemony developed by Italian Communist Party Founder Antonio Gramsci.\n\nFrantz Fanon's Marxist writings on imperialism, racism, and decolonizing struggles have influenced post-colonial discussions about the internalization of colonial prejudice. Fanon first tackled the problem of, what he called, the \"colonial alienation of the person\" as a mental health issue through psychiatric analysis.\n\nIn \"The Wretched of the Earth\" (French: \"Les Damnés de la Terre),\" published in 1961, Fanon used psychiatry to analyze how French colonization and the carnage of the Algerian War had mentally affected Algerians' self-identity and mental health. The book argues that during the period of colonization there was a subtle and constant mental pathology that developed within the colonial psyche. Fanon argued that the colonial psyche is fractured by the lack of mental and material homogeneity as a result of the colonial power's Western culture being pressured onto the colonized population despite the existing material differences between them.\n\nHere Fanon expands traditional Marxist understandings of historical materialism to explore how the dissonance between material existence and culture functions to transform the colonized people through the mold of the Western bourgeoisie. This meant that the native Algerian came to view their own traditional culture and identity through the lens of colonial prejudice. Fanon observed that average Algerians internalized and then openly repeated remarks that were in line with the institutionalized racist culture of the French colonizers; dismissing their own culture as backward due to the internalization of Western colonial ideologies.\n\nAccording to Fanon this results in a destabilizing existential conflict within the colonized culture:\"In the West, the family circle, the effects of education, and the relatively high standard of living of the working class provide a more or less efficient protection against the harmful action of these pastimes. But in an African country, where mental development is uneven, where the violent collision of two worlds has considerably shaken old traditions and thrown the universe of the perceptions out of focus, the impressionability and sensibility of the Young African are at the mercy of the various assaults made upon them by the very Nature of Western Culture.\"\n\nDuring the period of the British Raj, proponents of British Imperialism typically regarded native Indian culture with disdain and supported European colonization as a beneficial \"civilizing mission\". Colonization was largely framed as an act of charity aimed at uplifting the \"uncivilized\" Indian, rather than an act of direct exploitation and domination; which targeted native cultural practices deemed to be \"barbaric\" by colonial administrators.\n\nFor example, the colonial policies barring the self-immolating practice of sati, and the influence of British missionaries in discouraging perceived acts of idolatry, the latter of which has been noted by some scholars to have played a large role in the developments of the modern definition of Hinduism. These claims base their assumptions on the lack of a unified Hindu identity prior to the colonial period, and modern Hinduism's unprecedented outward focus on a monotheistic Vedanta worldview. These developments have been read as the result of colonial prejudices which discouraged aspects of Indian religions which differed too greatly from the template of Christianity. It has been noted that the prominence of the Bhagavad Gita as a primary religious text in Hindu discourse was a historical response to colonial criticisms of Indian culture. Europeans found that the Gita had more in common with their own Christian Bible, leading to the denouncement of Hindu practices more distantly related to monotheistic world views; with native subjects continually characterizing their faith as the equal of Christianity in belief (more clear monotheism) and structure (providing an equivalent primary sacred text).\n\nHindu nationalism developed in the 19th century as an internalization of European ideological domination; with local elites aiming to make themselves and Indian society modern by \"emulating the West\". This led to the emergence of what some have called 'neo-Hinduism': consisting of reformist rhetoric transforming Hindu tradition from above, disguised as a revivalist call to return to the untainted origins of the faith. Reflecting the same arguments made by Christian missionaries, who argued that the more superstitious elements of Hindu practice were responsible for corrupting the potential rational philosophy of the faith (i.e. the more Christian-like sentiments). Moving the definitions of Hindu practice away from more overt idol worshiping, reemphasizing the concept of Brahman as a monotheistic divinity, and focusing more on the figure of Krishna in Vaishnavism due to his role as a messianic type figure (more inline with European beliefs) which makes him a suitable alternative to the Christian figure of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India's current ruling party, follows this tradition of nationalistic Hinduism (Hindutva), and promotes an Indian national identity infused with neo-Vedantic thought influenced by this historical colonial mentality.\n\nCritics have claimed that British writer Rudyard Kipling's portrayals of Indian characters in his works generally supported the colonialist view that colonized people were incapable of surviving without the help of Europeans, describing these portrayals as racist. In his famous poem \"The White Man's Burden\", Kipling directly makes this point by romanticizing British colonialism in India and elsewhere in the world. Kipling's poem idolizes Western culture as entirely rational and civilized, while treating non-white cultures as 'childlike' and 'demonic'. Similar sentiments have been interpreted in Kipling's other works. Notably defending the Second Anglo-Boer War as a \"white man's war\"; presenting 'whiteness' as a morally and culturally superior trait of the West, and using it as a legitimizing for British colonial expansion and rule. His portrayal of Indians in his Jungle Book stories have also been criticized as examples of the chauvinistic infantilization of colonized peoples in popular culture. Generally, fiction, such as Kipling's works, have contributed towards colonial mentality in the ways that the colonized people in these fictional narratives are made submissive to and dependent on white colonizers.\n\nIndividuals of Indian ancestry who adopt European culture, internalizing these colonial prejudices, have sometimes been labeled \"Macaulay's Children\". The term is usually used in a derogatory fashion, connoting disloyalty to India. It derives from 19th century British historian, politician, and colonial administrator Thomas Macaulay, who regarded British culture as superior to Indian culture and who famously argued in favor of replacing Indian languages/dialects with English as the medium of instruction in educational institutions. The consequences of this development can still be felt in contemporary India, where the use of English, as opposed to Hindi, still carries with it a level of superiority. Nationalist politicians have campaigned and pushed forward policy changes to promote Hindi official use in education and media over English.\n\nIn the colonial territories administered by the Spanish Empire, racial mixing between Spaniard settlers and the indigenous peoples resulted in the restrictive racial classes, like mestizo, which promoted Spanish cultural hegemony and restricted 'Otherness' within these colonized societies.\nMestizos and other mixed raced combinations were categorized into different castas by colonial administrators as a means of maintaining Spanish dominance over the majority. This system was applied to Spanish colonies in the Americas and the Philippines, where large populations of mixed raced individuals made up the increasing majority of the colonized population.\nThese racial categories punished those with Black African, Afro-Latin, or \"indígenas\" (natives) heritage specifically. With those of European descent given privilege over these other mixtures. As a result of this system, Mestizos struggled to downplay their indigenous heritage and cultural trappings, in order to appear superficially more Spanish. With these internalized prejudices individuals' choices of clothes, occupations, and forms of religious expression. Those of mixed racial identities who wanted to receive the institutional benefits of being Spanish (such as higher educational institutions and career opportunities), could do so by suppressing their own cultures and acting with \"Spanishness\". This mentality lead to commonplace racial forgery in Latin America, often accompanied by legitimizing oral accounts of a Spanish ancestor and a Spanish surname. Most mixed-white and white people in Latin America have Spanish surnames inherited from Spanish ancestors, while most other Latin Americans who have Spanish names and surnames acquired them through the Christianization and Hispanicization of the indigenous and African slave populations by Spanish friars.\n\nIn this heavily racial segregated context, the encomienda system was put in place. Under this system, entire native communities could be used as forced labor under the guise of collecting tribute. A means of rewarding notable soldiers or colonial officials with colonial possessions, as well as extorting native resources with free indigenous labor. Eventually, some Spaniards openly objected to the encomienda system, notably Bartolomé de Las Casas, who insisted that the American \"indígenas\" were human beings with souls and rights and were, in the words of Queen Isabella I, \"to be treated with justice and fairness\".\n\nHistorically, the religious identities of natives were targeted and suppressed by colonial authorities for Christian conversion. The Spaniards were committed to converting their Amerindian subjects to Roman Catholicism, and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end. However, most initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as Amerindian groups simply blended Catholicism with their traditional beliefs. Syncretism between native beliefs and Christianity is still largely prevalent in Indian and Mestizo communities in Latin America. On the other hand, the Spaniards did not impose their language to the degree they did their religion, and the Roman Catholic Church even evangelized in Quechua, Nahuatl, Guarani, etc., contributing to the expansion of these Amerindian languages and equipping them with writing systems.\n\nPrior to colonization by the Spanish (1565-1898), the Sulu Archipelago (located in southern Philippines) was a colony of the Majapahit Empire (1293–1527) based in Indonesia. The Americans were the last country to colonize the Philippines (1898–1946) and nationalists claim that it continues to act as a neo-colony of the US despite its formal independence in 1946.\n\nIn the Philippines colonial mentality is most evident in the preference for Filipino mestizos (primarily those of mixed native Filipino and white ancestry, but also mixed indigenous Filipino and Chinese, and other ethnic groups) in the entertainment industry and mass media, in which they have received extensive exposure despite constituting a small fraction of the population.\n\nThe Cádiz Constitution of 1812 automatically gave Spanish citizenship to all Filipinos regardless of race. The census of 1870 stated that at least one-third of the population of Luzon had partial Hispanic ancestry (from varying points of origin and ranging from Latin America to Spain).\n\nThe combined number of all types of white mestizos or Eurasians is 3.6%, according to a genetic study by Stanford University. This is contradicted by another genetic study done by California University which stated that Filipinos possess moderate amounts of European admixture.\n\nEvidence suggests that fair skin was a characteristic of the cloistered \"binukot\", who were often kept indoors from a very early age. In historical epics of the Philippines their fair skin was presented as a standard of beauty among the upper class. Some cite this as proof that desire for light-colored skin predates colonial influences.\n\nOne of the more adverse physical consequences in the idealization and acceptance of colonial mentality can be seen in the high rate of consumer demand for skin bleaching products used by some indigenous women and a smaller percentage of indigenous men and dark-skinned mestizas and mestizos, in the Philippines.\n\nDemand in the Philippines and in some other tropical countries continue to be widespread.\n"}

The crimes defined therein form either political repression or direct violation of human rights of an individual or a group; including those, otherwise named in Polish criminal law of that particular time. The concept also covers several other illegal activities prohibited by Polish laws already in place since 1932, such as falsification of documents and using them with the intent to cause harm to people mentioned in them.\n\nThe concept of Communist crimes was legally introduced in 1998 and revised several times. It was designed to facilitate studies of events and prosecution of people in authority who committed crimes against Polish citizens as well as the Polish state. The definition is conceptually similar to the legal concept of a Nazi crime.\n\nA functionary of a Communist state is defined as a public official including those who received legal protection similar to public officials, particularly government officials and leaders of the Communist Party. The functionaries involved would most likely work for Polish intelligence, security service and other internal affairs (particularly censorship and religious affairs) departments. Particular organizations named as examples include Ministry of Public Security of Poland, Służba Bezpieczeństwa and Główny Zarząd Informacji Wojska Polskiego. The communist crimes could have also been committed in Poland by members of foreign civil or military services, such as the KGB, NKVD, SMERSH, and Stasi.\n\nCrimes, recognized by international law as crimes against humanity, crimes against peace and war crimes, are not affected by the statute of limitations in Poland. Those crimes are not affected either by the former amnesty or abolition decrees issued in Communist Poland before 7 December 1989. In case of murders, the Polish statute of limitations begins on 1 August 1990 and runs for 40 years, and for 30 years for other crimes.\n\nThe concept has replaced the term Stalinist crime (\"zbrodnia stalinowska\") previously used in Polish law for similar acts, just as the concept of Nazi crime has replaced that of the Hitlerite crime. Both \"Stalinist\" and \"Hitlerite\" crimes were first defined by Polish legislation in 1991.\n\nWhile drafting the concept of the communist crime, Polish legislators specifically discarded the notion that a Communist crime is equal to a Nazi crime, or that the legislation of the communist crime can be based on that of the Nazi crime (already defined in legislation of 31 August 1944), as while similar on some levels they are different enough on others to make analogies unacceptable.\n\nCommunist crimes are primarily investigated by the Institute of National Remembrance, a special research institute with prosecution powers, created by the same legislation that defined the concept of the Communist crime in 1998. Two examples of such unsolved Communist crimes are the Augustów chase, and Kąkolewnica massacre, also known as the Baran Forest Massacre.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14707618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14707618", "title": "Comprehensive annual financial report", "text": "Comprehensive annual financial report\n\nA Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) is a set of U.S. government financial statements comprising the financial report of a state, municipal or other governmental entity that complies with the accounting requirements promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). GASB provides standards for the content of a CAFR in its annually updated publication \"Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards\". The U.S. Federal Government adheres to standards determined by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB).\n\nA CAFR is compiled by a state, municipal or other governmental accounting staff and audited by an external American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) certified accounting firm utilizing GASB requirements. It is composed of three sections: Introductory, Financial and Statistical. It combines the financial information of fund accounting and Enterprise Authorities accounting.\n\nThe National Committee on Municipal Accounting (NCMA) was formed in 1934 by the Government Financial Officers Association to create accounting standards. As a result of its work, the 'Principles of Municipal Accounting', the predecessor to the CAFR, was created. The successor to the NCMA, the National Council on Governmental Accounting (NCGA), issued 'Governmental Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting', which is the basis of the format for the current standard. This document, known as the \"Blue Book\", and its successors documented the CAFR accounting structure and provided standardization and example documents. By 1946, the various levels of government—federal, state, local and municipal—each began producing a CAFR to catalog an accurate picture of institutional funds, enterprise or financial holdings, assets and total investment incomes for those government and nongovernmental entities using the report. This measure is above and beyond the budget process and replaced what was regularly an \"off-the-books\" practice called the \"general fixed-asset account group\". General Purpose government \"budget\" reports did not reflect accounting of this financial data, only reporting on the budget or \"rainy day\" funds or pension fund investments. By the 1970s, the CAFR became the nationwide paradigm for local government accounting.\n\nThe resulting CAFR is presented to the GFOA, which conducts each year a review of applicant local government CAFRs and upon review awards their Certificate of Achievement Award for Excellence in Financial Reporting to those local governments that are in compliance with their CAFR accounting standards of preparation. Presently, accounting principles for government entities are set by transmittal letters issued to local governments by the GASB.\n\nThe primary difference between a budget and a CAFR is a budget is a plan for a specific fiscal period (often a year) primarily showing where tax income is to be allocated. The CAFR contains the results of the period (year) with previous years accumulations. A CAFR shows the total of all financial accounting that a general purpose budget reports does not. The CAFR contains a section that provides a comparison of period budget and actual. Additionally, the CAFR gives a detailed showing of investment accounts by category reflecting balances over previous years, or in plain language using a personal example in comparison would be the difference between: Your house Budget for the year vs your statement of \"Net Worth\" covering the financial accounting over your lifetime. 1-year vs your lifetime.\n\nA Government budget document is a blueprint for a \"specific grouping\" of government agencies' spending over the course of an annual financial period. General Purpose Budgets contain both the spending categories of specified units of government, such as school districts, social services, transportation, courts, police, fire, and park services; along with estimates of revenues expected to occur during the year, such as investment return; due from other funds, overrides of money from the previous year, and tax payments. They are usually more limited to the expected costs of running the aforementioned government operations through tax income as opposed to describing the status of any government fixed assets and investment wealth.\n\nA CAFR is a report of the complete overall financial results not just for the year but what has accumulated since the inception of that local government of both those \"specific groupings\" of government agencies that appear in the current fiscal year General Purpose Budget and all other agencies and departments. These can be autonomous, enterprise (for example government or city owned golf courses), recycling, water, sewer, and financial management - often these agencies were created with the inception of that local, state or government. The CAFR provides information about all of these other government agencies that may have their own budgets and separate investment accounts but their financial holdings are \"not\" combined with the general purpose budget that the same government presents to the public. The CAFR, or as it is called in CANADA CanFR can be used along with a budget document to compare the organizations total financial standing to the annual general purpose budget. The CAFR is the complete showing of the financial investment and income records from all sources, that reflects what has developed over decades whereas a budget report is an inferior document to the CAFR being that it is primarily focused on what revenue is expected to be brought in and spent for just the year.\n\nIn contrast with the rules applying to governments, publicly traded US companies are required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to provide their Annual Financial Report (AFR) to every shareholder each year. Government's accounting falls under GAP (Generally Accepted Procedures)overseen by GASB.org for government accounting. US Companies have their own standards of accounting which would not be accepted by the SEC if US Companies attempted to use local Government's GAP accounting. To view the GASB.org accounting changes in local government CAFR GAP accounting, a short version of each change going back to 1984 can be viewed here - \n\nNews stories covering financial issues of government cite \"rainy day funds\" or special \"ear marked\" funds, loans between government entities, sales of government holdings in, for example, shares of a health care insurance company, self insurance management funds, debt repayment funds that can be up to 40% of the debt itself, and then the \"budget\" is often referred to, along with mentions of pension funds investments, but the full accounting of assets of government entities, the \"CAFR\" is typically not mentioned.\n\n\"Alternative\" media, since the late 1990s, has exposed segments of the public to the subject of the (U.S.) CAFR contributing to the topic being labeled as \"conspiracy theory\" or \"soap box\" issue. In all reality, local government's \"Net Worth\" accounting document, the CAFR is a mandatory review document for any responsible taxpaying citizen.\n\nReporting on government financial issues can be seen as sensationalized in dealing with alleged excesses in spending or tucked away wealth held not clearly visible in the budgetary accounting. A $10,000 dollar Christmas tree for example, or vague mentions of \"many billions\" in referring to issues around the road improvement, self-insurance, debt repayment, and pension funds managed by a state. \n\nThe State of TX based on good due diligence to its residents publishes a \"Cash Report\" that lists all funds managed by the state. The 2014 TX Cash Report can be viewed here - In one recent series of reports, the Kentucky Association of Counties whose spending came under scrutiny by the Lexington Herald-Leader provided some awareness of these types of entities as well as their surpluses and the claimed spending excesses while using money acquired from government fees for products like municipal insurance at premium rates, which build surpluses beyond the needs of the entity.\n\nTypical topics of the alternative media may include examples of: government entities financing each other's bond issues; Orange County California's or other divisions of government investments in derivatives; financial deals that are kept from the public to entice businesses to locate in a state, which may include tax incentives in exchange for stock assets in a company. \nMuch of both the mainstream and alternative media coverage of the topic of government financial issues must be considered a factor in public's confidence towards issues of government accountability.\n\n\n"}

Charles Barns initially entered law school, but then explored the sciences before launching a career as a newspaperman for the \"New York Herald\". While living in New York, he also earned a reputation as author and poet. By 1910 the family relocated to Philadelphia, where Charles Barns established himself as theater manager, and Cornelia studied art.\n\nAs educational opportunities were made more available in the 19th-century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, including founding their own art associations. Artwork made by women was considered to be inferior, and to help overcome that stereotype women became \"increasingly vocal and confident\" in promoting women's work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern and freer \"New Woman\". Artists then, \"played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplyfying this emerging type through their own lives.\"\n\nCornelia Barns enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1906, where she became a pupil of William Merritt Chase and John Twachtman.

She exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and by 1910 was listed as a painter in the \"American Art Annual\". In her mid-twenties she married Arthur S. Garbett, a British music critic working in Philadelphia. The couple gave birth to a son in Philadelphia, and is believed to have spent a couple years in New York City.\n\nMax Eastman, recalled the early days in his assigned role as editor of \"The Masses\", during which the following incident took place around 1913.\nCornelia Barns' artistic style relied on heavy crayon lines and a distinctive comic style in her portrayals of pretentiousness, social privilege, male dominance, and childhood innocence.\n\nIn another work Max Eastman wrote,\n\n\"American Salon of Humorists\" was a 1915 exhibit held in New York City at the Folsom Galleries. It was organized by Louis Baury, and Cornelia Barns was one the twenty-three featured artists. She may have been a relative newcomer to the art scene of New York, but she was rising rapidly.\n\nFrom 1913 to 1917 Barns was a frequent contributor to \"The Masses\", a socialist magazine that attracted a highly talented group of writers and artists. For three years, Barns served on its editorial board.\nAs art historian Rebecca Zurier commented,\nWhen publication of \"The Masses\" was suspending following government charges, a new magazine, \"The Liberator\" was founded by Max Eastman and Crystal Eastman. In the February 10, 1918 issue of the \"New York Call\", Cornelia was announced as a contributing editor to \"The Liberator\", along with fellow cartoonist/illustrators Robert Minor, Boardman Robinson and Art Young. In 1925 the \"New Masses\" was announced as \"A new radical magazine of arts and letters, without political affiliations or obligations but with sympathy and allegiance unqualifiedly with the international labor movement. . .\" Once again, Cornelia Barns was listed as a contributing editor.\n\nWithin socialist periodicals, many cartoons by Cornelia Barns pertained to the topic of women's suffrage and gender equality. As might be expected, she also published cartoons in the suffrage magazines including New York City's \"Woman Voter\" and the National Woman's Party's \"Suffragist.\" \"One Man--One Vote\" depicted two immigrant women with young children, juxtaposted with the stare from a male dandy in three-piece suit and walking stick. Her cover, \"Waiting,\" published in \"The Suffragist\" in 1919 is a powerful portrayal of an unending mass of strong-bodied women, two with babies in their arms, holding a lighted torch while waiting for political recognition through suffrage.\n\nIn 1918, in its second year of publication, Cornelia Barns and Lou Rogers were listed as art editors for Margaret Sanger's \"Birth Control Review\". Her earliest contribution was \"We Accuse Society.\"\n\nIn 1920 Cornelia Barns moved to California with her husband, Arthur S. Garbett, and their young son. They settled on a ranch near her parents, who had moved to Morgan Hill, several years earlier. Seeking job opportunities, the Garbetts next moved to Berkeley. Garbett became a radio station program director, later offering his own radio program. He also served as music critic for a San Francisco newspaper. Cornelia Barns turned mostly to illustration, and provided sketches and covers for \"Sunset\" magazine by 1921. She contributed a feature column for \"Oakland Tribune\", \"My City Oakland\". Garbett and Barns retired to Los Gatos, California, shortly before Cornelia's death from tuberculosis in November 1941. It was speculated that years of using etching acids on zinc plates in poorly ventilated studios had damaged her lungs. Others have noted that her paternal grandmother and grand aunt both succumbed to the disease. Following a flood in the family dwelling, few of her original artworks survive.\n\n"}

{"id": "47616682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47616682", "title": "Double Movement", "text": "Double Movement\n\nThe Double Movement is a concept originated by Karl Polanyi in his book \"The Great Transformation\". The phrase refers to the dialectical process of marketization and push for social protection against that marketization. First, laissez-faire reformers seek to \"disembed\" the economy in order to establish what Polanyi calls a \"market society\" wherein all things are commodified, including what Polanyi terms \"false commodities\": land, labor, and money. Second, a reactionary \"countermovement\" arises whereby society attempts to re-embed the economy through the creation of social protections such as labor laws and tariffs. In Polanyi's view, these liberal reformers seek to subordinate society to the market economy, which is taken by these reformers to be self-regulating. To Polanyi, this is a utopian project, as economies are always embedded in societies.\n\nAccording to \"The Great Transformation\", the development of \"market society\" has been formed by the Double Movement. It has been found that this formulation is practical to analyze the last 30 year's Global development. For example, Laissez-faire has been the forerunner concept or movement of \"neo-liberalism\" or \"market fundamentalism\". \n\nAlthough the concept of Double Movement has been criticized in that this formulation tended to be functionalism, it is still an efficient tool which works as a theoretical foundation. \n\nFirst of all, Polanyi criticized the class analysis of Marxism. \nHe brought up some problems about Marxist class analysis which only focus on the only narrow part of conflicts between employers and workers rather than deal with the overall political background where the conflicts occurred. Rather, Polanyi suggested the state power forms a different power between employers and workers. This also means the market system cannot be operated without government action. His saying \"Laissez-faire was planned\" implies that Laissez-faire is closely involved in managing market economy. Since the market cannot produce invented commodities such as money, land and labor at the right level of sustainable quantities, the government must involve in managing the supply and demand for the production process of these things. This fictitious concept of market economy means that Laissez-faire does not always operate in a perfect way. He argued the self-contradiction of market society is that itself cannot be a basis for social order, rather, the government action is needed for production and maintenance of social order. \nPolanyi's analysis reforms the field where social struggles happen and provides less class-deterministic explanation. These two innovations are intimately connected.\n\nPolanyi also contributed to global context field where social struggle take place. Before him, many other analysts were aware of globally expanding capitalism, but he provided further analysis of this global quality. He argued that the country's specific position within the global system of states constrains the social conflicts within a particular political state. It means that the two innovations, mentioned above, were global situation. The normal economic pattern showed that the global phenomena have been considerably determined the social struggles in countries. The reliance of the movement of Laissez-faire on global situation also generated unavoidable competition which is a cause of weakness of the international state system. Domestic counter-movement against nationalism showed a kind of loyalty to adequate operation of international economy in favor of chasing itself's distinct way of development, which demands substantial management of markets from political power. \n\nThe dependence of Laissez-faire on global hegemony is a complicated problem because this is the field where political leaders need negotiation to keep their political power for two main purposes. They need to maintain both protection on position of the nation within the international state system and effective function of domestic economy. Political leaders should pursue balance between these two goals. If policies are weighted one-side for example, tilting to the Laissez-faire, it undermines the domestic economy and the economy becomes to rely too much on global stream. On the other hand, if policies are biased to the other goal, it disturbs business environment and weakens the global status of the nation by diminishing sufficient foreign investment and resources. Therefore, Each political leaders have to consider both risky situations and make a settlement at the proper balanced point. The relative power between these two rivalry movements are determined by the political and economic states and how social participants think about and act against those particular situations.\n\nOn the one hand, there is a significant importance of self-regulating mechanism of market in Polanyi's study. Polanyi backed up Marx's assertion that it is more influential on pursuing for interests when people have a common ideology rather than an individual goal. If it was not for argument about commonly shared interests among social actors in self-regulating market, the movement of Laissez-faire would not have such a big impact on global economy. \n\nIn the double movement, workers and capitalists are major actors who engage in these two movements and represent the key part of the two rivalry movements respectively. Meanwhile, there are also different social groups which actively participate in these movements according to Polanyi's analysis. For instance, he argued that the brougeoisie and proletariat had the most effect on society when they exerted their power from various influential social groups. In general, workers tended to stand by the counter movement against Laissez-faire and capitalists advocated the freedom and expansion of market. Nevertheless, there were a few workers and capitalists who were supportive vice versa at all time. \n\nPolanyi also argued that the concept of a self-regulating market of Laissez-faire is quite utopian thinking. The market system would break down if there isn't any management of government at all. In most cases, the supporters of the movement of Laissez-faire claim that a self-regulating market works well itself so that signals such as price from the market have an ability to allocate capital, labor and land in a suitable way. However, a fairly much portion of these advocators would find that they are more dependent on the government's regulation on protection of their own property, control over low-class workers and even operation of the free market.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43473072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43473072", "title": "General Jewish Labour Bund", "text": "General Jewish Labour Bund\n\nThe General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (, \"Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund in Litah, Poyln un Rusland\"), generally called The Bund (, cognate to , meaning \"federation\" or \"union\") or the Jewish Labour Bund, was a secular Jewish socialist party in the Russian Empire, active between 1897 and 1920. In 1917 the Polish part of the Bund, which dated to the times when Poland was a Russian territory, seceded from the Russian Bund and created a new Polish General Labor Bund which continued to operate in Poland in the years between the two world wars. The Russian Bund was dissolved in 1920 and incorporated into the Communist Party. Other remnants of the Bund endured in various countries. A member of the Bund was called a \"Bundist\".\n\nThe \"General Jewish Labour Bund in Russia and Poland\" was founded in Vilnius on October 7, 1897. The name was inspired by the General German Workers' Association. The Bund sought to unite all Jewish workers in the Russian Empire into a united socialist party, and also to ally itself with the wider Russian social democratic movement to achieve a democratic and socialist Russia. The Russian Empire then included Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine and most of present-day Poland, areas where the majority of the world's Jews then lived. They hoped to see the Jews achieve a legal minority status in Russia. Of all Jewish political parties of the time, the Bund was the most progressive regarding gender equality, with women making up more than one-third of all members.\n\nIn 1901, the word 'Lithuania' was added to the name of the party.\n\nDuring the period of 1903–1904, the Bund was harshly affected by Czarist state repression. Between June 1903 and July 1904, 4,467 Bundists were arrested and jailed.\n\nGiven the Bund's secular and socialist perspective, it opposed what it viewed as the reactionary nature of traditional Jewish life in Russia. Created before the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP), the Bund was a founding collective member at the RSDLP's first congress in Minsk in March 1898. For the next 5 years, the Bund was recognized as the sole representative of the Jewish workers in the RSDLP, although many Russian socialists of Jewish descent, especially outside of the Pale of Settlement, joined the RSDLP directly.\n\nAt the RSDLP's second congress in Brussels and London in August 1903, the Bund's autonomous position within the RSDLP was rejected under pressure by the Bolsheviks and the Bund's representatives left the Congress, the first of many splits in the Russian social democratic movement in the years to come. The five representatives of the Bund at this Congress were Vladimir Kossowsky, Arkadi Kremer, Mikhail Liber, Vladimir Medem and Noah Portnoy.\n\nThe Bund formally rejoined the RSDLP when all of its faction reunited at the Fourth (Unification) Congress in Stockholm in April 1906, with the support of the Mensheviks, but the RSDLP remained fractured along ideological and ethnic lines. The Bund generally sided with the party's Menshevik faction led by Julius Martov and against the Bolshevik faction led by Vladimir Lenin during the factional struggles in the run-up to the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nThe fifth congress of the Bund met in Zürich in June 1903. 30 delegates took part in the proceedings, representing the major city branches of the party and the Foreign Committee. Two issues dominated the debates; the upcoming congress of the RSDLP and the national question. During the debates there was a division between the older guard of the Foreign Committee (Kossovsky, Kremer and John (Yosef) Mill and the younger generation represented by Medem, Liber and Raphael Abramovitch. The younger group wanted to stress the Jewish national character of the party. In the end no compromise could be reached, and no resolution was adopted on the national question.\n\nIn the Polish areas of the empire, the Bund was a leading force in the 1905 revolution. During the following years, the Bund went into a period of decay. The party tried to concentrate on labour activism around 1909–1910 and led strikes in ten cities. The strikes resulted in a deepened backlash for the party, and as of 1910 there were legal Bundist trade unions in only four cities, Białystok, Vilnius, Riga and Łódź. Total membership in Bundist unions was around 1,500. At the time of the eight party conference only nine local branches were represented (Riga, Vilnius, Białystok, Łódź, Bobruisk, Pinsk, Warsaw, Grodno and Dvinsk) with a combined membership of 609 (out of whom 404 were active).\n\nAfter the RSDLP finally split in 1912, the Bund became a federated part of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Menshevik) (by this time the Mensheviks had accepted the idea of a federated party organization).\n\nAt the 1906 First Duma elections, the Bund made an electoral agreement with the Lithuanian Labourers' Party (\"Trudoviks\"), which resulted in the election to the Duma of two (apparently non-Bundist) candidates supported by the Bund: Dr. Shmaryahu Levin for the Vilnius province and Leon Bramson for the Kaunas province. In total, there were twelve Jewish deputies in the Duma, falling to three in the Second Duma (February 1907 to June 1907), two in the Third Duma (1907–1912) and again three in the fourth, elected in 1912, none of them being affiliated to the Bund.\n\nThe Bund eventually came to strongly oppose Zionism, arguing that emigration to Palestine was a form of escapism. The Bund did not advocate separatism. Instead, it focused on culture, rather than a state or a place, as the glue of Jewish \"nationalism.\" In this they borrowed extensively from the Austro-Marxist school, further alienating the Bolsheviks and Lenin. The Bund also promoted the use of Yiddish as a Jewish national language and to some extent opposed the Zionist project of reviving Hebrew.\n\nThe Bund won converts mainly among Jewish artisans and workers, but also among the growing Jewish intelligentsia. It led a trade union movement of its own. It joined with the Poalei Zion (Labour Zionists) and other groups to form self-defense organisations to protect Jewish communities against pogroms and government troops. During the Russian Revolution of 1905 the Bund headed the revolutionary movement in the Jewish towns, particularly in Belarus and Ukraine.\n\nLess than a year after the founding of the party, its Foreign Committee was set up in Geneva. Also within the same timespan, Bundist groups began to constitute themselves internationally. However, the Bund did not construct any world party (as did Poalei Zion). On the contrary, the Bund argued that it was a party for action inside the Russian empire. The Bundist groups abroad were not included into the party structures. In 1902, a United Organization of Workers' Associations and Support Groups to the Bund Abroad was founded. The groups affiliated to the United Organization played an important role in raising funds for the party.\n\nBetween 1901–1903, the Foreign Committee was based in London.\n\nThe United Organization, the Foreign Committee as well as the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad were all dissolved at the time of the Russian revolution of 1917.\n\nWhen Poland fell under German occupation in 1914, contact between the Bundists in Poland and the party centre in St. Petersburg became difficult. In November 1914 the Bund Central Committee appointed a separate Committee of Bund Organizations in Poland to run the party in Poland. Theoretically the Bundists in Poland and Russia were members of the same party, but in practice the Polish Bundists operated as a party of their own. In December 1917 the split was formalized, as the Polish Bundists held a clandestine meeting in Lublin and reconstituted themselves as a separate political party.\n\nThe Bund was the only Jewish party that worked within the soviets. Like other socialist parties in Russia, the Bund welcomed the February Revolution of 1917, but it did not support the October Revolution in which the Bolsheviks seized power. Like Mensheviks and other non-Bolshevik parties, the Bund called for the convening of the Russian Constituent Assembly long demanded by all Social Democratic factions. The Bund's key leader in Petrograd during these months was Mikhail Liber, who was to be roundly denounced by Lenin. With the Russian Civil War and the increase in anti-Semitic pogroms by nationalists and Whites, the Bund was obliged to recognise the Soviet government and its militants fought in the Red Army in large numbers.\n\nAt the time of the 1917 upheavals, Mikhail Liber was elected president of the Bund. In May 1917, a new Central Committee of the Bund was formed, consisting of Goldman, Erlich, Medem and Jeremiah Weinsthein. One Central Committee member, Medem, was in Poland at the time and couldn't travel to Saint Petersburg to meet with the rest of the Committee.\n\nFour Bund bureaus were represented as such among the 60 delegates to the May 1918 Menshevik Party conference: Moscow (Abramovich), Northern (Erlich), Western (Goldshtein, Melamed) and Occupied Lands (Aizenshtadt).\n\nThe political changes at the time of the Russian revolution resulted in splits in the Bund. In Ukraine, Bund branches in cities like Bobruisk, Ekaterinoburg and Odessa had formed 'leftwing Bund groups' in late 1918. In February 1919 these groups (representing the majority in the Bund in Ukraine) adopted the name Communist Bund (\"Kombund\"), re-constituting themselves as an independent party. Moisei Rafes, who had been a leading figure of the Bund in Ukraine, became the leader of the Ukrainian \"Kombund\". The Communist Bund supported the Soviet side in the Russian Civil War.\n\nThe Bund also had elected officials at the local level. During the 1917 October Revolution and Russian Civil War, the mayor of the predominantly Jewish Ukrainian town of Berdychiv (53,728 inhabitants, 80% of whom were Jewish at the 1897 census) was a Bundist, David Petrovsky (Lipets).\n\nThe remainder Bund in Russia held a conference (the Twelfth Conference of the Bund) on April 12–19, 1920 in Gomel, where the party was split into two separate parties, the majority Communist Bund (Kombund) and the minority Social Democratic Bund.\n\nThe fourteen point of the resolution \"On the Present Situation and the Tasks of Our Party\" stated that\n\nSumming up the experience of the last year, the Twelfth Conference of the Bund finds:\n\nThe resolution on organisational questions stated that\n\nThe logical consequence of the political stand adopted by the Bund is the latter’s entry into the R.C.P on the same basis as the Bund’s membership of the R.S.D.L.P.. The conference authorised the C.C. of the Bund to see to it, as an essential condition, that the Bund preserve within the R.C.P. the status of an autonomous organisation of the Jewish proletariat.\nIn 1921, the Communist Bund dissolved itself and its members sought admission to the Communist Party. As of 1923, the last Bundist groups had ceased to function in Soviet Russia. Many former Bundists, like Mikhail Liber, perished during Stalin's purges in the 1930s. The Polish Bundists continued their activities until 1948. During the latter half of the 20th century the Bundist legacy was represented through the International Jewish Labor Bund, a federation of local Bundist groups around the world.\n\n\nAmong the exiled Bundists who went on with Socialist politics in America was Baruch Charney Vladeck (1886–1938), elected to the New York Board of Aldermen as a Socialist in 1917, defeated in 1921 but re-elected in 1937 to the newly formed New York City Council running on the American Labor Party ticket. He was also the manager of \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" from 1918 till his death.\n\nMoishe Lewis (1888–1950) was a Bundist leader in his Polish (now Belarusian) hometown Svislosz before he emigrated to Canada in 1922. He was the father of David Lewis (1909–1981), a leader of the New Democratic Party in Canada.\n\nThe American Labour leader David Dubinsky (1892–1982), though never formally a member of the party, had joined the bakers' union, which was controlled by the Bund, and was elected assistant secretary within the union by 1906. He made his way to the United States in 1911. He later became a member of the Socialist Party of America, helped found the American Labor Party in 1936 and was from 1932 till 1966 the leader of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.\n\nBetween 1913 and 1917, working under the name Max Goldfarb, David Petrovsky (1886–1937) was a member of the Central Committee of the Jewish Socialist Federation of America, a member of the Socialist Party of America, and the editor of \"The Forward\".\n\n\n"}

This would be one of the causes for the declaration of Brazilian independence by Pedro I of Brazil in 1822, following a liberal revolution in Portugal.\n\nThe liberal period was stormy and short as Miguel of Portugal (Pedro's brother) supported an absolutist revolution endeavoring to restore all power to the monarchy. Pedro eventually returned to Portugal and fought and defeated his brother in the Liberal Wars in which liberalism prevailed and Portugal became a constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe death of King Joseph in 1777 forced the accession of Princess Maria Francisca, his eldest daughter, to the throne of Portugal; she succeeded her father as the first Queen regnant of the 650-year-old country, which was still recovering from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Before becoming queen, Princess Maria and her husband, the Infante Pedro, lived on the sidelines of politics, but were clearly unsympathetic to her father's former Prime Minister, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, the Marquis of Pombal, who had been the \"de facto\" ruler of the kingdom for the past 27 years. During her father's last few years, she had been the Marquis' fiercest detractor; once in power, she eagerly dismissed him and then exiled him to Pombal.\n\nAlthough the queen retained many of the Marquis' other ministers, she restored most of the privileges of the nobility and clergy, and released many of Pombal's political prisoners. The economy was reorganized and Pombaline monopolies were abandoned. However, international conditions favored the economic situation in Portugal as the balance of trade was positive, helped by wine exports and a decrease of British imports. The period was, while tainted by political instability, a time of cultural renovation, marked by the completion of the Palace at Queluz, the beginnings of the Ajuda Palace, the São Carlos Theatre, the Estrela Basilica and the immense Convent of Santa Clara in Vila do Conde.\n\nIn 1789, the French Revolution caused great social upheaval in Europe. The eventual Portuguese reaction was to land forces in Catalonia, and together with the Spanish forces attack the French in the Pyrenees in the War of Roussillon (1794). The war did not go well, and by 1795, Spain had privately sued for peace, signed an alliance and aligned its external politics against Great Britain. Even as Portugal was politically divided between continuing its old alliance with Britain, its people were also divided. The French Revolution, as seen by intellectuals and progressives, was romanticized: Bocage and the \"Partido Francês\" (French Party) believed the French could usher in a liberal revolution in Europe. The French represented a threat to the traditionalist nobility who were returning to prominence and were very willing to fight them externally or internally.\n\nIt was at about this time that Queen Maria, already possessed of a religious mania, began to show signs of mental illness. When after 1799 she became incapable of handling state affairs, her son, Infante John of Braganza, began to use the title of Prince-Regent. The traditionalist adversaries of France, however, did not look to John, but rather to his wife Carlota Joaquina for support, and at one point attempted a coup against the prince.\n\nJohn VI's regency was a complex political period that saw Portugal attempting to remain neutral in spite of the combative intransigence of its neighbors and contentious forces within the country that favored either liberal or traditional policies. Between 1795 and 1801, his government struggled to maintain a delicate balance of peace in the face of the French Continental blockade against Portugal's traditional ally, Great Britain, and the demands of the merchant classes who were prospering economically and wanted peace. Meanwhile, Spain, a former ally, had signed the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, and was under pressure from France to coerce Portugal's cooperation, even if it required an invasion. Although Manuel de Godoy was initially hesitant to invade Portugal, due to the royal family having relatives in both countries, the French remained anxious to break the Anglo-Portuguese alliance in order to close Portuguese ports to British shipping.\n\nOn 29 January 1801, an ultimatum from Spain and France forced Portugal to decide between France and Britain, even as its government had tried to negotiate favorable relations with the two powers rather than abrogate the Treaty of Windsor (1386). The French sent a five-point statement to Lisbon demanding that Portugal:\nIf Portugal failed to accomplish the five conditions of this ultimatum, it would be invaded by Spain, supported by 15,000 French soldiers. The British could not promise any effective relief, even as Prince John appealed to Hookham Frere, who arrived in November 1800. In February, the terms were delivered to the Prince-Regent; although he sent a negotiator to Madrid, war was declared. At the time, Portugal had a poorly trained army, with less than 8,000 cavalry and 46,000 infantry troops. Its military commander, João Carlos de Bragança e Ligne (2nd Duke of Lafões), had barely raised 2,000 horse and 16,000 troops. and was compelled to contract the services of a Prussian colonel, Count Karl Alexander von der Goltz, to assume command as field marshal. The Spanish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief, Manuel de Godoy, had some 30,000 troops at his disposal, while the French troops under General Charles Leclerc (Napoleon's brother-in-law) arrived in Spain too late to assist Godoy, as it was a short military campaign.\n\nOn May 20, Godoy finally entered Portugal; this incursion was a precursor of the Peninsular War that would engulf the Iberian Peninsula. The Spanish army quickly penetrated the Alentejo region in southern Portugal and occupied Olivença, Juromenha, Arronches, Portalegre, Castelo de Vide, Barbacena and Ouguela without resistance. Campo Maior resisted for 18 days before falling to the Spanish army, but Elvas successfully resisted a siege by the invaders. An episode which occurred during the siege of Elvas accounts for the name, \"War of the Oranges\": Godoy, celebrating his first experience of generalship, plucked two oranges from a tree and immediately sent them to Queen Maria Luisa of Spain, mother of Carlota Joaquina and supposedly his lover, with the message:\nThe conflict ended quickly when the defeated and demoralized Portuguese were forced to negotiate and accept the stipulations of the Treaty of Badajoz, signed on June 6, 1801. As part of the peace settlement, Portugal recovered all of the strongholds previously conquered by the Spanish, with the exception of Olivença and other territories on the eastern margin of the Guadiana, and a prohibition of contraband was enforced near the border between the two countries. The treaty was ratified by the Prince-Regent on 14 June, while the King of Spain promulgated the treaty on 21 June.\n\nA special convention (i.e., the Treaty of Madrid) on 29 September 1801 made additions to that of Badajoz whereby Portugal was forced to pay France an indemnity of 20 million francs. This treaty was initially rejected by Napoleon, who wanted the partition of Portugal, but accepted once he concluded a peace with Great Britain at Amiens.\n\nIn 1806, after Napoleon's victory over the Prussians, he considered the problem of the resistance of the English, who had broken the peace in 1803 to challenge the Continental system imposed by the French, and realized that the situation in Portugal impeded his plan for reform in Europe. Again, Portuguese ports were ordered closed to British shipping; the Portuguese initially resisted, but after a tentative period of neutrality, reluctantly succumbed to French demands and declared war on the United Kingdom.\n\nOn 27 October 1807, France and Spain signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau which would partition Portugal. In this pact, Northern Lusitania, a territory between the Minho and Douro rivers, would be a principality governed by the sovereign of the extinct Kingdom of Etruria (then Maria Luisa, daughter of Charles IV of Spain). The Algarve and all Portuguese territory located south of the Tagus would be governed by Manuel de Godoy, in compensation for his role in bringing the Spanish to align with France. The rest of Portugal, the area between the Douro and the Tagus, a strategic region because of its ports, would be administered by the central government in France until a general peace. Its colonial possessions, including Brazil, would be divided between Spain and France.\n\nOn either 19 or 20 November 1807, a French battalion commanded by General Jean-Andoche Junot entered Portugal. Ironically, its arrival was preceded by the newspaper \"O Monitor\", which was presented to the Prince Regent by the British ambassador, informing him of Napoleon's plan to conquer Portugal. To implement the terms of the treaty, Napoleon had ordered its invasion and occupation.\n\nOn 27 November, the Prince Regent, the Queen and the entire royal family, accompanied by many rich merchants as well as their servants, boarded fifteen Portuguese ships gathered in the Tagus with an escort of several English ships, as planned the year before when the British ambassador advised the prince that the Portuguese Crown should be transferred to Brazil. Approximately 10,000 people, including the entire governmental administration and the judiciary, joined the royal family as they moved to Brazil, a \"de facto\" colonial possession of Portugal, and established the capital of the Portuguese Empire in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nGeneral Jean-Andoche Junot and his troops had entered Spain on 18 October 1807 and crossed the peninsula to reach the Portuguese border. Junot encountered no resistance and reached Abrantes by 24 November, Santarém on 28 November, and the Portuguese capital at the end of the month, arriving a day after the Court had fled to Brazil. Before the Prince Regent departed, he left orders with the Regency Junta to greet the French in peace. Once he arrived, Junot promoted himself as a reformer come to liberate the oppressed people of Portugal, promising progress, the construction of roads and canals, efficient administration, clean finances, assistance and schools for the poor. Instead, he set about removing vestiges of the Portuguese monarchy, declared that the House of Braganza had ceased to reign in Portugal, suspended the Council of Regency, suppressed the Portuguese militia, billeted officers in the finest houses of the rich, and plundered the Portuguese treasury for continuing reparations to the French. Meanwhile, 50,000 Spanish and French troops roamed the countryside arresting, killing, plundering and raping the citizenry.\n\nBy 1808, as Junot was busy redesigning Portuguese society, Napoleon decided to revise his alliance with Spain; he forced the abdication of Charles IV of Spain and his son Ferdinand, and installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte as King. A popular uprising in Spain immediately spread to Junot's forces, which were accompanied by Spanish troops, and further instigated a popular uprising by the Portuguese that was brutally put down after some minor successes.\n\nThe following year, a British force commanded by Arthur Wellesley (future Duke of Wellington) disembarked in Galiza with the intent of supporting the Spanish, but later advanced on Porto and landed at Figueira da Foz on 1 August. The British-Portuguese forces advanced quickly on the French, defeating them at the Battle of Roliça (17 August) and later the Battle of Vimeiro (21 August). A two-day armistice was observed as negotiations proceeded and the belligerents formally signed the Convention of Sintra (30 August), without Portuguese representation. As part of the accord, the British transported the French troops to France, with the product of sacks made in Portugal. The Convention benefited both sides: Junot's armies, incapable of communicating with France, could make a safe withdrawal; and the Anglo-Portuguese forces gained control over Lisbon. The Portuguese populace was free to avenge itself on francophile compatriots for the brutality and depredations of the French.\n\nAs Napoleon began dealing with the Spanish in earnest, he sent Marshall Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult to reoccupy Portugal. As word spread of the abdication of the Spanish royal family, many Spaniards revolted, gaining support from the British stationed in Portugal. Under the command of John Moore, British forces crossed the northern Portuguese border but were defeated at A Coruña by Marshal Soult, and were forced to retreat in the middle of January. The French immediately occupied northern Portugal and advanced on Oporto by 24 March.\n\nUnlike the first invasion, there was a popular revolt against French occupation by farmers, merchants and the poor, that almost border on zeal. Many of the citizen soldiers and farmers fought against the French aggression, going so far as to see tactical retreats as a betrayal or treason by the Portuguese officers.\n\nBut, Soult occupied Chaves on 12 March, a defense of Braga was unsuccessful and the French cavalry forced entry into Porto by 29 March. Soult forces encountered a popular resistance in Porto, that included militia and local residents whom barricaded the streets. But, Francisco da Silveira recovered Chaves and ultimately, it was Wellesley, again, at the head of the British-Portuguese forces who expelled the French from the north of the country. He was aided by William Carr Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford and supported by a stronger Portuguese contingent, trained, equipped and command by British officers. The Anglo-Portuguese Army defeated Soult at the Second Battle of Porto, re-conquering the city of Porto on 29 May, and forcing the French retreat to Galicia. Wellesley intended to pursue the French, but with French forces crossing from the Spanish Extremadura, he moved his base to Abrantes. From here his forces then marched up the Tagus valley, entered Spain and won the victory at Talavera, after which he was made Duke of Wellington. He could not penetrate further, owing to Soult's forces joining Victor, to bar the way to Madrid, and so withdrew to Torres Vedras to plan for the defense against a third invasion by the French.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Portuguese colony of Brazil, Portugal was successful in capturing French Guiana in 1809.\n\nThe third invasion, the last effort of the Peninsular War on Portuguese soil, was commanded by Marshall André Massena, and divided into three parts under Jean Reynier, Claude Victor-Perrin and Jean-Andoche Junot, and comprised 62,000 men and 84 canon. Entering by way of Beira in August, they quickly defeated the defenders in the Fort of Almeida in August, then marched in the direction of Lisbon. Against the wishes of his council, Messena attacked the Anglo-Portuguese Army on 26 September in Buçaco, losing 4500 troops. Yet, Wellsely's forces withdrew in front of the oncoming French, until his troops entered the prepared positions in Torres Vedras.\n\nBut, the French were impeded along the Lines of Torres Vedras, a system of 152 fortifications north of Lisbon, planned by Wellington, supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Fletcher constructed by Portuguese laborers, manned by 40,000 Portuguese troops and members of the local population. Marshal Massena and his forces reached the lines by 14 October, but were unable to penetrate the defenses, and he was forced to retreat in April 1811. Supplies were running low, and Massena sent a request to Bonaparte for new instructions, but was compelled to withdraw before the instructions arrived, and he retreated to Santarém. Although Napoleon finally sent Soult, it was too late for Massena, who could not hold Santarém and withdrew towards Coimbra by March 6. Successively, the French were defeated in several smaller battles: the Battle of Sabugal, Fuentes de Onoro, Battle of Condeixa, Battle of Casal Novo, and the Battle of Foz de Arouce, in addition to Michel Ney's rear-guard action at the Battle of Pombal. With winter quickly approaching, his forces starving, they were again defeated at the Battle of Redinha and with Anglo-Portuguese forces in pursuit, Massena crossed the border into Spain; the War would continue until March 1814, but not on Portuguese territory.\n\nA series of battles in Spain followed, until a final victory was reached on French soil in the Battle of Toulouse on April 10, 1814, putting an end to the Peninsular War. However, in numerous coastal, interior and border towns there were bodies bayoneted and left on the ground; several frontier towns were pillaged and ransacked for treasure or vandalized by retreating troops (both British and French); reprisal killings were common in the local populations for sympathizers (the total number of casualties in the war reached 100,000 by one account); while famine and social deprivation was common.\n\nFurthermore, the instability in Spain and the abdication of the king, resulted in declarations of independence in the Spanish colonies of America, which in turn was responsible for a tense political climate in Brazil.\n\nIn 1816, and as a result of the increasing influence of the Liga Federal, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves invaded and conquered the Banda Oriental, annexing it under the name of Província Cisplatina in 1821.\n\nFrom 1808 through 1821, Portugal was effectively both a British protectorate and a colony of Brazil, as the Portuguese Crown remained in Rio de Janeiro. The moving of the Portuguese capital to Rio de Janeiro accentuated the economic, institutional and social crises in mainland Portugal, which was administered by English commercial and military interests under William Beresford's rule in the absence of the monarch. The influence of liberal ideals was strengthened by the aftermath of the war, the continuing impact of the American and French revolutions, discontent under absolutist government, and the general indifference shown by the Portuguese regency for the plight of its people.\n\nAfter 1807 the limitations and subordinations inherent in Brazil's colonial status were already being reduced incrementally. The prohibition on transformative industries was rescinded, and new incentives were offered for: the creation of factories, the importation of British machinery, ship construction, and road building, as well as the foundation and construction of public schools and military academies. In addition to these improvements, the Bank of Brazil was chartered and insurance companies, commerce commissions and currency exchanges were established. This damaged the mother country's commercial interests and aggravated social problems there, while benefiting the United Kingdom, as Portugal was governed by the increasingly despotic British general William Beresford in the absence of the Cortes.\n\nAt the end of the Peninsular War, Portugal returned French Guiana (which had been seized in 1809) to France on 30 May 1814. With the declaration by King John of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in December 1815, Brazil's new importance worsened the situation in continental Portugal: politically, it became the Portuguese capital (shedding the pretense of being a colony), and economically, was now able to trade directly with other European powers.\n\nA report was sent from the Regency to John VI on 2 June 1820, stating:\n\nPortugal's neighbor Spain, during its resistance to the Napoleonic invasions, had approved a liberal Constitution when King Ferdinand VII was in exile, but it was quickly abrogated on his return, and he reigned as absolute monarch. The Spanish model also served as an example for the Portuguese: a popular uprising in the provinces against absolutism forced the Spanish monarch to reinstate the 1820 Constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe significance of events in Spain was not lost on a small group of politically like-minded bourgeoisie in Porto; two years earlier, Manuel Fernandes Tomás, José Ferreira Borges, José da Silva Carvalho and João Ferreira Viana had founded the \"Sinédrio\", a clandestine liberal group who debated the political evolution of Spain and Portugal and would influence subsequent events. The Sinédrio's members were a mixture of merchants, property-owners, the military and noblemen, whose liberalism was based not on personal economic circumstances but on their exposure to international literature and philosophies at university or in the masonic lodges. The common people were rural, almost totally illiterate and lived in a culture of tradition and religion guided by the clergy. The ideological differences between the doctrinairism of the liberal movement and the dogmas of religion would bring the two groups into conflict eventually. In the meantime, however, the rhetoric of the liberal intellectuals had influenced those soldiers in the northern garrisons who on 24 August 1820, first proclaimed in Porto a revolution against the absolute monarchy of Portugal. A colonel read out the declaration:\nThe Regency in Lisbon attempted to gather forces to oppose the revolt, but on 15 September they too joined the movement.\n\nThe administration of William Beresford was swiftly replaced by a Provisional Junta, and the \"General Extraordinary and Constituent Cortes of the Portuguese Nation\", whose deputies were chosen by indirect election, was summoned on 1 January 1821 to draft a written Constitution. This constitutional assembly was composed of diplomatic functionaries, merchants, agrarian burghers, and university-educated representatives who were usually lawyers. Most of all these were ideological romantics, later referred to as \"Vintistas\" for their audacious radicalism. State censorship of the press and literary productions was lifted, and the Portuguese Inquisition was extinguished; a general amnesty for those involved in anti-liberal movements was also ordered. On 26 April 1821, John VI departed for Lisbon, arriving on 3 July of the same year, and communicated to the Cortes the establishment of a Regency in Brazil in the name of his heir-apparent, Pedro I of Brazil. The deputies did not recognize the King's authority to designate regents, nor support the Bragança Agreement, which stipulated that the Portuguese Crown should pass to Prince Pedro if Brazil gained its independence.\n\nTalk of separatism had dominated the economic and intellectual circles of Brazil, which was prosperous, although at least one third of its population of 3.5 million were African slaves. The question was whether Brazil should return to being a colony of Portugal or the reverse should be the case. While most Portuguese-born Brazilians believed in a united empire, the majority of natives and local politicians aspired to some form of independence for their homeland. The historical evidence indicates that regardless of any developments in Portuguese politics, Brazil would have proclaimed independence after the return of King John VI to Portugal. The separatist movement rose from the conflict between the Regency of Prince Pedro meant to rule frugally and started by cutting his own salary, centralizing scattered government offices and selling off most of the royal horses and mules. He issued decrees eliminating the royal salt tax to spur the output of hides and dried beef; he forbade arbitrary seizure of private property; required a judge's warrant for arrests of freemen; and banned secret trials, torture, and other indignities. He also sent elected deputies to the Portuguese Cortes. Slaves continued to be bought and sold and disciplined with force, however, despite his assertion that their blood was the same color as his.</ref> and the Portuguese Cortes.\n\nIn September 1821, the Portuguese Cortes, with a handful of the Brazilian delegates present, voted to abolish the Kingdom of Brazil and the royal agencies in Rio de Janeiro, thus subordinating all provinces of Brazil directly to Lisbon. Troops were sent to Brazil to stifle resistance, and local units were placed under Portuguese command. On 29 September, the \"Cortes\" ordered Prince Pedro to return to Europe to complete his education with a tour of Spain, France and England, but the governmental junta in São Paulo, as well as the Senate Chamber of Rio de Janeiro implored the prince to remain. He was moved by petitions from Brazilian towns and fears that his departure, with the consequent dismantling of the central government, would trigger separatist movements.\n\nPedro formed a new government headed by José Bonifácio de Andrade e Silva, a former royal official and professor of science at the University of Coimbra who was a formative figure in Brazilian nationalism, and known as the \"Patriarch of Independence\". Following Prince Pedro's decision to defy the Cortes, Portuguese troops rioted, then concentrated in the area of Mount Castello, which was soon surrounded by thousands of armed Brazilians. Pedro dismissed the Portuguese commanding general, General Jorge Avilez, and ordered him to remove his soldiers across the bay to Niterói, where they would await transportation to Portugal. Blood was also shed in Recife, Province of Pernambuco, when the Portuguese garrison was forced to depart in November 1821. In mid-February 1822, Brazilians in Bahia revolted against the Portuguese forces there, but were driven into the countryside, where they began guerrilla operations, signaling that the struggle in the north would not be without loss of life and property.\n\nHoping to rally support throughout the country, Pedro began a series of initiatives to strengthen his position, even as the Portuguese Cortes ridiculed him and disparaged his importance. In Minas Gerais, where there were no Portuguese garrisons stationed, some doubts lingered, especially among the junta of Ouro Preto. With only a few companions and no pomp or ceremony, Pedro plunged into Minas Gerais on horseback in late March 1822, receiving enthusiastic welcomes and vows of allegiance everywhere. On 13 May, in Rio de Janeiro, Pedro was proclaimed the \"Perpetual Defender of Brazil\" by the São Paulo legislative assembly and he took the opportunity to call for a constituent assembly. To broaden his base of support, he joined the freemasons, who, led by José Bonifácio de Andrade e Silva, were pressing for parliamentary government and independence. More confident now, in early August he called on the Brazilian deputies in Lisbon to return, decreed that Portuguese forces in Brazil should be treated as enemies, and issued a manifesto to \"friendly nations\" that read like a declaration of independence. Seeking to duplicate his triumph in Minas Gerais, Pedro rode to São Paulo in August to ensure his support there.\n\nReturning from an excursion to Santos, Pedro received messages from his wife Princess Maria Leopoldina and Andrade e Silva that the Portuguese Cortes had declared his government traitorous, and were dispatching more troops. Pedro then had to choose between returning to Portugal in disgrace, or breaking the last ties to Portugal; in a famous scene in front of the Ipiranga River on 7 September 1822, he tore the Portuguese white and blue insignia from his uniform, drew his sword, and swore: \"By my blood, by my honor, and by God: I will make Brazil free.\" With this oath, repeated by the assembled crowd, he announced: \"Brazilians, from this day forward our motto will be...Independence or Death\"\n\nJohn VI had no pretensions to the throne until his older brother Joseph, Prince of Beira, died from smallpox at the age of 27. John, then 21 years old, lived for hunting and had little interest in public affairs. However, four years later he became Prince Regent because of Queen Maria I's mental illness, and in 1816, he became King John VI after her death while the royal family was residing in Rio de Janeiro. In 1821 he was forced to return to a country economically and politically unstable, to preside over a recently installed constitutional monarchy. There were deep divisions between the returning Royal Court and the Portuguese Cortes that governed the nation. While the free-thinking \"Vintistas\" of the upper class governed, the new \"modern era\" was such in name only: the former condition of the poor still prevailed, they remaining pro-monarchist and ultra-religious, but without the power to change their circumstances.\n\nThe situation in continental Europe changed in 1823. Once again influenced by events in Spain, where the anti-liberal Santa Aliança had restored the absolute monarchy, pro-monarchist forces gravitated towards Queen Carlota Joaquina de Borbón. The queen was very conservative, ambitious and violent, and at the same time despised her husband's politics, manners and personality. While in Brazil, she had attempted to obtain administration of Spanish dominions in Latin America and was involved in various obscure conspiracies regarding the independence of Brazil. The return of the king and the royal court had emboldened the clergy and nobles who were hostile to the Constitution and parliamentary government.\n\nPrince Miguel, who shared the queen's views, served as her instrument to subvert the revolution. On 27 May 1823, the prince organized an insurgency against the liberal constitution; a garrison from Lisbon joined Miguel in Vila Franca de Xira, and there absolutism was proclaimed. The king responded by suspending the 1822 Constitution and promising the promulgation of a new law to guarantee \"personal security, property and jobs\". The revolt was referred to as the \"Vilafrancada\" (events that occurred in Vila Franca). One of the objectives of Queen Carlota and Miguel was the abdication of King John, who, although he accepted absolutism, was yet loyal to the liberal Constitution. Ultimately the king accepted absolutism when a movement of army officers and citizens surrounded the Palace of Bemposta to urge him to renounce liberal ideals.\n\nIn Portugal, as in Spain, the adversaries of constitutionalism were divided into two factions: a radical and a more moderate group. King John depended on the moderate faction; the ministers he selected after the \"Vilafrancada\" oscillated between conciliatory paternal absolutism and a timidly moderate liberalism. Queen Carlota was the principal supporter of the radical absolutists, who favored absolutism without concessions and the repression of new ideas filtering in from Europe. She gave no quarter, and in 1823, the police revealed a conspiracy led by her and Prince Miguel (who had been promoted to the post of commander-in-chief of the Army following the events of the \"Vilafrancada\") to force the King to abdicate. Then, on 30 April, Miguel, using the pretext that the King's life was in danger, imprisoned numerous ministers and important figures of the kingdom, while keeping his father \"incommunicado\" in the Bemposta Palace. This second attempt to depose King John became known as the \"Abrilada\", (after \"Abril\", the Portuguese word for \"April\"). During the course of his actions Miguel had offended the sensibilities of the British and French ambassadors, who managed to get John to the British battleship \"Windsor Castle\" in Caxias. There he was made aware of the situation, summoned Miguel, dismissed him from the post of commander-in-chief of the army, and sent him into exile. On 14 May, John returned to the Palace of Bemposta and re-established the liberal government. However, a new conspiracy was discovered on October 26 of the same year. The queen accused the liberals of attempting to poison the king, while they suspected her of having done it herself: this time, she was exiled to Queluz.\n\nDuring his reign as king, John promoted the arts (mainly literature), commerce and agriculture, but being forced to return to Europe and to keep track of the court intrigues that arose following the independence of Brazil made him an unhappy man, and he died soon after the \"Abrilada\" in 1826. It was also at the end of his life that he recognized the independence of Brazil (15 November 1825) and restored his son Pedro's right of succession to the Portuguese throne. Before his death, he named a regency council presided over by the Infanta Isabel Maria to govern the country between his death and the acclamation of the future king.\n\nThe death of King John VI sparked a constitutional crisis, as his rightful successor, Prince Pedro, was the Emperor of Brazil. To absolutists, the proclamation of Brazilian independence created a foreign nation, thus revoking Pedro's citizenship and his right of succession to the throne. John had left his daughter Princess Isabel Maria as regent, expecting that Pedro would return to Portugal and reunite Brazil with its former colonial overlord. Prince Miguel was also an undesirable option; he had been exiled due to several attempts he made to overthrow his own father, and supported the extremist politics of his mother, Queen Carlota, whom most of the liberals and moderates feared. Pedro accepted the throne of Portugal as King Pedro IV on 10 March 1826, after the regency deemed him the legitimate heir to the throne and sent a delegation to offer him the crown.\n\nIn Brazil, Pedro faced other challenges to his newborn country; the people clearly did not wish to return to colonial status and subservience to the politics and economy of the much smaller kingdom of Portugal. The Brazilian constitution prohibited the Emperor from subsuming another crown; this fact obliged Pedro to choose between Portugal or Brazil. Pedro, a pragmatic politician, tried to find a solution that would reconcile the desires of the liberal, moderate and absolutist elements in the debate, and eventually chose to abdicate as king of Portugal (28 May 1826) in favor of his eldest daughter Princess Maria da Glória, who was seven years old at the time. The abdication was conditional: Portugal should receive a new Constitution, i.e., the 1826 Charter, and his brother Miguel, exiled in Vienna, was to marry the Princess when she came of age. The Constitution was not popular with the absolutists (who wanted Prince Miguel to govern as an absolute monarch), but the liberal \"Vintistas\" also did not support the Charter (which was imposed by the King); moderates bided their time as a counter-revolution was slowly building.\n\nIn 1828, Prince Miguel returned from Austria, becoming Pedro's lieutenant and replacing their sister Princess Isabel Maria, who was ill, as regent. Over the next few months, absolutist politicians, clergymen and supporters of Queen Carlota manipulated political developments and eventually deposed Maria da Glória (who had not yet arrived in Portugal) and proclaimed Miguel King of Portugal. They also annulled the liberal Constitution, persecuted liberals and their supporters, and attempted to obtain international support for their regime. Thousands of liberal idealists were killed, arrested, or forced to flee to Spain, England, the Azores and Brazil. This usurpation was followed by demonstrations in support of absolutism and failed revolutions to reinstate liberalism.\n\nThe sequence of events inevitably triggered the Liberal Wars between the supporters of absolutism, led by Miguel, and those of liberalism. Miguel tried to obtain international support for his cause, but failed due to British pressure, although the United States and Mexico did recognize his authority. Between 1828 and 1834, forces loyal to progressive liberalism battled the power of Miguel's absolute monarchy. A liberal uprising in Porto led by exiles Pedro de Sousa Holstein (later 1st Duke of Palmela), João Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira Daun (later 1st Duke of Saldanha) and António José Severim de Noronha (later Duke of Terceira), was quickly defeated by Miguel's forces while similar revolts in the Azores and Madeira were similarly defeated (the liberal forces were able to hold onto territory only in Terceira).\n\nThe political climate began to change in 1830. Popular opposition to Pedro's reign in the aftermath of the dismissal of several of his ministers during a growing economic crisis forced him to abdicate his throne in Brazil in favor of his son, Pedro II, on 7 April 1831. He then returned to Europe, but found little support from England or France for his quest to regain the throne; instead, he collected arms, money and mercenaries to install his daughter on the throne. He then departed for Terceira in the Azores, from where his government-in-exile organized an expeditionary force that disembarked in Mindelo, not far from Porto, on 8 July 1832.\n\nWith the backing of liberals from Spain and England, and substantial Anglo-French contingents, Pedro landed near Porto, which the Miguelist forces abandoned without combat. After fighting the inconclusive Battle of Ponte Ferreira, Miguelite forces besieged Porto, engaging in sporadic skirmishes. Throughout the year, most of the battles of the Civil War concentrated around Porto, whose population had whole-heartedly supported the liberal cause. In June 1833, the liberals, still encircled at Porto, sent out a force commanded by the Duke of Terceira to Algarve, supported by a naval squadron commanded by Charles Napier, using the alias Carlos de Ponza. The Duke of Terceira landed in Faro and marched north through Alentejo to conquer Lisbon on 24 July 1833. Meanwhile, Napier's squadron encountered the absolutist fleet near Cape Saint Vincent and decisively defeated it at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent.\n\nThe liberals were able to occupy Lisbon, making it possible for them to repel the Miguelite siege in Porto. A stalemate of nine months ensued. Towards the end of 1833, Maria da Glória was proclaimed Queen regnant, and Pedro was made regent. His first act was to confiscate the property of all who had supported Miguel. He also suppressed all religious orders and confiscated their property, an act that suspended friendly relations with the Papal States for nearly eight years, until mid-1841. The liberals occupied Portugal's major cities, Lisbon and Porto, where they commanded a sizable following among the middle classes.\n\nMeanwhile, the absolutists controlled the rural areas, where they were supported by the aristocracy and a peasantry galvanized by the Church. Operations against the Miguelists recommenced in early 1834, and they were defeated at the Battle of Asseiceira. The Miguelite army, however, was still a force (about 18,000 men) to be reckoned with, but on May 24, 1834, at the Concession of Evoramonte, peace was declared under a convention by which Miguel formally consented to renounce all claims to the throne of Portugal, was guaranteed an annual pension, and was banished from Portugal, never to return.

A sitting independent MP and prominent union organiser, Keir Hardie, became its first chairman.\n\nThe party was positioned to the left of Ramsay MacDonald’s Labour Representation Committee, founded in 1900 and soon renamed the Labour Party, to which it was affiliated from 1906 to 1932. In 1947, the organisation's three parliamentary representatives defected to the Labour Party, and the organisation rejoined Labour as Independent Labour Publications in 1975.\n\nAs the nineteenth century came to a close, working-class representation in political office became a great concern for many Britons. Many who sought the election of working men and their advocates to the Parliament of the United Kingdom saw the Liberal Party as the main vehicle for achieving this aim. As early as 1869, a Labour Representation League had been established to register and mobilise working-class voters on behalf of favoured Liberal candidates.\n\nMany trade unions themselves became concerned with gaining parliamentary representation to advance their legislative aims. From the 1870s a series of working-class candidates financially supported by trade unions were accepted and supported by the Liberal Party. The federation of British unions, the Trades Union Congress (TUC), formed its own electoral committee in 1886 to further advance its electoral goals.\n\nMany socialist intellectuals, particularly those influenced by Christian socialism and similar notions of the ethical need for a restructuring of society, also saw the Liberals as the most obvious means for obtaining working-class representation. Within two years of its foundation in 1884, the gradualist Fabian Society officially committed itself to a policy of permeation of the Liberal Party.\n\nA number of so-called \"Lib-Lab\" candidates were subsequently elected Members of Parliament by this alliance of trade unions and radical intellectuals working within the Liberal Party.\n\nThe idea of working with the middle-class Liberal Party to achieve working-class representation in parliament was not universally accepted, however. Marxist socialists, believing in the inevitability of class struggle between the working-class and the capitalist class, rejected the idea of workers making common cause with the petty bourgeois Liberals in exchange for scraps of charity from the legislative table. The orthodox British Marxists established their own party, the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in 1881.\n\nOther socialist intellectuals, despite not sharing the concept of class struggle were nonetheless frustrated with the ideology and institutions of the Liberal Party and the secondary priority which it appeared to give to its working-class candidates. Out of these ideas and activities came a new generation of activists, including Keir Hardie, a Scot who had become convinced of the need for independent labour politics while working as a Gladstonian Liberal and trade union organiser in the Lanarkshire coalfield. Working with SDF members such as Henry Hyde Champion and Tom Mann he was instrumental in the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party in 1888.\n\nIn 1890, the United States imposed a tariff on foreign cloth which led to a general cut in wages throughout the British textile industry. There followed a strike in Bradford, the Manningham Mills strike, which produced as a by-product the Bradford Labour Union, an organisation which sought to function politically independently of either major political party. This initiative was replicated by others in Colne Valley, Huddersfield and Salford. Such developments showed that working-class support for separation from the Liberal Party was growing in strength.\n\nFurther arguments for the formation of a new party were to be found in Robert Blatchford's newspaper \"The Clarion\", founded in 1891, and in \"Workman's Times\", edited by Joseph Burgess. The latter collected some 3,500 names of those in favour of creating a party of labour independent from the existing political organisations.\n\nIn the 1892 General Election, held in July, three working men were elected without support from the Liberals, Keir Hardie in South West Ham, John Burns in Battersea, and Havelock Wilson in Middlesbrough, the last of whom actually faced Liberal opposition. Hardie owed nothing to the Liberal Party for his election, and his critical and confrontational style in Parliament caused him to emerge as a national voice of the labour movement.\n\nAt a TUC meeting in September 1892, a call was issued for a meeting of advocates of an independent labour organisation. An arrangements committee was established and a conference called for the following January. This conference was chaired by William Henry Drew and was held in Bradford 14–16 January 1893. It proved to be the foundation conference of the Independent Labour Party and MP Keir Hardie was elected as its first chairman.\n\nAbout 130 delegates were in attendance at the conference, including in addition to Hardie such socialist and labour worthies as Alderman Ben Tillett, author George Bernard Shaw, and Edward Aveling, son-in-law of Karl Marx. Some 91 local branches of the Independent Labour Party were represented, joined by 11 local Fabian Societies, four branches of the Social Democratic Federation, and individual representatives of a number of other socialist and labour groups. German Socialist leader Edward Bernstein was briefly permitted to address the gathering to pass along the best wishes for success from the Social Democratic Party of Germany.\n\nA proposal was made by a Scottish delegate, George Carson, to name the new organisation the \"Socialist Labour Party\", but this was defeated by a large margin by a counterproposal reaffirming the name \"Independent Labour Party\", moved by the logic that there were large numbers of workers not yet prepared to formally accept the doctrine of socialism who would nonetheless be willing to join and work for an organisation \"established for the purpose of obtaining the independent representation of labour\".\n\nDespite the apparent timidity in naming the organisation, the inaugural conference overwhelmingly accepted that the object of the party should be \"to secure the collective and communal ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange\". The party's programme called for a range of progressive social reforms, including free \"unsectarian\" education \"right up to the universities\", the provision of medical treatment and school feeding programmes for children, housing reform, the establishment of public measures to reduce unemployment and provide aid to the unemployed, a minimum-wage law, welfare programmes for orphans, widows, the elderly, the disabled, and the sick, the abolition of child labour, the abolition of overtime and piecework, and an eight-hour workday.\n\nThe keynote address of the foundation conference was delivered by Keir Hardie, who observed that the Labour Party was \"not an organisation but rather 'the expression of a great principle,' since it 'had neither programme nor constitution\". Hardie emphasised the fundamental demand of the new organisation as being the achievement of economic freedom and called for a party structure which gave full autonomy to every locality, and only seeking to bind these groups \"to such central and general principles as were indispensable to the progress of the movement\".\n\nThe conference also established the basic organisational structure of the new party. Annual Conferences, composed of delegates from each local unit of the organisation, were declared the \"supreme and governing authority of the party\". A Secretary was to be elected, to serve under the direct control of a central body known as the National Administrative Committee (NAC). This NAC was in turn to be made up of regionally appointed delegates who were in theory confined to act according to the instructions given them by branch conferences.\n\nThe new party was founded in a social environment of great hope and expectation. However, the first few years were difficult. The direction of the party, its leadership and organisation were heavily contested and the expected electoral progress did not emerge.\n\nThe party did not fare well in its first major test of national support, the 1895 general election. With the NAC taking a lead in organising the party's contests, and with finance tight just 28 candidates ran under the ILP banner. A special conference decided that support could be given to either ILP or SDF candidates, which brought a further four contests into the picture. None was elected, however, with even the popular party leader Keir Hardie going to defeat in a straight fight with the Conservatives. The electoral debacle of 1895 marked an end to the unbridled optimism which had attended the party's foundation.\n\nFrom its beginning, the ILP was never a homogeneous unit, but rather attempted to act as a \"big tent\" party of the working class, advocating a rather vague and amorphous socialist agenda. Historian Robert E. Dowse has observed:\n\"From the beginning the ILP attempted to influence the trade unions to back a working-class political party: they sought, as Henry Pelling states: 'collaboration with trade unionists with the ultimate object of tapping trade union funds for the attainment of Parliamentary power.' The socialism of the ILP was ideal for achieving this end; lacking as it did any real theoretical basis it could accommodate practically anything a trade unionist was likely to demand. Fervent and emotional, the socialism of the ILP could accommodate, with only a little strain, temperance reform, Scottish nationalism, Methodism, Marxism, Fabian gradualism, and even a variety of Burkean conservatism. Although the mixture was a curious one, it did have the one overwhelming virtue of excluding nobody on dogmatic grounds, a circumstance, on the left and at the time, which cannot be lightly dismissed.\"\n\nOf course in a party of loose and diverse opinions, the essential nature of the organisation and its programme would always remain a matter of debate. Initial decisions about party organisation were rooted in an idea of strict democracy. These arguments did have some impact, as the conference held to set policy prior to the 1895 General Election and the abolition of the position of party \"President\" in 1896 testified to the power of such arguments. Nonetheless, the NAC came to possess considerable power over the party's activities, including hegemonistic control over crucial matters such as electoral decisions and relations with other parties. The electoral defeat of 1895 hastened the establishment of centralising and anti-democratic practices of this kind.\nIn the last years of the 19th century, four figures emerged on the NAC who remained at the centre of the party shaping its direction for the next 20 years. In addition to the beloved party leader Keir Hardie came the Scot Bruce Glasier, elected to the NAC in 1897 and succeeding Hardie as Chairman in 1900; Philip Snowden, an evangelical socialist from the West Riding, and Ramsay MacDonald, whose adhesion to the ILP had been secured in the wake of his disillusionment with the Liberal Party over its rejection of a trade unionist candidate in the 1894 Sheffield Attercliffe by-election. While there were substantial personal tensions between the four, they shared a fundamental view that the party should seek alliance with the unions and rather than an ideology-based socialist unity with the Marxist Social Democratic Federation.\n\nFollowing the failure of 1895, this leadership became reluctant to overextend the party by running in too many electoral races. By 1898 the decision was formally made to restrict electoral contests to those where a reasonable performance could be expected rather than putting forward as many candidates as possible to maximise exposure for the party and to accumulate a maximum total vote.\n\nThe relationship with the trade unions was also problematic. In the 1890s the ILP was lacking in alliances with the trade union organisations. Individual rank and file trade unionists could be persuaded to join the party out of a political commitment shaped by their industrial experiences, but connection with top leaderships was lacking.\n\nThe ILP played a central role in the formation of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900, and when the Labour Party was formed in 1906, the ILP immediately affiliated to it. This affiliation allowed the ILP to continue to hold its own conferences and devise its own policies, which ILP members were expected to argue for within the Labour Party. In return, the ILP provided a good part of Labour's activist base during its early years.\n\nThe emergence and growth of the Labour Party, a federation of trade unions with the socialist intellectuals of the ILP, helped its constituent parts develop and grow. In contrast to the doctrinaire Marxism of the SDF and its even more orthodox offshoots like the Socialist Labour Party and the Socialist Party of Great Britain, the ILP had a loose and inspirational flavour that made it relatively more easy to attract newcomers. Victor Grayson recalled a 1906 campaign in the Colne Valley which he was proud to have conducted \"like a religious revival,\" without reference to specific political problems. Future party chairman Fenner Brockway later recounted the revivalist mood of the gatherings of his local ILP branch gathering in 1907:\n\"On Sunday nights a meeting was conducted rather on the lines of the Labour Church Movement—we had a small voluntary orchestra, sang Labour songs and the speeches were mostly Socialist evangelism, emotion in denunciation of injustice, visionary in their anticipation of a new society.\"\n\nWhile this inspirational presentation of socialism as a humanitarian necessity made the party accessible as a sort of secular religion or a means for the practical implementation of Christian principles in daily life, it bore with it the great weakness of being non-analytical and thus comparatively shallow. As the historian John Callaghan has noted, in the hands of Hardie, Glasier, Snowden and MacDonald socialism was little more than \"a vague protest against injustice.\" However, in 1909 the ILP laid the basis for the production of agitational material with the establishment of the National Labour Press.\n\nStill, the relationship between the ILP and the Labour Party was characterised by conflict. Many ILP members viewed the Labour Party as being too timid and moderate in their attempts at social reform, detached as it was from the socialist objective during its first years. Consequently, in 1912 came a split in which many ILP branches and a few leading figures, including Leonard Hall and Russell Smart, chose to amalgamate with the SDF of H. M. Hyndman in 1912 to found the British Socialist Party.\n\nUntil 1918, individuals could only join the Labour Party through an affiliated body, the most significant of which were the Fabian Society and the ILP. As a result, particularly from 1914, many individuals - particularly ones formerly active in the Liberal Party - joined the ILP, in order to become active in the Labour Party. While affiliated body membership was not required after 1918, the presence of MacDonald and other leading Labour Party figures in the ILP's leadership meant many converts to the Labour Party continued to join through the ILP, a process which continued until about 1925.\n\nOn 11 April 1914 the party celebrated its 21st anniversary with a congress in Bradford. The party had grown well in the previous decade, standing with a membership of approximately 30,000. The rank and file membership of the party as well as its leadership were pacifist, now as ever, having held from the beginning that war was \"sinful\".\n\nThe guns of August 1914 shook every left organisation in Britain. As one observer later put it: \"Hyndman and Cunningham Graham, Thorne and Clynes had sought peace while it endured, but now that war had come, well, Socialists and Trade Unionists, like other people had got to see it through.\" With respect to the Labour Party, most of the members of the organisation's executive as well as most of the 40 Labour MPs in Parliament lent their support to the recruiting campaign for the Great War. Only one section held aloof—the Independent Labour Party.\n\nThe ILP's insistence on standing by its long-held ethically based objections to militarism and war proved costly both in terms of its standing in the eyes of the general public as well as its ability to hold sway over the politicians who ran under its banner. A stream of its old Members of Parliament left the party over the ILP's refusal to support the British war effort. Among those breaking ranks were George Nicoll Barnes, J. R. Clynes, James Parker, George Wardle and G. H. Roberts.\n\nOthers held true to the party and its principles. Ramsay MacDonald, a committed pacifist, immediately resigned the chairmanship of the Labour Party in the House of Commons. Keir Hardie, Philip Snowden, W. C. Anderson, and a small group of like-minded radical pacifists, maintained an unflinching opposition to the government and its pro-war Labour allies. The 1917 Russian Revolution Conference in Leeds called for \"the complete independence of Ireland, India and Egypt\".\n\nDuring the war the ILP's criticism of militarism was somewhat muted by public condemnation and periodic episodes of physical violence, which included a wild scene on 6 July 1918, during which an agitated group of discharged soldiers rushed an ILP meeting being addressed by Ramsay MacDonald in the Abbey Wood section of London. Stewards at the door of the ILP meeting were overpowered by the mob, who in what was described as a \"riotous scene\" broke chairs and wielded their parts as weapons, seizing the auditorium and dispersing the socialists into the night.\n\nFollowing the termination of World War I in November 1918, the Second International was effectively relaunched and the question of whether the ILP should affiliate with this renewed Second International or with some other international grouping loomed large. The majority of ILP members saw the old Second International as hopelessly compromised by its support for the European bloodbath of 1914, and the ILP formally disaffiliated from the International in the spring of 1920. In January 1919, Moscow issued a call for the formation of a new Third International, a formation which held great appeal to a small section of the ILP's most radical members,\nincluding economist Emile Burns, journalist R. Palme Dutt, and the future Member of Parliament Shapurji Saklatvala, along with Charles Barber, Ernest H. Brown, Helen Crawfurd, C. H. Norman, and J. Wilson. They called themselves the Left Wing Group of the ILP. \n\nThe conservative leadership of the ILP, notably Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden, strongly opposed affiliation to the new Comintern. In opposition to them the radical wing of the ILP organised itself as a formal faction called the Left Wing Group of the ILP in an effort to move the ILP into the Communist International. The faction began to produce its own bi-weekly newspaper called \"The International\", a four-page broadsheet published in Glasgow, and sent greetings to the conference which established a Communist Party of Great Britain, although they did not attend.\n\nIn addition to cutting its ties with the Second International, the 1920 Annual Conference of the ILP directed its executive to contact the Swiss Socialist Party with a view to establishing an all-inclusive international which would join the internationalist left-wing socialist parties with their revolutionary socialist brethren of the new Moscow international. In a letter dated 21 May 1920, ILP chairman Richard Wallhead and National Council member Clifford Allen asked a further set of questions of the Comintern. The Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) was asked for its positions on such matters as demands for rigid adherence to its program, applicability of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Soviet system to Great Britain, and its view on the necessity of armed force as a universal principle.\n\nIn July 1920 the fledgling Comintern gave an unequivocal reply: while the presence of communists inside the organisation was acknowledged, and their membership in a new Communist Party welcomed, there would be no joint organisation with those like \"the Fabians, Ramsay MacDonald, and Snowden\" who had previously made use of \"the musty atmosphere of parliamentary work\" and \"petty concessions and compromises\" on behalf of the labour movement:\n[T]hese leaders have lost touch with the wide unskilled masses, with the toiling poor, they have become oblivious of the growth of capitalist exploitation and of the revolutionary aims of the proletariat. It seemed to them that because the capitalists treated them as equals, as partners in their transactions, the working class had secured equal rights with capital. Their own social standing secure and material position improved, they looked upon the world through the rose-coloured spectacles of a peaceful middle-class life. Disturbed in their peaceful trading with the representatives of the bourgeoisie by the revolutionary strivings of the proletariat they were the convinced enemies of the revolutionary aims of the proletariat.\n\nThe ECCI instead made its appeal directly to \"the communists of the Independent Labour Party\", noting that \"the revolutionary forces of England are split up\" and urging them to unite with communist members of the British Socialist Party, the Socialist Labour Party, and radical groups in Wales and Scotland. \"The emancipation of the British working class and of the working class of the whole world depends upon the Communist elements of England forming a single Communist Party\", the ECCI declared.\n\nThe agitation for affiliation to the Third International of Moscow came to a head in 1921 at the annual conference of the ILP. There an overwhelming vote of the party's branches voted not to affiliate with the Third International. This decision was followed by the exit of the defeated radical faction, which immediately joined the CPGB.\n\nThe \"centrism\" of the ILP, caught between the reformist politics of the Second International and the revolutionary politics of the Third International, led it to leading a number of other European socialist groups into the \"Second and a Half International\" between 1921 and 1923. The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1933.\n\nAt the 1922 general election several ILP members became MPs (including future ILP leader James Maxton) and the party grew in stature. The ILP provided many of the new Labour MPs, including John Wheatley, Emanuel Shinwell, Tom Johnston and David Kirkwood. However, the first Labour government, returned to office in 1924, proved to be hugely disappointing to the ILP. This came despite 30% of the cabinet holding ILP membership; of the most prominent of these figures, Ramsay MacDonald was removed as editor of the ILP's \"Socialist Review\" in 1925, and Philip Snowden resigned from the ILP in 1927.\n\nThe ILP's response to the first Labour government was to devise its own programme for government. Throughout 1928, the ILP developed a \"Socialism in Our Time\" platform, largely formulated by H. N. Brailsford, John A. Hobson and Frank Wise. The programme consisted of eight policies:\n\nOf these eight policies, the living wage, the unemployment allowance, nationalisation of banking and the bulk purchase of raw materials and foodstuffs were the chief concern of the ILP. Increasing the unemployment allowance and switching to bulk purchasing were to be done in the conventional way, but the method of paying the living wage differed from Labour practices. The ILP criticised the \"Continental\" method of paying wage allowances from employers' pools, which had been implemented in 1924 by Rhys Davies. The ILP proposed to redistribute the national income, meeting the cost of the allowances by taxing high income earners.\n\nThe nationalisation of banking involved more significant changes to economic policy, and had nothing in common with Labour practices. The ILP proposed that once a Labour government took office it should hold an enquiry into the banking system that would prepare a detailed scheme for transferring the Bank of England to public control, revise the operation of the Bank Acts and ensure that \"control of credit is exercised in the national interest and not in the interest of powerful financial groups\" by making creditors shift entirely to cheques and possibly getting rid of gold reserves, thus ending the policy of deflation practised by the Treasury and the Bank of England.\n\nThe Labour leadership did not support the programme. In particular, MacDonald objected to the slogan \"Socialism In Our Time\", as he viewed socialism as a gradual process. For the duration of the second Labour government (1929–31), 37 Labour MPs were sponsored by the ILP, but none were appointed to the cabinet. Instead, the group provided the left opposition to the Labour leadership. The 1930 ILP conference decided that where their policies diverged from the Labour Party their MPs should break the whip to support the ILP policy.\n\nIt was becoming clearer that the ILP was diverging further away from the Labour Party and at the 1931 ILP Scottish Conference the issue of whether the party should still affiliate to Labour was discussed. It was decided to continue to do so, but only after Maxton himself intervened in the debate.\n\nAt the 1931 general election the ILP candidates refused to accept the standing orders of the Parliamentary Labour Party and stood without Labour Party support. Five ILP members were returned to Westminster and created an ILP group outside the Labour Party. In 1932 a special conference of the ILP voted to disaffiliate from Labour. The same year the ILP co-founded the London Bureau of left-socialist parties, later called the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre or \"Three-and-a-Half International\", administered by the ILP and chaired by its leader, Fenner Brockway, for most of its existence.\n\nThe Labour left-winger Aneurin Bevan described the ILP's disaffiliation as a decision to remain \"pure, but impotent\". Outside the Labour Party the ILP went into decline. In just three years it lost 75% of its members, the total falling from 16,773 in 1932 to 4,392 in 1935, as it lost adherents to the Labour Party, the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and the Trotskyists. Some members of the ILP who had chosen to remain within the Labour Party were instrumental in creating the Socialist League, while the majority of Scottish members left to form the Scottish Socialist Party and members in Northern Ireland left \"en masse\" to form the Socialist Party of Northern Ireland. In 1934 a breakaway group in the Northwest of England left to form the Independent Socialist Party.\n\nThe remaining ILP membership tended to be young and radical. They were particularly active in supporting the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, and around twenty-five members and sympathisers, including George Orwell, went to Spain as members of an ILP Contingent of volunteers to assist the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a sister party to the ILP in the Three-and-a-Half International.\n\nFrom the mid-1930s onwards the ILP also attracted the attention of the Trotskyist movement, and various Trotskyist groups worked within it, notably the Marxist Group, of which C. L. R. James, Denzil Dean Harber and Ted Grant were members. There was also a group of ILP members, the Revolutionary Policy Committee, who were sympathetic to the CPGB and eventually left to join that party. From the late 1930s the ILP had the support of several key figures in the tiny Pan-Africanist movement in Britain, including George Padmore and Chris Braithwaite, as well as left-wing writers such as George Orwell, Reginald Reynolds and Ethel Mannin.\n\nIn 1939 the ILP wrote to the Labour Party requesting reaffiliation subject to a right to advocate its own policies where it had a \"conscientious objection\" to Labour policy. Labour refused to agree to this condition, stating that its usual rules for affiliation could not be waived for the ILP.\n\nAs in 1914 the ILP opposed World War II on ethical grounds and turned to the left. One aspect of its leftist policies in this period was that it opposed the war-time truce between the major parties and actively contested Parliamentary elections. In one such contest, the Cardiff East by-election in 1942, this was with the result that Fenner Brockway, the ILP candidate, found himself opposed by a Conservative candidate for whom the local Communist Party actively campaigned.\n\nThe ILP still had some significant strength at the end of the war, but it went into crisis shortly afterwards. At the 1945 general election it retained three MPs, all in Glasgow, although only one of them had a Labour opponent. Its conference rejected calls to reaffiliate to the Labour Party. A major blow came in 1946 when the party's best known public spokesman, James Maxton MP, died. The ILP narrowly held his seat in the Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1946 (against a Labour opponent). However, all its MPs defected to Labour at various stages in 1947, and the party was roundly defeated at the Glasgow Camlachie by-election, 1948, in a seat it had won easily only three years earlier. The party was never again able to win a significant vote in a parliamentary election.\n\nDespite these blows, the ILP continued. Throughout the 1950s and into the early 1960s it pioneered opposition to nuclear weapons and sought to publicise ideas such as workers' control. It also maintained links with the remnants of its fraternal groups, such as the POUM, who were in exile, as well as campaigning for decolonisation.\n\nIn the 1970s the ILP reassessed its views on the Labour Party, and in 1975 it renamed itself Independent Labour Publications and became a pressure group inside Labour.\n\n\n\n"}

It can be used to eavesdrop with minimal chance of exposure.\n\nThe object is typically inside a room where a conversation is taking place and can be anything that can vibrate (for example, a picture on a wall) in response to the pressure waves created by noises present in the room. The object preferably has a smooth surface. The laser beam is directed into the room through a window, reflects off the object, and returns to a receiver that converts the beam to an audio signal. The beam may also be bounced off the window itself. The minute differences in the distance traveled by the light as it reflects from the vibrating object are detected interferometrically. The interferometer converts the variations to intensity variations, and electronics are used to convert these variations to signals that can be converted back to sound.\n\nThe technique of using a light beam to remotely record sound probably originated with Léon Theremin in the Soviet Union at or before 1947, when he developed and used the \"Buran\" eavesdropping system. This worked by using a low power infrared beam (not a laser) from a distance to detect the sound vibrations in the glass windows. Lavrentiy Beria, head of the KGB, had used this Buran device to spy on the U.S., British, and French embassies in Moscow.\n\nOn 25 August 2009, was issued for a device that uses a laser beam and smoke or vapor to detect sound vibrations in free air (\"Particulate Flow Detection Microphone based on a laser-photocell pair with a moving stream of smoke or vapor in the laser beam's path\"). Sound pressure waves cause disturbances in the smoke that in turn cause variations in the amount of laser light reaching the photo detector. A prototype of the device was demonstrated at the 127th Audio Engineering Society convention in New York City from 9 through 12 October 2009.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36667216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36667216", "title": "Length extension attack", "text": "Length extension attack\n\nIn cryptography and computer security, a length extension attack is a type of attack where an attacker can use Hash(\"message\") and the length of \"message\" to calculate Hash(\"message\" ‖ \"message\") for an attacker-controlled \"message\". Algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 that are based on the Merkle–Damgård construction are susceptible to this kind of attack. The SHA-3 algorithm is not susceptible. \n\nWhen a Merkle–Damgård based hash is misused as a message authentication code with construction H(\"secret\" ‖ \"message\"), and \"message\" and the length of \"secret\" is known, a length extension attack allows anyone to include extra information at the end of the message and produce a valid hash without knowing the secret. Note that since HMAC doesn't use this construction, HMAC hashes are not prone to length extension attacks. \n\nThe vulnerable hashing functions work by taking the input message, and using it to transform an internal state. After all of the input has been processed, the hash digest is generated by outputting the internal state of the function. It is possible to reconstruct the internal state from the hash digest, which can then be used to process the new data. In this way one may extend the message and compute the hash that is a valid signature for the new message.\n\nA server for delivering waffles of a specified type to a specific user at a location could be implemented to handle requests of the given format:\n\nThe server would perform the request given (to deliver ten waffles of type eggo to the given location for user 1) only if the signature is valid for the user. The signature used here is a MAC, signed with a key not known to the attacker. (This example is also vulnerable to a replay attack, by sending the same request and signature a second time.)\n\nIt is possible for an attacker to modify the request, in this example switching the requested waffle from \"eggo\" to \"liege.\" This can be done by taking advantage of a flexibility in the message format if duplicate content in the query string gives preference to the latter value. This flexibility does not indicate an exploit in the message format, because the message format was never designed to be cryptographically secure in the first place, without the signature algorithm to help it.\n\nIn order to sign this new message, typically the attacker would need to know the key the message was signed with, and generate a new signature by generating a new MAC. However, with a length extension attack, it is possible to feed the hash (the signature given above) into the state of the hashing function, and continue where the original request had left off, so long as you know the length of the original request. In this request, the original key's length was 14 bytes, which could be determined by trying forged requests with various assumed lengths, and checking which length results in a request that the server accepts as valid.\n\nThe message as fed into the hashing function is often padded, as many algorithms can only work on input messages whose lengths are a multiple of some given size. The content of this padding is always specified by the hash function used. The attacker must include all of these padding bits in their forged message before the internal states of their message and the original will line up. Thus, the attacker constructs a slightly different message using these padding rules:\n\nThis message includes all of the padding that was appended to the original message inside of the hash function before their payload (in this case, a 0x80 followed by a number of 0x00s and a message length, 0x228 = 552 = (14+55)*8, which is the length of the key plus the original message, appended at the end). The attacker knows that the state behind the hashed key/message pair for the original message is identical to that of new message up to the final \"&.\" The attacker also knows the hash digest at this point, which means they know the internal state of the hashing function at that point.

It was awarded by a panel appointed by the Soviet government, to notable individuals whom the panel indicated had \"strengthened peace among comrades\". It was founded as the International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples, but was renamed the International Lenin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples (, \"Mezhdunarodnaya Leninskaya premiya «za ukrepleniye mira mezhdu narodami»\" ) as a result of de-Stalinization. Unlike the Nobel Prize, the Lenin Peace Prize was usually awarded to several people a year rather than to just one individual. The prize was mainly awarded to prominent Communists and supporters of the Soviet Union who were not Soviet citizens. Notable recipients include: W. E. B. Du Bois, Fidel Castro, Salvador Allende, Mikis Theodorakis, Sean MacBride, Angela Davis, Pablo Picasso, Oscar Niemeyer, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Abdul Sattar Edhi and Nelson Mandela.\n\nThe prize was created as the International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples on December 21, 1949 by \"executive order\" of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in honor of Joseph Stalin's seventieth birthday (although this was after his seventy-first).\n\nFollowing Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956 during the Twentieth Party Congress, the prize was renamed on September 6 as the International Lenin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples. All previous recipients were asked to return their Stalin Prizes so they could be replaced by the renamed Lenin Prize. By a decision of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of December 11, 1989, the prize was renamed the International Lenin Peace Prize. Two years later, after the collapse of USSR in 1991, the Russian government, as the successor state to the defunct Soviet Union, ended the award program. The Lenin Peace Prize is regarded as a counterpart to the existing Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe International Lenin Prize should not be confused with the International Peace Prize, awarded by the World Peace Council. In 1941 the Soviet Union created the Stalin Prize (later renamed the \"USSR State Prize\"), which was awarded annually to accomplished Soviet writers, composers, artists and scientists.\n\n\n"}

It has an estimated 550 to 850 members.\n\nThe NLFT seeks to secede from India and establish an independent Tripuri state, and is an active participant in the Insurgency in Northeast India. The NLFT manifesto says that they want to expand what they describe as the Kingdom of God and Jesus Christ in Tripura.\n\nThe NLFT is currently designated as a terrorist organisation in India.\n\nThe Baptist Church of Tripura was initially set up by missionaries from New Zealand in the 1940s. Despite their efforts, even until the 1980s, only a few thousand people in Tripura had converted to Christianity. In the aftermath of one of the worst ethnic riots, the NLFT was born in 1989 with the backing of the Baptist Church of Tripura. Since then, the NLFT has been advancing its cause through armed rebellion. In its constitution, the organisation claims to represent the indigenous population which it claims has been marginalised by \"the subjugation policy of imperialist Hindustani (India)\"; its constitution makes no mention of any specific religion and claims to extend membership to \"any person irrespective of caste, sex or creed\".\n\nThe NLFT has been described as engaging in terrorist violence motivated by their Christian beliefs. The NLFT is listed as a terrorist organisation in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002. The state government contends that the Baptist Church of Tripura supplies arms and gives financial support to the NLFT. In April 2000, according to the state government, the secretary of the Noapara Baptist Church in Tripura, Nagmanlal Halam, was arrested with explosives and confessed that for two years he had been buying explosives for the NLFT. In 2000, the NLFT threatened to kill Hindus celebrating the religious festival of Durga Puja. At least 20 Hindus in Tripura have been killed by the NLFT in two years for resisting forced conversion to Christianity. A leader of the Jamatia tribe, Rampada Jamatia, said that armed NLFT militants were forcibly converting tribal villagers to Christianity, which he said was a serious threat to Hinduism. It is believed that as many as 5,000 tribal villagers were forcibly converted from 1999 to 2001. These forcible conversions to Christianity, sometimes including the use of \"rape as a means of intimidation,\" were noted by academics outside of India in 2007.\n\nIn early 2000, 16 Bengali Hindus were killed by the NLFT at Gourangatilla. On 20 May 2000, the NLFT killed 25 Bengali Hindus at the Bagber refugee camp. In August 2000, a tribal Hindu spiritual leader, Shanti Kali, was shot dead by about ten NLFT guerrillas who said it wanted to convert all people in the state to Christianity. In December 2000, Labh Kumar Jamatia, a religious leader of the state's second largest Hindu group, was kidnapped by the NLFT, and found dead in a forest in Dalak village in southern Tripura. According to police, rebels from the NLFT wanted Jamatia to convert to Christianity, but he refused. A local Marxist tribal leader, Kishore Debbarma, was clubbed to death in Tripura's Sadar by militants from the Biswamohan faction of the NLFT in May 2005.\n\nIn 2001, there were 826 reported terrorist attacks in Tripura, in which 405 people lost their lives and 481 kidnappings were made by the NLFT and related organisations such as the Christian All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTP). Nagmanlal Halam, secretary of the Noapara Baptist Church in Tripura, was arrested for and confessed, under torture from police, to providing munitions and financial aid to the NLFT from 1998 until 2000. \n\nThe BBC reported in 2005 that independent investigations as well as confessions from surrendered members showed that the NLFT had been making and selling pornography to finance their activities. This includes DVDs of pornographic films made by the group with tribal men and women kidnapped and forced to participate in sex acts while being filmed. The movies are dubbed into various languages and sold illegally throughout the region for a profit. Statements from former members and one report state that the NLFT has a history of sexually abusing tribal women.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Conflict Management, approximately 90% of the NLFT's administration are Christians.\n\nIn the wake of the expulsion of Biswamohan Debbarma and Nayanbasi Jamatiya, the NLFT divided into two factions in February 2001. \n\nCited causes of internal conflicts include the \nreluctance of Biswamohan Debbarma's Central Executive Committee to nominate Joshua Debbarma as the King of ‘Tripura Kingdom’; misappropriation of funds by senior leaders; lavish lifestyles led by the senior leadership; and forcible conversion of tribal cadres/civilians to Christianity.\n\nOther leaders of the original NLFT included ‘Vice President’ Kamini Debbarma, ‘Publicity Secretary’ Binoy Debbarma, ‘Chief of Army’ Dhanu Koloi, and ‘Finance Secretary’ Bishnu Prasad Jamatiya.\n\nThe Biswamohan faction (NLFT/BM) is currently headed by Biswamohan Debbarma.\n\nUpon the surrender of Mantu Koloi, second in command, he requested that Biswamohan Debbarma and Ranjit Debbarma engage in talks with the Government of India to resolve the crisis, but both leaders vowed to fight on.\n\nThe Nayanbasi faction (NLFT/NB) was led by Nayanbasi Jamatiya until 2004, when it peacefully entered into a Memorandum of Settlement with India.\n\n"}

He is a noted opponent of the European Union and a donor of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). He previously supported the Conservative Party, but left because of the party's support of the Maastricht Treaty.\n\nBorn in Barnsley, Sykes was the son of a miner and left school with no qualifications. He had various manual jobs before setting up a business at the age of 18 to dismantle old buses and sell the engines for fishing junks to the Far East. He later moved into bus, coach and truck dealing in the North. Sykes then moved into Property, developing industrial, office and warehouse properties first in London Docklands and then in the North including Wakefield, Salford, Leeds, Rotherham and ultimately founded the Meadowhall shopping complex in Sheffield, which was at the time was Britain's largest ever retail shopping mall. In 1999 Sykes sold Meadow Hall for £1.17 billion. His internet firm Planet Online was for a time Britain's largest internet service provider. In 1998 Sykes sold it for £85 million to Energis.\n\nIn 2015, his wealth was estimated at some £690 million.\n\nSykes started in politics in 1975, and was chairman of Barnsley Conservative Party. he served on the Yorkshire Conservative Regional Council for many years, when the Conservative Party was led by Margaret Thatcher.\n\nSykes left the Conservative Party in 1991 in a dispute with John Major over the Maastricht Treaty. Sykes is estimated to have donated £8 million opposing the Euro and to Eurosceptic campaigns.\n\nIn the 1997 general election he selectively funded eurosceptic Conservative candidates, and in 1998 pledged to \"use every means possible\" to persuade British voters to say no in a referendum on the single currency, saying he would \"raise hellfire to get the message across\". The following year he began making large donations to the cross-party Democracy Movement, founded by Lady Annabel Goldsmith as a successor to the Referendum Party. He also donated £500,000 to Denmark's successful anti-euro campaign and £65,000 to the successful Irish No to the Lisbon Treaty campaign.\n\nIn 2000, Sykes supported the Conservative Party, led at the time by William Hague, but left the party because of a disagreement on not ruling out, joining the Euro.\n\nSykes is a vehement opponent of the European Union and is noted for his belief that it represents an undemocratic, bureaucratic, super state in the making.\n\nSykes then donated almost £1,500,000 to UKIP for advertising during the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, making him the primary source of funding for the party. He subsequently admitted that UKIP's fourfold increase in seats at the election was a result of the party having \"more loot\" than the others. When Robert Kilroy-Silk, elected as one of UKIP's Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), criticised the leadership of Roger Knapman and expressed an interest in replacing him, Sykes announced his intention to cease funding of UKIP and appeared with Kilroy-Silk in a television interview to discuss the party and its leadership and made it clear that he would not support Kilroy-Silk.\n\nOn 17 November 2013, Sykes announced that he would do \"whatever it takes\" to help make the UK Independence Party (UKIP) be successful in the 2014 European Parliament elections. Sykes planned with Nigel Farage, a poster, leaflet and technology campaign across Britain costing Sykes £1.650,000 UKIP won the UK European Elections, electing 24 MEP's, which amounted to over 4 million votes, which was the first time in 100 years that an outside party had won a British Election. With the General Election approaching in 2015, the conservatives under David Cameron decided to give a national Referendum on the membership of the European Union.\n\nIn 2016, Sykes and Farage planned a nationwide poster and technology campaign, costing around £1,800,000, campaigning to Leave the European Union.\n\nAfter treatment for the disease at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore in 2000, he funded the construction of a specialist prostate cancer unit at St James's University Hospital, Leeds. Sykes donated over £1m to the restoration of the Royal Hall in Harrogate. He funded Sir Ranulph Fiennes' expeditions on the Eiger for the British Heart Foundation, as well as the Everest Challenge and Marathon des Sables for Marie Curie Cancer Care raising millions for the charity.\n\nSykes now spends most of his time on environmental issues including work with Durrell wildlife conservation trust which is an international body dealing with endangered species. He also has an interest in preventing deforestation.\n\nSykes met and married Valeria when he was 24; they are currently divorced after 44 years of marriage. Sykes has vowed not to leave any of his fortune to his children, except for buying them houses, to encourage them to make their own way in the world.\n\nSykes lived in a property just outside Ripon, North Yorkshire.\n"}
{"id": "23203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23203", "title": "Propaganda", "text": "Propaganda\n\nPropaganda is information that is not objective and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented. Propaganda is often associated with material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies, religious organizations and the media can also produce propaganda. \n\nIn the twentieth century, the term propaganda has often been associated with a manipulative approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term.\n\nA wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages, which changed as new technologies were invented, including paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio shows, TV shows, and websites. Propaganda is now moving into a digital age utillizing bots, algorithms, to create computational propaganda and spread fake or biased news using social media. \n\nIn a 1929 literary debate with Edward Bernays, Everett Dean Martin argues that, \"Propaganda is making puppets of us. We are moved by hidden strings which the propagandist manipulates.\"\n\n\"Propaganda\" is a modern Latin word, the gerundive form of \"propagare\", meaning \"to spread\" or \"to propagate\", thus \"propaganda\" means \"that which is to be propagated\". Originally this word derived from a new administrative body of the Catholic church (congregation) created in 1622, called the \"Congregatio de Propaganda Fide\" (\"Congregation for Propagating the Faith\"), or informally simply \"Propaganda\". Its activity was aimed at \"propagating\" the Catholic faith in non-Catholic countries.\n\nFrom the 1790s, the term began being used also to refer to \"propaganda\" in secular activities. The term began taking a pejorative or negative connotation in the mid-19th century, when it was used in the political sphere.\n\nPrimitive forms of propaganda have been a human activity as far back as reliable recorded evidence exists. The Behistun Inscription (c. 515 BC) detailing the rise of Darius I to the Persian throne is viewed by most historians as an early example of propaganda. \nAnother striking example of propaganda during Ancient History is the last Roman civil wars (44-30 BC) during which Octavian and Mark Antony blame each other for obscure and degrading origins, cruelty, cowardice, oratorical and literary incompetence, debaucheries, luxury, drunkenness and other slanders. This defamation took the form of \"uituperatio\" (Roman rhetorical genre of the invective) which was decisive for shaping the Roman public opinion at this time.\n\nPropaganda during the Reformation, helped by the spread of the printing press throughout Europe, and in particular within Germany, caused new ideas, thoughts, and doctrine to be made available to the public in ways that had never been seen before the 16th century. During the era of the American Revolution, the American colonies had a flourishing network of newspapers and printers who specialized in the topic on behalf of the Patriots (and to a lesser extent on behalf of the Loyalists).\nThe first large-scale and organised propagation of government propaganda was occasioned by the outbreak of war in 1914. After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, military officials such as Erich Ludendorff suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. Adolf Hitler came to echo this view, believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in 1918 (see also: Dolchstoßlegende). In \"Mein Kampf\" (1925) Hitler expounded his theory of propaganda, which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in 1933. Historian Robert Ensor explains that \"Hitler...puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda; people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny.\" Most propaganda in Nazi Germany was produced by the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda under Joseph Goebbels. World War II saw continued use of propaganda as a weapon of war, building on the experience of WWI, by Goebbels and the British Political Warfare Executive, as well as the United States Office of War Information.\nIn the early 20th century, the invention of motion pictures gave propaganda-creators a powerful tool for advancing political and military interests when it came to reaching a broad segment of the population and creating consent or encouraging rejection of the real or imagined enemy. In the years following the October Revolution of 1917, the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films (e.g. the 1925 film \"The Battleship Potemkin\" glorifies Communist ideals.) In WWII, Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the Sudetenland and attacking Poland. The 1930s and 1940s, which saw the rise of totalitarian states and the Second World War, are arguably the \"Golden Age of Propaganda\". Leni Riefenstahl, a filmmaker working in Nazi Germany, created one of the best-known propaganda movies, \"Triumph of the Will\". In the US, animation became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U.S. war effort, e.g.,\"Der Fuehrer's Face\" (1942), which ridicules Hitler and advocates the value of freedom. US war films in the early 1940s were designed to create a patriotic mindset and convince viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the Axis Powers. Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film \"Calling mr. Smith\" (1943) about current nazi crimes in occupied Europe and about lies of nazi propaganda.\n\nThe West and the Soviet Union both used propaganda extensively during the Cold War. Both sides used film, television, and radio programming to influence their own citizens, each other, and Third World nations. George Orwell's novels \"Animal Farm\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" are virtual textbooks on the use of propaganda. During the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro stressed the importance of propaganda. Propaganda was used extensively by Communist forces in the Vietnam War as means of controlling people's opinions.\n\nDuring the Yugoslav wars, propaganda was used as a military strategy by governments of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia. Propaganda was used to create fear and hatred, and particularly incite the Serb population against the other ethnicities (Bosniaks, Croats, Albanians and other non-Serbs). Serb media made a great effort in justifying, revising or denying mass war crimes committed by Serb forces during these wars.\n\nIn the early 20th century the term propaganda was used by the founders of the nascent public relations industry to refer to their people. Literally translated from the Latin gerundive as \"things that must be disseminated\", in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. The connotations of the term \"propaganda\" can also vary over time. For example, in Portuguese and some Spanish language speaking countries, particularly in the Southern Cone, the word \"propaganda\" usually refers to the most common manipulative media – \"advertising\".\nIn English, \"propaganda\" was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause. During the 20th century, however, the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries, representing the intentional dissemination of often false, but certainly \"compelling\" claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies. According to Harold Lasswell, the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the Creel Committee in the United States and the Ministry of Information in Britain: Writing in 1928, Lasswell observed, \"In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm, for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends. The outcry in the United States against Mr. Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information (or 'Inflammation') helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed. … The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it. Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate, and the propagandists have sought protective coloration in such names as 'public relations council,' 'specialist in public education,' 'public relations adviser.' \" In 1949, political science professor Dayton David McKean wrote, \"After World War I the word came to be applied to 'what you don’t like of the other fellow’s publicity,' as Edward L. Bernays said...\"\n\nThe term is essentially contested and some have argued for a neutral definition arguing that ethics depend on intent and context, others define it as necessarily unethical and negative. Dr Emma Briant defines it as \"the deliberate manipulation of representations (including text, pictures, video, speech etc.) with the intention of producing any effect in the audience (e.g. action or inaction; reinforcement or transformation of feelings, ideas, attitudes or behaviours) that is desired by the propagandist.\n\nIdentifying propaganda has always been a problem. The main difficulties have involved differentiating propaganda from other types of persuasion, and avoiding a biased approach. Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term: \"Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for ideological, political or commercial purposes through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels.\" The definition focuses on the communicative process involved – or more precisely, on the purpose of the process, and allow \"propaganda\" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener. \nAccording to historian Zbyněk Zeman, propaganda is defined as either white, grey or black. White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent. Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent. Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins (compare with black operation, a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden). In scale, these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda. For example, opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source. Opposition to grey propaganda, when revealed (often by an inside source), may create some level of public outcry. Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal, because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported.\n\nThe propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group. Propaganda, in this sense, serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved, not by filling people's minds with approved information, but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view. What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding. The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue, but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda.\n\nPropaganda was often used to influence opinions and beliefs on religious issues, particularly during the split between the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches.\n\nMore in line with the religious roots of the term, propaganda is also used widely in the debates about new religious movements (NRMs), both by people who defend them and by people who oppose them. The latter pejoratively call these NRMs cults. Anti-cult activists and Christian countercult activists accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them. Some social scientists, such as the late Jeffrey Hadden, and CESNUR affiliated scholars accuse ex-members of \"cults\" and the anti-cult movement of making these unusual religious movements look bad without sufficient reasons.\n\nPost–World War II usage of the word \"propaganda\" more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas.\n\nPropaganda is a powerful weapon in war; it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy, either internal or external, by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens. This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms (e.g., the racist terms \"Jap\" and \"gook\" used during World War II and the Vietnam War, respectively), avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities. Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice, which may be fictitious or may be based on facts (e.g., the sinking of the passenger ship RMS Lusitania by the German Navy in World War I). The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just. In NATO doctrine, propaganda is defined as \"Any information, ideas, doctrines, or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion, emotions, attitudes, or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly.\" Within this perspective, information provided does not need to be necessarily false, but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the \"actor\" or \"system\" that performs it.\n\nPropaganda is also one of the methods used in psychological warfare, which may also involve false flag operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation (e.g., The Bay of Pigs invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings). The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes (e.g., During the First World War, the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army, and women to work in the country's industry. The propaganda posters were used, because radios and TVs were not very common at that time.). The assumption is that, if people believe something false, they will constantly be assailed by doubts. Since these doubts are unpleasant (see cognitive dissonance), people will be eager to have them extinguished, and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power. For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented. This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select \"agreeable\" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations.\n\nPropaganda may be administered in insidious ways. For instance, disparaging disinformation about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system. Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school, such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents, thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a \"well-known fact\", even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source. The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system, without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media. Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals: by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country, they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others.\n\nIn the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin, who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic. On the other hand, the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing. Stalin was a Georgian who spoke Russian with a heavy accent. That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero. Only his eyes and famous mustache remained unaltered. Zhores Medvedev and Roy Medvedev say his \"majestic new image was devised appropriately to depict the leader of all times and of all peoples.\"\n\nArticle 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits any propaganda for war as well as any advocacy of national or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence by law.\n\nPropaganda shares techniques with advertising and public relations, each of which can be thought of as propaganda that promotes a commercial product or shapes the perception of an organization, person, or brand.\nJournalistic theory generally holds that news items should be objective, giving the reader an accurate background and analysis of the subject at hand. On the other hand, advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news. These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light, primarily meant to persuade rather than inform. Normally they use only subtle propaganda techniques and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements. If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item, the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily \"believed\" or \"internalized\". Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of \"covert\" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda, which is misleading. Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement.\n\nPropaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century, propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans. Propaganda also has much in common with public information campaigns by governments, which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior (such as wearing seat belts, not smoking, not littering and so forth). Again, the emphasis is more political in propaganda. Propaganda can take the form of leaflets, posters, TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other medium. In the case of the United States, there is also an important legal (imposed by law) distinction between advertising (a type of overt propaganda) and what the Government Accountability Office (GAO), an arm of the United States Congress, refers to as \"covert propaganda\".\n\nRoderick Hindery argues that propaganda exists on the political left, and right, and in mainstream centrist parties. Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking \"what is or is not propaganda?\" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda, indoctrination, and terrorism/counterterrorism. He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself.\n\nSince 9/11 and the appearance of greater media fluidity, propaganda institutions, practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the US and Britain. Dr Emma Louise Briant shows how this included expansion and integration of the apparatus cross-government and details attempts to coordinate the forms of propaganda for foreign and domestic audiences, with new efforts in strategic communication. These were subject to contestation within the US Government, resisted by Pentagon Public Affairs and critiqued by some scholars. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (section 1078 (a)) amended the US Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (popularly referred to as the Smith-Mundt Act) and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within U.S. borders for the Archivist of the United States. The Smith-Mundt Act, as amended, provided that \"the Secretary and the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall make available to the Archivist of the United States, for domestic distribution, motion pictures, films, videotapes, and other material 12 years after the initial dissemination of the material abroad (...) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors from engaging in any medium or form of communication, either directly or indirectly, because a United States domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material, or based on a presumption of such exposure.\" Public concerns were raised upon passage due to the relaxation of prohibitions of domestic propaganda in the United States.\n\nCommon media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports, government reports, historical revision, junk science, books, leaflets, movies, radio, television, and posters. Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to indoctrinate the target group. This may begin with a simple transmission, such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement. Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information, via a web site, hot line, radio program, etc. (as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals). The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement, and then from information seeker to opinion leader through indoctrination.\n\nA number of techniques based in social psychological research are used to generate propaganda. Many of these same techniques can be found under logical fallacies, since propagandists use arguments that, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.\n\nSome time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted. That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with \"propagandistic messages\". Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread. \n\nThe field of social psychology includes the study of persuasion. Social psychologists can be sociologists or psychologists. The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion. For example, communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator's credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. The elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors (e.g., the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication), influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them. Nobel Prize–winning psychologist Herbert A. Simon won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are cognitive misers. That is, in a society of mass information, people are forced to make decisions quickly and often superficially, as opposed to logically.\n\nAccording to William W. Biddle's 1931 article \"A psychological definition of propaganda\", \"[t]he four principles followed in propaganda are: (1) rely on emotions, never argue; (2) cast propaganda into the pattern of \"we\" versus an \"enemy\"; (3) reach groups as well as individuals; (4) hide the propagandist as much as possible.\"\n\nThe propaganda model is a theory advanced by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky which argues systemic biases in the mass media and seeks to explain them in terms of structural economic causes:\n\nFirst presented in their 1988 book \"\", the propaganda model views the private media as businesses selling a product – readers and audiences (rather than news) – to other businesses (advertisers) and relying primarily on government and corporate information and propaganda. The theory postulates five general classes of \"filters\" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media: Ownership of the medium, the medium's Funding, Sourcing of the news, Flak, and anti-communist ideology.\n\nThe first three (ownership, funding, and sourcing) are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important. Although the model was based mainly on the characterization of United States media, Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles the model postulates as the cause of media bias.\n\nOf all the potential targets for propaganda, children are the most vulnerable because they are the least prepared with the critical reasoning and contextual comprehension they need to determine whether a message is propaganda or not. The attention children give their environment during development, due to the process of developing their understanding of the world, causes them to absorb propaganda indiscriminately. Also, children are highly imitative: studies by Albert Bandura, Dorothea Ross and Sheila A. Ross in the 1960s indicated that, to a degree, socialization, formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of indoctrination. The use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s in Germany, as well as in Stalinist Russia. \nJohn Taylor Gatto asserts that modern schooling in the USA is designed to \"dumb us down\" in order to turn children into material suitable to work in factories. This ties into the Herman & Chomsky thesis of rise of Corporate Power, and its use in creating educational systems which serve its purposes against those of democracy.\n\nIn Nazi Germany, the education system was thoroughly co-opted to indoctrinate the German youth with anti-Semitic ideology. This was accomplished through the National Socialist Teachers League, of which 97% of all German teachers were members in 1937. The League encouraged the teaching of racial theory. Picture books for children such as \"Don't Trust A Fox in A Green Meadow or The Word of A Jew\", \"Der Giftpilz\" (translated into English as \"The Poisonous Mushroom\") and \"The Poodle-Pug-Dachshund-Pincher\" were widely circulated (over 100,000 copies of \"Don't Trust A Fox\"... were circulated during the late 1930s) and contained depictions of Jews as devils, child molesters and other morally charged figures. Slogans such as \"Judas the Jew betrayed Jesus the German to the Jews\" were recited in class. The following is an example of a propagandistic math problem recommended by the National Socialist Essence of Education: \"The Jews are aliens in Germany—in 1933 there were 66,606,000 inhabitants in the German Reich, of whom 499,682 (.75%) were Jews.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40949267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40949267", "title": "Property is theft!", "text": "Property is theft!\n\nProperty is theft! () is a slogan coined by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in his 1840 book \"What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government\".\n\nBy \"property\", Proudhon referred to a concept regarding land property that originated in Roman law: the \"sovereign right of property\", the right of the proprietor to do with his property as he pleases, \"to use and abuse,\" so long as in the end he submits to state-sanctioned title, and he contrasted the supposed right of property with the rights (which he considered valid) of liberty, equality, and security. Proudhon was clear that his opposition to property did not extend to exclusive possession of labor-made wealth.\n\nIn the \"Confessions d'un revolutionnaire\" Proudhon further explained his use of this phrase: \n\nJacques Pierre Brissot had previously written, in his \"Philosophical Inquiries on the Right of Property\" (\"Recherches philosophiques sur le droit de propriété et le vol\"), \"Exclusive property is a robbery in nature.\" Marx would later write in an 1865 letter to a contemporary that Proudhon had taken the slogan from Warville, although this is contested by subsequent scholarship.\n\nThe phrase also appears in 1797 in the Marquis de Sade's text L'Histoire de Juliette: \"Tracing the right of property back to its source, one infallibly arrives at usurpation. However, theft is only punished because it violates the right of property; but this right is itself nothing in origin but theft\".\n\nSimilar phrases also appear in the works of Saint Ambrose, who taught that \"superfluum quod tenes tu furaris\" (the superfluous property which you hold you have stolen) and Basil of Caesarea (\"Ascetics\", 34, 1–2).\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau made the same general point when he wrote: \"The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying 'This is mine', and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows: Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.\"\n\nIrish Marxist James Connolly referred to the socialist movement as the \"Great Anti-Theft Movement of the Twentieth Century\"\n\nKarl Marx, although initially favourable to Proudhon's work, later criticised, among other things, the expression \"property is theft\" as self-refuting and unnecessarily confusing, writing that theft' as a forcible violation of property presupposes the existence of property\" and condemning Proudhon for entangling himself in \"all sorts of fantasies, obscure even to himself, about true bourgeois property\".\n\nMax Stirner was highly critical of Proudhon, and in his work, \"The Ego and Its Own\", made the same criticism of Proudhon's expression before Marx, asking, \"Is the concept 'theft' at all possible unless one allows validity to the concept 'property'? How can one steal if property is not already extant? ... Accordingly property is not theft, but a theft becomes possible only through property.\"\n\n. This translation by Benjamin Tucker renders \"c'est le vol\" as \"it is robbery\", although the slogan is typically rendered in English as \"property is theft\".\n"}
{"id": "28367017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28367017", "title": "Racism in the Palestinian territories", "text": "Racism in the Palestinian territories\n\nAccording to many observers, various types of discrimination on the basis of religion against Jews as well as of racism and ethnic discrimination against blacks on ethnic basis, have existed in the area of what are now the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe British Mandate in Palestine period was marked by rising intercommunal tensions between the Zionist Yishuv and rising Palestinian and Arab nationalism. Arab nationalists not only opposed British rule, but the Zionist plan for a Jewish state in Palestine, and some Arabs engaged in violence against Jews, notably during the Arab Revolt. Some historians and other observers have interpreted this opposition as rooted in racism, while others have argued that Arab positions and actions were \"political in character, aiming to defend Arab social, economic, and cultural, and political interests. It was not racial in character, and neither did it reflect racial concepts rooted in Islam.\" Historian Gudrun Krämer argues the \"anti-Zionism equals anti-Judaism equals anti-Semitism\" interpretation \"is itself politically motivated, and must be understood as such.\" Scholars of both positions agree that European and Nazi antisemitism appeared in Mandate Palestine in the forms of the antisemitic forgery \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" (which was translated into Arabic and published in Cairo in 1925), and the embrace of Nazi antisemitism by Jerusalem Mufti Haj Amin al-Husayni. However, scholars also disagree on the broader impact of the elements of antisemitism, with Jeffrey Herf arguing that it was influential enough to provide seeds for later Islamist movements, and Krämer and René Wildangel arguing that most Palestinians and Arab nationalists distanced themselves from Nazi ideology. Richard Levy notes that, \"Original works of Arabic antisemitic literature did not appear until the second half of the twentieth century, after the establishment of the state of Israel and the defeat of Arab armies in 1948, 1956, and 1967.\"\n\n1920s - 40s\n\nAfter the British assumed power in the region, Haj Amin al-Husayni was appointed as Mufti of Jerusalem by High Commissioner Herbert Samuel. He was the principal leader of the Arab national movement in Palestine and a popular personality in the Arab world during most of the years of British rule. He met with Hitler and other Nazi officials on various occasions and attempted to coordinate Nazi and Arab policies to solve the \"Jewish problem\" in Palestine. Due to his role of leadership in Palestine and his association with the Nazi leader, he was sometimes referred to as the \"fuhrer of the Arab world\". In one of his speeches he said: \"Kill the Jews wherever you find them—this pleases Allah.\"\n\nZvi Elpeleg, while rehabilitating Haj Amin from other charges, wrote that there is no doubt that the Mufti's hatred was not limited to Zionism, but extended to Jews as such. Amin, according to Elpeleg, knew the fate which awaited Jews, and he was not only delighted that Jews were prevented from emigrating to Palestine, but was very pleased by the Nazis' Final Solution. Benny Morris also argues that the Mufti was deeply anti-Semitic, since he 'explained the Holocaust as owing to the Jews' sabotage of the German war effort in World War I and [their] character: (...) their selfishness, rooted in their belief that they are the chosen people of God.\" In contrast, Idith Zertal asserts that 'in more correct proportions, [Husayni appeared] as a fanatic nationalist-religious Palestinian leader'.\n\nIn the 1930s, wealthy Arab youths, educated in Germany and having witnessed the rise of fascist paramilitary groups, began returning home with the idea of creating an \"Arab Nazi Party\". In 1935, Jamal al-Husayni established the Palestine Arab Party, the party was used to create the \"fascist-style\" youth organization, al-Futuwwa; also sometimes called the \"Nazi Scouts\". The organization recruited children and youth, who took the following oath: \"Life -- my right; independence -- my aspiration; Arabism -- my country, and there is no room in it for any but Arabs. In this I believe and Allah is my witness.\" The British expressed concern at the situation in Palestine, stating in a report that \"the growing youth and scout movements must be regarded as the most probable factors for the disturbance of the peace.\"\n\nAccording to the US Congress report \"Contemporary Global Anti-Semitism\"\n\"In July 1990, the Palestinian Liberation Organization-affiliated Palestinian Red Crescent published an article in its magazine Balsam claiming that Jews concocted, “The lie concerning the gas chambers.” Gradually, throughout the 1990s, Holocaust denial became commonplace in popular media in the Middle East, particularly in the Palestinian Authority.\"\n\nIn August, 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper \"Al-Risala\"\nIt is no longer a secret that the Zionists were behind the Nazis’ murder of many Jews, and agreed to it, with the aim of intimidating them and forcing them to immigrate to Palestine. In August 2009, Hamas refused to allow Palestinian children to learn about the Holocaust, which it called \"a lie invented by the Zionists\" and referred to Holocaust education as a \"war crime.\"\n\nIn 1982, Mahmoud Abbas, later to become President of the Palestinian Authority, wrote his doctoral thesis which later became a book, \"\". In the book, Abbas raised doubts that gas chambers were used for extermination of Jews, and suggested that the number of Jews murdered in the Holocaust was \"less than a million\", claiming secret ties between the Nazis and the Zionist movement. He also claimed that the Holocaust was a joint Zionist-Nazi plot, writing \"The Zionist movement led a broad campaign of incitement against the Jews living under Nazi rule, in order to arouse the government's hatred of them, to fuel vengeance against them, and to expand the mass extermination.\" In 2013, Abbas defended his doctoral thesis regarding the relationship between the Zionists and the Nazis before World War II and said he \"challenges anyone who can deny that the Zionist movement had ties with the Nazis before World War II.\"\n\nHamas (\"Islamic Resistance Movement\") is the Palestinian Islamist socio-political organization, which won a decisive majority in the Palestinian Parliament in 2006 and currently rules the Gaza strip.\n\nAccording to academic Esther Webman, antisemitism is not the main tenet of Hamas ideology, although antisemitic rhetoric is frequent and intense in Hamas leaflets. The leaflets generally do not differentiate between Jews and Zionists. In other Hamas publications and in interviews with its leaders attempts at this differentiation have been made.\n\nThe Hamas covenant states, \"Our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious.\" It continues by claiming that the French revolution, the Russian revolution, colonialism and both world wars were created as a Jewish zionist conspiracy. It also claims the Freemasons and Rotary clubs are Zionist fronts and refers to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an antisemitic text purporting to describe a plan to achieve global domination by the Jewish people.\n\nHamas legislator and imam, Sheik Yunus al-Astal, said that \"suffering by fire is the Jews' destiny in this world and the next\". He concluded \"Therefore we are sure that the Holocaust is still to come upon the Jews\". Another Hamas cleric, Yousif al-Zahar said that \"Jews are a people who cannot be trusted. They have been traitors to all agreements. Go back to history. Their fate is their vanishing.\".\n\nIn its 2009 report on human rights in the Palestinian territories, the US State Department noted that:\n\"Rhetoric by Palestinian terrorist groups included expressions of anti-Semitism, as did sermons by many Muslim religious leaders. Most Palestinian religious leaders rejected the right of Israel to exist. Hamas's al-Aqsa television station carried shows for preschoolers extolling hatred of Jews and suicide bombings.\"\n\nAccording to the report, International academics had concluded that \"the textbooks did not incite violence against Jews\"\n\nIn its 2004 report on global anti-semitism, the US State Department reported that\n\"The rhetoric of some Muslim religious leaders at times constituted an incitement to violence or hatred. For example, the television station controlled by the Palestinian Authority broadcast statements by Palestinian political and spiritual leaders that resembled traditional expressions of anti-Semitism.\"\n\nThe Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri appeared on the Saudi satellite channel Al-Majd on February 20, 2005, commenting on the assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. \"Anyone who studies \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" and specifically the Talmud,\" he said, \"will discover that one of the goals of these Protocols is to cause confusion in the world and to undermine security throughout the world.\"\n\nIn 2005, it was reported that the Palestinian Authority was referring to the \"Protocols\" in a textbook for 10th grade students. After media exposure, the PA issued a revised edition of the textbook that does not include references to the \"Protocols\".\n\nThe Palestinian Authority has a prohibition based on a 1973 Jordanian law against selling land to Israelis. The law made such sales, which in the case of Israeli settlers are exclusively to Jews, punishable by death. In 1996, the Palestinian Authority's Mufti, Ikremah Sabri, issued a fatwa (religious decree), banning the sale of Arab and Muslim property to Jews. Sabri endorsed the killing of anyone who violated the order. The Palestinian Authority announced it would enforce the law in 1997, and drafted a replacement for it called the Property Law for Foreigners. The Palestinian Authority describes the law as a response to occupation and illegal settlement.\n\nAs of September 2010, the Palestinian Authority has not formally executed anyone under the law, but numerous land dealers suspected of selling land to Israeli Jews have been extrajudicially killed, some by policemen, in recent decades. At least seven land dealers were killed in 1996. On May 5, 1997, Palestinian Authority announced that the death penalty would be imposed on anyone convicted of ceding \"one inch\" to Israel. Later that month, two Arab land dealers were killed. A year later, another Palestinian suspected of selling land to Jews was murdered. In October 2004, Palestinians who allegedly sold land to Jews were killed. In April 2006, Muhammad Abu al-Hawa was tortured and murdered in Jericho for allegedly selling an apartment building in an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem to Jews. He was buried in Jericho rather than Jerusalem, as the Palestinian Authority's mufti in Jerusalem had banned all Muslims accused of selling land to Jews from being buried there. On April 2009, a Palestinian Authority military court sentenced an Arab from Hebron to death by hanging for the \"crime\" of selling land to Jews in the West Bank. At one such case, an arrest by the PA of Arabs who did sell to Jews, the community of Jewish settlers in Hebron sharply protested, declaring: \"We call upon the government to accept the racial hatred prevalent in the PA.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Authority and opponents of such land purchases argue that a prohibition of such land purchases is necessary to prevent the illegal expansion of Israeli settlements, and to avoid the prejudicing negotiations on the status of Palestine and further reductions in Palestinians' freedom of movement. Draft PA legislation described the sale of land to \"occupiers\" as \"national treason.\" There is a broad international consensus, affirmed by a series of UN Security Council resolutions, that Israeli settlements, and the transfer of Israeli nationals into the West Bank and Gaza, constitute violations of international law, specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention. Article 49(6) of that Convention requires that \"The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies\".\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, has been the subject of some viciously racial personal attacks, alongside vociferous criticism of her policies. These included an anti-black racist Cartoon in Palestinian Authority's controlled Press Al Quds. The New York Times reported in 2006 \"Her comment that the Israel-Lebanon war represented the “birth pangs of a new Middle East”— coming at a time when television stations were showing images of dead Lebanese children — sparked ridicule and even racist cartoons. A Palestinian newspaper, Al Quds,\" which \"depicted Ms. Rice as pregnant with an armed monkey, and a caption that read, “Rice speaks about the birth of a new Middle East.\" The Palestinian media has used racist terms including \"black spinster\" and \"colored dark skin lady.\"\n\nA review of Israel's country report conducted by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination stated \"The status of the settlements was clearly inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention, which, as noted in the Committee's General Recommendation XIX, prohibited all forms of racial segregation in all countries. There is a consensus among publicists that the prohibition of racial discrimination, irrespective of territories, is an imperative norm of international law.\" In Hebron, the Israeli Army has responded to violence between Israeli settlers and Palestinians by restricting the latter's freedom of movement in the central city. The Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem charges this policy violates the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and that\n"}

The main areas of regulation concern,\n\n\nIn general, people renting homes or real property may agree with a landlord to any contract terms they like, but some rights and duties are made compulsory. Historically, the United Kingdom sought to ensure fair rents, prevent evictions without a fair reason, and placed obligations on landlords to properly maintain premises. Such regulation seeks to redress the inequality of bargaining power between landlords and tenants in a market where there is unlimited freedom of contract. Most rights for tenants were abolished by the Housing Act 1980 and in subsequent legislation through the 1980s. The remaining legislation is found in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, which gives rights to business tenants, and the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 which gives some rights, although fewer, to people renting for the purpose of a home.\n\nBefore the 20th century, and during the industrial revolution, the regulation of the rental property relationship was largely left to the market. The first major regulation was introduced by the Rents and Mortgage Interest Restriction Act 1915, largely as a consequence of rent strikes in Glasgow.\n\n\n\nSecurity of tenure exists for business tenancies under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. It was abolished for most residential properties by the Housing Act 1988. However, it remains for some people who live in council houses.\n\n\nThe Rent Act 1977 was the last piece of legislation in England and Wales to place limits on how much landlords could raise prices for residential homes.

McCormick\n\nRobert Rutherford \"Colonel\" McCormick (July 30, 1880 – April 1, 1955) was a member of the McCormick family of Chicago who became a lawyer, Republican Chicago alderman, distinguished U.S. Army officer in World War I, and eventually owner and publisher of the \"Chicago Tribune\" newspaper. A leading Republican and non-interventionist, McCormick opposed the increase in Federal power brought about by the New Deal and later opposed American entry into World War II. His death also created what is now the McCormick Foundation, known for its philanthropic activities.\n\nMcCormick was born July 30, 1880, in Chicago to Robert Sanderson McCormick (1849–1919) and his wife Katherine Van Etta Medill McCormick (1853–1932). His wealthy and distinguished family is explained in detail in a separate section below. Members quickly nicknamed him \"Bertie\" because so many relatives shared the name, including his late paternal great-grandfather Robert McCormick (Virginia). His maternal grandfather was \"Tribune\" editor and former Chicago mayor Joseph Medill, on whose estate McCormick would live for much of his adult life. On his father's side, his great-uncle was inventor and businessman Cyrus McCormick. His elder brother Joseph Medill McCormick (known as \"Medill McCormick\") was slated to take over the family newspaper business, but was more interested in running for political office, and became a member of the United State House of Representatives (1917–1919) and then the U.S. Senate before losing his bid for a second term and committing suicide in Washington, D.C. in 1925. Meanwhile, from 1889 through 1893, Bertie lived a lonely childhood with his parents in London. His father Robert Sanderson McCormick was Second Secretary of the American Legation in London, serving from 1889 to 1892 under Robert Todd Lincoln. Later, his father served as his nation's ambassador to Austria-Hungary (1901–1902) and Imperial Russia (1902–1905), and replaced Horace Porter as ambassador to France in 1905.\n\nWhile in London, Bertie attended Ludgrove School. Sent back to the United States, Bertie attended Groton School, as had his brother. In 1899, the year of his maternal grandfather Joseph Medill's death, McCormick matriculated at Yale College, where he was elected to the prestigious secret society Scroll and Key and graduated in 1903 (three years after his brother). Robert McCormick then attended the Northwestern University School of Law and after graduation became a clerk in a Chicago law firm.\n\nRobert McCormick was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1907. The following year, he co-founded the law firm that became Kirkland & Ellis, which represented the Tribune Company. However, his elder brother Medill McCormick had become depressed after taking over and expanding the family newspaper business, and in 1908 upon the advice of Carl Jung gave up that job. Robert McCormick thus became increasingly involved in the family publishing business. Despite that business involvement, a scandal that ultimately led to his marriage (discussed separately below), and his military service (which led to his subsequent honorific \"the Colonel\"), McCormick continued as a law firm partner until 1920.\n\nIn 1910, Robert McCormick took control of the \"Chicago Tribune\", and in 1914 became editor and publisher with his cousin, Captain Joseph Medill Patterson (son of a Tribune editor who married Joseph Medill's daughter). In 1919, Patterson (a former U.S. Representative from Illinois) moved to New York City and founded the tabloid New York Daily News. However he and McCormick, while often disagreeing, jointly held both positions at the Chicago Tribune until 1926, when McCormick assumed both roles at the Tribune, and Patterson concentrated on the New York Daily News.\n\nIn 1904 a Republican ward leader persuaded McCormick to run for alderman. Elected, he served two years on the Chicago City Council. In 1905, at the age of 25, he was elected to a five-year term as president of the board of trustees of the Chicago Sanitary District, which operated the city's vast drainage and sewage disposal system. In 1907 McCormick was appointed to the Chicago Permanent Charter Commission and the Chicago Plan Commission. However, his political career ended abruptly when he took control of the \"Tribune.\"\n\nMcCormick went to Europe as a war correspondent for the \"Tribune\" in February 1915, early in World War I. He interviewed Tsar Nicholas, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, and First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill. McCormick also visited (and was under fire on) both the Eastern and Western Fronts. Using connections his father had made while ambassador to Russia, McCormick attended formal dinners with Grand Duke Nicholas and Grand Duke Peter. During this trip, McCormick collected fragments of the cathedral of Ypres and the city hall of Arras. Reputedly, these pieces were the first of the collection of stones that were later embedded in the facade of the Tribune Tower. However, they are not actually on display.\n\nReturning to the United States in early 1915, McCormick joined the Illinois National Guard on June 21, 1916. His family background, education and expert horsemanship led to his being commissioned as a major in its 1st Cavalry Regiment. Two days earlier, President Woodrow Wilson had called the Illinois National Guard into federal service, along with those of several other states, to patrol the Mexican border during General John Joseph Pershing's Punitive Expedition. McCormick accompanied his regiment to the Mexican border.\n\nSoon after the United States entered the war, the entire Illinois National Guard was mobilized for federal service in Europe. McCormick thus became part of the U.S. Army on June 13, 1917, and was sent to France as an intelligence officer on the staff of General Pershing. \n\nSeeking more active service, he was assigned to an artillery school. \n\nBy June 17, 1918, McCormick became a lieutenant colonel, and by September 5, 1918, was promoted to a full colonel in the field artillery. He took part in the capture of Cantigny (hence his later naming his farm estate near Wheaton, Illinois), and in the battles of Soissons, Saint-Mihiel, and the second phase of the Argonne. McCormick served in the 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery Regiment, with the 1st Infantry Division. His service ended on December 31, 1918, though he remained a part of the Officers Reserve Corps from October 8, 1919, to September 30, 1929. Cited for prompt action in battle, he received the Distinguished Service Medal, and was later always referred to as \"Colonel McCormick.\"\n\nMcCormick returned from the war and took control of the \"Tribune\" in the 1920s. Given the lack of schools of journalism in the midwestern United States at the time, McCormick and Patterson sponsored a school named for their grandfather, the Joseph Medill School of Journalism. It was announced by Walter Dill Scott in November 1920, and began classes in 1921.\n\nAs publisher of the \"Tribune\", McCormick was involved in a number of legal disputes regarding freedom of the press that were handled by McCormick's longtime lawyer Weymouth Kirkland. The most famous of these cases is \"Near v. Minnesota\", 283 U.S. 697 (1931), a case championed by McCormick in his role as chairman of the American Newspaper Publishers Association's Committee on Free Speech.\nA conservative Republican, McCormick was an opponent of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and compared the New Deal to Communism. For a period in 1935, he protested Rhode Island's Democratic judiciary by displaying a 47 star flag outside the Tribune building, with the 13th star (representing Rhode Island) removed; he relented after he was advised that alteration of the American flag was unlawful.\n\nHe was also an America First non-interventionist who strongly opposed entering World War II \"to rescue the British Empire\". He famously published a military plan that FDR had ordered in the summer of 1941 to prepare the United States for possible entry into World War II, the \"Victory Program\" which had been leaked to him by US Senator Burton K. Wheeler. The publication was on December 4, 1941, only three days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The controversy it stirred died off quickly after the December 7 attack. In June 1942, the \"Tribune\" published an article that indicated that the Americans had broken Japanese codes, the 1942 \"Chicago Tribune\" incident.\n\nAs a publisher he was very innovative. McCormick was a 25 percent owner of the Tribune's 50,000 watt radio station, which was purchased in 1924; he named it WGN, the initials of the \"Tribune\"'s modest motto, the \"World's Greatest Newspaper\". He also established the town of Baie-Comeau, Quebec in 1936 and constructed a paper mill and a hydroelectric power plant there named McCormick Dam to generate electricity for the mill.\n\nMcCormick carried on crusades against various local, state, and national politicians, gangsters and racketeers, labor unions, prohibition and prohibitionists, Wall Street, the East and Easterners, Democrats, the New Deal and the Fair Deal, liberal Republicans, the League of Nations, the World Court, the United Nations, British imperialism, socialism, and communism. Besides Roosevelt, his chief targets included Chicago Mayor William Hale Thompson and Illinois Governor Len Small. Some of McCormick's personal crusades were seen as quixotic (such as his attempts to reform spelling of the English language) and were parodied in political cartoons in rival Frank Knox's \"Chicago Daily News\". Knox's political cartoonists, including Cecil Jensen, derided McCormick as \"Colonel McCosmic\", a \"pompous, paunchy, didactic individual with a bristling mustache and superlative ego.\"\n\nIn 1943 he told an audience he helped plan a defence against an invasion from Canada at the end of World War I.\nIn June 1947, he gave a 100-year birthday party for the \"Tribune\" that included a fireworks show called \"the most colossal show since the Chicago fire.\"\nOther publications noted that everything about the celebration was called \"the world's greatest\". Time magazine editorialized that \"the \"Tribune\" has been made into a worldwide symbol of reaction, isolation, and prejudice by a man capable of real hate.\"\n\nMcCormick had purchased the \"Washington Times-Herald\" newspaper following the 1948 death of Eleanor Medill \"Cissy\" Patterson, his first cousin. The paper was an \"isolationist and archconservative\" publication known for sensationalism. McCormick appointed his niece, then known as Ruth \"Bazy\" McCormick Miller as the publisher of the paper in 1949. He wanted Bazy to use the paper to create \"an outpost of American principles\". When the two came to a parting of the ways over her relationship with one of the paper's editors, Garvin Tankersley, as well as editorial control over the paper, he ordered her to choose between Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she resigned from the \"Times-Herald\". Bazy later said, \"I understood when I went to the \"Times-Herald\" I was to have full control. That control was not given me ... There is some difference in our political beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [McCormick] has. I am for the same people as the colonel, but I am for some more people.\n\nMcCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the \"Times-Herald\" to \"The Washington Post\" in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Bazy be given a chance to purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the money to do so. Upon the purchase of the \"Times-Herald\", the \"Post\" consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper.\n\nMcCormick married twice, but had no children from either marriage. His first wife was Amy Irwin, the former wife of his father's first cousin, Edward Shields Adams. Starting in the summer of 1904, McCormick had spent much time at the homes of Adams in downtown Chicago and Lake Forest, Illinois. Amanda McCormick (1822–1891), youngest daughter of family patriarch Robert McCormick, had married fellow Virginian Hugh Adams (1820–1880) before moving to Chicago to start the McCormick & Adams grain trading business. Their son, Edward Shields Adams, born in 1859, had married the much younger Amie de Houle \"Amy\" Irwin on April 15, 1895. She was born in 1872, the daughter of decorated soldier Bernard J. D. Irwin.\n\nStarting in November 1913, a bitter family dispute developed. Amy Irwin Adams filed for divorce, claiming Adams was alcoholic, and the suit was granted on March 6, 1914, without her husband appearing in court. In September 1914, Adams filed another lawsuit. He sued McCormick for trespass and asked for the divorce case to be heard again. The opposition press made the most out of the scandals. Adams presented McCormick with a bill for eight years of lodging, and claimed McCormick had \"wickedly and maliciously debauched and carnally knew the said Amy Irwin Adams\" while his guest. Other allegations included that McCormick had a former chauffeur arrested and interrogated by a private detective. McCormick then counterclaimed that he had made loans to Adams which had to be repaid. The case was heard by Federal Court Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis in November. It was hinted that McCormick had promised to forgive the loans if Adams dropped his suit to reopen the divorce. Landis ruled in favor of McCormick in February 1915.\n\nFollowing the settlement, on March 10, 1915, McCormick married Amy Irwin Adams, after waiting the year after the original divorce decree as was required by law at the time. The wedding occurred in London, in the registry office of St George's, Hanover Square, with only two witnesses present. The \"Tribune\" did not mention the wedding, nor any of the previous lawsuits.\n\nAfter Amy died in 1939, McCormick became a near social recluse. On December 21, 1944, he married Mrs. Maryland Mathison Hooper in the apartment of his cousin Chauncey McCormick. She was 47 and he was 64 at the time. She lived until July 21, 1985. In his later years and until his death, McCormick lived at the estate named Cantigny, in Wheaton, Illinois.\n\nThe childless McCormick for a time mentored his niece, Ruth \"Bazy\" McCormick Miller (later Tankersley) to be the heir to his publishing empire. He was said to have \"doted\" on Bazy. When McCormick appointed her as the publisher of the \"Washington Times-Herald\" in 1949, she was 28 years old and was given the title of Vice-President. When Bazy divorced her husband in 1951, ultimately to elope with an editor at the paper, Garvin \"Tank\" Tankersley, the two came to a parting of the ways. McCormick considered Tankersley to be of unsuitable social status for Bazy because \"Tank\" was from a poor Lynchburg, Virginia, family. McCormick also disapproved of her divorce in general, which Bazy viewed as hypocritical, given McCormick's own complicated personal life. When McCormick delivered the ultimatum that she choose between Garvin Tankersley and the paper, she resigned from the \"Times-Herald\". Though estranged for many years, Bazy and McCormick reconciled prior to his death.\n\nMcCormick was regarded as a \"remote, coldly aloof, ruthless aristocrat, living in lonely magnificence, disdaining the common people... an exceptional man, a lone wolf whose strength and courage could be looked up to, but at the same time had to be feared; an eccentric, misanthropic genius whose haughty bearing, cold eye and steely reserve made it impossible to like or trust him.\" McCormick was described by one opponent as \"the greatest mind of the fourteenth century\" and by the American labor historian Art Preis as a \"fascist-minded multi-millionaire\". In his memoirs, publisher Henry Regnery described his meeting with McCormick and William Henry Chamberlin:\n\nThe Colonel received us in his rather feudal office, high above Michigan Avenue at the top of his Gothic tower. He was a tall, erect, distinguished-looking man, who, with his white hair, blue eyes, ruddy complexion, white mustache, and in his manner and dress, conveyed the impression that he might have come from the English landed aristocracy. He was perfectly cordial, but gave us clearly to understand that our rather similar views on such matters as foreign policy and the administration in Washington were no basis for familiarity.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" said:\nHe did consider himself an aristocrat, and his imposing stature— tall, with a muscular body weighing over , his erect soldierly bearing, his reserved manner and his distinguished appearance—made it easy for him to play that role. But if he was one, he was an aristocrat, according to his friends, in the best sense of the word, despising the idle rich and having no use for parasites, dilettantes or mere pleasure-seekers, whose company, clubs and amusements he avoided. With an extraordinary capacity for hard work, he often put in seven long days a week at his job even when elderly, keeping fit through polo and later horseback riding. In his seventies, he could still get into the war uniform of his thirties.\n\nIn failing health since an attack of pneumonia in April 1955, McCormick nevertheless remained active in his work until the month before he died on April 1, 1955. He was buried on his farm, in his war uniform. His second wife survived him by three decades.\n\nUpon his death, the childless McCormick left an estate estimated at $55 million, including stock in the Chicago Tribune Company. His will established a trust devoted to charitable purposes, including maintenance of his former home, which became Cantigny Park and includes a museum. The Northwestern University School of Law building that opened in 1962 was named McCormick Hall following a donation from the foundation.\nAfter a donation to renovate the Technological Institute building at Northwestern University in 1989, the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science was also named for him.\nWithin days of McCormick's death, Richard J. Daley was elected mayor and a new family would dominate Chicago, this time aligned with the Democratic Party for over half a century.\nSince McCormick had long advocated building a convention center, after it was built from 1957 to 1960 McCormick Place was named for him.\n\nThe trust eventually divested its ownership of the Tribune Company, so in 2008 changed its name from the McCormick Tribune Foundation to the Robert R. McCormick Foundation. It contributed more than a billion US dollars for journalism, early childhood education, civic health, social and economic services, arts and culture and citizenship. Additionally, McCormick endowed five scholarships at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina and deeded his Aiken, South Carolina estate to friend and former commander Charles Pelot Summerall with the stipulation that the General live there the remainder of his life. After Summerall's death in 1954, the estate was sold and the proceeds used to purchase a beach house in Isle of Palms, South Carolina, now known as the Robert R. McCormick Citadel Beach Club. The structure was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and subsequently rebuilt and hosts many functions including weddings and corporate events.\n\nMcCormick's legacy also extended to Canada, his grandfather Joseph Medill's birthplace. Six towns were created for the purpose of forestry and journal paper production: Heron Bay (Ont.), Gore Bay (Ont), Thorold (Ont.), Baie-Comeau (Que), Franquelin (Que) and Shelter Bay (Que), known as Port-Cartier today. These towns still exist and if yesterdays productions are no longer what make them thrive, the memories of the Colonel are remembered and honored. Many monuments have been made in honor of the Colonel, in Baie-Comeau lay the biggest of them all, a bronze statue of the Colonel canoeing as he did in 1915 when he discovered the land that would welcome the town in 1937. The monument was made by Wheeler Williams an American sculptor. In 1955 the Quebec & Ontario Transportation Company renamed the cargo vessel the \"Manicouagan\" the \"Col. Robert R. McCormick\".\n\n"}

To reduce price distortion, the connection between payments and specific crops was removed; instead, a \"Single Farm Payment\", which subsidised farmers on a per-hectare basis, was introduced in June 2003; although farmers may now attempt to claim subsidies for more land than they actually have. This \"decoupling\" of subsidies means they are accepted in the \"\" category of subsidies in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture negotiated at the Uruguay Round, in line with international agreements to reduce market-distorting subsidies and price controls.\n\nNational governments within the EU make their own arrangements for implementation and for paying subsidies to farmers; in the UK this is done by the Rural Payments Agency, an executive agency of Defra. Some British farmers have experienced problems due to delays in verifying how much land they have which is eligible for subsidy.\n\nThe Scottish government offers farmers an online system to claim subsidies, which reduces the burden of paperwork.\n\nIn non-Euro countries, payments to farmers may be made in local currency at an exchange rate set by the European Central Bank.\n\nSome farmers trade their subsidy entitlements.\n\nThe Single Farm Payment is a large proportion of income for many farmers, who say they could not profit without subsidies. However, farm subsidies in developed countries push down food prices and impoverish third-world farmers. Taxpayers in the EU get more than most in return for their money.\n\nIn 2010, the EU spent €57 billion on agricultural development, of which €39 billion was spent on direct subsidies.\n\n"}

{"id": "158940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158940", "title": "Teapot Dome scandal", "text": "Teapot Dome scandal\n\nThe \"Teapot Dome scandal\" was a bribery scandal involving the administration of United States President Warren G. Harding from 19211923. Secretary of the Interior Albert Bacon Fall had leased Navy petroleum reserves at Teapot Dome in Wyoming, and two locations in California, to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding. The leases were the subject of a sensational investigation by Senator Thomas J. Walsh. Convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies, Fall became the first presidential cabinet member to go to prison; no one was convicted of paying the bribes.\n\nBefore the Watergate scandal, Teapot Dome was regarded as the \"greatest and most sensational scandal in the history of American politics\". It damaged the reputation of the Harding administration, which was already severely diminished by its controversial handling of the Great Railroad Strike of 1922 and Harding's veto of the Bonus Bill in 1922.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the U.S. Navy largely converted from coal to fuel oil. To ensure that the Navy would always have enough fuel available, several oil-producing areas were designated as naval oil reserves by President Taft. In 1921, President Harding issued an executive order that transferred control of Teapot Dome Oil Field in Natrona County, Wyoming, and the Elk Hills and Buena Vista Oil Fields in Kern County, California, from the Navy Department to the Department of the Interior. This was not implemented until 1922, when Interior Secretary Fall persuaded Navy Secretary Edwin C. Denby to transfer control.\n\nLater in 1922, Interior Secretary Albert Fall leased the oil production rights at Teapot Dome to Harry F. Sinclair of Mammoth Oil, a subsidiary of Sinclair Oil Corporation. He also leased the Elk Hills reserve to Edward L. Doheny of Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company. Both leases were issued without competitive bidding. This manner of leasing was legal under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.\n\nThe lease terms were very favorable to the oil companies, which secretly made Fall a rich man. Fall had received a no-interest loan from Doheny of $100,000 (about $ today) in November 1921. He received other gifts from Doheny and Sinclair totaling about $404,000 (about $ today). This money changing hands was illegal, not the leases. Fall attempted to keep his actions secret, but the sudden improvement in his standard of living was suspect.\n\nIn April 1922, a Wyoming oil operator wrote to Senator John B. Kendrick, angered that Sinclair had been given a contract to the lands in a secret deal. Kendrick did not respond, but two days later on April 15, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the deal. Republican Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. of Wisconsin led an investigation by the Senate Committee on Public Lands. At first, La Follette believed Fall was innocent. However, his suspicions deepened after his own office in the Senate Office Building was ransacked.\n\nDemocrat Thomas J. Walsh of Montana, the most junior minority member, led a lengthy inquiry. For two years, Walsh pushed forward while Fall stepped backward, covering his tracks as he went. No evidence of wrongdoing was initially uncovered, as the leases were legal enough, but records kept disappearing mysteriously. Fall had made the leases appear legitimate, but his acceptance of the money was his undoing. By 1924, the remaining unanswered question was how Fall had become so rich so quickly and easily.\n\nMoney from the bribes had gone to Fall's cattle ranch and investments in his business. Finally, as the investigation was winding down with Fall apparently innocent, Walsh uncovered a piece of evidence Fall had forgotten to cover up: Doheny's $100,000 loan to Fall.\n\nThis discovery broke open the scandal. Civil and criminal suits related to the scandal continued throughout the 1920s. In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained. The Court invalidated the Elk Hills lease in February 1927, and the Teapot Dome lease in October. Both reserves were returned to the Navy.\n\nIn 1929, Albert Fall was found guilty of accepting bribes from Doheny. Conversely, in 1930, Edward L. Doheny was acquitted of paying bribes to Fall. Further, Doheny's corporation foreclosed on Fall's home in Tularosa Basin, New Mexico, because of \"unpaid loans\" that turned out to be that same $100,000 bribe. Sinclair served six months in jail on a charge of jury tampering.\n\nAlthough Fall was to blame for this scandal, Harding's reputation was sullied because of his involvement with the wrong people. Evidence proving Fall's guilt only arose after Harding's death in 1923. This was not the first time that Fall's character had been called into question. He had been suspected of the 1896 murder of rival attorney and politician Albert Jennings Fountain and his eight-year-old son Henry at White Sands near Tularosa, as the Fountains rode home from a meeting at Fall's ranch.\n\nAnother significant outcome was the Supreme Court's ruling in \"McGrain v. Daugherty\" (1927) which, for the first time, explicitly established that Congress had the power to compel testimony.\n\nThe field was then idled for 49 years, but went back into production in 1976. After earning over $569 million in revenue having extracted of oil over the previous 39 years, in February 2015, the Department of Energy sold the oil field for $45 million to Stranded Oil Resources Corp.\n\n\n"}

The phrase appeared in print as a space-filler in \"The Lady's Magazine\" for 1818, although it is sometimes attributed to a speech given by Sir William Curtis, Member of Parliament, in about 1795, the publication The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Volume 5, casts doubt on this by noting \"It has been very much the fashion amongst a class of persons to attribute to Sir W.C. certain bulls (which would be more in place from an alderman in Dublin), and also a vulgarity and arrogance of speech which are by no means consistent with his character and conduct.\". The skills themselves are alluded to in St. Augustine's \"Confessions\": \"nam illas primas, ubi legere et scribere et numerare discitur\" 'for those first, where to read, and to write, and ciphering is being learned.' . Ciphering translates differently and can be defined as transposing, arguing, reckoning, a secretive method of writing, or numerating. Since its original creation, many others have used the term to describe other triples.\n\nThe phrase \"the Three Rs\" may have originated in a speech made by Sir William Curtis in 1795. but this origination is disputed in the publication The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Volume 5.\nAn extended modern version of the three Rs consists of the \"functional skills of literacy, numeracy and ICT\".\n\nThere is an earlier reference to the skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic in St Augustine's \"Confessions\" (c. 397-401), though of course the words do not begin with 'R' in Latin.\n\nThe phrase 'the three Rs' is used because each word in the phrase has a strong \"R\" phoneme (sound) at the beginning. The term is ironic, since someone with rudimentary language education would know that two of the original words do not actually begin with the letter \"R\". The third \"R\" was more probably Reckoning, not as is more usually stated 'Rithmetic. Reckoning was a Victorian term for mental arithmetic and had been in use as such since the 14th century. The educationalist Louis P. Bénézet preferred \"to read\", \"to reason\", \"to recite\", adding, \"by reciting I did not mean giving back, verbatim, the words of the teacher or of the textbook. I meant speaking the English language.\"\n\nIn the United States, during the 17th century, the curriculum in the common (elementary) schools of the New England colonies was summed up as the \"four Rs\" -\nReading, 'Riting, \"Rithmetic\", and Religion.\n\nMore recent meanings of \"the Three Rs\" are:\n\n"}

One was a ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court that side judges had the right to vote on plea agreements. The second was a lengthy review of judges' conduct used to reach this conclusion. This resulted in the state Judicial Conduct Board bringing 24 formal charges against three Supreme Court judges.\n\nThe state accused Gordon Hunt of murdering a neighbor in 1982. His attorney attempted to plea bargain for a minimum sentence of ten years. The judge who heard the case, James L. Morse, accepted the plea. Both side judges, including Jane Wheel, disagreed. They brought their objections to the Vermont Supreme Court and, in 1984, obtained a ruling in favor of the side judges' decision.\n\nWheel was accused of exerting undue influence over three state Supreme Court justices, William C. Hill, Thomas L. Hayes, and Ernest W. Gibson III, and there were intimations of an affair between Wheel and Hill, which they denied. Among the other allegations against Wheel, she was accused of threatening the Vermont Attorney General, John J. Easton Jr., by suggesting she would undermine his 1984 candidacy for governor if he pursued the investigation. At one point in the investigation, Assistant Attorney General Brian L. Burgess punctured a hole in an office wall in order to eavesdrop on a conversation between Hill and Jeffrey Amestoy, who had succeeded Easton as Attorney General, in order to determine whether Hill was attempting to unduly influence Amestoy. During the investigation and subsequent court proceedings, all five Vermont Supreme Court justices recused themselves, and their positions were filled by temporary judges.\n\nIn 1986 and 1987, Hill and two other justices, Hill, Hayes, and Gibson were accused of tailoring decisions to suit Wheel, and helping her cover up payroll padding. Wheel was accused of wielding undue influence over the three justices. Hayes died before the charges could be resolved, and charges against Gibson were dropped. Wheel was convicted on charges arising from the case. Hill was found to have violated rules regarding judicial conduct, and opted to retire at the end of his second six-year term, rather than applying to remain on the court until age 70, Vermont's mandatory retirement age for judges.
