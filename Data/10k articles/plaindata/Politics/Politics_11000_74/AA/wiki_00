According to its mission statement, it is primarily tasked with \"Israel advocacy, community relations, fighting anti-Semitism, and promoting interfaith dialogue and multiculturalism.\" Howard Conter is the president of its board of directors, and its executive director is Jon Goldberg. As a result of the Canadian Jewish Congress' reorganization in 2007, the AJC became an individual member rather than an affiliate organization of the CJC; this was further reformed after the establishment of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, which subsumed the CJC in 2011. The AJC also owns and operates Camp Kadimah.\n\nCamp Kadimah, founded in 1943 and affiliated with Canadian Young Judaea, is located on the South Shore of Nova Scotia in Lunenburg County. Campers range from 8–16 years of age. Its mission statement, according to its website, is \"to build a foundation of Jewish identity and a love of Israel in generations of campers and staff, by providing a safe, caring community in which to foster knowledge, skills and leadership, for the benefit of Atlantic and Canadian Jewish Children.\" Many of the campers are from Toronto, Ontario but there remains a large portion of campers from Halifax. Many of the campers also from Israel.\n\nThere are 5 sections are the camp. The youngest sections, Gibborim, Goshrim, and Kochot occupied the main side of the bridge. Gibborim, the youngest section, means 'mighty.' Goshrim, for children aged 10-11, means 'bridge builders.' Kochot, the next section means 'power.' Machar, the eldest section as well as the section that occupies the other side of the bridge, means 'tomorrow.' There is also a CIT program that fosters the development of teenagers into adults. The CIT's live on the Machar side of the bridge. It is Kosher and nut-free. In 2009, ten teenagers from Sderot, Israel attended Camp Kadimah.\n\nCamp Kadimah is a founding member of the Summer Camp Health Initiative, which is aimed at advancing the health promotion and prevention of injuries and illnesses at Summer Camps in Canada.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1375003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1375003", "title": "Conditionality", "text": "Conditionality\n\nIn political economy and international relations, conditionality is the use of conditions attached to the provision of benefits such as a loan, debt relief or bilateral aid. These conditions are typically imposed by international financial institutions or regional organizations and are intended to improve economic conditions within the recipient country.\n\nConditionality is typically employed by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or a donor country with respect to loans, debt relief and financial aid. Conditionalities may involve relatively uncontroversial requirements to enhance aid effectiveness, such as anti-corruption measures, but they may involve highly controversial ones, such as austerity or the privatization of key public services, which may provoke strong political opposition in the recipient country. These conditionalities are often grouped under the label structural adjustment as they were prominent in the structural adjustment programs following the debt crisis of the 1980s.\n\nMuch debate in types of conditionality centers around ex-ante versus ex-post conditionality. In ex-post conditionality, the country receiving aid agrees to conditions set by the donor or lender that they will carry out \"after\" they receive the aid. Later follow-ups determine whether they might receive more aid.\nEx-ante conditionality requires a country to meet certain conditions and prove it can maintain them \"before\" it will receive any aid.\n\nTraditionally, the IMF lends funds based on ex-post criteria, which might induce moral hazard behavior by the borrowing country. The moral hazard problem appears when a government behaves in a risky manner in the anticipation that it can turn to the IMF in the case of a crisis. Institutional reforms of the International Monetary Fund, such as the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) in 1999, attempt to reduce moral hazard by relying more on pre-set qualification criteria (i.e. ex-ante).\n\nOther types of conditionality that often occur are aid which is tied to be used in a specific way. For example, many countries tie aid to the purchasing of domestic products, although this practice has drastically decreased over the past 15 years. The United Nations Human Development Report in 2005 estimated that only about 8 per cent of bilateral aid is 'tied', down from 27 per cent in 1990. This however varies from country to country with the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway giving 100 per cent of their aid untied, and Canada, Austria and Spain giving less than 60 per cent. \n\nThe European Union also employs conditionality with respect to enlargement, with membership conditional on candidate countries meeting the Copenhagen criteria and adopting the acquis communautaire.\n\n\n"}

There, she began her primary school education, at the Diocesan Girls' Junior School.\n\nAt age 11, in 1988, she moved with her parents from Hong Kong to Montreal, Canada. Ho first attended Jean-de-la-Mennais College, an elementary and middle in La Prairie, on the \"Rive-Sud\" (the suburban South Shore of Montreal), then attended Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, a Catholic college preparatory secondary school and private college. There, she received a Quebec Diploma of College Studies in Arts and Communications.\n\nShe then began studies at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), in graphic design.\n\nAt age 19, Ho enrolled in a song contest in Hong Kong—the 1996 New Talent Singing Awards—and to her stated surprise, won the competition (referring to it as an \"accident\").\n\nThis gave her the opportunity to meet Anita Mui, a diva of cantopop—\"queen of Hong Kong movies and…renowned in the… world of Cantonese pop music\"—of whom she had been a fan since childhood, and who would become her mentor following her win. This launched her career, and at this time she took on the stage name, \"HoCC\"; this gave her the opportunity to record an album, and gave her a recording contract with Capital Artists. In the intervening period between the contents win and her first album, Ho toured as a background vocalist with Mui, and hosted various television programs produced by TVB.\n\nHo released her first album \"First\" in 2001, in her fourth year of the contract with Capital Artists. Produced by Choy Yat Chi of Grasshopper (band), this EP, containing her first single \"Thousands more of me\" (千千萬萬個我）and \"Home of Glory\" (光榮之家），defined with success Ho's style as the rock pop independent female she is up till recent years. She earned the gold award of \"Best new singer\" of the year in CRHK and also in various awards ceremony. In October of the same year, Capital Artists announced bankruptcy， resulting in the end of Ho's first record label era.\n\nAfter Capital Artists closed, Ho joined EMI in 2002. Although she was only with the company for a brief 2-year period, it was during this time that her musical talents flourished. She teamed up with Ying C Foo (英師傅) for her first EMI label release, hocc². The song \"Angel Blues\" (天使藍), composed by Ho herself, not only reached top spots on music charts, but according to Ho, it is also her \"growing up\" song.\n\nAnother single in the EP, \"Rosemary\" (露絲瑪莉), written by Wyman Wong, created considerable controversies at the time, as it touched on the topic of lesbianism. This song also marked the beginning of Ho's series of songs containing gay themes. Following the success of \"Rosemary\" (露絲瑪莉), Ho continued the story of the two lovers in \"Goodbye... Rosemary\" (再見…露絲瑪莉) in her first full-length album, free love.\n\nThe year 2002 proved to be a successful year for Ho. The two singles \"Angel Blues\" (天使藍) and \"Goodbye... Rosemary\" (再見…露絲瑪莉) won multiple music awards in Hong Kong, including CASH Golden Sail Music Awards (CASH金帆音樂獎) – \"Best Vocal Performance by a Female Artist\" for the song \"Angel Blues\". In the same year, Ho won the renowned \"Female Singer Bronze Award\" in the Commercial Radio Hong Kong Annual Awards (叱吒樂壇流行榜頒獎典禮).\n\nIn 2003, Ho did a \"Music is Live\" concert with Andy Hui, who is also an apprentice of Anita Mui. Their performance won praise from the critics, and Ho proved to the audience her abilities to perform live as a musician. Later that year, Ho released her second full-length album Dress Me Up!. She was the credited as the producer of the album, indicating that Ho has finally gained full control over her music. In September 2003, Ho's longtime mentor, Anita Mui announced she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Shortly after the announcement, Anita lost her battle against cervical cancer and died on 30 December 2003. Between 2003 and 2004, Ho took on the role of hosting TVB's weekly live music show, Jade Solid Gold. In 2004, she appeared in Sammi Cheng's 2004 \"Sammi vs. Sammi\" concert as a cross-dressing cigarette-smoking admirer of Sammi Cheng. Ho's critically acclaimed performance in the short musical segment not only brought attention to the role she played, but also further established herself as a tremendous live performer. In September 2004, Ho signed a contract with East Asia Music.\n\nThe album \"Glam\", which pays tribute to the superstars of the 80's, was released in January 2005. It also marked the start of a close collaboration between Ho and the Green Mountain Orchestra band. She was named the Orbis Student Ambassador 2005, and visited Hainan in July. In September 2005, Ho performed in the musical \"Butterfly Lovers\" (梁祝下世傳奇) as the leading actress, producer and musical director. Her album of the same name gave her three Number 1 singles – \"Becoming a Butterfly\" (化蝶), \"Lawrence and Lewis\" (勞斯．萊斯) and \"Coffee in a Soda Bottle\" (汽水樽裡的咖啡), which are all based on the story of the \"Butterfly Lovers\", with possible homosexual themes. These singles helped her to receive the \"Female Singer Silver Award\" at the Commercial Radio Hong Kong Annual Awards 2005 (叱吒樂壇流行榜頒獎典禮).\n\nHo held her first Hong Kong Coliseum concert \"Live in Unity 2006\" on 26–28 October 2006. The concert was a great success and was positively received by the public. She decided to stage a second concert, \"Live in Unity 2007\", on 19–20 January 2007 following the original concert's success. Her single, We Stand As One, named after the slogan for the \"Live in Unity\" concerts, was released on 11 January 2007. Recordings of the concert were later released in February 2007. She went on a worldwide tour, performing in Toronto, Canada and Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nThe significant public attention and positive reception to her music helped her garner the \"Female Singer Gold Award\" at the Commercial Radio Hong Kong Annual Awards 2006 (叱吒樂壇流行榜頒獎典禮). She sang the Chinese version of Ayumi Hamasaki's song \"Secret\", known as \"Wounded City Secret\" (傷城秘密), for the 2006 movie \"Confession of Pain\". She continued as the Orbis Student Ambassdor 2006 and visited Vietnam, and later started her own charitable fund. In 2008, a new album \"Ten Days in the Madhouse\" was released. She produced this album from the viewpoint of society's outcasts and to raise awareness of mental health issues. She encouraged people to understand and find out more about people with mental illnesses and those who formerly suffered from mental illnesses, and care about their needs and situations. Ho encouraged communication between them and the public, ultimately, to achieve social harmony. \"Ten Days in the Madhouse\" was Ho's most ambitious project yet with the release of a documentary by Hong Kong director Yan Yan Mak (Butterfly) and an exhibition for charity, Ho showed that a multimedia project by a musician can be about something more important than clothing tie-ins.\n\nIn 2009, she followed up her plan from the previous year and organised a free concert (a rarity in Hong Kong) called \"Happiness is Free\" in the outdoor courtyard in Diocesan Boys' School. She managed to book the place because her father was a teacher there. In June, she began shooting a new TVB sitcom titled \"O.L. Supreme\" with Liza Wang. In July, she released her new song \"The Old Testament\" (舊約) and announced that she would hold her \"SUPERGOO\" themed concerts would be held from 9–12 October that year. Following the concerts, Ho took on a role in the new stage comedy \"Man and Woman, War and Peace\" (男人與女人之戰爭與和平) directed by Edward Lam. The stage comedy was presented on 13–16 November at Kwai Tsing Theatre in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2010, Ho appeared in the film \"Life Without Principle\" directed by Johnnie To.\n\nIn September 2010, her first Mandarin album \"Nameless Poem\" (無名．詩) was released in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and she held \"Homecoming\" concerts in Hong Kong in December 2010. In 2011, Ho received her first nomination for a Golden Melody Award, as Best Mandarin Female Singer, at the 22nd Annual ceremony for those awards.\n\nIn 2012, she was nominated for a Golden Horse Award for Best Actress, for her performance in the movie \"Life Without Principle\", which was won by Taiwan's Gwei Lun-mei at that 49th Annual ceremony. In 2013, Ho continued the tour of her play, \"Awakening\", in Singapore and in many cities in China. She released her second Mandarin album, Coexistence, whose theme is embracing and supporting others despite differences. Ho received her second nomination for a Golden Melody Popular Music Award, as Best Mandarin Female Singer, at the 25th Annual ceremony in 2015.\n\nWhen asked about the origins of her \"passion for freedom of expression,\" Ho replied to reporter Frédéric Lelièvre of \"La Presse\" that it was probably from her being an adolescent in Montreal at the time of the 1995 Quebec referendum.\n\nHo proudly announced herself as \"tongzhi\" (Cantonese:tongzi), a Chinese slang term for gay, at age 35, the fourth annual Hong Kong Pride Parade on 10 November 2012.\n\nSara Gates of \"The Huffington Post\" reports the various Hong Kong media outlets had indicated that Ho was the first \"mainstream female singer in Hong Kong to come out of the closet.\" Since then, Ho has been involved in the Big Love Alliance (大愛同盟), a civil rights group striving equal rights for the LGBT community, and she became a columnist for \"Apple Daily\" in 2014 and was recognised for her activism for LGBT rights in Hong Kong.\n\nHo faced a visa refusal by Malaysia on February 2018, which forced her to cancel the concert on April, allegedly related to her stance on LGBT and her LGBT identity.\n\nHo supported the 2014 Hong Kong protests, and a protester herself. On the subject, she stated, \"I saw the students rushing in, then the tear gas... There was no option but to stand up. [...] My favourite thing about Hong Kong is this moment in time – but it's also my least favorite. The most beautiful and the ugliest sides of Hong Kong are both happening right here. The Hong Kong spirit of helping each other out is something that was lost for a long time. But that's making a return. I don't like the greed, the selfishness, and the indifference some people feel towards what's happening in society.\"\n\nOn 5 June 2016, French cosmetics brand Lancôme cancelled a promotional concert by Denise Ho that was scheduled to be held on 19 June in Sheung Wan. This action was taken in response to a boycott campaign launched by the Communist Party-controlled \"Global Times\", which denigrated her for supposedly supporting Hong Kong and Tibet independence.\n\nLancôme added, in a Facebook post, that Ho is not a spokesperson for the brand. The Tibet allegation appeared to have stemmed from Ho's May 2016 meeting with the Dalai Lama. The cancellation drew a heavy backlash in Hong Kong. Ho says that citizens' wish for self-rule ought not to be considered a crime.\n\nShortly after the Lancôme incident, Ho announced a crowd-sponsorship campaign named \"Togetherly Exclusive Sponsorship\" for her Hong Kong Coliseum concert \"Dear Friend,\", (which was planned to be held in October of the same year), in response to being avoided by corporates. The campaign amazingly drew in near to 300 individual and business sponsors priced at $15k HKD each, which headlined newspapers and generated overall support within the general public. The 4 showings of the concert, a total of 50000 tickets, sold out within two hours.\n\nIn 2016 she was chosen as one of BBC's 100 Women\n\n\nThe following are songs which have not appeared on any of Denise Ho's albums:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Serious violence against Chinese people has occurred at irregular intervals since 1740, when the soldiers of the Dutch East India Company killed up to 10,000 people of Chinese descent during the \"Chinezenmoord\". The worst outbreaks took place in 1945-49 during the Indonesian National Revolution against Dutch rule. There were significant outbreaks in the early 1960s. Violence against Chinese also took place in 1965 after the failed coup attempt during anti-communist purges, but the number of Chinese victims in these events is often exaggerated; the main target of the killings were Native Indonesian communists. In 1998, many Chinese businesses were burned down, while dozens of women raped during the May riots.\n\nViolence against Chinese Indonesians is generally limited to attacks on property, including factories and shops. However, killings and assaults have happened, including in Batavia in 1740, Tangerang in 1946, during the period after the 30 September Movement of 1965, and during the May 1998 riots.\n\nSome observers suggest that Chinese Indonesians have become \"the typical scapegoat\" in situations where widespread discontent and social unrest becomes violent. The scapegoating has become more pronounced during the period since Indonesia’s independence.\n\nTerms considered disparaging against Chinese Indonesians have entered common Indonesian usage, at both the regional and national levels. The term \"Cina\", the use of which was mandated in 1967 instead of the then-commonly used \"Tionghoa\", was perceived as having similar negative connotations to \"Inlander\" for Native Indonesians. The term \"Tionghoa\" began to be used again after the beginning of Reformation, but by then \"Cina\" was not considered negative by the younger generation of Chinese Indonesians.\n\nIn different regions different terms have come into use that reflect common stereotypes. The following examples are from Surakarta.\n\nAfter the end of Company rule and the introduction of metropolitan colonial rule in 1815, legislation was introduced specifically against Chinese Indonesians. One of the first was in 1816 and required ethnic Chinese to carry a special pass at all times.\n\nDuring the Sukarno regime in 1958, all Chinese Indonesians were required to state their intent to stay Indonesian citizens and in 1959 Chinese who were not citizens were forbidden from doing business outside of urban areas. The discrimination continued into the New Order. Chinese Indonesians were urged to choose Indonesian-sounding names, forbidden to practice their traditions publicly, and required to obtain extra proof of citizenship. In total, forty five directly or indirectly discriminatory laws were passed during the New Order. Although the majority of this legislation was rescinded during the presidencies of Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri, instances of enforcement continued.\n\nBased on Chinese artifacts found in Indonesia, China is thought to have had trading relations with the Indonesian archipelago since the first century B.C. However, the first recorded movement of people from China into the Maritime Southeast Asia was the arrival of Mongol forces under Kublai Khan that culminated in the Mongol invasion of Java in 1293. The Mongols introduced Chinese technology to the island, particularly shipbuilding and Ancient Chinese coinage. Their intervention also hastened the decline of the classical kingdoms and precipitated the rise of the Majapahit empire.\n\nLater, Chinese Muslim traders from the eastern coast of China arrived at the coastal towns of Indonesia and Malaysia in the early 15th century. They were led by the mariner Zheng He, who led several expeditions to southeastern Asia between 1405 and 1430. These traders settled along the northern coast of Java, but there is no further documentation of their settlements beyond the 16th century. Scholars believe that the Chinese Muslims became absorbed into the majority Muslim population, until no Chinese communities remained when the Dutch arrived. Trade from China was re-established when it legalised private trade in 1567 and began licensing 50 junks a year. Distinct Chinese colonies emerged in ports throughout the archipelago, including the pepper port of Banten.\n\nBy 1740, there were over 2,500 Chinese-owned houses within the Batavia city walls, with another 15,000 individuals living outside of the city limits. Due to Chinese support of Native Indonesian campaigns against the Dutch, on 25 July 1740 the Dutch passed a resolution to \"kill or disappear\" Chinese who did not have a pass () and were unemployed; in practice this included traders and businessmen unwilling to be blackmailed. Those so rounded up were put on ships to Ceylon. Other Chinese homes were subject to random searches, often accompanied by assault and robbery.\n\nRumours soon spread that those sent to Ceylon were being killed, and the Chinese armed themselves. As the situation became tenser, Governor General Adriaan Valckenier held an emergency plenary session. On 7 October 1740, a group of hundreds of Chinese Indonesians attacked a Dutch stronghold in Tanah Abang, killing 50. In response, a troop of 1,800 Company soldiers led by Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff, together with militia () and conscripts (), began an ethnic cleansing campaign. They were later joined by Native Indonesians, fed by rumours of Chinese plans for rape and mass murder. For two weeks, the troops burned Chinese-owned houses and stores, killing ethnic Chinese and dumping their bodies in the Ciliwung River. Eventually an estimated 10,000 were killed, including 500 prisoners and hospital patients. The surviving Chinese Indonesians in Batavia were moved to an area outside of the wall, in what is now Glodok. This was later applied to other cities, where Chinatowns () were built to segregate the Chinese and other ethnic groups. The event triggered a two-year war, in which Chinese and Javanese soldiers fought side by side.\n\nWhen the VOC was nationalised on 31 December 1799, the freedoms the Chinese experienced under the corporation were taken away by the Dutch government. An 1816 regulation introduced a requirement for the indigenous population and Chinese travelling within the territory to obtain a travel permit. Those who did not carry a permit risked being arrested by security officers. The Governor-General also introduced a resolution in 1825 which forbade \"foreign Asians\" from living within the same neighbourhood as the native population.\n\nDuring the Java War, thousands of Chinese Indonesians were killed by Prince Diponegoro's forces during raids on the southern coast of Java. Survivors fled to the northern coast or to Dutch settlements for protection. Setiono cites the Chinese's status as tax collectors and loan providers as a cause, as well as Diponegoro's belief that the Chinese brought bad luck upon his campaign.\n\nIn 1848, the Dutch colonial government enacted the legislation sorting all inhabitants of the archipelago into two groups, based on whether or not they practised Christianity. This was later amended in 1855, combining Native Indonesian, Chinese, Arab, and Indian Christians with non-Christians. However, in practice the \"foreign Orientals\", were subject to separate regulations.\n\nBy 1912, the Dutch government had abandoned the policy of segregation. During the same period, the Xinhai Revolution awakened Chinese nationalism in the ethnic Chinese, while Sarekat Islam worked to awaken Indonesian nationalism in the Native Indonesian populace. Tensions between Sarekat Islam and the ethnic Chinese led to racially charged riots in Surakarta (1912), Tangerang (1913), and Kudus (31 October 1918). Of these riots, the largest was in Kudus, where a group of rioters burned and looted forty houses and numerous Chinese temples. At least 16 were killed in the riots.\n\nAfter the Japanese occupied Indonesia in 1942, at least 542 ethnic Chinese from Java and Madura were arrested and detained in the Cimahi concentration camp; this group included leaders, spouses of Europeans, and Chinese who were legally considered Europeans. Chinese organisations were disbanded and banned. Not long afterwards, ethnic Chinese were required to register themselves and pledge their allegiance to the Japanese army. Despite Japanese attempts to quell dissent, there were several underground resistance movements led by ethnic Chinese.\n\nThis was followed by the Pontianak affair in October 1943. Over 1,500 people were arrested or killed by the Japanese occupying forces in an attempt to prevent a multi-ethnic rebellion. Ethnic Chinese were the largest single group targeted, with 854 killed in the affair.\n\nFrom 30 May to 4 June 1946, attacks from Indonesian independence fighters killed 653 Chinese Indonesians. Roughly a thousand Chinese Indonesian-owned homes were burned; Mely G. Tan notes this as the worst of the violence targeted at Chinese Indonesians during the war. More cases were reported in Karawaci, Bayur, and Bagansiapiapi.\n\nIn 1955, Zhou Enlai declared that Chinese citizenship was \"jus sanguinis\". This led to a treaty between China and Indonesia regarding the legal status of Chinese Indonesians, which formed the basis for the Citizenship Law of 1958. This law required all Chinese Indonesians to choose between Chinese and Indonesian citizenship, making a statement at the nearest district court. Approximately 390,000 ethnic Chinese rejected Chinese citizenship.\n\nIn May 1959, the Sukarno government passed legislation revoking the trading rights of foreign nationals in rural areas; this was based on two previous, lower-level legislations. Due to uncertainty relating to the legal status of the ethnic Chinese, they were included as well. This led to the exodus of between 102,000 and 136,000 Chinese Indonesians, who left for China on ships sent by the Chinese government.\n\nBetween 1963 and early 1965, the situation for Chinese Indonesians generally became more stable. Numerous Chinese-language schools were opened and a Chinese-language press flourished. However, there were still minor attacks on Chinese Indonesians in Cirebon, Sukabumi, and Bandung in 1963.\n\nDuring the riots following the abortive 30 September Movement coup, Chinese Indonesians were sometimes targeted. Because most violence was against members and associates of the Indonesian Communist Party, to which very few Chinese belonged, it is likely that much of this violence was opportunistic, rather than due to suspected ties to the Communist Party. Property was targeted by rioters, and some Chinese Indonesians were killed but there is no evidence to support the claim sometimes circulating on the internet that hundreds of thousands of Chinese Indonesians were killed. The best estimate is that thousands of Chinese Indonesians were killed (out of a total death toll of 500,000), with documented massacres taking place in Makassar and Medan and on the island of Lombok. In West Kalimantan, approximately eighteen months after the worst of the killings in Java, indigenous pagan Dayaks expelled 45,000 ethnic Chinese from rural areas, killing up to 5,000. The Chinese refused to fight back, since they considered themselves \"a guest on other people's land\" with the intention of trading only.\n\nDuring the same period, numerous discriminative laws were passed. In April 1966, all Chinese schools (at the time numbering 629) were closed. On 8 May 1966, Territorial Military Commander of Aceh Ishak Djarsa declared that all ethnic Chinese had to leave Aceh prior to 17 August 1966; this was followed by a similar decree by the North Sumatra government. In 1967, the usage of the term \"Cina\", considered disparaging, became mandated for all official communications.\n\nOn 5 August 1973, a riot in Bandung, West Java, caused by three Chinese Indonesian teenagers beating another driver to death after a minor traffic accident, led to the looting and destruction of more than 1,500 Chinese Indonesian-owned shops and houses. The riots were not stopped by the local military; and nineteen soldiers were arrested for participating in the riots. The riots were later blamed on an underground section of the PKI.\n\nOn 15 January 1974, student demonstrations against corruption, foreign investment, and President Suharto's clique of personal assistants were diverted by suspected Special Forces provocateurs into a full riot., and later an anti-Chinese Indonesian pogrom. Stores in Glodok, owned by ethnic Chinese, were looted and burned; the largest of these was the Senen shopping complex. The security forces did almost nothing to stop the looting. The demonstrations and their aftermath came to be known as the Malari incident.\nIn 1978, the government began requiring a Letter of Proof of Citizenship of the Republic of Indonesia (, or SBKRI). Although the SBKRI was legally required for all citizens of foreign descent, in practice it was generally applied to the Chinese. This led to difficulties for Chinese Indonesians when enrolling in state universities, applying to be civil servants, or joining the military or police.\n\nSuharto's economic programs continued to work, with Indonesia experiencing an economic boom with its Gross Domestic Product growing at a rate of 8 percent in 1996, led by the manufacturing sector. However, the Asian Financial Crisis caused the rupiah to collapse and economic growth slowed to 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Unable to stabilise the economy, the government sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund. With rising unemployment and inflated food prices, the public lost confidence in the government's ability to turn the economy around. By the beginning of May 1998, students had been demonstrating in campuses throughout Medan for nearly two months. The growing number of demonstrators was coupled with increasing calls from the public for overall reforms.\n\nOn 4 May, more than 500 protestors from the State Institute of Teacher Training and Education (', IKIP Negeri) were barricaded and allegedly had Molotov cocktails thrown at them. Eventually, police reportedly stopped a group of students and assaulted them. Word of this attack spread through several witnesses, and a large group later attacked and destroyed a traffic police post. When more officers arrived to confront the group, the station was attacked. Not long after, shops owned by Chinese Indonesians were looted, while they reportedly left those marked with the words \"'\" (owned by the indigenous \"pribumi\") in graffiti alone. When the Mobile Brigade arrived in the afternoon, the crowd was dispersed with tear gas. As businesses in Medan closed on the following day, thousands of people attacked markets throughout the city and its surrounding districts. Police and anti-riot soldiers fired rubber bullets at the crowd to disperse them but were unsuccessful. When the violence ended two days later, six people had died and one hundred were injured.\n\nOn 12 May, less than a week after the violence in Medan subsided, the police shot four protesting students. Mass violence began almost simultaneously throughout Jakarta the following day. Mobs also attacked Glodok in the northwestern part of the city, where the commercial area of Jakarta's Chinatown was badly damaged. Some store owners reportedly paid local thugs to protect them from the violence because security forces were largely absent. This violence spread to numerous cities throughout Indonesia on 14 and 15 May, including Surabaya, Palembang, Surakarta, and Boyolali. After the riots, there were dozens of documented accounts of ethnic Chinese women being raped; the total number of mass gang-rapes may have reached 468, with 168 victims in Jakarta alone. However, most of the people who died in the riots were the Javanese Indonesian looters who targeted the Chinese shops, not the Chinese themselves, since the looters were burnt to death in a massive fire. The incidents caused President Suharto to resign and B. J. Habibie to become President of Indonesia.\n\nAfter the fall of Suharto, numerous discriminative laws were recalled and others promoting unity were passed. President Habibie passed legislation requiring the elimination of the terms pribumi and non-pribumi (native Indonesian and non-native) in 1998. In 2000, the next president, Abdurrahman Wahid, recalled the legislation forbidding the practice of Chinese culture and use of Mandarin Chinese in public. In 2002, Megawati Sukarnoputri declared Chinese New Year a national holiday. However, some discriminative legislation still remains.\n\nChinese Indonesians have been \"embraced\" by the government, with numerous mixed-ethnic cultural presentations and media activity. By 2004, there were three Chinese Indonesian members of the Peoples Representative Council, as well as one cabinet member. However, discrimination and prejudice have continued and risen. On 15 March 2016, for instance, Indonesian Army General Surya Prabowo commented that the incumbent governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, should \"know his place lest the Indonesian Chinese face the consequences of his action\". This controversial comment was considered to hearken back to previous violence against the Indonesian Chinese.\n\nThe use of Chinese Indonesians as scapegoats is partly caused by their lack of political power and government protection. The New Order policy of assimilation has also been seen as a factor; the need to assimilate the ethnic Chinese \"indicated that Chinese cultural elements are unacceptable\".\n\nDiscrimination, distrust, and violence against Chinese Indonesians is caused in part by a perception that they are still loyal to China, and only see Indonesia as a place to live and work. They are also seen as being \"exclusive\", unwilling to mingle with other ethnic groups, as well as discriminating against native Indonesians in their business relations.\n\nDuring the Old and New Orders, Chinese Indonesians generally complied with legal restrictions as best they could. However, the May 1998 riots caused a change in attitude, including greater political activity and assertiveness. Additionally, the discrimination led to an ethnic identity crisis, with Chinese Indonesians with strong Chinese ties feeling unaccepted by the Indonesian populace, and those with strong Indonesian ties wanting equal rights.\n\nSociologist Mely G. Tan notes that presently many Chinese Indonesian families have prepared escape plans in case of further riots and find themselves unable to trust ethnic Indonesians. She also notes that younger Chinese Indonesians are increasingly impatient with the inability of the government and military to prevent inter-ethnic violence.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography\n\nOnline sources\n"}

The declaration was drafted in response to HIV/AIDS denialism, and particularly to address South African president Thabo Mbeki's support for AIDS denialists. It was written several weeks prior to the 2000 International AIDS Conference, held in Durban, South Africa from July 9–14, 2000, and was published in the medical journal \"Nature\" to coincide with the Durban conference. The declaration called the evidence that HIV causes AIDS \"clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous\".\n\nEach person who signed the document was required to have a Ph.D. or M.D.-equivalent degree. To avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, scientists \"working for commercial companies were asked not to sign.\" The signatories included eleven Nobel prize winners.\n\nMichael Specter, writing in the \"New Yorker\", called the Durban Declaration \"one of the saddest documents in modern scientific history,\" reflecting concern that Mbeki's embrace of AIDS denialism was a disastrous response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic. Mbeki's government reportedly pressured South African scientists not to sign the document, and initially dismissed the Durban declaration. Health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang called it \"elitist\", while Mbeki's spokesperson said it belonged in a \"dustbin\".\n\nSeveral AIDS denialists criticized the Declaration in a letter to the editor of \"Nature\", casting the issue as an abridgement of their rights to free speech and an intolerance of \"alternative\" viewpoints. In response, \"Nature\" later published a letter detailing inaccurate claims made by AIDS denialists in their attacks on the Declaration, and a second satirical letter from two AIDS researchers, stating: \"We are staunch believers in the right to free speech, but is \"Nature\" the appropriate place to militate in favour of the pre-Copernican model of the universe or the existence of phlogiston?\"\n\nIn 2008, independent estimates by public health experts attributed over 300,000 preventable South African AIDS deaths and nearly 200,000 new HIV infections to government policies based on the AIDS denialist assertions criticised by the Durban Declaration.\n\n"}

Each polling station is staffed with multiple officials. The duties include signing in registered voters, explaining voting procedure and use of voting equipment, providing ballots, and monitoring the conduct of the election. In US states with Election Day voter registration, they also register unregistered voters on election day. In most other countries, however, voters do not need to register, all citizens being automatically included in the lists of eligible voters. Depending on the jurisdiction, election officials are chosen by a board of elections, county official (such as the county clerk or county auditor), city or township official (such as a city clerk), the federal state, or a national committee. \n\nIn California, poll workers can be any citizen who requests the job at least two months prior to an election. Inspectors and site supervisors receive a minimum of two training classes, and clerks are required to attend a training class within two weeks of the election, with additional certification classes for any machine or technological devices to be used. These classes cover a wide range of topics, including opening and closing of the polls, which color pen to use on which paper, dealing with irate voters, and the rare times when a voter can be challenged.\n\nIn 41 of the 50 United States, high school students can serve as student election judges.

E2E systems often employ cryptographic methods to craft receipts that allow voters to verify that their votes were counted as cast, without revealing which candidates were voted for. As such, these systems are sometimes referred to as receipt-based systems. \n\nElectronic voting systems arrive at their final vote totals by a series of steps: \n\nClassical approaches to election integrity tended to focus on mechanisms that operated at each step on the chain from voter intent to final total. Voting is an example of a distributed system, and in general, distributed system designers have long known that such local focus may miss some vulnerabilities while over-protecting others. The alternative is to use end-to-end measures that are designed to guard the integrity of the entire chain.\n\nThe failure of current optical scan voting systems to meet\nreasonable end-to-end standards was pointed out in 2002. \n\nComprehensive coverage of election integrity frequently involves multiple stages. Voters are expected to verify that they have marked their ballots as intended, we use recounts or audits to protect the step from marked ballots to ballot-box totals, and we use publication of all subtotals to allow public verification that the overall totals correctly sum the local totals.\n\nWhile measures such as voter verified paper audit trails and manual recounts increase the effectiveness of our defenses, they offer only weak protection of the integrity of the physical or electronic ballot boxes. Ballots could be removed, replaced, or could have marks added to them (\"i.e.,\"to fill in undervoted contests with votes for a desired candidate or to overvote and spoil votes for undesired candidates). This shortcoming motivated the development of the end-to-end auditable voting systems discussed here, sometimes referred to as \"E2E voting systems\". These attempt to cover the entire path from voter attempt to election totals with just two measures:\n\nBecause of the importance of the right to a secret ballot, some E2E voting schemes also attempt to meet a third requirement, usually referred to as \"receipt freeness\":\n\nA researcher has argued that end-to-end auditability and receipt-freeness should be considered to be orthogonal properties. Other researchers have shown that these properties can co-exist, and these properties are combined in the 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines promulgated by the Election Assistance Commission. This definition is also predominant in the academic literature.\n\nTo address ballot stuffing, the following measure can be adopted:\n\n\nAlternatively, assertions regarding ballot stuffing can be externally verified by comparing the number of votes cast with the number of registered voters who voted, and by auditing other aspects of the registration and ballot delivery system.\n\nSupport for E2E auditability, based on prior experience using it with in-person elections, is also seen as a requirement for remote voting over the Internet by many experts.\n\nThe city of Takoma Park, Maryland used Scantegrity II for its 2009 and 2011 city elections.\n\nThe STAR-Vote system was under development for Travis County, the fifth most populous county in Texas, where the state capital, Austin, is. Development ended in 2017, because no contractor was willing to bid an open-source system meeting criteria in the request for proposals.\n\nIn 2004, David Chaum proposed a solution that allows a voter to verify that the vote is cast appropriately and that the vote is accurately counted using visual cryptography. After the voter selects their candidates, a DRE machine prints out a specially formatted version of the ballot on two transparencies. When the layers are stacked, they show the human-readable vote. However, each transparency is encrypted with a form of visual cryptography so that it alone does not reveal any information unless it is decrypted. The voter selects one layer to destroy at the poll. The DRE retains an electronic copy of the other layer and gives the physical copy as a receipt to allow the voter to confirm that the electronic ballot was not later changed. The system guards against changes to the voter's ballot and uses a mix-net decryption procedure to ensure that each vote is accurately counted. Sastry, Karloff and Wagner pointed out that there are issues with both of the Chaum and VoteHere cryptographic solutions.\n\nChaum's team subsequently developed Punchscan, which has stronger security properties and uses simpler paper ballots. The paper ballots are voted on and then a privacy-preserving portion of the ballot is scanned by an optical scanner.\n\nThe Prêt à Voter system, invented by Peter Ryan, uses a shuffled candidate order and a traditional mix network. As in Punchscan, the votes are made on paper ballots and a portion of the ballot is scanned.\n\nThe Scratch and Vote system, invented by Ben Adida, uses a scratch-off surface to hide cryptographic information that can be used to verify the correct printing of the ballot.\n\nThe ThreeBallot voting protocol, invented by Ron Rivest, was designed to provide some of the benefits of a cryptographic voting system without using cryptography. It can in principle be implemented on paper although the presented version requires an electronic verifier.\n\nThe Scantegrity and Scantegrity II systems provide E2E properties, however instead of being a replacement of the entire voting system, as is the case in all the preceding examples, it works as an add-on for existing optical scan voting systems. Scantegrity II employs invisible ink and was developed by a team that included Chaum, Rivest, and Ryan. \n\nThe STAR-vote system under development for Travis County, Texas is another way to combine an E2E system with conventionally auditable paper ballots, produced in this case by a ballot marking device.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4239005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4239005", "title": "Formative context", "text": "Formative context\n\nFormative contexts are the institutional and imaginative arrangements that shape a society's conflicts and resolutions. They are the structures that limit both the practice and the imaginative possibilities in a socio-political order, and in doing so shape the routines of conflict over social, political and economic resources that govern access to labor, loyalty, and social station, e.g. government power, economic capital, technological expertise, etc. In a formative context, the institutions structure conflict over government power and capital allocation, whereas the imaginative framework shapes the preconceptions about possible forms of human interaction. Through this, a formative context further creates and sustains a set of roles and ranks, which mold conflict over the mastery of resources and the shaping of the ideas of social possibilities, identities and interests. The formative context of the Western democracies, for example, include the organization of production through managers and laborers, a set of laws administering capital, a state in relation to the citizen, and a social division of labor.\n\nAlso referred to as order, framework, or structure of social life, the concept of formative context was developed by philosopher and social theorist Roberto Unger. Whereas other social and political philosophers have taken the historical context as a given, and seen one existing set of institutional arrangements as necessarily giving birth to another set, Unger rejects this naturalization of the world and moves to explain how such contexts are made and reproduced. The most forceful articulation and development of the concept is in Unger's book \"False Necessity.\" \n\nThe thesis of formative context is central to Unger's theory of false necessity, which rejects the idea of a closed number of institutional arrangements of human societies, e.g. feudalism and capitalism, and that these arrangements are the product of historical necessity, as theories of liberalism or Marxism claim. Rather, Unger argues that there are myriad institutional arrangements that can coalesce, and that they do so through a contingent process of struggle, reconciliation, and innovation among individuals and groups. For Unger, the concept of formative context serves to explain the basis of a certain set of institutional arrangements and their reliance upon each other. It offers an explanation of the cycles of reform and retrenchment of a socio-economic political system and how it remains undisturbed by rivalries and animosities. The theory of false necessity goes on to explain the connections of a formative context, their making and remaking, and how they maintain stability despite the contingent formation.\n\nWhile a formative context of a society exerts a major influence on the course of social actions and behaviors, it is itself hard to challenge, revise, or even identify in the midst of everyday conflicts and routines. Thus there are two criteria for determining if an institution or structure belongs in a formative context, one subjective and one objective. The subjective criteria considers the perspective of the social actors themselves and the arrangements that are assumed in their speech and actions. For example, the attempts of big business and labor to protect themselves through deals with each other, and the political efforts of unorganized labor and petty bourgeoisie to undermine and circumvent these deals by pressuring the government, operate on the same institutional assumption of the distinction between economy and polity, and that victory in one can be offset by the other. The objective criteria is simply that if a substitution of the proposed structure affects the hierarchies or cyclical conflicts—if it alters the social divisions—then it can be included in the formative context. For example, a change in any one of the following conditions would completely change the formative context of a Western democratic state: if the state stopped being democratic or was democratic enough to allow collective militancy and subject private centers of power to public accountability; if business could have its way and override all regulatory controls of govt; or if no workers could unionize or all of them could and did.\n\nThe formative context of the North Atlantic democracies can be organized into four clusters of institutional arrangements: work, law, government, and occupational structure. \n\nThe thesis of formative contexts has been heavily drawn on and used within the Social Study of Information Systems. In the field of Information systems Claudio Ciborra and Giovan Lanzara define the term \"formative context\" as the \"set of institutional arrangements and cognitive imageries that inform actors' practical and reasoning routines in organisations\". They posit that the common inability to inquire into, challenge or shape formative context can inhibit individuals and organizations from acting competently and learning what they need to know in order to make the most of situations and technological transitions as the enchaining effect of Formative Context can lead to cognitive and social inertia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2709053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2709053", "title": "Francisco de Carvajal", "text": "Francisco de Carvajal\n\nFrancisco de Carvajal (1464 – 10 April 1548) was a Spanish military officer, conquistador, and explorer remembered as \"the demon of the Andes\" due to his brutality and uncanny military skill in the Peruvian civil wars of the 16th century.\n\nCarvajal's career as a soldier in Europe spanned forty years and a half-dozen wars. Fighting in Spain's Imperial armies—the famous \"tercios\"—he served under Charles V's principal commanders in the Italian Wars: Pedro Navarro, Fabrizio Colonna, and the illustrious \"Gran Capitán\", Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. He took part in the memorable Spanish victory at the Battle of Pavia in 1525 and acquired a small fortune when the Imperial armies sacked Rome two years later.\n\nIn the 1540s, the octogenarian Carvajal travelled to the Spanish West Indies and from there accepted a military commission with the Pizarro brothers in Peru, eventually backing Gonzalo Pizarro's unsuccessful rebellion against the officials of the Spanish Crown. Carvajal proved a tireless soldier and successful strategist. He was ultimately captured in battle by royalist forces on April 9, 1548 and executed at the age of 84.\n\nBorn \"Francisco López Gascón\" in Rágama de Arévalo, Salamanca, Carvajal was admitted to the University of Salamanca only to return home in disgrace after a series of public scandals. Disinherited, Carvajal enlisted in the Castilian infantry bound for Italy to fight in Charles V's wars. He was present as an \"alférez\" when the mutinous Imperial army stormed Rome in 1527. However, instead competing in the violent plunder for gold and valuables, Carvajal seized legal documents belonging to a ranking Roman notary and ransomed them for a small fortune.\n\nCarvajal later used these funds to journey to Mexico as an aide to its first Spanish viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza. In 1535, he was dispatched to Peru to the relief of newly founded Lima, then under siege by an Inca army. Carvajal led reinforcements to Governor Francisco Pizarro and thereafter played a key role in reestablishing Pizarro's rule against the rival faction of conquistadors led by Almagro the Younger. He continued to lead his cavalry from the front ranks despite his age and obesity and became something of a local legend for his composure in battle. At Chupas, seeing the Imperial Spanish infantry giving way before a hail of fire from Almagro's massed cannons and harquebusiers, Carvajal is said to have ridden to the front of the line and, casting his helmet and cuirass to the ground, exclaimed, \n\nInspired by their corpulent commander, Carvajal's men advanced on the enemy guns and carried Almagro's troops before them.\n\nWhen the royal authority moved against Pizarro in 1546, Carvajal, unable to quit the country due to the embargo on shipping, took command again in the field as Pizarro's lieutenant, or \"Maestro de Campo\" of Nueva Castilla's armies. In the campaign of 1546 Carvajal violently put down the royalist forces in the south of the colony, marching and countermarching from Quito to San Miguel, from Lima to Guamanga and back to Lima, from Lucanas to Cuzco, from Collao to Arequipa and from Arequipa to Charcas.\n\nCarvajal was sentenced to death by the royalists after being wounded and captured at the Battle of Jaquijahuana. American historian William H. Prescott collected a number of details about the execution, claiming that Carvajal was not gravely troubled by the sentence, remarking simply, \"basta matar\": \"They can only kill me.\" He refused confession offered by the priests and did not accept his last rites, asking:\n\nAccording to Prescott, Carvajal did admit guests throughout his last day but treated his interlocutors to his usual cutting sarcasm. When a former enemy, once vanquished in battle by Carvajal, came to offer his services to the condemned rebel, Carvajal rebuked him caustically:\n\nCarvajal's only complaint emerged when his executioners arrived to carry him to the place of execution. Upon being bound and forced into a narrow basket, Carvajal exclaimed, \"¡Niño en cuna y viejo en cuna!\"—\"Cradles for infants and now cradles for old men as well!\" Carvajal's severed head was exhibited on a pike next to Pizarro's at the gates of Lima.\n\nCarvajal remains a folkloric character in Peru: One legend made him the illegitimate son of the Spanish-Italian tyrant Cesare Borgia; Ricardo Palma pointed out in the \"Tradiciones peruanas\" that Carvajal was in fact Borgia's senior by 10 years, their only parentage, he added, being \"that of cruelty.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "41047612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41047612", "title": "Free, prior and informed consent", "text": "Free, prior and informed consent\n\nThe aim of Free Prior Informed consent (FPIC), is to establish bottom up participation and consultation of an Indigenous Population prior to the beginning of a development on ancestral land or using resources within the Indigenous Population's territory. Indigenous people (IP) have a special connection to their land and resources, they inhabit 20% of the earth's surface, these areas are environmentally rich in both renewable and non-renewable resources. The collective ownership style of most Indigenous Peoples conflicts with the modern global market and its continuous need for resources and land. To protect Indigenous peoples rights, international human rights law has created process and standards to safeguard their way of life and to encourage participation in the decision making process. One of these methods is the process of FPIC.\nThere is criticism that many international conventions and treaties only require consultation and not consent, which is a much higher threshold. Without the requirement for consent Indigenous People are not able to veto government projects and developments in their area which directly affects their lives and cultures. FPIC allows Indigenous Peoples to have the right to self-determination and self-governance in national and local government decision making process over projects that concern their lives and resources.\n\nExamples include natural resource management, economic development, uses of traditional knowledge, genetic resources, health care, and education.\n\nThe United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) has defined the concept of Free Prior Informed Consent as the following:\n\nThe UNPFII requires that Indigenous People should be consulted in a way which is appropriate for their customs. This means that not every member will have to agree. This has been criticised by some [women's rights] groups. The Indigenous People will determine who is to be consulted and must effectively communicate this with the Government and Developers. It is the duty of the state to make sure that FPIC has been carried out, if it has not then it is their issue to redress, not the company or the people wishing to carry out the project. The International Labour Organization requires that consultation takes place in a climate of mutual trust and circumstances are considered appropriate if they create favourable conditions for reaching agreement and consent.\nIn a pilot study by the UN-Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation UN-REDD of FPIC application in Vietnam the following steps were required;\n\nThe principle of FPIC within international development is most clearly stated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Article 10 states:\n\n\"Indigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from their lands or territories. No relocation shall take place without the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return. \" \n\nArticles 11, 19, 28, and 29 of the declaration also explicitly use the term. It is further established in international conventions, notably the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. Countries including Peru, Australia, and the Philippines have included FPIC in their national law.\n\nThe role of indigenous peoples' FPIC in decisions about infrastructure or extractive industries developed on their ancestral domain is an issue within international law. Projects lacking FPIC are called development aggression by indigenous peoples. The issue of indigenous peoples' lack of access to accountability and grievance mechanisms to address human rights violations has been formally raised with the United Nations Human Rights Council. Asian Indigenous peoples have urged the UN to address this before the economic integration of ASEAN in 2015, given the human rights records of member states such as Myanmar and Laos, which are among the world's most repressive societies.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) [] has been working with indigenous people since the 1920s, it currently has 187 member states, including New Zealand. ILO Convention 169 (the Convention) [] on Indigenous and tribal peoples is an international treaty adopted by the ILO in 1989. The Convention aims to overcome discriminatory practices affecting Indigenous People and enable them in the decision making process. The fundamental foundations of the Convention are participation and consultation. The requirement for consultation falls upon the Government of the state and not on private persons or companies, this may be delegated but ultimately the responsibility rests on the government. The need for consultation of IPs is written throughout the Convention a number of times and is referred to in : Articles 6, 7, 16 and 22. Article 6(1) states that governments should: \n\" “Consult the peoples concerned, through appropriate procedures and in particular through their representative institutions, whenever consideration is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect them directly\" \"'\n\nArticle 6 (2) states that this consultation will be carried out in good faith and in a form that is appropriate to the circumstances. The aim of this consultation process is to achieve an agreement or consent to the purposed development. \nThe Convention does not allow Indigenous People to veto any developments; the condition is for mere consultation not consent. The supervisor bodies of the ILO have stated that the consultation process cannot only be information sharing that there must be a chance for the Indigenous People to influence the decision making process. If consent is not achieved the nation-state must still respect other areas of the convention that include the Indigenous peoples right to their lands. Such as Article 16 (2) requires that free informed consent must be given where is the relocation of people. The treaty is legally binding on all states that ratify it, if a state chooses to ratify they may need to adjust domestic legislation. In nations such as NZ domestic legislation such as the Resource Management Act 1991 refers to the need to consider in developments Maori relationship with land and water sites. This spiritual and practical connection that Maori have to the land has been considered in a number cases before the court including the supreme court case of \"Paki v Attorney General\".\n\nThe United Nations describes FPIC both directly and indirectly in numerous conventions and treaties. One of the most direct is located in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), Article 19 states: \n\n\" \"States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the Indigenous Peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them. ”\"\nArticle 32 of UNDRIP requires that consultation is carried out with Indigenous Peoples before states can undertake projects that will affect Indigenous People Rights to land, territory and resources The above Articles only requires Consultation, however Article 10 requires that there is informed consent before the relocation Indigenous Peoples from their land. This allows Indigenous People the right to decide where they live and gives them the power stop any development which they disagree with.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is the most universally accepted standard of Human Rights. It does not directly mention FPIC but it does express the importance of Self- determination of all Peoples in Article 1. Article 7 declares that all are equal before the law, this means that one person has no more right to another in a nation, this is further endorsed by Article 17 which states that every person has the right to own property and that he shall not be arbitrary deprived of his property. The right for Self-determination is further protected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), in Article 1 of both Documents. This includes economic self-determination, which for many IP is the control of their natural resources. \nThe ICCPR in Article 27 states that minorities shall not be denied access to their culture, in the Human Rights Committee (HRC) in General Comment 23, have found this meaning to include the right of Indigenous People to their land and resources. The HRC has interpreted this to mean that states have a positive duty to engage with IP prior to any development or granting of resource concession in IP lands.\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the supervisory body of the ICESCR, has even stated in their general comment No.23 that if Indigenous People's land has been taken without informed prior consent then they have the right to restitution or the return of their land or resources. This comes from their interpretation of Article 15 of the ICESCR . Article 15 protects Indigenous People's right to participate in their cultural life. The Comment by the CESCR is important as it goes beyond mere consultation. The need for FPIC has also been called upon by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) which requires that no state shall make a decision concerning the rights of IPs without their consent. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) encourages Indigenous Peoples participation in decision making. However these are not legally binding decisions, only recommendations \n\nThe World Bank was one of the first multilateral financial institutions to create guidelines to protect the rights of Indigenous People's in the 1980s, when it recognized that development negatively impacted the lives and cultures of Indigenous People. Its first policy was in 1987. It was designed by Bank staff without consultation of Indigenous People and was a statement on the need to protect Indigenous People's. Then in 1991 the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 document acknowledged the need for participation of Indigenous People in the consultation process.\n\nThe subsequent World Bank Policy on indigenous peoples was released in 2005, OP 4.10 focused on the reduction of poverty. In doing so the bank identified the intrinsic link that Indigenous People have with the land and the need for a consultation process which fully respects the human rights, human dignity, economics and culture of the people involved. The Bank stated that it will not lend money to a state or company unless there has been Free Prior Informed Consultation with the local Indigenous Population and that there is broad community support for the development.\nCritics have questioned why the term \"consultation\" has been used as opposed to consent. Stating that it means IP are not able to decline a project if they do not agree with it. Furthermore, \"community\" is an ambiguous term.\nIn August 2016 the World Bank adopted its new Environmental and Social Standards, including Environmental and Social Standard 7 (ESS7) on Indigenous Peoples/Sub-Saharan African Historically Underserved Traditional Local Communities (IPs), which requires Free Prior Informed Consent if the project will:\n\nDuring the UNFCCC climate change negotiations on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), it was noted that the United Nations General Assembly had adopted UNDRIP, meaning that the Declaration and its FPIC provision applied to the negotiations. This reference was made in the context of a so-called safeguard for REDD+, specifically the instruction to have \"respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities\" when undertaking REDD+ activities.\n\nFollowing this, FPIC has been widely applied for demonstration projects on REDD+, particularly after the United Nations REDD Programme published a report on its efforts to develop a methodology for FPIC for REDD+ in the case of its country program in Vietnam. Early in 2013, the global United Nations REDD Programme issued guidelines for the application of FPIC, including an analysis of jurisprudence on FPIC in various contexts, that are mandatory for all UN-REDD country programmes.\n\nBolivia ratified ILO Convention 169 and in 2007 it also formally incorporated UNDRIP into its municipal law. In 2009 the nation also included the duty to consult Indigenous People's in its constitution, this is however a much less radical version of the draft, which required that consent be given for the exploration of all resource activities. These legal requirements are very significant in a nation that has a wealth of natural resources and a large Indigenous Population. The risk of giving Indigenous People this type of power to veto government projects is an increase social conflict in certain regions. This was seen with the conflict surrounding the Isiboro Se´cure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS). A road was planned through the Park, coca growers were in favour of the project as it would expand their business. The Indigenous Population however opposed the idea, saying that consent should be needed for mega development in Indigenous Peoples territories. The result was large protests in La Paz. The fear was of damage to the vital river system, illegal logging and altering habitats of endangered animals in the area. The state engaged in consultation with the Indigenous Peoples, but this amplified the problem, with activists critiquing the governments lack of legal framework to protect Indigenous People. The government claimed that the expectations of the Indigenous People were unrealistic.\n\n"}

Rondon created the foundation's motto: \"Die if necessary, but never kill.\" Drawing from his Positivism, Rondon led the SPI with the belief that the native Indians should be allowed to develop at their own pace. With state assistance and protection, Indians would eventually integrate into modern society. The SPI then began its mission to \"pacify\" Indian communities by setting up posts in their territories to foster communication and protection. Efforts were initially met by opposition and hostility from Indian groups; there were reports of SPI agents being attacked and shot by arrows. During the 1950s and 1960s, following the death of Rondon, the SPI's officials became corrupt. In 1967 the officials were accused of sexual perversion, abuse, and the massacre of entire tribes by introducing diseases and pesticides, leading to an international outcry for the disbandment of SPI. Following this disbandment, FUNAI was created to take over SPI's responsibilities and remedy the damages caused by corruption.\n\nFUNAI was created by Law No. 5,371, under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and headquartered in Brasilia. On December 19, 1973, Law No. 6001 officially placed Indians under the protection of FUNAI through the Indian Statute. The Indian Statute, while aiming to demarcate all Indian lands by 1978, also had the main goal to integrate Indians into society as soon as possible, so that the Amazon and its people could start contributing economically to Brazilian society. Protection from a government agency is important for Indian populations, but this also means that FUNAI, as a part of the government, has authority to act contrary to the welfare of the Indians. For example, the Indian Statute permitted mining on indigenous lands; a decree in 1983 restricted mining to minerals necessary only for national defense and security, but still allowed private companies to have licenses and use indigenous labor if necessary. Also, in the early 1970s, FUNAI president General Jerônimo Bandeira de Mello approved the plan for a trans-Amazonian highway that would run through Brazil's Amazon to Peru's frontier. This highway granted access to the previously inaccessible interior of the Amazon, allowing government and private agencies to use it for their advantage. The highway led to the relocation and extermination of many indigenous tribes by the government and other private agencies, and logging along the highway directly led to deforestation along the affected parts of the Amazon. Sydney Possuelo was one of the sertanistas/explorers sent to find and relocate the tribes living along the path of the highway. Possuelo and other sertanistas were disturbed by the amount of indigenous deaths their contact caused, and met in 1987 to try to stop it. Possuelo's efforts greatly influenced FUNAI's change in policy from \"pacification\" and integration to preservation.\n\nThe Central Department for Isolated Indians and Recently Contacted Indians is a division within FUNAI to handle dealings with isolated indigenous tribes. Article 231 of the 1988 Constitution expresses indigenous peoples' rights to preserve their culture, traditions, and customs; since contact with mainstream society could jeopardize isolated tribes' culture, FUNAI undertakes efforts to maintain these tribes' isolation. The CGIIRC division is responsible for protecting areas with known isolated tribes from outside contact, since outside contact could spread disease within indigenous communities. The Department is present in 12 regions of Brazil's Amazon region, and almost all of Brazil's known uncontacted tribes reside within already demarcated lands. FUNAI has records of about 107 isolated Indians' presence.\n\nThe Brazilian Constitution of 1988 recognized Indians' rights to practice their customs without pressure to assimilate or integrate into mainstream Brazilian society. Article 231 also defines Indians' rights to their lands, and outlines FUNAI's responsibility to demarcate those lands. The article also provides that mining and other energy resources on indigenous lands is only allowed with the approval of Congress, and after taking into account the Indigenous populations' input. The Constitution set a goal of demarcating indigenous lands in five years, but by 1993 only 291 of 559 indigenous territories were demarcated.\n\nIn 1991, Decree 22 outlined five steps FUNAI must follow to demarcate indigenous lands:\nIn 1996, Brazil's President Cardoso passed Decree 1775, which effectively revoked Decree 22 and expanded the ways that commercial interests could contest the demarcation of lands. Individuals or companies were allowed from the beginning of the demarcation process until 90 days after FUNAI issued their report to submit an appeal showing that the contested lands do not meet the qualifications of indigenous lands as stated in the constitution. The government claimed that allowing people to contest indigenous lands during the demarcation process would prevent any future challenges of completed lands on the basis of unconstitutionality. The decree was widely contested as a violation of indigenous rights, earning the nickname of the \"Genocide Decree,\" due to the power it gave to commercial interests to exploit Indian lands. By April 1996, FUNAI had received over 500 appeals for over 40 indigenous territories that were in the process of being demarcated. FUNAI followed procedure and submitted its official opinion to the Ministry of Justice, rejecting the appeals that were brought against the indigenous lands. Justice Nelson Jobim sided with FUNAI on all except eight territories, ordering further investigation.\n\nOne of these territories was the Raposa/Serra do Sol region in the northern state of Roraima, home to the Macuxi, Wapixanas, Ingaricós, Taurepangs and Patamonas peoples. FUNAI identified almost 1.8 million hectares of these lands to be demarcated in 1977, but opposition from farmers and mining companies in the region prevented completion of its demarcation. After Decree 1775, the claims against the Raposa/Serra do Sol regions were backed by the Roraima state government, which supported breaking up the area into smaller settlements. Despite FUNAI's recommendations to demarcate the entire indigenous region, commercial and state pressure led Justice Nelson Jobim to order the reduction of land under Decree 1775. FUNAI, along with other indigenous rights organizations like the Indigenous Council of Roraima (CIR), Coordination of the Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB), and Council for the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples and Organizations in Brazil (CAPOIB) worked together in opposition to this decision. The land was finally recognized as an indigenous territory in 2005.\n\nOn December 28, 2009, President Luís Inácio (Lula) da Silva signed Presidential Decree 7056, also known as the \"FUNAI Statute\". The decree restructured FUNAI, effectively closing hundreds of indigenous posts and regional FUNAI offices. The government never consulted with indigenous populations, even though under Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization, the government is required to discuss legal changes that would affect indigenous populations. This led to hundreds of indigenous people, deeming themselves the Revolutionary Indigenous Camp, to protest outside the Ministry of Justice building. The protesters called for the resignation of FUNAI president Márcio Augusto Freitas de Meira and the revocation of Decree 7056. Protesters were eventually forcibly removed from their camp outside the Ministry of Justice Building, and the Decree remained in effect, decreasing the quality and efficiency FUNAI could provide to indigenous peoples.\n\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's government approved 81 applications for demarcation, but Dilma Rousseff's government approved only 11 territories from 2011 to 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

Based on the work of the Global Risk Network, the report describes changes occurring in the global risks landscape from year to year and identifies global catastrophic risks. The report also explores the interconnectedness of risks, and considers how the strategies for the mitigation of global risks might be structured. \n\nSources for the report include an assessment by several major insurance and reinsurance companies and focus workshops, interviews and a survey of internationally recognised experts. The report is intended to raise awareness about the need for a multi-stakeholder approach to the mitigation of global risk. \n\n2018\n\nThe Global Risks report 2018 highlights four concerns: (1) persistent inequality and unfairness, (2) domestic and international political tensions, (3) environmental dangers and (4) cyber vulnerabilities. One recurring theme is humanity's inadequate competence in dealing with complex systems and the danger of complacency.\n\nThe Global Risks report 2009 identifies deteriorating fiscal positions, a hard landing in China, a collapse in asset prices, gaps in global governance and issues relating to natural resources and climate as the pivotal risks facing the world this year. While Global Risks 2008 highlighted food security, systemic financial risk and supply chain risk as areas of focus for the short term, Global Risks 2009 focuses on the impact of the financial crisis on levels of economic risk and its implications for other risk areas. The 2009 report stresses the importance of considering the long-term implications of many of the decisions taken today in response to immediate financial and economic challenges. The report also explores how the lack of effective global governance was a factor in the financial crisis and could potentially exacerbate a number of other global risks if not properly addressed.\n\nThe particularity of this Global Risks report is that it considers risks that are global in their nature and impact, such that they would have a widespread impact should they play out. The criteria for what constitutes a global risk have been set as follows:\n\n\nThe Global Risk Network was established in 2004 and tracks the evolution of a set of risks in five areas over a ten year time frame. The five areas are: Economics, Geopolitics, Environment, Society, Technology. In 2009 the set of risks totalled 36, up from 31 in the 2008 taxonomy. Each year the risk set is assessed using quantitative and qualitative means in terms of likelihood and severity to come up with a 'Risk Landscape' of risks to watch in the short to medium term. These include high likelihood and high severity risks, but also low likelihood and high severity risks that constitute 'outliers' whose impact would be significant in the unlikely event they would occur.\nThe Global Risk Network also publishes a selection of regional and topical reports each year. Its latest publications include: India@Risk 2008, Europe@Risk 2008, Global Growth@Risk 2008, and Africa@Risk 2008.\n\n"}

The work criticises Christianity and the then-burgeoning technocracy movement from a materialist, anarchist and individualist perspective. Early editions contained rewrites by Carlo Cafiero and Élisée Reclus in order to make the work more poetic in the translated French and due to misreadings, but later translations have attempted to remain more faithful to the original text. It has gone on to become Bakunin's most widely read and praised work.\n\n\"God and the State\" was written in February and March 1871. It was originally written as Part II of a greater work that was going to be called \"The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution\". Part I was to deal with the background of the Franco-Prussian War and a general history of European resistance to imperialism. \"God and the State\", like most of Bakunin's work, is unfinished and disjointed. When Bakunin was criticized on this he said, \"My life is a fragment.\" \"God and the State\" is indeed a fragment; the book has paragraphs that drop out and pick up in mid-sentence, footnotes that are four or five paragraphs long, and the book itself stops abruptly in mid-sentence.\n\n\"God and the State\" was discovered by Carlo Cafiero and Élisée Reclus, two prominent anarchists at the time, and close friends of Bakunin around the time of his death. The two looked tirelessly for the missing parts of the book, but had no success. They translated the book into French and distributed it as a pamphlet in Geneva in 1882. Cafiero and Reclus titled the book \"Dieu et l'état\" (God and the State) although Bakunin originally titled the book \"The Historical Sophisms of the Doctrinaire School of Communism\". The book's original title was not discovered in Bakunin's diary until after Cafiero and Reclus's deaths.\n\nIn 1883, the American anarchist Benjamin Tucker translated the book into English and distributed it in pamphlet form throughout Boston. He ran into many problems, however, because when Cafiero and Reclus translated the original manuscript into French, they sometimes changed words around to give the French a more literary quality, and often misread Bakunin's handwriting.\nThe first number of \"The Anarchist\" published in 1885 in London by Henry Seymour held an announcement of a translation into English by Marie Le Compte.\nThe International Publishing Company announced that the profits would go to the Red Cross of the Russian Revolutionary Party.\n\nA correct French translation was released in 1908, and a new English edition was released in London in 1910. In 1916, the Lithuanian-born anarchist Emma Goldman released a re-print of the 1910 London edition for the radical journal \"Mother Earth\". Since \"God and the State's\" first publication it has been one of Bakunin's greatest known works. It has been translated into many languages including English, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Polish, Greek, Czech, Georgian Romanian, Turkish and Yiddish.\n\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\n"}

{"id": "3280220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3280220", "title": "Green libertarianism", "text": "Green libertarianism\n\nGreen libertarianism (also known as eco-libertarianism) is a hybrid political philosophy that has developed in the United States. Based upon a mixture of political third party values, such as the environmental and economic platform from the Green Party and the civil liberties platform of the Libertarian Party, the green libertarian philosophy attempts to consolidate progressive or agrarian values with libertarianism. While green libertarians have tended to associate with the Green Party, the movement has grown to encompass economic liberals who advocate free markets and commonly identify with contemporary American libertarianism.\n\nLeft-libertarian political philosophy, like that of the greens, is historically rooted in the individualist and social schools of anarchism. Anarcho-communist theorist Peter Kropotkin, a Russian prince and leading opponent of \"laissez-faire\" social Darwinism, developed a theory of how \"mutual aid\" is the real basis for social organization in his \"Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution\" (see also Proudhonian mutualism). Murray Bookchin and the Institute for Social Ecology sought to further elaborate these ideas. Bookchin was one of the main influences behind the formation of the German Green Party, the first green party to win seats in state and national parliaments.\n\nSome more moderate, green libertarians are both egalitarian and democratic. New England Transcendentalism (especially Henry David Thoreau and Bronson Alcott) and German Romanticism, the Pre-Raphaelites and other \"back to nature\" movements combined with anti-war, anti-industrialism, civil liberties and decentralization movements are all part of this tradition. The modern Green Party of the United States seeks to apply these ideas to a more pragmatic system of democratic governance as opposed to contemporary right or left anarchism.\n\nSustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins posited in their book \"\" (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits. The 2006 book \"Green to Gold\", written by environmental scholars Daniel C. Esty and Andrew S. Winston, provided ideas on how companies can apply the principles of green libertarianism.\n\nThe work of Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek is especially important to understanding the organic view of society and how most human institutions, including law and the economy, are \"the result of human action but not of human design\". In his last major work, \"Law, Legislation and Liberty\", Hayek differentiates between endogenous orders or self-organizing systems and exogenous orders imposed from without.\n\nHayek argues that free and sustainable societies and economies which support them should follow general guidelines, such as \"7th Generation Principle\" rather than specific economic laws and regulations.\n\nA fundamental concern among green libertarians is the health of global ecology and carrying capacity in view of climate adaptation. The green libertarian philosophy recognizes that ecology and economics are inseparable. It seeks a system of effective environmental law that is compatible with civil liberties and market economy.\n\nGreen libertarians believe there should be a clear distinction between science and political ideology. For example, a green libertarian might be concerned by the phrases such as \"wealth redistribution\" and \"reducing poverty\" in the Stern Review and in some Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change documents and statements. Among green libertarians, the preservation of civil and economic individual freedom may take precedence over long-term climate concerns because ultimately humans are part of nature. They believe that natural ecologies, like the free markets, are dynamic and self-adjusting systems.\n\nAs part of the libertarian tradition, green libertarians maintain that the government itself is responsible for most environmental degradation, either directly or by encouraging and protecting politically powerful corporations and other organized interests which degrade, pollute and deplete the natural environment. The government should be thus held accountable to all the same environmental regulations they place on businesses. One problem is that while private corporations or individuals can be sued under the common law for damaging the environment, the government protects itself from the same suits, therefore green libertarians call for the abolition of sovereign immunity. Increasingly, federal and state law is being amended by lobbyists for those who pollute or extract resources from public lands or waterways so that such actions can no longer be challenged in the courts.\n\nThe green libertarian philosophy supports constitutionally limited government, grassroots democracy and decentralized minarchism. Although many in the movement oppose government regulation of business, believing it to be generally counterproductive, they contend that different legal and economic principles such as full-cost accounting or \"internalizing externalities\" – rather than government regulations – would be more effective at remedying problems such as pollution. A central tenet of a libertarian environmentalist stance is that corporate externalities are not priced into the market correctly, creating market distortions in the valuation and price of goods, healthy living and the value of the environment. Greenhouse gases should be taxed directly according to a formula which calculates the negative costs to the global environment of burning more non-renewable fossil fuels. This approach, it is argued, also has the advantage of providing the correct price signals to utilities and other energy consumers so that they can rapidly convert to more environmentally friendly technologies. The Rocky Mountain Institute advocates this kind of market-based environmental protection strategy.\n\n"}

It was described in its Declaration of Independence as a \"Jewish state\" – the legal definition \"Jewish and democratic state\" was adopted in 1985. In addition to its Jewish majority, Israel is home to religious and ethnic minorities, some of whom report discrimination. In the Palestinian territories, successive Israeli governments have been subject to international criticism from other countries as well as international human rights groups. One of the Basic Laws of Israel, intended to form the basis of a future constitution, , is a major tool for safeguarding human rights and civil liberties in the State of Israel.\n\nAccording to the 2015 US Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Israel faces significant human rights problems regarding institutional discrimination of Arab citizens of Israel (many of whom self-identify as Palestinian), Ethiopian Israelis and women, and the treatment of refugees and irregular migrants. Other human rights problems include institutional discrimination against non-Orthodox Jews and intermarried families, and labor rights abuses against foreign workers.\nDespite criticism of its human rights record, Israel is seen as being more politically free and democratic than neighboring countries in the Middle East.\n\nThe Council of the League of Nations adopted a resolution on 4 September 1931 regarding the general conditions required before the mandate regime could be brought to an end. The new government was to provide an oral or written declaration acknowledging acceptance of an obligation to constitutionally guarantee the equal rights of ethnic and religious minorities. That resolution followed a longstanding precedent of international law in cases where the Great Powers had assisted in the restoration of sovereignty over a territory. The UN resolution on \"The Future Government of Palestine\" contained both a plan of partition and a Minority Protection Plan.\nIt placed minority, women's, and religious rights under the protection of the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. The plan provided specific guarantees of fundamental human rights. The new states were to supply a declaration, which according to precedent was tantamount to a treaty.\nThe resolution stated that \"the stipulations contained in the declarations are recognized as fundamental laws of State, and no law, regulation or official action shall conflict or interfere with these stipulations, nor shall any law, regulation or official action prevail over them.\" The resolution also required that the constitution of each state embody the rights contained in the Declaration.\n\nDuring the hearings on Israel's application for membership in the United Nations, Abba Eban said that the rights stipulated in UN resolution 181(II) had been constitutionally embodied as the fundamental law of the state of Israel as required by the resolution. The instruments that he cited during the hearings were the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, and various cables and letters of confirmation addressed to the Secretary General.\nEban's explanations and Israel's undertakings were noted in the text of General Assembly Resolution 273 (III) Admission of Israel to membership in the United Nations, 11 May 1949.\n\nThe Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel proclaimed, on 14 May 1948, that \"the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in its own country\" was recognized in the Balfour Declaration of 2 November 1917, and re-affirmed in the Mandate of the League of Nations which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the Jewish people and \"Eretz-Israel [Land of Israel] and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home.\" It also declared that the state \"will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of the Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\"\n\nSome British academics argue that Israel has not fulfilled its obligation to constitutionally protect minority rights.\n\nIn 1950, Israel was admitted to the United Nations in accordance with General Assembly resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949. The Israeli Supreme Court has ruled that the Declaration of Independence is not a constitution and cannot be used to invalidate laws and regulations that contradict it.\n\n, states that fundamental human rights in Israel shall be upheld in the spirit of the principles set forth in the Declaration, but it specifically exempted legislation that was already in force. Israeli legal scholars say that the wording of the law was adopted to avoid the difficulty of giving priority to equality, which was not expressly entrenched. The result is that the principle of equality can be reversed by ordinary legislation, and furthermore will not override statutory or judge-made laws.\n\nThe United Nations and its subsidiary organs say that Israel has a binding legal obligation that flows from resolution 181(II) and that the United Nations has a permanent responsibility in the matter.\n\nIsrael is committed to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights international treaty in regard to freedom, political rights and civil liberties.\n\nThe 2013 \"Freedom in the World\" annual survey and report by US-based Freedom House, which attempts to measure the degree of democracy and political freedom in every nation, ranked Israel along with Tunisia as the Middle East and North Africa's only free countries.\n\nIsraeli citizens and human rights organizations have criticized the Israeli government for assailing civil society organizations and human rights activists in recent years. According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), Israel's oldest and largest civil liberties organization, a series of Israeli government efforts in recent years have attacked Israeli civil society and the Supreme Court of Israel. A December 2017 ACRI report presents what it views as examples of persistent Israeli government attack against Israeli democracy, human rights, the right to protest, respect for the underlying value of equality, and the liberties of political, social and ethnic minorities. This trend in Israel has been called \"constitutional retrogression\" by some legal analysts.\n\nAccording to the 2015 US Department of State report on Israel, \"The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government in free and fair periodic elections based on universal and equal suffrage, and citizens exercised this ability.\" Elections held in March 2015 were considered free and fair by observers. A change in the electoral threshold was criticized as limiting representation of small parties, particularly affecting the Arab minority. This resulted in the four Arab-majority parties uniting into one faction, the Joint List, which won 13 seats and became the third-largest faction in the Knesset. Most Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories live under Israeli occupation and are not Israeli citizens. They are not allowed to vote in Israel.\n\nWomen faced significant cultural barriers in political parties representing conservative religious movements and, to a lesser degree, the Arab minority. In the 2015 election, the 120-member Knesset had 29 female members and 15 Arab members. Three women were appointed to the cabinet, and for the first time an Arab Israeli chaired a permanent committee.\n\nAlthough Israel describes itself as a Jewish state, all religious groups have freedom to practice and maintain communal institutions in Israel. According to the 2009 US Department of State report on Israel and the occupied territories, \"The Israeli Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty provides for freedom of worship and the Government generally respected this right in practice.\" The report added that \"Government policy continued to support the generally free practice of religion, although governmental and legal discrimination against non-Jews and non-Orthodox streams of Judaism continued\" and \"Many Jewish citizens objected to exclusive Orthodox control over fundamental aspects of their personal lives.\" The report stated that approximately 310,000 citizens who immigrated to Israel under the Law of Return are not considered Jewish by the Orthodox Rabbinate and therefore cannot be married or divorced, or buried in Jewish state cemeteries within the country.\n\nAfter gaining control of the West Bank in 1967, Israel guaranteed Muslim access to mosques, including the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and Christian access to churches. Israel has extended protection to religious sites of non-Jewish religions; most famously the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) foiled a Kach party attempt to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and continue to protect this site from attacks by non-Muslims. At times, the observances of holy days by various religions has the potential to cause conflict; thus Israeli police take measures to avoid friction between communities by issuing temporary restrictions on movement and audible worship. The 1967 Protection of Holy Sites Law protects all holy sites, but the government has implemented regulations only for 137 Jewish sites, leaving many Muslim and Christian sites neglected, inaccessible, or threatened by property development.\n\nThe city of Jerusalem has given financial support to Muslim religious activities as well has giving them facilities for their use. Israel does not give funding to some religious communities including Protestants.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith (in 1960) maintains the seat of their governing bodies, the Universal House of Justice, in Haifa. Buddhism is also active as a religion in Israel.\n\nAccording to a 2009 report from the US Department of State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Israel falls short of being a tolerant or pluralistic society. According to the report, Israel discriminates against Muslims, Jehovah's Witnesses, Reform Jews, Christians, women and Bedouins. All 137 official holy sites recognized by Israel are Jewish, ignoring and neglecting Christian and Muslim sites.\n\nThe Pew Research Center has published studies of social hostilities by country. The Social Hostilities Index (SHI) measures acts of religious hostility by private individuals, organizations, and social groups. This includes mob or sectarian violence, harassment over attire for religious reasons and other religion-related intimidation or abuse. The Social Hostilities Index (SHI) measures acts of religious hostility by individuals, organizations and social groups. \"This includes mob or sectarian violence, harassment over attire for religious reasons, and other religion-related intimidation or abuse.\" In 2007, Israel was one of 10 countries with a score over 7.1 on a scale of 10; in 2010, Israel and the Palestinian territories were two of the 15 areas with the highest SHI scores.\n\nA couple wishing to marry can do so through a religious ceremony, if Jewish, Muslim, Christian, or other. Non-religious couples, since 2014, can have a kind of civil marriage in Israel, and get through New Family Organization a Relationships Card that changes their status to a couple, and entitles them with all of the rights that come from it. Common-law marriage gives couples the same rights as married couples enjoy. Israeli citizens may also travel abroad for a civil marriage, which is then binding under Israeli law.\n\nDuring the Al-Aqsa Intifada in 2003, the Knesset made a temporary amendment to the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law which prohibited Palestinians married to Israelis from gaining Israeli citizenship or residency. Critics argue that the law is racist because it is targeted at Israeli Arabs who are far more likely to have Palestinian spouses than other Israelis; defenders say the law is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and preserving the Jewish character of Israel. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination unanimously approved a resolution saying that the Israeli law violated an international human rights treaty against racism. The Israeli Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Yaakov Levy, said the resolution was \"highly politicized\", citing the committee's failure to grant Israel's request to present evidence of the \"legislation's compliance with existing international law and practice\", examples of \"numerous concrete instances [in which the] granting of a legal status to Palestinian spouses of Israeli residents [was] abused by Palestinian residents of the territories for suicide terrorism\", and also ignoring the fact that at the time of the UN resolution the matter was under review by the Israeli High Court of Justice.\n\nThe Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) filed a petition to have the law struck down but it was upheld by a High Court decision in 2006. In formulating the law, the government cited, \"information presented by the security forces, which said that the terrorist organizations try to enlist Palestinians who have already received or will receive Israeli documentation and that the security services have a hard time distinguishing between Palestinians who might help the terrorists and those who will not\".\nIn the Israeli Supreme Court decision on this matter, Deputy Chief Justice Mishael Cheshin argued that, \"Israeli citizens [do not] enjoy a constitutional right to bring a foreign national into Israel... and it is the right – moreover, it is the duty – of the state, of any state, to protect its residents from those wishing to harm them. And it derives from this that the state is entitled to prevent the immigration of enemy nationals into it – even if they are spouses of Israeli citizens – while it is waging an armed conflict with that same enemy\".\n\nIn 2009, the US Department of State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor criticized the lack of civil marriage and divorce in Israel for immigrants who are not considered Jewish under rabbinical law.\n\nIsraeli law provides for the right to a fair trial and an independent judiciary. The 2005 US Department of State report on Israel notes that the courts sometimes ruled against the executive branch, including in some security cases. Human Rights Groups believe these requirements are generally respected. The system is adversarial and cases are decided by professional judges. Indigent defendants receive mandatory representation. Some areas of the country fall under the separate judicial jurisdiction of military courts. These courts are believed to be in alignment with Israel's other criminal courts on matters pertaining to civilians. Convictions in these courts cannot be based on confession alone.\n\nUS Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan said, in 1987, that despite the difficulties in safeguarding civil liberties during times of security crises, \"it may well be Israel, not the United States, that provides the best hope for building a jurisprudence that can protect civil liberties against the demands of national security.\"\n\nIsraeli law currently allows for the death penalty for serious crimes committed during wartime, but it has been abolished during peacetime. Current crimes during wartime include genocide, crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The only person to have ever been executed after conviction in an Israeli civilian court was the Nazi war-criminal Adolf Eichmann.\n\nRegarding the conditions of imprisonment of prisoners, including security prisoners (the Israel Prison Service term for Palestinian prisoners), Israel is committed to two international treaties:\n\nIn 1978, two cable messages, Jerusalem 1500 and Jerusalem 3239, sent from the US Consulate General in Jerusalem to the US Department of State in Washington, D.C., described abusive methods allegedly used by Israeli authorities to interrogate Palestinian detainees in Jerusalem and the West Bank. Alexandra U. Johnson, the consular officer who wrote the cables, was terminated from the United States Foreign Service later that year; the cables became the focus of controversy when their contents became public in 1979. A third report, Jerusalem A-19, sent as an airgram message from the Consulate General in Jerusalem to the Department of State in October 1978, described the military trial of two young American citizens who reported that Israeli authorities used physical coercion to obtain confessions from them. The report concluded that Israeli authorities were aware that \"physical coercion and mistreatment\" probably had been used to obtain the confessions.\n\nThe 1987 Landau Commission, headed by then-Supreme Court Justice Moshe Landau, was appointed to examine the interrogation methods of the Israel Security Agency (ISA) and said that \"the exertion of a moderate degree of physical pressure cannot be avoided\". Nevertheless, the commission condemned a 1982 internal memo that instructed interrogators on the kind of lies they should tell in court when denying they'd used physical force to obtain confessions. It condemned the perjury involved but advised against prosecution of those who'd carried it out. The second part of the Landau report remains secret, it is believed to contain guidelines for permissible interrogation methods.\n\nThe Landau Commission resulted in hundreds of petitions by detained Palestinians complaining that force had been used against them during ISA interrogations. In isolated cases, interim orders were issued temporarily prohibiting the ISA from using all or some of the methods, but in September 1999 the High Court refused to rule whether they are legal under Israeli and international law.\n\nIn 1991, Israel ratified the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, a measure which states (Article 7) \"no one shall be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\". Critics say Israel is also in breach of section 2(2) of the Convention against torture which stipulates that, \"No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.\"\n\nIn 1994, a State Comptroller's Report (partly released in summary form in February 2000) found that ISA interrogation methods contravened the law, the Landau Commission guidelines, and the internal guidelines formulated by the service itself.\n\nIn July 2002, \"Haaretz\" quoted a senior ISA official saying that, since the High Court's decision, 90 Palestinians had been defined as \"ticking bombs\" and \"extraordinary interrogation methods,\" i.e. torture, was used against them. Other Israeli interrogators have admitted that the ISA \"uses every manipulation possible, up to shaking and beating.\" Dozens of affidavits from Palestinians also confirm that torture is still part of Israeli interrogations.\n\nTorture is reported by B'Tselem as having been carried out against individuals not suspected of crime, including religious sages, sheiks and religious leaders, persons active in charitable organizations, and Islamic students. Others to be tortured include brothers and other relatives of persons listed as \"wanted\" and any Palestinians in the engineering profession. In some cases, wives of the detained have been arrested and mistreated to further pressure their husbands. ISA agents have sometimes tortured Palestinians in order to recruit them as collaborators.\n\nB'Tselem estimates that the ISA annually interrogates between 1,000 and 1,500 Palestinians and uses methods constituting torture against some 85 percent of them, at least 850 persons a year.\n\nAccording to a 2011 report by two Israeli human rights organisations, the Public Committee Against Torture (PCAT) and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), Israeli doctors fail to report suspected torture and conceal related information, allowing Israeli Security Agency interrogators to use torture against Palestinian detainees.\n\nIn August 2015, a law authorized force-feeding of hunger-striking prisoners. However, the Israel Medical Association declared the legislation unethical and urged doctors to refuse to implement it.\n\nPrisoners are allowed to take online courses from the Open University of Israel, and to complete academic degrees. This is not a vested right but a benefit, contingent on good behavior, with prison authorities paying their university tuition. The courses are in the fields of: humanities, sociology, economics, management, psychology and political-science. The intention is to give the prisoners the tools to deal with life outside, so that upon release from prison they will have the appropriate education to help them obtain jobs, and prevent them from returning to a life of crime.\n\nIn 2011, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Israel held thousands of Palestinians as political prisoners, and called on Israel to release them. Ban said the release of political prisoners would \"serve as a significant confidence-building measure\" and boost prospects of peace in the region. Amnesty International has called on Israel to release political prisoners, saying \"all political prisoners held without charge or trial should be tried in fair trials or immediately released\".\n\nJohn Dugard has compared Israeli imprisonment of Palestinians to policies of Apartheid-era South Africa, saying \"Apartheid's security police practiced torture on a large scale. So do the Israeli security forces. There were many political prisoners on Robben Island but there are more Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails.\"\n\nAdministrative detention is a procedure under which prisoners are held without charge or trial. The sentences are authorized by an administrative order from the Israeli Ministry of Defence or Israeli military commanders. Amnesty International believes that the practice breaches Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which \"makes clear that no-one should be subjected to arbitrary detention and that deprivation of liberty must be based on grounds and procedures established by law\". Amnesty International is also concerned that prisoners of conscience are being \"held solely for the non-violent exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association\". According to B'Tselem there are currently 645 Palestinians being held under administrative detention by the Israel Prisons Service and 105 by the IDF. Most are kept in the West Bank in Ofer Military Camp or in the Ansar 3/Ketziot Military Camp in the Negev desert.\n\nIn 2009, there were 250 Palestinian prisoners studying at Israel's Open University. In June 2011, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced, in response to a halt in the peace talks, that Palestinian prisoners would no longer be granted the right to pursue academic degrees in prison. In late 2012, three prisoners appealed the decision to the Israeli Supreme Court, which rejected their appeal. In their ruling, the judges stated that the right to free university education does not apply to those convicted of terror offenses. The ruling did, however, call on prison authorities to be \"considerate\" in deciding the cases of prisoners already in the midst of academic programs.\n\nAccording to the 2005 US Department of State report on Israel, \"[t]he law provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the government generally respected these rights in practice subject to restrictions concerning security issues.\" The law provides for freedom of assembly and association, and the government generally respected these rights in practice.\n\nSome government officials and others have been critical of the freedom of speech rights afforded to Israeli settlers during their forced evacuation from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. This led to the criticism that \"the authorities took disproportional steps, unjustifiably infringing on the right to political expression and protest.\"\n\nWithin Israel, policies of its government are subjected to criticism by its press as well as a variety of political, human rights and watchdog groups, which include Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), B'Tselem, Machsom Watch, Women in Black and Women for Israel's Tomorrow. According to the press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders, \"The Israeli media were once again in 2005 the only ones in the region that had genuine freedom to speak out.\" However, in 2010, human rights groups operating in Israel complained of a hostile environment in the country, and said they were coming under attack for criticising Israeli policies. The groups say that some Israeli leaders see human rights criticism as a threat to Israel's legitimacy, especially following war crimes allegations against the Israeli military over the Gaza War (2008–09).\n\nIn 2009, Israel ranked 93rd in the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index, down from the previous year. In 2013, Israel slipped to 112 out of 179 countries in the press Freedom Index. Reporters without borders explained the change was due to Israeli actions in Operation Pillar of Defense during which it said \"Israel Defense Forces intentionally attacked journalists and buildings where media connected to Hamas had premises\". The organization also criticized arrests of Palestinian journalists and military censorship. Freedom House ranked Israel as having a \"Partly Free\" media climate in 2009. Previously, Israel have been the only country in the region ranked with a \"Free\" media.)\n\nIn 2003, Israel's film board banned the commercial screening of a film about the 2002 Battle of Jenin. The film, \"Jenin, Jenin\", was a collection of interviews with residents of the Jenin refugee camp filmed in April 2002, a week after the battle. Mohammad Bakri, an Israeli Arab, directed the film. The film was banned due to its allegations of war crimes committed by Israeli forces, which the board deemed false and hurtful to the soldiers' families. Following legal proceedings, a petition was filed to the Supreme Court of Israel, which unanimously overturned the board's decision, and allowed the movie to be shown in cinemas \"for the public to decide\", while noting that the movie was \"full of lies\", was not a documentary, and was made \"without good faith\", falsely portraying the Israeli soldiers as \"the worst of war crime perpetrators\".\n\nIn January 2011, the Israeli parliament endorsed a right-wing proposal to investigate some of Israel's best-known human rights organisations for \"delegitimising\" its military. The investigations would entail inquiries into the funding of several human rights groups that have criticised Israeli policies. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel described the decision as a \"severe blow\" to Israeli democracy, and critics labeled the policy as \"McCarthyist\".\n\nIn 2015, the Israeli Supreme Court upheld major provisions of a law imposing consequences on those who call for boycotting Israel and occupied territories. The ruling sparked debate, with some protesting it ends freedom of speech while others say it affirms Israel's stand on \"the destructive nature of the BDS\" (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement). Israeli human rights groups had petitioned against the law, saying it infringes on freedom of speech. Supporters of the law say it prohibits \"discrimination based on geography.\" \"To exclude calls for a boycott from the category of free speech is incorrect,\" said Rabbi David Rosenn, New Israel Fund's (NIF) executive vice president. \"There is not a separate category for speech that is political. The most important speech is political, and people should have the ability to express their opinions without fear of government sanctions.\"\n\nThe law empowers police to limit incitement to violence or hate speech and criminalizes calling persons \"Nazis\" or \"fascists\". The Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance prohibits expressing support for an organization deemed to be illegal or terrorist in nature.\n\n\nReporters Without Borders publishes an annual report on worldwide press freedom, called the Press Freedom Index. The first such publication began in 2002. The results for Israel and the Palestinian Authority from 2002 to the present are shown below, with lower numbers indicating better treatment of reporters:\n\nObesity rates in Israel are below the average for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations, with an obesity rate of 14% for adults in 2009.\n\nIn 2007, the obesity rate among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza was the third highest (42%) in the world for women and eighth highest (23%) for men. For 2014, the obesity rate in Gaza stands on 60%.\n\nAccording to a 2005 US Department of State report on Israel, \"[l]aws and regulations provide for protection of privacy of the individual and the home. In criminal cases the law permits wiretapping under court order; in security cases the defense ministry must issue the order.\"\n\nIsrael is committed to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women international treaty in regard to women's rights.\n\nWomen in Israel have been guaranteed gender equality since the establishment of the state in 1948. This has enabled\nwomen to actively participate in Israeli life. The Israeli Declaration of Independence states: \"The State of Israel [...] will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.\"\n\nIn 1969, Israel elected Golda Meir as prime minister and became the fourth country to have a woman holding such an office. In 2010, women's parliamentary representation in Israel was 18 percent, which is above the Arab world's average of 6 percent, equal to that of the US Congress, and far below the Scandinavian countries' 40-percent average.\n\nThe Israeli parliament, The Knesset, has established The Committee on the Status of Women to address women's rights. The stated objectives of this committee are to prevent discrimination, combat violence against women, and promote equality in politics, lifecycle events and education. In 1998, the Knesset passed a law for \"Prevention of Sexual Harassment\".\n\nWith that said, the laws of the Status quo left the matters of marriage and managing the holy places to the officially recognized religious institutions. A 2009 report of the US Department of State mentions the problems of civil marriage, \"agunot\" ('chained' women unable to divorce without their husband's permission), and mixed-gender prayer services at the Western Wall.\n\nWomen's rights are promoted through \"Bringing Women to the Fore: The Feminist Partnership\", coordinated through the Jewish Women's Collaborative International Fund. The seven partnering organizations in Israel are Adva Center, Women's Spirit, Itach-Maaki: Women Lawyers for Social Justice, Mahut Center, The Israel Women's Network (IWN), Economic Empowerment for Women (EEW) and Achoti (Sister) for Women in Israel.\n\nArab-Israeli women actively participate in government and public life. Hussniya Jabara was the first Israeli-Arab woman to serve in the Knesset. According to section 15 of the States Civil Service [appointments], women and Arab-Israeli citizens are entitled to affirmative action in civil service employment.\n\nAccording to section 15 of the States Civil Service [appointments], female Israeli citizens are entitled to affirmative action in civil service employment.\n\nRights for sexual minorities in Israel are considered to be the most tolerant in the Middle East. While Israel has not legalized same-sex marriage, same-sex marriages valid in foreign countries are legally recognized in Israel. Israel guarantees civil rights for its homosexual population, including adoption rights and partner benefits. Israel also grants a common-law marriage status for same-sex domestic partners. The sodomy law inherited from the British Mandate of Palestine was repealed in 1988, though there was an explicit instruction issued in 1953 by the Attorney General of Israel ordering the police to refrain from enforcing this law, so long as no other offenses were involved. A national gay rights law bans some anti-gay discrimination, including in employment; some exemptions are made for religious organizations. In the past, military service of homosexuals was subject to certain restrictions. These restrictions were lifted in 1993, allowing homosexuals to serve openly in all units of the army.\n\nIn March 2014, the Ministry of Health issued a directive stating that sex-reassignment surgery was included among subsidized health services provided to citizens. Despite this, in May \"Haaretz\" reported that a health maintenance organization refused to pay for two sex-change surgeries, resulting in significant expenses by the patients. A national LGBTI task force found that 80 percent of transgender persons, 50 percent of lesbians and 20 percent of gay men were discriminated against when seeking employment.\n\nIsrael is committed to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination treaties in regard to social and cultural rights for minorities.\n\nEthnic and religious minorities have full voting rights in Israel and are entitled to government benefits under various laws. Israel's Employment Law (1988) prohibits discrimination – in hiring, working conditions, promotion, professional training or studies, discharge or severance pay, and benefits and payments provided for employees in connection with their retirement from employment – due to race, religion, nationality, and land of origin, among other reasons.\n\nAccording to section 15 of the States Civil Service [appointments], Israeli citizens who are female, disabled, or of Arab or black African origin are entitled to affirmative action in the civil service. Israeli citizens of Arab or black African origin, or with disabilities, are furthermore entitled to affirmative action with regard to university and college admission, and are entitled to full tuition scholarships by the state.\n\nProhibition of Discrimination in Products, Services and Entry into Places of Entertainment and Public Places Law forbids those who operate public places, or provide services or products, to discriminate because of race, religion, nationality, and land of origin, among other reasons. According to the 2010 US Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, Israeli law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, and the government effectively enforced these prohibitions.\n\nHuman rights group B'Tselem has claimed that Arabs in Jerusalem are denied residency rights, leading to a housing shortage in the Arab areas of Jerusalem.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has charged that cuts in veteran benefits and child allowances based on parents' military service discriminate against Arab children: \"The cuts will also affect the children of Jewish ultra-orthodox parents who do not serve in the military, but they are eligible for extra subsidies, including educational supplements, not available to Palestinian Arab children.\"\n\nAccording to the 2004 US Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, the Israeli government had done \"little to reduce institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens.\" Reports of subsequent years also identified discrimination against Arab citizens as a problem area for Israel, but did not repeat the assertion that Israel had done little to reduce discrimination.\n\nThe 2004 US State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices notes that:\n\nThe 2005 US Department of State report on Israel wrote: \"[T]he government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas, including... institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens.\"\n\nIn a report submitted to the United Nations, Bedouin claimed that they face discrimination and are not treated as equal citizens in Israel and that Bedouin towns are not provided the same level of services or land of Jewish towns of the same size, and they are not given fair access to water. The city of Be'er Sheva refused to recognize a Bedouin holy site, despite a High Court recommendation.\n\n\"The 2007 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\" notes that:\n\nIn September 2010, the Israeli government endorsed an amendment to the country's citizenship laws. The draft law obliges that any person applying for an Israeli citizenship to pledge an oath of allegiance to \"Israel as a Jewish and democratic state\". The amendment has been strongly criticized by Israeli Arabs as well as by Israeli left-wing movements including Kadima opposition party chief Tzipi Livni. Israeli educational psychologist Prof. Gavriel Solomon said that the loyalty oath resembles Nuremberg Laws. Supporters of the amendment state that non-Jews who become citizens need to fully appreciate that the \"State of Israel is the national expression of the self-determination of the Jewish people.\"\n\nIsrael prohibits its citizens from visiting enemy nations without permission, a travel restriction which, in 2015, included Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. The Adalah Legal Center claims this disproportionately discriminates against Arab-Israeli citizens, and that authorities did not detain Jewish Israelis upon return from trips to unauthorized countries as they did with Arab Israelis. The Israel Airports Authority has also been criticised for racial profiling of Arab citizens. The Adalah Legal Center maintains a list of more than 50 laws it claims discriminate against Arab citizens. In 2015, there was racial profiling of Arab citizens by security services and other citizens, as well as revenge attacks against Arabs.\n\nAccording to section 15 of the States Civil Service [appointments], Arab-Israeli citizens are entitled to affirmative action in civil service employment. Arab-Israeli citizens are entitled to affirmative action in university and college admission requirements, and are entitled to full tuition scholarships by the state.\n\nIsrael is a state party to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Israeli human rights organizations consider the Israeli asylum system to be extremely flawed and unfair, and the recognition rate of refugees is considerably lower than 1%.\nSince 2003, an estimated 70,000 illegal immigrants from various African countries have crossed into Israel. Some 600 refugees from the Darfur region of Sudan have been granted temporary resident status to be renewed every year, though not official refugee status. Another 2,000 refugees from the conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia have been granted temporary resident status on humanitarian grounds, though Israel prefers not to recognize them as refugees.\n\nIn a 2012 news story, \"Reuters\" reported, \"Israel may jail illegal immigrants for up to three years under a law put into effect on Sunday, an Interior Ministry official said, a measure aimed at stemming the flow of Africans entering Israel across the porous desert border with Egypt.\" Interior Minister Eli Yishai said, \"Why should we provide them with jobs? I'm sick of the bleeding hearts, including politicians. Jobs would settle them here, they'll make babies, and that offer will only result in hundreds of thousands more coming over here.\" Liel Leibovitz in \"Tablet Magazine\" wrote: \"If Israel honored the 1951 Refugee Convention it itself signed, it would not deny asylum to the 19,000 African refugees, mostly from Sudan and Congo, fleeing genocide and persecution, making the Jewish state the least inclined country in the Western world to aid those fleeing genocide.\"\n\nUnder the 2014 Prevention of Infiltration Law, all irregular border-crossers are defined as \"infiltrators\" and may be detained at Saharonim Prison for three months \"for the purpose of identification\" and then 12 months at the remote Holhot facility. The Hotline for Refugees and Migrants reported that authorities have returned more than half of Holot detainees to Saharonim for up to several months for various rule infractions. In a series of rulings, the Supreme Court rejected that migrants could be held indefinitely and ordered the release of 1,178 Eritrean and Sudanese migrants held for more than a year without charges. The government barred these asylum-seekers from Tel Aviv or Eilat, where they would have had supportive communities and access to social services.\n\nAccording to the 2015 US Department of State's Country Report on Human Rights Practices, since 2011 the environment for refugees in Israel has deteriorated \"due to adoption of policies and legislation aimed at deterring future asylum seekers by making life difficult for those already in the country. These actions further curtailed the rights of the population and encouraged the departure of those already in the country.\" The government would make it difficult to apply for refugee status while held in detention for a year, and once released would require applicants to provide justification for not applying earlier. Asylum seekers are called \"infiltrators\" by the government and media, who associate them with increases in crime, disease, and vagrancy.\n\nAccording to BBC, Ethiopian Jews living in Israel have long complained of discrimination. They held rallies after an agreement by landlords in southern Israel to not rent or sell their real estate to Jews of Ethiopian origin. The Ethiopian Jewish community took part in demonstrations after a video emerged showing two policemen beating a uniformed Ethiopian-Israeli soldier, Demas Fekadeh. While the protest by thousands of demonstrators was initially nonviolent, clashes with police developed. ACRI claimed that police failed to warn protesters prior to using crowd-dispersal measures, and that their use did not escalate gradually. The government dropped charges against Fekadeh, concluding he had not initiated the altercation that led to his beating.\n\nIsrael's Pupils' Rights Law of 2000 prohibits discrimination of students for sectarian reasons in admission to or expulsion from an educational institution, in establishment of separate educational curricula or holding of separate classes in the same educational institution, and in rights and obligations of pupils. This law has been enforced by the Supreme Court of Israel, prompting protests from Orthodox families who objected to sending their children to integrated schools.\n\nAn August 2009 study published in Megamot by Sorel Cahan of Hebrew University's School of Education demonstrated that the Israeli Education Ministry's budget for special assistance to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds severely discriminated against Arabs. It also showed that the average per-student allocation at Arab junior high schools was one-fifth the average at Jewish ones. This was the result of the allocation method used – assistance funds were first divided between Arab and Jewish school systems, according to the number of students in each, and then allocated to needy students; however, due to the largest proportion of such students in the Arab system, they received less funds, per student, than Jewish students. The Ministry of Education said that it had already decided to discontinue this allotment method in favor of a uniform index method, without first dividing the funds between the school systems.\n\nMinistry data on what percentage of high school students pass their matriculation exams, broken down by town, showed that most Arab towns were the lowest ranked – an exception was Arab Fureidis which had the third-highest pass rate (75.86 percent) in Israel.\n\nIsraeli citizens who are Arabs, Blacks or people with disabilities are entitled to affirmative action in university and college admission requirements, and are entitled for full tuition scholarships by the state.\n\nPrisoners with good behavior are allowed to take online courses from the Open University of Israel, and to complete academic degrees. The program for education in jail is free for the prisoners, with prison authorities paying their university tuition.\n\nIn 2010, the US Department of State issued a report which stated that \"the Government of Israel does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking however it is making significant efforts to do so.\" It noted that Israel continued law enforcement actions against human trafficking, and established a shelter for labor traffic victims. However, the government did not identify the victims, and law enforcement and protection efforts diminished since transferring anti-trafficking duties from Immigration police to the Ministry of Interior.\n\nThe 2015 US Department of State report stated that some foreign workers experienced conditions of forced labour, including \"the unlawful withholding of passports, restrictions on freedom of movement, limited ability to change or otherwise choose employers, nonpayment of wages, exceedingly long working hours, threats, sexual assault, and physical intimidation.\" The most vulnerable were foreign agricultural workers, construction workers, and nursing care workers (particularly women).\n\nIsrael is committed to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities international treaty in regard to people with disabilities rights.\n\nIsrael enacted an Equal Rights for People with Disabilities Law in 1998. Nevertheless, the US Department of State report on Israel stated that \"de facto discrimination against persons with disabilities\" exists in Israel. In 2014, there were approximately 1.6 million people with disabilities residing in Israel. Approximately 878,000 were between the ages of 20 to 64 and 488,000 were over the age of 64. A survey by the Dialog Institute showed that a significant portion of the Israeli population has difficulty accepting people with disabilities as neighbors, co-workers or classmates. 40% of those surveyed said they would \"be bothered\" if their children were in school with a disabled child, and almost a third of respondents said they would \"be bothered\" living in the same neighborhood as disabled people.\n\nIn Israel more than 144,000 people with disabilities rely solely on government allowances as their only means of support. According to Arie Zudkevitch and fellow members of the Israeli Organization of the Disabled: \"The amount of money that we get cannot fulfill even the basic needs of people without special needs.\" In Tel Aviv, more than 10,000 people marched in solidarity with the disabled, demanding increased compensation and recognition from the Israeli Government.\n\nA 2005 report from the Association for Civil Rights in Israel stated that private psychiatric hospitals were holding 70 individuals who no longer needed hospitalization, but continue to be hospitalized to serve the institutions' financial interests. The most recent statistics of the Israeli Health Ministry showed over 18,000 admissions for psychiatric hospital care.\n\nBeginning in 2014, employers of more than 100 persons were required to have 3 percent of their workforce be persons with disabilities, though enforcement of this quota was limited. Disabled persons have lower rates of employment, and often work part-time for low wages. The advocacy organization Bizchut stated that Arab citizens with disabilities were employed at half the rate of Jews with disabilities, and that shortages of funding for Arab municipalities adversely affected the disabled of these communities.\n\nAccording to section 15 of the States Civil Service [appointments], Israeli citizens with disabilities are entitled to affirmative action in civil service employment. Israeli citizens with disabilities are entitled to affirmative action in university and college admission requirements, and are entitled to full tuition scholarships by the state.\n\nIsrael has been criticized in the 1990s for its policies and its weak enforcement of laws on human trafficking. Women from the former Soviet Republics were brought into the country by criminal elements for forced labor in the sex industry. In 1998, the \"Jerusalem Post\" estimated that pimps engaging in this activity derived on average US$50,000–100,000 per prostitute, resulting in a countrywide industry of nearly $450,000,000 annually.\nBy July 2000, Israel passed the Prohibition on Trafficking Law. In its 2003 report, the Human Rights Committee noted it \"welcomes the measures taken by the State party to combat trafficking in women for the purpose of prostitution\". The 2005 US Department of State report on Israel mentioned \"societal violence and discrimination against women and trafficking in and abuse of women.\"\n\nIn October 2006, the Knesset passed a new law outlawing human trade with sentences for human trade offenses of up to 16 years, and 20 years when the victim is a minor. The law also addresses forced labor, slavery, organ theft, and prostitution.\nThe bill also requires compensation of victims of human trade and slavery. Trials will be able to be held behind closed doors to protect the identity of victims. By November, prostitution activity in Israel has become less apparent. Police raided the places that offered sex services, and detained criminals related to prostitution and sex trafficking. However, campaigners say that police action has shifted the industry to private apartments and escort agencies, making the practice more difficult to detect.\n\nThe 2005 annual report of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) found that \"accelerated privatization\" is damaging human rights. According to the report, \"State economic policy, including cutting stipends, reducing housing assistance, and constantly declining state participation in health-care and education costs, are forcing more elderly, children and whole families into poverty and despair. The increasing damage to citizens' rights to earn a dignified living – both due to low wages and the lack of enforcement of labor laws – is particularly prominent.\"\n\nSince 1967, Israel has controlled territories captured from Egypt, Jordan and Syria during the Six-Day War. Residents of the Golan Heights are entitled to citizenship, voting rights and residency that allows them to travel within Israel's borders. Israel no longer exercises military control in the Gaza Strip, but has subjected it to blockades and other measures it deems necessary to Israeli security. The government of Israel has declared that it observes the international humanitarian laws contained in the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nDuring the Al-Aqsa Intifada, the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) reported \"widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights perpetrated by the Israeli occupying power, in particular mass killings and collective punishments, such as demolition of houses and closure of the Palestinian territories, measures which constitute war crimes, flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity.\"\n\nSince the transfer of responsibilities to the Palestinians under the Oslo Accords, Israel says it cannot be held internationally accountable for human rights in these areas.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) stated that human rights covenants are applicable and that Israel had breached its obligations under international law by establishing settlements in the occupied territories. According to the ICJ, Israel cannot rely on the right of self-defense or on a state of necessity, and is guilty of violating basic human rights by impeding liberty of movement and the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living.\n\nAbdallah Abu Rahmah was arrested by the Israeli army in 2009 for participating in demonstrations which take place weekly in the West Bank. On 25 August 2010, the Israeli military court found Abu Rahmah guilty of two anti-free speech articles in military legislation: \"incitement, and organizing and participating in illegal demonstrations.\" European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton condemned the verdict, stating, \"The EU considers Abdallah Abu Rahmah to be a human rights defender committed to non-violent protest against the route of the Israeli separation barrier through his West Bank village of Bil'in.\"\n\nArticle 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination says \"States Parties particularly condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.\" A review of Israel's country report by the experts of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination took issue with the establishment of Jewish-only settlements and stated \"The status of the settlements was clearly inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention which, as noted in the Committee's General Recommendation XIX, prohibited all forms of racial segregation in all countries. There was a consensus among publicists that the prohibition of racial discrimination, irrespective of territories, was an imperative norm of international law.\n\nOn 7 April 2005, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights stated it was \"deeply concerned at the suffering of the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan due to the violation of their fundamental and human rights since the Israeli military occupation of 1967...[and] in this connection, deploring the Israeli settlement in the occupied Arab territories, including in the occupied Syrian Golan, and regretting Israel's constant refusal to cooperate with and to receive the Special Committee\".\n\nIsraeli military strategists defend the occupation of the Golan Heights as necessary to maintain a buffer against future military attacks from Syria. The land was captured in the Six-Day War.\n\nIsraeli treatment of non-Israelis in territories occupied by Israel, for the past forty years, has been compared to South Africa's treatment of non-whites during the apartheid era – by various parties including the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Jimmy Carter, archbishop Desmond Tutu, and Israel Attorney-General Michael Ben-Yair. In 2009, South Africa's Human Sciences Research Council released a 300-page study that concluded that Israel practiced colonialism and apartheid in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nThe term apartheid in the context of the West Bank is used in relation to certain Israeli policies in force in the area. These include segregated roads and settlements, and restrictions placed on movements of Palestinians but not Israelis – in the form of checkpoints and segmentation of the West Bank. The comparison also extends to access to natural resources such as water and access to the judicial system.\n\nThose who criticize the analogy argue that Israeli policies have little or no comparison to apartheid South Africa, and that the motivation and historical context of Israel's policies are different. It is argued that Israel itself is a democratic and pluralist state, while the West Bank and Gaza are not part of sovereign Israel and cannot be compared to the internal policies of apartheid South Africa. According to Gerald Steinberg, the attempt to label Israel an apartheid state is \"the embodiment of the new antisemitism that seeks to deny the Jewish people the right of equality and self-determination.\" Others say that it is \"a foolish and unfair comparison\", that Arab citizens of Israel have the same rights as other Israeli citizens and that \"full social and political equality of all [Israel's] citizens, without distinction of race, creed or sex\" is specifically guaranteed by Israeli law. Arab-Israeli journalist Khaled Abu Toameh says, \"Fortunately, Arab citizens can go to the same beaches, restaurants and shopping malls as Jews in this 'apartheid' state. Moreover, they can run in any election and even have a minister in the government (Ghaleb Majadlah) for the first time\". Others state that the comparison to apartheid is defamatory and inflammatory, and reflects a double standard when applied to Israel since it does not comment on the human and civil rights in neighboring Arab countries or within the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe center of much controversy, the Israeli West Bank barrier is a physical barrier, consisting mainly of fences and trenches, built by the Israeli Government. It is located partly within the West Bank, and partly along the border between the West Bank and Israel proper. The barrier's stated purpose is \"to keep the terrorists out and thereby save the lives of Israel's citizens, Jews and Arabs alike.\"\n\nIn 2003, the barrier was condemned by a UN Resolution \"overwhelmingly\" passed by UN General Assembly which also called for all construction to halt. The building of the barrier inside the west bank was also condemned by the International Court of Justice which stated: \"Israel also has an obligation to put an end to the violation of its international obligations flowing from the construction of the wall in Occupied Palestinian Territories...reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act.\" During 2003, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled, concerning a stretch of the barrier to the north-west of Jerusalem: \"The route [of the West Bank barrier] disrupts the delicate balance between the obligation of the military commander to preserve security and his obligation to provide for the needs of the local inhabitants.\"\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Amnesty International issued a statement in 2005, saying: \"Israel built a fence/wall through the West Bank, confining Palestinians in isolated enclaves cut off from their land and essential services in nearby towns and villages.\"\n\nA UN report released in August 2005 observed that the existence of the barrier \"replaced the need for closures: movement within the northern West Bank, for example, is less restrictive where the Barrier has been constructed. Physical obstacles have also been removed in Ramallah and Jerusalem governorates where the Barrier is under construction.\" The report notes that more freedom of movement in rural areas may ease Palestinian access to hospitals and schools, but also notes that restrictions on movement between urban population centers have not significantly changed.\n\nIn 2004, Amnesty International accused the IDF of war crimes, including \"unlawful killings; extensive and wanton of destruction of property; obstruction of medical assistance and targeting of medical personnel; torture; and the use of Palestinians as human shields.\" They accuse the Israeli army of \"reckless shooting\" and \"excessive use of force\" against militants that endangers the lives of civilians. They claim Israeli soldiers are rarely punished for human rights violations, and investigations of crimes are not carried out.\nIn 2014, Amnesty released a report with similar findings, criticizing Israel for excessive and reckless use of force for which Israeli soldiers are not held accountable. Amnesty said characteristics of the violence suggested it was employed as a matter of policy, and that there was evidence some killings amounted to war crimes.\n\nAccording to Gal Luft, Palestinian militants utilize a tactic of blending among civilian populations which exacerbates civilian casualties in Israeli attacks. According to Luft, biased media coverage of Operation Defensive Shield encouraged militants to use civilians and refugees as \"human shields\" because they were not held accountable for their actions. The Israeli military claims it does not target civilians and that critics do not take into account the \"realities\" of war faced by the IDF.\n\nAccording to the 2010 US State Department Human Rights Report, in 2010, the Military Investigative Police launched 147 investigations with regard to cases of death, violence, and property damage against residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In these cases the military advocate general filed 10 indictments against 12 soldiers suspected of committing criminal offenses against Palestinians. There were three convictions of four soldiers, no acquittals, closure of three cases by the military advocate general, and seven cases pending as of year's end.\n\nIn 2013, a report by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child concluded that Israeli forces had used Palestinian children as human shields in 14 cases between 2010 and 2013. According to the report, almost everyone who had used children as human shields had remained unpunished.\n\nThe IDF acknowledged using the \"Neighbor Procedure\" or the \"Early Warning Procedure\", in which the IDF would encourage a Palestinian acquaintance of a wanted man to try and convince them to surrender. This practice was criticized by some as using human shields, an allegation the IDF denied, saying that it never forced people into carrying out the \"Neighbor Procedure\"; and that Palestinians volunteered to prevent excess loss of life.\nAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch are among the groups who made the human shield comparison. The Israeli group B'Tselem also made the comparison, saying that \"for a long period of time following the outbreak of the second intifada Operation Defensive Shield, in April 2002, the IDF systematically used Palestinian civilians as human shields, forcing them to carry out military actions which threatened their lives\". The Neighbor Procedure was outlawed by the Supreme Court of Israel in 2005 but some groups say the IDF continues to use it, although they say the number of instances has dropped sharply.\n\nIn April 2004, human rights activists from Rabbis for Human Rights reported that Israeli soldiers used 13-year-old Muhammed Badwan as a human shield during a demonstration in the West Bank village of Biddu, by tying him to the front windscreen of their jeep with the purpose, according to the boy's father, of discouraging Palestinian demonstrators from throwing stones at them. A picture of Badwan tied to the jeep was published in the \"Daily Mail\". On 1 July 2009, Amnesty International stated that Israeli troops forced Palestinians to stay in one room of their home while turning the rest of the house into a base and sniper position, \"effectively using the families, both adults and children, as human shields and putting them at risk,\" the group said. \"Intentionally using civilians to shield a military objective, often referred to as using 'human shields' is a war crime,\" Amnesty said. Such actions are condemned by human rights groups as violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nIsrael has a policy of targeted killings against those it considers proven to have intentions of performing a specific act of terrorism in the very near future or to be linked with several acts of terrorism. In 2006, the Supreme Court of Israel issued its judgment in \"The Public Committee against Torture in Israel v. The Government of Israel\". The case addressed the issue of whether the state acts illegally in its policy of targeted killings. The court considered that the legal context is a conflict \"of an international character (international armed conflict). Therefore, the law that applies to the armed conflict between Israel and the terrorist organizations is the international law of armed conflicts.\" The court decided that \"members of the terrorist organizations are not combatants [...] They do not fulfill the conditions for combatants under international law\" and that \"they do not comply with the international laws of war.\" They concluded that \"members of terrorist organizations have the status of civilians\" but that \"the protection accorded by international law to civilians does not apply at the time during which civilians take direct part in hostilities.\" They ruled that they could not determine whether targeted killings are always legal or always illegal, but the legality must be established on a case by case basis. Their ruling stated \"it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is prohibited according to customary international law, just as it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is permissible according to customary international law. The law of targeted killing is determined in the customary international law, and the legality of each individual such act must be determined in light of it.\" The judgment included guidelines for permissible and impermissible actions involving targeted killings and provided the conditions for investigating the criminality of some of the actions.\n\nPalestinian militants have planned multiple attacks against Israeli civilians such as suicide bombings while living among non-militant Palestinian civilians, and thwarting such attacks may have saved lives. The Israeli army maintains that it pursues such military operations to prevent imminent attacks when it has no discernible means of making an arrest or foiling such attacks by other methods. Some commentators claim that this practice is in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention () which reads: \"The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.\" According to some commentators there may be circumstances when international law gives Israel the right to conduct military operations against civilian targets.\n\nFor example, in July 2002 the Israeli Defense Forces carried out an air strike targeting Salah Shahade, the commander of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, in a densely populated residential area of Gaza City. The night-time bombing resulted in the deaths of 15 persons, nine of whom were children, and the injury of 150 others. According to the Israeli government, Shehade was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians, and earlier Israel asked the Palestinian Authority to arrest him but no action was taken. Israel maintains that Shehade was in the process of preparing another large-scale attack inside Israel and thereby constituted a \"ticking bomb\".\n\nOn 1 March 2009, \"The Independent\" obtained an account which, for the first time, details service in one of the Israeli military's assassination squads. A former IDF soldier of an assassination squad described his role in a botched ambush that killed two Palestinian bystanders and two militants. According to the interviewer \"the source cannot be identified by name, not least because by finally deciding to talk about what happened, he could theoretically be charged abroad for his direct role in an assassination of the sort most Western countries regard as a grave breach of international law.\"\n\nAccording to Amnesty International: \"Military checkpoints and blockades around Palestinian towns and villages hindered or prevented access to work, education and medical facilities and other crucial services. Restrictions on the movement of Palestinians remained the key cause of high rates of unemployment and poverty. More than half of the Palestinian population lived below the poverty line, with increasing numbers suffering from malnutrition and other health problems.\"\n\nIsrael maintains that the majority of checkpoints and blockades were erected following the Al-Aqsa Intifada (October 2000) as security measures against terrorist attacks.\n\nIn August 2009, UN Human Rights Chief Navi Pillay criticised Israel for blockading the Gaza strip in a 34-page report, calling it a violation of the rules of war. In September 2009, the UN found in the Goldstone Report that the blockade of Gaza amounted to collective punishment and was thus illegal.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and other organizations have accused Israel of committing war crimes in the 2006 Lebanon war. Israel has rejected those accusations and accused Hezbollah of deliberately firing from civilian areas during the fighting.\n\nThe UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict published a 575-page report on 15 September 2009, stating it had found that war crimes were committed by both sides involved in the Gaza War.\n\nThe report condemns Israel's actions during the conflict for \"the application of disproportionate force and the causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure, and suffering to civilian populations\". It came to the conclusion \"that there was strong evidence to establish that numerous serious violations of international law, both humanitarian law and human rights law, were committed by Israel during the military operations in Gaza\". The report claims that Israel made disproportionate or excessive use of white phosphorus. Israel has also come under fire from other fact-finding missions over the use of white phosphorus – an incendiary weapon which is deemed illegal to use against civilians (forbidden by the Geneva Conventions) or in civilian areas by Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons – and depleted uranium during the conflict.\n\nThe UN report also condemned the use of indiscriminate rocket attacks by Palestinian militants which targeted known civilian areas within Israel, stating that \"[t]here's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars [by armed groups from Gaza] was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians and damage to civilian structures. The mission found that these actions also amount to serious war crimes and also possibly crimes against humanity\".\n\nAccording to the 2010 US Department of State's Human Rights Report, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Military Advocate General Mandelblit investigated all allegations relating to the 2008–09 Operation Cast Lead military incursion into the Gaza Strip, examining over 150 incidents, including those contained in the UN Human Rights Council's 2009 Goldstone report. In January and July, Mandelblit released updates on the majority of investigations, which included details of indictments against several soldiers for manslaughter, improper use of civilians in wartime, and misconduct. the military advocate general launched 47 military police criminal investigations into IDF conduct during Operation Cast Lead and completed a significant number of them. On 1 August, the IDF issued a new order appointing humanitarian affairs officers to each battalion to provide further protections for civilian populations during wartime planning and combat operations.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International report published on 27 October 2009, Israeli restrictions prevent Palestinians from receiving enough water in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The report says Israel's daily water consumption per capita was four times higher than that in the Palestinian territories.\n\nIn December 2006, Kofi Annan, former UN Secretary-General, accused the Human Rights Council of focusing too heavily on the Arab–Israeli conflict, while allowing it to monopolize attention at the expense of other situations where violations are no less grave or even worse.\n\nMatti Friedman, former AP correspondent in Israel, has analyzed what he perceives as the disproportionate media attention given to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, compared to other conflicts that are no less violent or even worse.\n\nTuvia Tenenbom, in his book \"Catch the Jew!\", argues that many seemingly \"human rights\" NGOs, EU representatives and Red Cross representatives that act in Israel actually come to implant and inflame the hatred of the Palestinians against Israel and the Jews, while promoting a one-sided view of the conflict in the world. He also claims that the textbooks in the schools run by the UN, UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), and flyers distributed by the Red Cross prompt and encourage anti-semitism against Jews and teach toward a lack of recognition in the existence of Israel.\n\nBen-Dror Yemini wrote in his book \"The Industry of Lies\" that the Arab–Israeli conflict has become the center of a major deception. According to Yemini, lies about Israel in media and academia have been presented as truths; deeply rooted in the global consciousness, this has caused Israel to be seen as a monster, similar to perceptions of Jews in Nazi Germany.\n\nFreedom House has claimed the United Nations has a history of negative focus on Israel that is disproportional in respect to other members, including the actions and statements of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and its predecessor, the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR).\n\nHillel Neuer of UN Watch has described the actions of the UN Commission on Human Rights as a \"campaign to demonize Israel\". Neuer has stated that an example of bias is that in 2005, the Commission adopted four resolutions against Israel, equaling the combined total of resolutions against all other states in the world. Belarus, Cuba, Myanmar, and North Korea were the subject of one resolution each.\nIn addition, according to UN Watch, in 2004–2005, the UN General Assembly passed nineteen resolutions concerning Israel, while not passing any resolution concerning Sudan, which at the time was facing a genocide in the Darfur region.\n\nIn 2006, the UN General Assembly voted to replace UNCHR with the UN Human Rights Council. In 2011, Richard Goldstone publicly regretted appointing the UN Human Rights Council to investigate for the Goldstone Report, saying that their \"history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted.\"\n\nIn December 2006, Kofi Annan, former UN Secretary-General, accused the members of the Human Rights Council at that time of \"double standard\", and of holding Israel to a standard of behaviour that they are unwilling to apply to other states, to Israel's adversaries, or to themselves. He said that the repeated resolutions and conferences of the General Assembly that condemn Israel's behaviour just strengthen the belief in Israel, and among many of its supporters, that the UN is too one-sided.\n\nIn April 2012, the UN released an official statement in which Israel was listed as a country that is restricting the activities of human rights organisations. Israel, the only democratic country to be named on the list, was included because of a bill approved by the Ministerial Committee on Legislation that would restrict foreign governmental funding of Israeli non-profit groups. The bill was frozen by the Prime Minister and never reached the Knesset, but the statement said: \"In Israel, the recently adopted Foreign Funding Law could have a major impact on human rights organizations\".\n\nDuring his visit in Jerusalem in 2013, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon confirmed that there was a biased attitude towards the Israeli people and Israeli government, stressing that it was \"an unfortunate situation\". He added that Israel has been criticized and sometimes discriminated against because of the Mideast conflict.\n\nRichard Falk, who was the UNHRC's special investigator of \"Israel's violations of the bases and principles of international law\", has been criticised by UN Watch for \"pro-Hamas appeasement\", anti-Western invective, support for 9/11 conspiracy theorists and demonization of Israel.\n\nWilliam Schabas, a Canadian international law expert, was the head of a UN committee investigating the Israeli role in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. Schabas was often accused of anti-Israeli positions. In February 2015, Schabas acknowledged that he was paid for previous work for the Palestine Liberation Organization in 2012, and that he had not declared this when he applied for the role. This behavior has been seen by Israelis as \"clear and documented bias\" against Israel. In 2015, Schabas resigned his post, saying he didn't want the issue to overshadow the work of the inquiry.\n\nRon Prosor, Israel's representative to the United Nations, claimed in General Assembly debate on the Question of Palestine, November 2014, that the UN is illogical and tends to lack of sense of justice when it comes to the case of Israel. He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of Radical Islam, and that the Arab–Israeli conflict was never about the establishment of a Palestinian state but the existence of the Jewish state. He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really cared about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.\n\nAmnesty International (AI) has been accused by the American Jewish Congress and NGO Monitor of having a double standard with its assessment of Israel. Professor Alan Dershowitz, an American legal scholar and columnist for the \"Huffington Post\", has attacked Amnesty International's perceived bias against Israel, claiming that AI absolves Palestinian men of responsibility for domestic violence and places the blame on Israel instead and that it illegitimately characterises legal acts of Israeli self-defence as war-crimes. Dershowitz has joined NGO Monitor's calls for an independent evaluation of anti-Israeli bias within the organisation.\n\nIn 2004, NGO Monitor, a pro-Israel organization, released a study comparing Amnesty International's response to the twenty years of ethnic, religious and racial violence in Sudan – in which (at that time) 2,000,000 people were killed and 4,000,000 people displaced – to their treatment of Israel. When NGO Monitor focused on 2001, they found that Amnesty International issued seven reports on Sudan, as opposed to 39 reports on Israel. Between 2000 and 2003, they claimed the imbalance in issued reports to be 52 reports on Sudan and 192 reports on Israel, which they call \"lack of balance and objectivity and apparent political bias [which] is entirely inconsistent with AI's official stated mission.\" They further called attention to the difference in both scale and intensity: \"While ignoring the large-scale and systematic bombing and destruction of Sudanese villages, AI issued numerous condemnations of the razing of Palestinian houses, most of which were used as sniper nests or belonged to terrorists. Although failing to decry the slaughter of thousands of civilians by Sudanese government and allied troops, AI managed to criticize Israel's 'assassinations' of active terrorist leaders.\"\n\nAccording to the US State Department's 2015 Country Report on Human Rights Practices, Israeli officials were generally cooperative with the United Nations and human rights groups and invited the testimony of human rights NGOs at Knesset hearings. These groups can directly petition the Israeli Supreme Court on government policies and individual cases.\n\nIsraeli and Palestinian NGOs critical of the government's human rights policies claim the government sought to pressure them for receiving foreign funding. These investigations into funding have been labeled by critics as \"McCarthyist\". In July 2015, in a series of private meetings, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely accused European governments of funding Israeli and Palestinian NGOs which sought to \"delegitimize Israel under the guise of human rights\", naming B'Tselem, Breaking the Silence, and the Adalah Legal Center. Hotovely threatened that her government would restrict or tax foreign funding of Israeli NGOs if this continued.\n\nThe participation of ACRI and B'Tselem in the national service volunteer program was terminated by the civil service in 2015, following government allegations that they engaged in defamation and incitement against Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe Ministry of the Interior has refused to renew work permits as well as blocking entry to Israel by foreigners suspected of supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel, a policy which applies also to activists.\n\nThe government continues a partial suspension of its coordination with UNESCO (the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), in effect since 2013. In 2015, Israel blocked the UNHRC's special rapporteur (investigator) from gaining access to the West Bank.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8755919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8755919", "title": "Humani generis unitas", "text": "Humani generis unitas\n\nHumani generis unitas (Latin; English translation: On the Unity of the Human Race) was a draft for an encyclical planned by Pope Pius XI before his death on February 10, 1939. The draft text condemned antisemitism, racism and the persecution of Jews. Because it was never issued, it is sometimes referred to as \"The Hidden Encyclical\" or \"The Lost Encyclical.\" \"Humani generis unitas\" was written by three Jesuits under the leadership of John LaFarge. The draft text remained secret until published in 1995 in France (by Passelecq and Suchecky under the title \"L’Encyclique Cachée de Pie XI\") and in 1997 in English as \"The Hidden Encyclical of Pius XI.\"\n\nIn June 1938, Pius XI assigned American Jesuit John LaFarge to prepare a draft of \"Humani generis unitas\". Jesuit Superior-General Wlodimir Ledóchowski assigned two other Jesuits, Gustav Gundlach and Gustave Desbuquois, to assist LaFarge. Working in Paris, they produced a draft of approximately 100 pages. Another Jesuit translated the draft into Latin and presented it to Ledóchowski. The draft was delivered to the Vatican in September 1938.\n\nSome secondary sources, including Cardinal Tisserant, claim that the draft was on Pius XI's desk when he died of a heart attack on February 10, 1939.\n\nPius XI's successor, Pope Pius XII, did not promulgate the draft as an encyclical. Critics of Pius XII (notably John Cornwell in his controversial work \"Hitler's Pope\") cited this decision as evidence of his alleged silence toward anti-Semitism and The Holocaust. He utilized parts of it in his own inaugural encyclical \"Summi Pontificatus\" on the unity of human society, in October 1939, the month after the outbreak of World War II, and analysis of the draft figures prominently in most comparisons of the policies of Pius XII and his predecessor.\n\nIn June 2006, Pope Benedict XVI ordered all documents from the reign of Pius XI in the Vatican Secret Archives to be opened, and on September 18, 2006 over 30,000 documents were made available to researchers.\n\nThe first 70 paragraphs, probably authored by Gundlach, are a critique of theological modernism, unorthodox re-interpretation of Sacred Scripture, nationalism, and racism; the remaining 108, likely authored by all three Jesuits, contextualized the first part of the text with the social role of Catholic educational institutions and anti-Semitism.\n\nAlthough the draft clearly condemned racism and anti-Semitism, the document is deeply grounded in anti-\"Judaism\". The draft criticizes the majority of post-Messianic Jews for not acknowledging Jesus Christ as the true Jewish Messiah.\n\n\"Humani generis unitas\" clearly condemns American racial segregation and racism and Nazi German anti-Semitism, though without explicitly naming these countries. Racism is a denial of the unity of human society, a denial of the human personality, and a denial of the true values of religion There is no relation between race and religion, because racism is destructive to any society. Racism is destructive not only for social relations within a society but also for international relations and relations between different races.\n\nThe draft condemns the persecution of Jews. “These persecutions have been censured by the Holy See on more than one occasion, but especially when they have worn the mantle of Christianity\". But the text hedges with an anti-Judaic theme. “This unjust and pitiless campaign against the Jews has at least this advantage”, according to the draft, \"because the true nature, the authentic basis of the social separation of the Jews from the rest of humanity … is religious in character. …Essentially, the so-called Jewish question … is a question of religion and, since the coming of Christ, a question of Christianity.\" The encyclical blames the Jews of the time of Christ for having brought their own Messiah Jesus Christ to death: \"The very act by which the Jewish people put to death their Savior and King was, in the strong language of Saint Paul, the salvation of the world.\" The draft continues by accusing Jews of blind materialism.\n\n\nAccording to the authors, Pius XII was not aware of the text before the death of his predecessor. He chose not to publish it. However, his first encyclical \"Summi Pontificatus\" (\"On the Supreme Pontificate\", October 12, 1939), published after the beginning of World War II, has an echo of the previous title in its title: On the Unity of Human Society and uses many of the arguments of the text, avoiding most of the negative characterization of the Jewish people and rabbinic religion contained in the text of the draft.\n\n\"Summi Pontificatus\" sees Christianity as universalized and opposed to every form of racial hostility and every claim of racial superiority. There are no real racial differences: the human race forms a unity, because \"one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the whole earth\".\n\n\nThis divine law of solidarity and charity assures that all men are truly brethren, without excluding the rich variety of persons, cultures, and societies.\n\n\n"}

They offer many programs for community development and organization, such as art, culture, and human services for the neighborhood. They hope to empower the growing Latino community in Boston's South End, most notably the Villa Victoria section.\n\nIBA began in South End, Boston as a grassroots movement to fight the Boston Redevelopment Authority's urban renewal plan. In 1968, a year after forming the IBA, they had established their own housing plan given to the Boston Housing Authority and renamed themselves the \"Emergency Tenants Council.\" A year later, they were given the rights to develop on the parcel of land that is now Villa Victoria, and changed their name to \"Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción\", or \"Puerto Rican Tenants in Action\". This was considered a large accomplishment in terms of affordable housing, community organizing, and civil rights as they gave birth to a new community of not only Puerto Rican tenants, but Latinos of all cultures.\n\nThe goal of IBA is to empower to the residents of the neighborhood through arts, education, workforce development, and affordable housing communities that are vibrant and brightly colored to liven up the neighborhood. IBA aims to preserve safe and culturally diverse housing communities so the members are able to reach their full social, economic, or political potential. In order to achieve these goals, the group lives by a few different rules. They look for community involvement and direct representation, great leadership and planning, reinforcement of cultural pride, and effective organization around community needs. IBA uses these guidelines to go about their business.\n\nThought to be one of the major accomplishments in Boston's urban housing developments, Villa Victoria, or Victory Village, is located in Boston's growing South End neighborhood. It is a housing community that contains 435 low income housing units, as well as various commercial and community spaces such as restaurants, community centers, markets, and retail stores. The development was done by 1976 in four different phases; Victoria Apartments, Viviendas Apartments, South End Apartments, and Casas Borinquen Apartments. The properties in Villa Victoria have been renovated in the past ten years using funds from the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program and the Section 8 Mark Up To Market program.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "336024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336024", "title": "Internal affairs (law enforcement)", "text": "Internal affairs (law enforcement)\n\nThe internal affairs refers to a division of a law enforcement agency that investigates incidents and possible suspicions of law-breaking and professional misconduct attributed to officers on the force. It is thus a mechanism of limited self-governance, \"a police force policing itself\". In different systems, internal affairs can go by other names such as Internal Investigations Division (usually referred to as IID), professional standards, inspectorate general, Office of Professional Responsibility, Internal Review Board, or similar.\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this responsibility, in many departments, officers employed in an internal affairs unit are not in a detective command but report directly to the agency's chief, or to a board of civilian police commissioners.\n\nInternal affairs investigators are bound by stringent rules when conducting their investigations. In California, the Peace Officers Bill of Rights (POBR) is a mandated set of rules found in the Government Code.\n\nThe internal affairs function is not an enforcement function, but rather a policing function that works to report only. The concept of internal affairs is very broad and unique to each police department. However, the sole purpose to having an internal affairs unit is to investigate and find the truth to what occurred when an officer is accused of misconduct. An investigation can also give insight on a policy itself that may have issues.\n\nThe circumstances of the complaint determines who will be investigating the complaint. The investigation of police officer(s) misconduct can be conducted by the internal affairs unit, executive police officer, or any other outside agency. In the Salt Lake City Police Department, the Civilian Review Board will also investigate the complaint, but they will do so independently. When the investigation begins, everything is documented and all employees, complainants, and witnesses are interviewed. Any physical evidence is analyzed and past behaviors of the officer in question are reviewed. Dispatch tapes, police reports, tickets, audio, and videotapes are all reviewed if available. Many controversies arise because an officer investigating police misconduct may show favoritism and/or hold grudges particularly when a single officer is conducting the investigation. Some departments hire uninvolved officers or include another department or a special unit to conduct the investigation.\n\nLarger agencies have the resources to have separate units for internal affairs, but smaller agencies - which do not have the luxury - are more common, with 87% of police departments in the United States employing 25 or fewer sworn officers. Smaller agencies that do not have sufficient resources may have the executive officer, the accused's supervisor, or another police department conduct an investigation. The state police may also be asked to investigate criminal behavior, but they do not deal in minor misconduct or rule violation cases. However, allowing another department to investigate can result in lower morale among the officers because it can appear as an admission that the department cannot handle their own affairs.\n\nSeveral police departments in the USA have been compelled to institute citizen review or investigation of police misconduct complaints in response to community perception that internal affairs investigations are biased in favor of police officers. \n\nFor example, San Francisco, California, has its Office of Citizen Complaints, created by voter initiative in 1983, in which citizens who have never been members of the San Francisco Police Department investigate complaints of police misconduct filed against members of the San Francisco Police Department. Washington, DC, has a similar office, created in 1999, known as the Office of Police Complaints.\n\nIn the state of Utah, the Internal Affairs Division must properly file a complaint before the committee can officially investigate. Complaints involving police misuse of force will be brought to the Civilian Review Board, but citizens can request the committee to investigate any other issues of misconduct.\n\n"}
{"id": "26845057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26845057", "title": "July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike", "text": "July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike\n\nThe July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrikes were a series of air-to-ground attacks conducted by a team of two U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopters in Al-Amin al-Thaniyah, New Baghdad during the Iraqi insurgency which followed the Iraq War. On April 5, 2010, the attacks received worldwide coverage and controversy following the release of 39 minutes of gunsight footage by leaks website WikiLeaks. The footage was portrayed as classified, but its confessed leaker, U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning, testified in 2013 that the video was not classified. The video, which WikiLeaks titled Collateral Murder, showed that the crew encountered a firefight and laughed at some of the casualties. An anonymous U.S. military official confirmed the authenticity of the footage, which provoked global discussion on the legality and morality of the attacks.\n\nIn the first strike, the crews of two Apaches directed 30 mm cannon fire at a group of ten Iraqi men, including some armed men, standing where insurgents earlier that day had shot at an American Humvee with small arms fire. Among the group were two Iraqi war correspondents working for Reuters, Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen. Seven men (including Noor-Eldeen) were killed during this first strike, and Saeed Chmagh was injured.\n\nThe second strike, also using 30 mm rounds, was directed at a van whose driver, Saleh Matasher Tomal, appeared to happen to drive by and who proceeded to help the wounded Chmagh. However, in the long version of the video this van was targeted prior to the first engagement by one Apache (Crazyhorse 1/8) as it traveled south toward the Reuters employees who were, simultaneously, targeted by the other Apache (Crazyhorse 1/9) as they walked north on the same road toward the van. Minutes after the first engagement ended the van returned traveling in an opposite direction (north) once again on this same road. Two men assisting in the rescue effort were from a group of five standing at an intersection – seen in the upper right corner of the video when the Reuters employees arrive in the courtyard – reported to Apaches as being a second position combatants were using to attack the Humvee. Both of these men, Chmagh and Tomal, were killed in the second strike, and two of Tomal's children were badly wounded.\n\nIn a third strike, Apache pilots watched people run into a building and engaged that building with several AGM-114 Hellfire missiles.\n\nAccording to Tom Raju, a reporter at CNN, \"the soldiers of Bravo Company, 2–16 Infantry had been under fire all morning from rocket-propelled grenades and small arms on the first day of Operation Ilaaj in Baghdad\". Al Jazeera stated that the Army had received \"reports of small arms fire\", but were unable to positively identify the gunmen. Apache helicopters were called in by a soldier in the Humvee (Hotel 2–6) under attack from the same position used by Namir Noor-Eldeen to photograph the vehicle. According to a military review, soldiers in that company \"had been under sporadic small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire since\" the operation—described as \"clearing their sector and looking for weapons caches\"—began.\n\nThe Air Weapons Team (AWT) of two Apache AH-64s from the 1st Cavalry Division had been requested by the 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment (2–16), 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Kauzlarich, before July 12 to support Operation Ilaaj. Tasked to conduct escort, armed reconnaissance patrols, and counter-IED and counter-mortar operations, the two helicopters left Camp Taji at 9:24 a.m. They arrived on station in New Baghdad at 9:53 a.m., where sporadic attacks on coalition forces continued.\n\nIn the video on the morning of July 12, 2007, the crews of two United States Army AH-64 Apache helicopters observe a gathering of men near a section of Baghdad in the path of advancing U.S. ground troops, some armed with AKMs and RPGs. The crew estimates the group is twenty men. Among the group are two journalists working for Reuters, Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh. (While the two are carrying media cards, a military officer claimed they were not wearing distinctive clothing identifying themselves as such.) A crew member requests authorization to engage after seeing five or six of the men, moving in the direction of U.S. soldiers. A long shadow cast on the ground by a telephoto lens on Noor-Eldeen's camera is misidentified by the pilot as an additional RPG aimed at him and a U.S. Army Humvee directly below his aircraft. One second later he screams, \"He's got an RPG!\" Noor-Eldeen fails to photograph the Apache but three pictures of the U.S. Humvee appear on his camera's memory card when it was recovered by U.S. soldiers. The men become obscured behind a building as the Apache moves around the group. Expecting an immediate attack on the U.S. soldiers, both helicopters strafe a group of ten men with 30 mm rounds once they became visible again. Seven men are killed, including Noor-Eldeen, and three others wounded, including Chmagh. Once the group is eliminated, the Apache pilots direct the ground troops to move up to the position of the attack to clear the area.\n\nAs the ground troops advanced, a wounded Chmagh was seen crawling and attempting to stand. As the U.S. soldiers moved towards the site of the attack, a van stopped near Chmagh. The van had no visible markings to suggest it was an ambulance or a protected vehicle. The Apache crew alerted the ground troops of the van and requested permission to engage the vehicle before the ground troops arrived. The Apache crew saw unarmed men exit the vehicle and move to Chmagh. The Apache crew requested permission to engage, stating it \"looks like [the men] possibly, picking up bodies and weapons\" from the scene, and repeated their request to shoot, before they received permission to begin firing on the van and its occupants. Chmagh was killed along with three other men, while two children, not known to be in the van to the U.S. forces, were injured. The children, a girl and boy, suffered injuries. The girl suffered from a stomach wound and glass in her eyes, and the boy a head injury. Just as the van was destroyed, U.S. ground troops made their final turn and arrived on the road with the van. The Apache crew then alerted the ground troops that they believed that they could see an injured child moving around inside the destroyed van. On the video, it is then seen that Army soldiers establish a perimeter around the site and extract the children from the burning van.\n\nThe ground troops that secured the site of the first two strikes then receive small arms fire from nearby buildings.\n\nThere is a period of 20 minutes not included on the leaked tape. According to the internal legal review, the helicopters engaged a group of armed insurgents, and that some were seen entering a nearby building.\n\nAs the tape resumes, two men, one holding an AK-47, are seen walking. They split up and the footage follows one who appears to be armed. He walks into a building which has been identified as the source of fire at U.S. ground troops. They request permission to fire a missile at the building, describing it as \"abandoned\" or \"under construction\". The ground controller responds, \"If you've [positively identified] the individuals in the building with weapons, go ahead and engage the building\". As the pilot positions the helicopter to attack the building, two unarmed men walk towards, and perhaps into, the building. As the gunner fires the first missile, another man is seen walking along the street in front of the building. The missile hits the building, and the man is caught in the explosion. The crew then reposition the helicopter and fire two more missiles into the upper floors of the building\n\nWikiLeaks said in the preface to one of their videos of the incident that \"some of the men appear to have been armed [although] the behavior of nearly everyone was relaxed\" in the introductory text of the shorter video. Julian Assange said \"permission to engage was given before the word 'RPG' was ever used\". Politifact states: \"When Assange points out in the context of justifying the title \"Collateral Murder\" that the word \"RPG\" was not used until after permission to engage was given, he leaves the impression that the soldiers were given the okay to open fire on a group of unarmed men, or men believed to be unarmed. But the video and accompanying audio make clear that the soldiers in the helicopter said they spotted \"weapons\" among those in the group—later allegedly identified by an internal army investigator as an AK-47, RPG rounds and two RPG launchers, one of which was loaded. Assange later acknowledged \"Based upon visual evidence, I suspect there probably were AKs and an RPG, but I'm not sure that means anything\". Assange stated that initial attempts to evacuate the wounded children to a nearby U.S. military hospital were blocked by U.S. military command. The legal review carried out by the U.S. Army states that the two children were evacuated to the 28th Combat Support Hospital via Forward Operating Base Loyalty, then transferred to an Iraqi medical facility the next day.\n\nFox News said that of the attack \"WikiLeaks appears to have done selective editing that tells only half the story. For instance, the Web site takes special care to slow down the video and identify the two photographers and the cameras they are carrying. ... The Web site does not slow down the video to show that at least one man in that group was carrying a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, a clearly visible weapon that runs nearly two-thirds the length of his body. WikiLeaks also does not point out that at least one man was carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. He is seen swinging the weapon below his waist while standing next to the man holding the RPG.\"\n\n\"The Guardian\" stated \"It is unclear if some of the men are armed but Noor-Eldeen can be seen with a camera\". Glenn Greenwald of \"Salon.com\" said that \"the vast majority of the men were clearly unarmed\". Greenwald called the second airstrike a \"plainly unjustified killing of a group of unarmed men carrying away an unarmed, seriously wounded man to safety\". \"The Australian\" newspaper said the group was displaying \"no obvious hostile action\".\n\nIn \"The Independent\" on April 8, 2010, human rights activist Joan Smith asserts that the engagements were like a game to the helicopter crew. She writes that the co-pilot urged a dying, unarmed journalist to pick up a weapon as he tried to crawl to safety; and claims that the footage shows \"the Apache crew opening fire on civilians\". When the crew were informed that a child had been injured by their attack, one initially responded, \"Ah damn. Oh well\", and a minute later continued, \"Well, it's their fault for bringing kids into a battle\". Smith describes this reaction as inhuman. She draws parallels with soldiers who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in earlier wars. She continues, \"the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are inflicting huge psychological damage on combatants\". In refusing to recognize this, the US military fails both its own soldiers and their victims. She concludes that command structures need to be in place to identify \"combatants with serious psychological problems\".\n\nOn \"Democracy Now!\", Josh Stieber, a conscientious objector who was at the time assigned to Bravo Company 2–16, said that although it's natural to \"judge or criticize the soldiers\", in fact \"this is how [they] were trained to act\". He said that the debate should be re-framed, that it is more appropriate to ask \"questions of the larger system\" that teaches \"doing these things is in the best interests of my own country\". In a later interview on the \"World Socialist Web Site\", Stieber said that the attack \"exposes so clearly the fallacy of using war as a tool of foreign policy or as a way to supposedly spread 'freedom and democracy' around the world\".\n\nEthan McCord, a soldier who arrived on the scene after the attack, stated in an interview for the \"Australian Broadcasting Corporation\":\n\nOn June 7, 2010, \"The New Yorker\" reported that Kristinn Hrafnsson, an investigative reporter who worked on the Collateral Murder video and has since become a spokesman for WikiLeaks, claimed to have found the owner of the building who said that three families had been living in there and seven residents had died, including his wife and daughter. The report stated that the helicopter crew did not know how many people were in the building when they destroyed it with missiles, and that \"there is evidence that unarmed people have both entered and are nearby\". It concludes that an investigating officer would want to know how the armed men were identified as combatants from the earlier engagement; would question the nature of the collateral-damage estimate carried out by the crew before the missiles were launched; and would wish to determine whether a missile attack was a proportionate response to the threat.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman insisted the video did not contradict the official finding that the helicopters' crew acted within the rules of engagement and said that the inquiry backed the assessment that the group of men were carrying a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).\n\nOn the day of the attack the U.S. military reported that the two journalists were killed along with nine insurgents, and that the helicopter engagement was related to a U.S. troop raid force that had been attacked by small-arms fire and RPGs. U.S. forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Scott Bleichwehl later stated: \"There is no question that coalition forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force\".\n\n\"The Washington Post\" reported it was unclear whether the journalists were killed by U.S. fire or by shooting from the targeted Iraqis. Captain James Hall stated they couldn't drive in Bradleys in fear of running over bodies. Major Brent Cummings claimed they took great pains to prevent the loss of innocent civilian lives.\n\nReuters reported that it could locate no witnesses who had seen gunmen in the immediate area. Reuters also stated that local police described the attack as \"random American bombardment\". Reuters subsequently asked the U.S. military to probe the deaths. They asked for an explanation of the confiscation of the journalists' two cameras, access to the on-board footage and voice communications from the helicopters involved, and access to the reports of the units involved in the incident, particularly logs of weapons taken from the scene.\n\nOn July 25, 2007, during an off-the-record briefing in Baghdad by the U.S. military, two Reuters editors were shown \"less than three minutes of video from the Apache’s gun camera, up to the exact moment it opened fire the first time.\" The editors asked to see the remaining footage so Reuters could check whether it had been edited or manipulated. They were denied at the briefing and told seek access under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. That same day, Reuters requested a copy of the full video under the Freedom of Information Act. The Pentagon blocked that request despite several follow-up requests by Reuters. In a personal statement during her court-martial, Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning stated that the military did have access to this information, and that it was actively examining it, yet it denied access partially on the basis that the information might no longer exist.\n\nAn internal legal review by staff at Forward Operating Base Loyalty in Iraq during July 2007 stated that the helicopters had attacked a number of armed insurgents within the rules of engagement, and that in an apparent case of civilian casualties two reporters working for Reuters had also been killed. The review would not be released in full until 2010, after the video of the incident had been released by WikiLeaks.\n\n\"Washington Post\" reporter David Finkel, who at the time was embedded with Bravo Company 2–16 Infantry, later covered the incidents of the day in his book, \"The Good Soldiers\". At a February 2013 pretrial hearing, Manning stated that Finkel \"was quoting, I feel in verbatim, the audio communications of the aerial weapons team crew\". She said, however, that she was \"aghast\" at Finkel's portrayal of the incident. \"Reading his account,\" she explained, \"one would believe the engagement was somehow justified as 'payback' for an earlier attack that led to the death of a soldier.\"\n\nEarly in 2010, the internet whistleblower site WikiLeaks made a public request for assistance in decrypting a video it described as \"US bomb strikes on civilians\", specifically requesting access to supercomputer time. The site stated on its Twitter account on January 8, 2010, that it had a copy of gunsight footage of the incidents. The footage was released during an April 5 press conference at the National Press Club, and subsequently under a designated website titled \"Collateral Murder\". WikiLeaks stated that the footage shows the \"murder of Iraqi civilians and two Reuters journalists\".\nWikiLeaks identified the leak's source as \"a number of military whistleblowers\". Speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, a U.S. Defense official confirmed the authenticity of the leaked audio and video. The military reported that it could not find its copy of the video.\n\nWikiLeaks released a 39-minute version, which shows all three incidents, and a 17-minute version, which shows only the first two incidents. Highlighted in the 17-minute version of the video are Noor-Eldeen with a camera and Chmagh talking on his mobile phone. Both videos depict the attack on the van, van driver, and two other men, and the aftermath when the two seriously injured children were evacuated by U.S. ground forces who arrived on the scene. The longer video shows the third attack, in which Hellfire missiles were fired into a building.\n\nIn an Al Jazeera English interview on April 19, 2010, WikiLeaks' Julian Assange explained why WikiLeaks titled the video \"Collateral Murder\":\nRegarding the title, Toby Harnden in \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote: \"Oddly enough, it was Stephen Colbert, ostensibly a comedian, who skewered him\":\n\nAccording to Harnden \"Assange admitted that he was seeking to manipulate and create 'maximum political impact'.\"\nDan Kennedy wrote in \"The Guardian\", \"Even the comedian Stephen Colbert, in an interview with Assange, dropped his rightwing-blowhard persona momentarily to make a serious point, calling the edited version 'emotional manipulation'\".\n\nBill Keller of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"But in its zeal to make the video a work of antiwar propaganda, WikiLeaks also released a version that didn't call attention to an Iraqi who was toting a rocket-propelled grenade and packaged the manipulated version under the tendentious rubric \"Collateral Murder\".\" \"The New York Times\" reported that \"Critics contend that the shorter video was misleading because it did not make clear that the attacks took place amid clashes in the neighborhood and that one of the men was carrying a rocket-propelled grenade.\"\n\nCaptain Jack Hanzlik, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command stated that the airstrike video \"gives you a limited perspective, [it] only tells you a portion of the activity that was happening that day. Just from watching that video, people cannot understand the complex battles that occurred. You are seeing only a very narrow picture of the events.\" Hanzlik said images gathered during a military investigation of the incident show multiple weapons around the dead bodies in the courtyard, including at least three RPGs. \"Our forces were engaged in combat all that day with individuals that fit the description of the men in that video. Their age, their weapons, and the fact that they were within the distance of the forces that had been engaged made it apparent these guys were potentially a threat.\" Also, WikiLeaks \"does not point out that at least one man was carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. He is seen swinging the weapon below his waist while standing next to the man holding the RPG\". The Wikileaks edited video did not add arrows pointing to these men, nor did they label them, as was done with the men carrying cameras. WikiLeaks did, in fact, state \"some of the men appear to have been armed [although] the behavior of nearly everyone was relaxed\" in the introductory text of the shorter video. In an interview with Fox News Assange acknowledged that \"it's likely some of the individuals seen in the video were carrying weapons\". He explained, \"based upon visual evidence I suspect there probably were AKs and an RPG, but I'm not sure that means anything. ... Nearly every Iraqi household has a rifle or an AK. Those guys could have just been protecting their area\". Fox News later stated that \"although it could be argued AK-47 rifles are common household items, RPGs are not\". A draft version of the video WikiLeaks produced made reference to the AK-47s and RPGs, but WikiLeaks said that ultimately they became unsure about the RPG, believing the long object could have been a camera tripod, so they decided not to point it out in the released version.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates criticized WikiLeaks for releasing the video without providing any context. \"These people can put out anything they want, and they're never held accountable for it. There's no before and there's no after\". Gates remarked that the video provides the public a view of warfare \"as seen through a soda straw\". Gates stated: \"They're in a combat situation. The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops. It's obviously a hard thing to see. It's painful to see, especially when you learn after the fact what was going on. But you—you talked about the fog of war. These people were operating in split second situations.\"\n\n\"The New Yorker\" praised its release, calling it \"a striking artifact—an unmediated representation of the ambiguities and cruelties of modern warfare\". Julian Assange said \"it's ludicrous to allege that we have taken anything out of context in this video\".\n\nGabriel Schoenfeld, Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute, said of the airstrike:.\n\nDaniel Ellsberg, a former United States military analyst who was known for having leaked the Pentagon Papers to the media, said of the airstrike:\n\nPublicity of the incident ballooned following the release of the footage. The event was covered by Al Jazeera English, RT and Reuters, and was also followed by organizations including \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Christian Science Monitor\", the BBC, and CNN.\n\nAssange stated that some of the press had not reported on the third airstrike, in which three Hellfire missiles were fired onto an apartment complex, which only appears in the longer unedited version of the two videos.\n\nIn an interview on NPR on April 6, the day after the \"Collateral Murder\" video release, David Finkel pointed out that the Reuters reporters were not embedded with anyone, but working independently. He also gave his view of the context of the killings:\n\nFinkel had reported the day in his book, \"The Good Soldiers\", including conversations which closely matched the subsequently leaked video footage. On the same day as the NPR interview, Finkel was asked how he had gotten a chance to see the unedited video and whether WikiLeaks had shown it to him. He responded, \"I hadn't heard of WikiLeaks before yesterday. I based the account in my book on multiple sources, all unclassified\".\nWikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange said that Finkel had seen the video and that at least one individual at the offices of the \"Washington Post\" had a copy of the video for at least a year, prior to its release by WikiLeaks.\nThe \"Washington Post\" has denied having any copy of the unedited video prior to WikiLeaks release of their edited version, and Finkel (who was on book leave from the \"Washington Post\" at the time) has said that he has never made any statement about his sources for the story, except that it was \"sourced ... from unclassified information and my presence in the area that day\".\n\nEthan McCord, the soldier seen in the video carrying the injured boy, recalled in an interview on \"The Marc Steiner Show\" that on arrival at the scene, \"The first thing I did was run up to the van\". After attending the girl's wounds and handing her to a medic, McCord was ordered to take position on the roof but he returned to the van to find the boy moving his hand. \"I grabbed him and ran to the Bradley myself\". McCord states he was yelled at for not \"pulling security\". \"The first thing I thought of ... was my children at home\". He later sought help for psychological trauma, but was ridiculed by his NCO and told that if he were to go to the mental health officer, \"there would be repercussions\".\n\nMcCord discussed his experience in the battle in an interview with the \"World Socialist Web Site\" on April 28, 2010, stating, \"What happened then was not an isolated incident. Stuff like that happens on a daily basis in Iraq.\" McCord also recalled being ordered to \"kill every motherfucker on the street\" in the event of an attack on their convoy. Describing doubts over his initial enthusiasm in Iraq, McCord said that \"I didn’t understand why people were throwing rocks at us, why I was being shot at and why we're being blown up, when I have it in my head that I was here to help these people. ... The first real serious doubt, where I could no longer justify to myself being in Iraq or serving in the Army, was on that day in July 2007.\" In this interview, McCord reports that repercussions for seeking mental health help could include being labeled as a \"malingerer\", a crime under U.S. military law.\n\nMcCord requested mental health assistance following his experiences in July 12, but was told by his superior officers to \"get the sand out of [his] vagina\" and to \"suck it up and be a soldier\".\n\nWhen interviewed by \"Wired\", McCord stated that he supported Wikileaks in releasing the video, with some qualifications: \"When it was first released I don't think it was done in the best manner that it could have been. They were stating that these people had no weapons whatsoever, that they were just carrying cameras. In the video, you can clearly see that they did have weapons ... to the trained eye.\" McCord added, \"I don't say that Wikileaks did a bad thing, because they didn't. ... I think it is good that they're putting this stuff out there. I don't think that people really want to see this, though, because this is war. ... It's very disturbing.\"\n\nJames Spione made a short documentary film about the airstrikes called \"Incident in New Baghdad\", featuring a first-person account from Ethan McCord. It was nominated as a Documentary Short Subject for the 84th Academy Awards.\n\nIn an interview with Russia Today, McCord stated that he became suicidal after the incident, and attempted suicide on two occasions.\n\nIn May 2010, a 22-year-old American Army intelligence analyst, Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley Manning), was arrested after telling hacker Adrian Lamo she had leaked the airstrike video, along with a video of another airstrike and around 260,000 diplomatic cables, to WikiLeaks. The Internet chats between Manning and Lamo were revealed to the public by \"Wired\".\n\nWikiLeaks said they were unable to confirm whether or not Manning was the source of the video, stating \"we never collect personal information on our sources\", but saying that \"if [Manning is the] whistleblower then, without doubt, he's a national hero\" and \"we have taken steps to arrange for his protection and legal defence\".\n\nOn February 28, 2013, Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of 22 specified charges. Her trial on the remaining charges began on June 3, 2013. On July 30, Manning was acquitted of the most serious charge, that of aiding the enemy, for giving secrets to WikiLeaks. In addition to five or six espionage counts, she was also found guilty of five theft specifications, two computer fraud specifications and multiple military infractions.\n\nOn August 21, 2013, Manning was sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment, reduction in rank from private first class to private, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. Pursuant to a commutation by President Obama, Chelsea Manning was released on May 17, 2017.\n\nIn an June 7, 2010, article in \"The New Yorker\", Raffi Khatchadourian addressed several issues involved in determining the legality of the attacks, including \"proportionality\", \"positive identification\" (\"reasonable certainty\" that the target has hostile intent), and \"the treatment of casualties during an ongoing military operation\". \n\nMark Taylor, an international law expert and a director at the Fafo Institute for International Studies in Norway, told Al Jazeera \"there's a case to be made that a war crime may have been committed.\" He added, \"I think what this video shows is really a case that challenges whether the laws of war are strict enough.\" An article at Gawker stated that Reuters reporter Luke Baker had written an article claiming that the airstrikes may have been war crimes, but Reuters refused to run the story. Reuters responded, \"It is absolutely untrue that this story was spiked. It was sent back for more reporting in an effort to incorporate a wider range of experts. The story was then overtaken by a more updated one out of Washington that incorporated reporting from the original piece.\"\n\nOn April 5, 2010, the same day as the release of the video footage by WikiLeaks, the United States Central Command, which oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, released a collection of documents including two investigative reports. Pentagon officials told the Reuters news agency that U.S. military lawyers were reviewing the video and could reopen an investigation into the incident, but a spokesperson later said that there were no plans to reopen the investigation.\n\nThe report states that at least two members of the group which were first fired on were armed, that two RPGs and one AKM or AK-47 rifle could be seen in the helicopter video, and that these weapons were picked up by the follow-up U.S. ground troops. The report concludes that the Reuters employees were in the company of armed insurgents. It also states that \"The cameras could easily be mistaken for slung AK-47 or AKM rifles, especially since neither cameraman is wearing anything that identifies him as media or press\". The report recommends encouraging journalists in Iraq to wear special vests to identify themselves, and to keep the U.S. military updated about their whereabouts. It claimed reporters' \"furtive attempts to photograph the Coalition Ground Forces made them appear as hostile combatants\".\n\nAccording to the U.S. Army investigation report released by the United States Central Command, the engagement started at 10:20 Iraqi local time and ended at 10:41. A unit from Bravo Company 2–16 was within 100 meters of the individuals that were fired upon with 30mm AH-64 Apache cannons. The company was charged with clearing their sector of any small armed forces, and had been under fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). The company was supported by two Apache helicopters from the 1st Cavalry Division's Aviation Brigade, callsigns \"Crazyhorse 1/8\" and \"Crazyhorse 1/9\". Two men were identified by Crazyhorse 1/8 as carrying an RPG launcher and an AKM or AK-47. When the cameraman on the ground aimed his camera in the direction of Bravo Company 2–16, a pilot remarked \"He's getting ready to fire\". An Apache maneuvered around a building to get a clear field of fire and shot all nine men, killing eight. A passing van then stopped and attempted to load a wounded man. After getting permission to fire, the Apache crew fired on the van. When Bravo Company arrived at the scene, they reported finding two RPGs and an AK-47 or AKM. They also found two Canon EOS digital cameras with telephoto lenses. Two children were found in the van, a four-year-old girl with gunshot wounds and embedded windscreen glass wounds and an eight-year-old boy with multiple wounds, including brain damage arising from shrapnel damage to his right temporal lobe. Both children were said to have been evacuated to the 28th Combat Support Hospital via Forward Operating Base Loyalty, then transferred to an Iraqi medical facility the next day. This account of first bringing the wounded children to the Combat Support Hospital appears to be contradicted by orders by radio that form part of the video record, which forbids it and orders that the children be handed over to local police.\n\nWhile the Air Weapons Team was providing support at the first engagement area they were informed by ground troops that they were receiving small arms fire from the south/southwest. The crew for Crazyhorse 1/8 then located multiple individuals with weapons about 400 meters east of coalition forces and was given clearance to engage the targets. However, the co-pilot/gunner then observed a child and some other non-combatants in the vicinity of the individuals and decided to hold off on the engagement until the non-combatants were clear. After the non-combatants were clear Crazyhorse 1/8 engaged the targets. The crew for Crazyhorse 1/9 could not engage due to target obfuscation from buildings and dust.\n\nThe team observed several individuals from this group, some possibly wounded, run into a large multistory building. The co-pilot/gunner for Crazyhorse 1/9 spotted three individuals near this building get into a red SUV and drive away to the west. For about 5 to 10 minutes the team diverted its attention to this vehicle. However, according to the co-pilot for Crazyhorse 1/8 they failed to positively identify the occupants as combatants and returned to the previous engagement area.\n\nThe events between the attack on the van and the attack on the building (approximately 30 minutes) were not captured on the leaked video footage. The military did not include the attack on the building in their report.\n\nAssange responded to the investigation report released by the Army in an interview with \"Democracy Now!\", stating that \"the tone and language is all about trying to find an excuse for the activity. ... It's very clear that that is the approach, to try and find any mechanism to excuse the behavior, and that is what ended up happening\".\n\nIn May 2011 the Barcelona Human Rights Film Festival awarded the investigative film \"Collateral murder, Hellfire\", done by Kristinn Hrafnsson, Wikileaks spokesperson, and Ingi Ingason, with the award for International Journalism and Human Rights.\n\nIn June 2011 the Federation of German Scientists (VDW) awarded the \"Whistleblower Award\" to the person who made the video \"Collateral Murder\" public via WikiLeaks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28986125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28986125", "title": "Korean literati purges", "text": "Korean literati purges\n\nThe term \"Literati purges\" is a translation of Korean term 'sahwa' (사화 士禍) by Edward W. Wagner, Harvard professor of Korean history. Sahwa literally means \"seonbi's calamity\" and refers to a series of political purges in late 15th and 16th century, in which Sarim scholars suffered persecution at the hands of their political rivals.\n\nThe politics during Middle Joseon Dynasty were primarily marked by a power struggle between the two aristocratic yangban factions - the entrenched Hungu power elites and the upstart Sarim scholars called seonbi, who belonged to neo-Confucian school of Kim Jong-jik and other thinkers. The Sarim scholars generally shunned the royal court and studied neo-Confucianism in rural provinces especially after King Sejo's usurpation of throne in 1455, but they began to enter politics during the reign of King Seongjong. They primarily occupied key positions in so-called \"Three Offices\" (삼사), collective name for Office of Inspector General (whose main role was to impeach government officials for corrupt or improper actions), Office of Censors (whose function to criticize the improper actions and policies of the king and ministers), and Hongmoongwan (library and advisory council that taught the king history and Confucian teachings). They were also well represented in Spring Autumn Office, where government records were kept and historiographers worked. From these organs that were designed to check the power of the king and central government, the Sarim scholars challenged the entrenched Hungu faction, who held key positions in State Council and Six Ministries that carried out state affairs, by impeaching them for corruption or impropriety. The subsequent conflict between two factions resulted in four bloody purges between 1498 and 1545.\n\nThe first and second literati purges took place during the reign of Yeonsangun, successor to Seongjong. The First Literati Purge of 1498, also called Muo Sahwa (무오사화, 戊午士禍), began as a personal grudge of Yi Guk-don against Kim Il-son, who once impeached him. Both were assigned to compile records related to King Seongjong's reign for Annals of Joseon Dynasty, and Kim Il-son, a disciple of Kim Jong-jik, included the latter's writing that was critical of King Sejo's usurpation in the compilation. (Kim Jong-jik wrote a lamentation of Xiang Yu's murder of Emperor Yi of Chu in early Chinese history after he heard of Danjong's death at the order of King Sejo.) When Yi Guk-don, Kim Il-son's superior, found this out, he sensed a chance of revenge. Kim Il-son and other followers of Kim Jong-jik were accused of treason by the Hungu faction, many of whom originally gained power from their support of Sejo. Because Yeonsangun's lineage came from Sejo, Sarim faction's view of Sejo's usurpation was considered to be treasonable. Yeonsangun - who disliked academia and was notorious for turning the Seonggyungwan, royal study hall, into his personal brothel - found an opportunity to purge the Sarim scholars and weaken Three Offices. Kim Il-son and two others were \"drawn and quartered\" (each limb was pulled apart by ox) while three were beheaded. Kim Jong-jik's remains were excavated and then beheaded, and at least 18 others were exiled. Yeonsangun ordered the entire court officials to watch Kim's execution and even ordered that those who did not attend or turned face away be reported so that they might be punished.\n\nThe Second Literati Purge of 1504, or Kapcha Sahwa (갑자사화, 甲子士禍), followed when Yeonsangun eventually discovered that his real mother was not Queen Jung-hyeon but Consort Yoon, who was executed in 1482 for poisoning one of Seongjong's concubines out of jealousy and making a scratch mark on Seongjong's face. When later Yeonsangun was told of details of his mother's death and was presented with a piece of clothing stained with blood vomited by her upon poisoning, he killed two of Seongjong's concubines who were responsible and then ordered the execution of officials who supported Consort Yoon's death. This event struck both the Hungu and the remnants of Sarim factions indiscriminately, including the instigators of the first purge. At least 36 officials were executed (by drinking poison) and remains of eight deceased officials were mutilated. The actual death toll was much greater because the victims' families and relatives were punished as well - male members being killed and the female members enslaved. In the end, 239 officials were affected by the event with execution, exile, or dismissal. Yeonsangun was eventually deposed by the remaining Hungu officials, and his half-brother Jungjong became the eleventh king of Joseon in 1506.\n\nThe Third Literati Purge of 1519, also called Kimyo Sahwa or Gimyo Sahwa (기묘사화, 己卯士禍), is one of the most discussed literati purges in Joseon Dynasty because the Sarim faction held political power and was in the process of carrying out significant reforms at the time of their purge.\n\nJungjong worked to remove excesses of Yeonsangun and return to Seongjong's era, but his royal authority was limited due to powerful presence of coup leaders who put him on the throne. Only when the three main leaders of coup died of old age and natural causes eight years later, Jungjong began to assert his authority and look for ways to restrain Hungu faction's power. He soon found an answer in Jo Gwang-jo, a young and energetic leader of the Sarim faction, who soon became Jungjong's most trusted official. He enjoyed such a complete confidence of Jungjong that Jungjong abandoned a planned war at the sole opposition by Jo. With Jungjong's support, Jo rose to become an Inspector General only four years after entering politics in a series of unprecedented promotions and brought in many like-minded, young Sarim scholars from rural provinces to Jungjong's court. Under his leadership, the Sarim faction pushed forth a series of reforms as they established local self-government system called Hyang'yak, pursued land reforms to distribute land more equally and limit amount of land owned by the rich, promulgated Confucian beliefs widely among the public with vernacular translations, and sought to reduce the number of slaves. Jo believed that any talented people including slaves should be appointed as officials regardless of social status. (For instance, he met a nameless butcher/tanner of lowest class and admired his learning so much that he discussed state affairs with him and wanted to appoint him as a government official.) According to Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace or local provinces during this time because of strict enforcement by Inspector General's Office. He was admired so much by populace that when he appeared on streets people gathered before him saying, \"Our master is coming,\" according to famous Korean philosopher Yi I.\n\nHowever, these radical reforms generated fierce hostility and resistance of the Hungu faction. Jo also made many political enemies by impeaching many of the so-called heroes of 1506 coup. Especially when Jo argued that many of the alleged contributors to 1506 coup did not actually contribute to the coup and revoked their special privileges (including tax exemptions and huge stipends), the Hungu faction began to plot Jo's downfall. In early 1519, there was a plot by some Hungu officials to assassinate Sarim officials, which was discovered in time.\n\nJo's uncompromising character and his frequent remonstrations to Jungjong to support his radical programs also began to irritate the king. Furthermore, Consort Gyeong of Park clan and Consort Hui of Hong clan (Hungu faction leader Hong Kyung-ju's daughter) sought to estrange Jungjong and Jo Gwang-jo by often questioning Jo's loyalty and claiming that popular support was shifting to Jo. At the behest of Hong Kyung-ju, Minister of Rites Nam Gon, and Shim Jung, and other Hungu leaders, they told Jungjong that people were saying that it was actually Jo Gwang-jo who ruled the country and that people wanted to make him their king. Even if Jo was not disloyal, he would not be able to stop his supporters from doing so, they said.\n\nAccording to Annals of Joseon Dynasty, Nam Gon now set out to slander Jo and wrote a phrase \"Ju cho will become the king\" (주초위왕, 走肖爲王)\" with honey or sugary water on mulberry leaves so that caterpillars left behind such phrase on leaves. When two Hanja (Chinese) characters \"ju\"(走) and \"cho\"(肖) are put together, they form a new Hanja character \"jo\"(趙), which happens to be Jo Gwang-jo's family name. Consort Hong or Consort Park showed the leaf to Jungjong and claimed that this was the heaven's warning that Jo would take the throne himself after eliminating Hungu faction. Jungjong, who himself rose to the throne through a coup d'état, began to distrust Jo Gwang-jo. [It should be noted that when Goryeo dynasty fell and was replaced by Joseon dynasty, there was popular saying \"Son of wood will gain the country\" (목자득국 木子得國). When two Hanja characters meaning wood(木) and son(子) are combined, they form a new character \"yi\"(李), which happens to be the family name of Yi Seong-gye, who deposed the last king of Goryeo and founded Joseon dynasty. These phrases helped Yi Seong-gye win popular support for the new dynasty as heaven's will.]\n\nNow feeling certain that Jungjong was sufficiently estranged from Jo, Hong Kyung-ju secretly entered the palace to warn King Jungjong that the court was filled with Jo's supporters and that no one could dare oppose him openly. When Jo petitioned Jungjong to revoke special privileges of people who falsely contributed to 1506 coup, Jungjong's suspicion was further heightened. Jungjong dispatched a secret letter to Hong Kyung-ju, expressing his fear that Jo Gwang-jo would next go on to question legitimacy of the coup and then turn against him. Jungjong instructed Hungu leaders to kill Jo Gwang-jo and then inform him. On November 15, 1519, Hungu leaders entered the palace secretly at night to bypass Royal Secretariat and present to the king written charges against Jo: he and his supporters deceived the king and put the state in disorder by forming a clique and abusing their positions to promote their supporters while excluding their opponents. Inspector Jo Gwang-jo, Justice Minister Kim Jung, and six others were immediately arrested, and they were about to be killed extrajudicially without trial or even investigation. The whole event had appearance of coup d'état except that it was sanctioned by the king.\n\nThey would have been immediately killed except that War Minister Yi Jang-gon, who arrested Sarim officials, entreated that ministers should be consulted for such decision. The cabinet meeting on the following day regarding Jo's fate is described in detail in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. Most officials expressed their shock at Jo Gwang-jo's arrest and Jungjong's intention to execute him. They entreated that he may have been extreme in his youthful zeal to improve the country but could not possibly have private agenda. Chief State Councillor Jeong Gwang-pil, who often clashed with Jo and was even approached by Nam Gon for support, entreated in tears: \"I have frequently witnessed horrid calamities during the reign of deposed king (Yeonsangun), but how could I imagine to see such thing again even after meeting the wise king?\" Chief Council and Six Ministries jointly entreated that punishing Jo and others on such charge without evidence would be a blot on the king's reputation. Eighteen younger officials requested to the king to imprison them with Jo Gwang-jo. Even Hong Sook, who became Justice Minister overnight and interrogated Jo, reported to the king that he was \"deeply moved\" by Jo's loyalty.\n\nNew Inspector General Yu Eun protested in even stronger terms: \"If Jo Gwang-jo is guilty of crime, he should be punished in open and just manner ... Instead, Your Majesty is handing out such punishment after secret words by two people in the middle of night... What is so difficult about punishing few seonbis with authority of king that Your Majesty should do so secretly by sending a secret message?... If there is a crime, it should be dealt with clearly and justly, but Your Majesty appeared to trust and be friendly with your subjects on the outside while thinking of eliminating them in mind.\" Meanwhile, 150 Seonggyungwan students stormed the palace to protest Jo's arrest and filled the palace with shouts of entreaties, and later 240 students petitioned to claim Jo's innocence and requested to be imprisoned together. Such outpouring in Jo's support may have increased Jungjong's suspicion and anger. Later Chief State Councillor Jeong, Deputy State Councillor Ahn Dang and even War Minister Yi Jang-gon were removed from office for opposing Jo's execution.\n\nJo Gwang-jo was completely caught off guard by the turn of the event. The Sarim faction had scored its biggest victory just four days earlier when Jungjong granted their petition to revoke special status for 70 Hungu officials. He continued to believe that Jungjong was misled by wicked Hungu ministers and was confident that he could persuade the king of his loyalty once he could face him in the interrogation. He wrote to Jungjong of his fear of this incident becoming a bloody purge and entreated that he would not regret dying ten thousand times if only he could be granted an audience. However, he would never have a chance to see Jungjong again. Amid petitions for leniency, Jungjong commuted the death sentence to exile, and Jo Gwang-jo was exiled to Neung-ju. But less than a month later, Jungjong fired many ministers who entreated on Jo's behalf and reinstated Jo's death sentence by poison. Before drinking poison, Jo wrote a death poem declaring his loyalty and bowed four times toward the palace. Later when there was a severe drought in the country, people believed that it was heaven's punishment for killing an innocent seonbi.\n\nKim Jung and three others were executed as well in 1520, and dozens of Sarim scholars were exiled. Many others left the central government in protest and retreated to rural provinces. In 1521, Ahn Dang's son allegedly plotted to assassinate Nam Gon and Shim Jung, for which a dozen people including Ahn Dang were executed. In all, 225 officials were affected by the purge. Most of Jo's reforms were rescinded with his fall. \nIn the end, Jungjong abruptly abandoned his reformist agenda because he either lost confidence in Jo Gwango-jo's programs or feared that he would become too powerful in the future. While Jungjong and Jo Gwang-jo shared the reformist agenda, Jungjong was also chiefly interested in solidifying royal authority whereas the latter was more concerned with neo-Confucian ideology, in which the king must be governed and restricted by teachings of Confucius and Mencius.\n\nThe Third Literati Purge of 1519 was widely viewed as a missed opportunity to fulfill ideal neo-Confucian society by later generations because Joseon politics soon degenerated into power struggle among in-laws and relatives of the royal family. Later its victims, called Gimyo Sarim or \"Wise men of Gimyo,\" were venerated as Confucian martyrs while instigators became symbols of wickedness for many generations (For instance, fermented fish of lowest quality is still called \"Gonjangyi\", combined word from Nam Gon and Shim Jung's given names). Nam Gon, one of main instigators who fabricated the conspiracy, regretted his role in the purge late in his life and willed that all his writings be burnt. No writing of his remains except for one short poem although he was a famous writer.\n\nWhen Jungjong died in 1544 and the crown prince Injong became the twelfth king, Sarim's hopes proved to be true. He appointed Yi Eonjeok and other famous Sarim scholars to high positions and rehabilitated Jo Gwang-jo and other purge victims. Unfortunately for the Sarim faction, Injong's reign was also to be the shortest of Joseon kings. When Injong died eight months later and Myeongjong became the thirteenth king of Joseon at the age of twelve, his mother Queen Munjeong became the regent and her brother Yoon Won Hyung wielded enormous power. (Many in the Sarim faction believed that Injong was poisoned by Queen Munjeong, but there is no evidence that this was the case.) Lesser Yoon faction was not persecuted by Greater Yoon faction during Injong's reign, but Injong dismissed Yoon Won-hyung and Yoon Won-ro from their positions after they were impeached by the Greater Yoon faction. Now that he was reinstated, Yoon Wong-hyung accused Yoon Im and his supporters of plotting to put another prince instead of Myeongjong on the throne after Injong's death. This ploy at first backfired and led to his exile, but continued accusations and rumors of Yoon Im's treason led to the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545, in which the prince, Yoon Im, and nine of his supporters including Sarim scholars were executed. After this initial purge, Yoon Won-hyung continued to purge his rivals and Sarim scholars over next five years until the total death toll surpassed one hundred and many others including Yi Eonjeok were exiled. Yoon Won-hyung even killed his older brother Yoon Won-ro in the ensuing power struggle. After Queen Munjeong's death in 1565, Myeongjong exiled Yoon Won-hyung, who died or committed suicide the same year, and attempted to govern well by recruiting talented people but died two years later. Along with Kim Anro, Yoon Won-hyung is considered one of the worst politicians of Joseon dynasty.\n\nUnlike other literati purges, the Fourth Literati Purge pf 1545, or Ulsa Sahwa (을사사화, 乙巳士禍), was largely a result of power struggle between relatives of the competing princes. After Jo Gwang-jo's fall, Nam Gon and Shim Jung's faction and Kim Anro's faction vied for power after Kim Anro's son married Jungjong's eldest daughter. Kim Anro was exiled by Nam Gon and Shim Jung for abusing power, but he returned from exile after Nam Gon's death and successfully drove out Shim Jung, who was accused of accepting bribes from Consort Park to help her put her son on the throne instead of crown prince. Later he framed Shim Jung and Consort Park on the charge of cursing the crown prince (A dead rat whose mouth, eyes, and ears were burnt with hot iron to make it look like a pig was discovered hanging from a tree in the crown prince's palace on his birthday. There also phrases cursing the crown prince, whose Chinese zodiac sign was Pig. Consort Park was suspected for she was already known to be plotting to put her son on the throne instead. It was later found out to be Kim Anro's doing after his fall.) Consort Park, her son Prince Buksong, and Shim Jung were executed. Kim Anro now unleashed the reign of terror against his political enemies in the name of protecting the crown prince. He even attempted to depose Queen Munjeong, who gave birth to a son who was later to become Myeongjong, but this led to his downfall and execution in 1537.\n\nAfter Kim Anro's fall, the crown prince Injong's maternal uncle Yoon Im and Queen Munjeong's brothers Yoon Won-ro and Yoon Won-hyung filled the power vacuum. (Yoon Im and Yoon Brothers were close relatives by that period's standards - Yoon Im's great-grandfather was older brother of Yoon Brothers' great-great-grandfather.) Many officials gathered around the two centers of power and developed into separate political factions. Yoon Im's faction became known as ‘Greater Yoon’ and the Yoon brothers' faction as ‘Lesser Yoon.’ By then, Jungjong promoted Sarim scholars again by recalling them from exile and reappointing to court positions to restrain Hungu faction's power. Many Sarim scholars joined the Greater Yoon since they had great hopes for the crown prince, who studied under Jo Gwang-jo and Yi Hwang and was greatly anticipated to become a benevolent ruler.\n\nThese four purges decimated the Sarim faction and again drove them to the rural villages, where they built schools (called seowon). Yi Hwang, for example, left politics in the aftermath of the Fourth Literati Purge and did not return to the court despite repeated summons by Myeongjong. Other famous philosophers Jo Shik, Seo Gyeong-deok, and Seoung Soo-chim also turned away from politics after Jo Gwang-jo's death. Jo Shik turned down his appointment by writing to Myeongjong: \"Under Your Majesty's reign, state of affairs has already gone awry and the foundation of the country has already collapsed. Heaven's will has already left as did the support of people... The Queen Regent is thoughtful, but she is merely a widow deep inside palace, and Your Majesty is young and thus merely a lonely heir to the late king. Therefore, how would one handle thousands of natural disasters and billion pieces of people's heart?\" (In Joseon Dynasty, natural disasters were thought to occur due to king's fault.)\n\nHowever, the Sarim continued to thrive in rural provinces through its seowons and Hyang'yak system. By the reign of King Seonjo, successor to Myeongjong, the Sarim faction gained the control of the central government and dominated Joseon politics ever since.\n\nThe above account of literati purges is based on widely accepted traditional understanding of the subject, which largely stems from the Sarim faction's point of view. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty and much of what we know about these events were largely written by Sarim scholars even before they emerged as the eventual victor. Some historians have tried to reinterpret the literati purges as a result of struggle between the Joseon kings who wanted to establish absolute monarchy and the arisocrats who claimed that the true loyalty to king was to guide him to become a benevolent Confucian philosopher-king by pointing out his mistakes if necessary. The Sarim scholars tended to occupy key positions in Three Offices, which put them in conflict with the king and high-ranking ministers. In this view, the distinction between Sarim and Hungu factions are thought to be largely artificial, and division within aristocracy was largely along the family connections rather than philosophical differences.\n\nFollowing the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545, there were a series of other similar purges out of political struggle between different factions, but they are not called \"literati purges,\" or \"sahwa\" (사화) in Korean, which specifically refers to persecution of Sarim scholars by the Hungu faction in late 15th and early 16th century. The later purges are instead called with various names such as \"oksa\" (meaning treason case), \"muok\"(false treason case), \"hwanguk\" (change of power), and \"bakhae\" (persecution, especially of those Catholic faith in the 19th century). One notable example of the later purges is Treason Case of 1589, or Gichuk Oksa, which is sometimes called the fifth literati purge even though both the instigators and victims were of Sarim faction. In these later purges, the victimized faction would call the event \"literati purge (sahwa)\" to signify their innocence and the rival faction's wrongs.\n\n\nThe Korean literati purges are frequently depicted in Korean television dramas and movies. In Dae Jang Geum, main protagonist Jang Guem's father is a victim of the second literati purge. Jang Geum herself and her mentor Lady Han are framed in connection with the third literati purge while the male protagonist Min Jung Ho is portrayed as a follower of Jo Gwang-jo. In television drama Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin (2004-5), Yi Sun-shin's grandfather is depicted as a victim of third literati purge and Yi's father is arrested while paying respect to Jo Gwang-jo's spirit at Jo's abandoned house. the second literati purge is dramatized through the movie, \"The Treacherous\" (2015). The third and fourth literati purges also constitute main plot lines of the 2001 television drama \"Ladies of the Palace\". The first and second literati purges are depicted in television dramas \"King and Queen\" (1998–2000) \"The King and I\" (2007–2008), \"Queen Insoo \" (2011) \" and 2005 film The King and the Clown.\n"}

{"id": "34832514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34832514", "title": "Melvin Ember", "text": "Melvin Ember\n\nMelvin Lawrence Ember (January 13, 1933 – September 27, 2009) was an American cultural anthropologist and cross-cultural researcher with wide-ranging interests who combined an active research career with writing for nonprofessionals.\n\nDrawn to anthropology after reading the works of Margaret Mead, he attended Columbia University at the young age of 16 where he was further inspired by Elman Service and Morton Fried in the anthropology department (B.A. 1953). He then went on to Yale University to study for his Ph.D. in anthropology (received 1958), primarily under the mentorship of George Peter Murdock.\n\nAfter a year’s postdoctoral work at Yale, Ember spent four years at the Laboratory of Socio-Environmental Studies at the National Institute of Health (1959–62). He was professor at Antioch College (1963–67) and Hunter College (1967–87). He also chaired the department of anthropology at Hunter College of the City University of New York (1967–73). Here he succeeded in expanding the department significantly, attracting young scholars from major institutions. He also served as executive officer of the City University of New York graduate program in anthropology from 1973 to 1975.\n\nHe was president of the Society for Cross-Cultural Research in 1981–82 and in 1982 took over the editorship of Cross-Cultural Research, a position he held until the time of his death. He moved to the New Haven area in 1987 to become president of the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), an institution at Yale whose mission is to foster the comparative study of culture. Under his leadership, he helped revitalize the institution, moving its databases into the digital age.\n\nIn contrast to most cultural anthropologists at the time, who conducted their fieldwork in a single community, Ember's fieldwork in American Samoa was explicitly comparative, using community variation to test theories about culture change. He chose three communities differing in distance from the commercial center to evaluate how commercial involvement affected political change.\n\nHis assessment of Samoan kinship was subsequently challenged by Derek Freeman, long before the now-famous Mead–Freeman controversy about Samoa. Because Ember knew, from his cross-community comparisons, that there was substantial variation within American Samoa, he questioned how Freeman, working in a very different time and in Western Samoa, could doubt Mead’s veracity.\n\nAt the National Institute of Mental Health Embler worked on the universality of the familial incest taboo. Since all societies prohibit familial incest, he decided to focus on cross-cultural variation in cousin marriage to try to understand why some societies allowed close cousin marriages while others forbade it.\n\nAfter evaluating the various explanatory hypotheses of the time, his own empirical research confirmed that much of the variation in cousin marriage could best be explained as an adaptation to the harmful effects of inbreeding.\n\nAs a professor at Antioch College and Hunter College Ember continued his cross-cultural work on aspects of kinship and social organization, picking up first on topics that Murdock was unable to explain, such as variation in post-marital residence and unilineal descent. Traditional theories had focused on economic factors, such as which gender contributed most to the economy, but finding these explanations lacking in predictive value, Ember began to explore other possibilities, particularly the effects of warfare in the social environment.\n\nBecause warfare seemed so central in explaining various aspects of social organization, he then turned to research that tested ideas about why societies varied in type and frequency of violence, looking at variation in warfare frequency, homicide, and corporal punishment of children in the anthropological record. Believing that laws about human nature should hold true among technological complex as well as simpler societies, he persuaded political scientist Bruce Russett to join him and his wife Carol R. Ember in a project to test the theory that “democracies do not fight each other”.\n\nAlthough the concepts of democracy and international war had to be transformed to fit the anthropological record, the results of their collaborative research were consistent with many studies conducted by political scientists. Ember later worked with cross-cultural psychologists to explore the relationships between aggression and war.\n\nBranching out into diverse and interdisciplinary research areas was not unusual for Ember. Indeed, he published scholarly articles in archaeology, linguistics, biological anthropology, and even ethology. He fervently believed that the work of different anthropologists in far-flung places and across time could be used to test theories about why cultures varied or were similar and he devoted most of his research career to systematically testing explanations, rather than just expounding them.\n\nHis passion for systematic comparative research on challenging questions in all areas of anthropology influenced a generation of younger scholars through his direction of the first Summer Institute for Cross-Cultural Research in 1964, his active participation in NSF-funded Summer Institutes in Comparative Research between 1991 and 1999, and through the series of publications in comparative methods that resulted from these Institutes.\n\nEmber is widely known as the co-author of two major textbooks, \"Anthropology\" (with Carol R. Ember and Peter N. Peregrine, Prentice-Hall), and \"Cultural Anthropology\" (with Carol R. Ember, Prentice-Hall), first published in 1973 and now in their 13th edition (2011). He was also editor or co-editor of eight encyclopedias.\n"}

The Ministry has the largest budget among the federal departments of India and currently maintains fifth in military expenditure, among countries of the world.\n\nThe President of India is the ceremonial commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the country. The Ministry of Defence provides policy framework and resources to the armed forces to discharge their responsibility in the context of the defence of the country. The Indian Armed Forces (including Indian Army, Indian Air Force, Indian Navy) and Indian Coast Guard under the Ministry of Defences are primarily responsible for ensuring the territorial integrity of the nation.\n\nAt present, the undergoing new creation of National Defence University, for training of military officials and concerned civilian officials, will be administered and overseen by Ministry of Defence. The ministry organises and runs Republic Day celebrations and parade every year in January, hosting a chief guest.\n\nA military department was created by the supreme government of the British East India Company at Kolkata in the year 1776. Its main function was to co-ordinate and record orders, relating to the army, issued by various departments of the government of the East India Company. The Military Department initially functioned as a branch of the Public Department and maintained a list of army personnel.\n\nWith the Charter Act 1833 the Secretariat of the Government of the East India Company was reorganised into four departments, each headed by a secretary to the Government. The armies in the presidencies of Bengal, Bombay and Madras functioned as the respective presidency armies until April 1895, when the presidency armies were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative convenience, it was divided into four commands: Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal (including Burma), Madras and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).\n\nThe supreme authority over the Indian Army was vested in the Governor General-in-Council, subject to the control of the Crown, which was exercised by the Secretary of State for India. Two members in the Council were responsible for military affairs. One was the Military Member, who supervised all administrative and financial matters. The other was the commander-in-chief who was responsible for all operational matters. The Military Department was abolished in March 1906 and was replaced by two separate departments; the Army Department and the Military Supply Department. In April 1909 the Military Supply Department was abolished and its functions were taken over by the Army Department. The Army Department was redesignated as the Defence Department in January 1938. The Department of Defence became the Ministry of Defence under a cabinet minister in August 1947.\n\nThe functions of MoD which in 1947 was mainly logistic support to the armed forces, has undergone far reaching changes. In November 1962, following the 1962 war, a Department of Defence Production was set-up to deal with research, development and production of defence equipment. In November 1965, the Department of Defence Supplies was created for planning and execution of schemes for import substitution of requirements for defence purposes. These two Departments were later merged to form the Department of Defence Production and Supplies.\n\nIn 1980, the Department of Defence Research and Development was created. In January 2004, the Department of Defence Production and Supplies was renamed the Department of Defence Production. A Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister was appointed to advise on scientific aspects of military equipment and the research and design of defence forces equipment. The Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare was created in 2004.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence consists of four Departments; Department of Defence, Department of Defence Production, Department of Defence Research and Development, and Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare. The Defence Secretary functions as head of the Department of Defence, and is additionally responsible for coordinating the activities of the four Departments in the Ministry.\n\nThe principal functions of all the Departments are as follows:\n\nInstitute for Defence Studies and Analyses, Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, Defence Institute of Psychological Research and National Defence University come under administration and purview of the Ministry of Defence.\n\nTo ensure a high degree of synergy between the Armed forces, the Government has set up the Integrated Defence Staff, headed by the Chief of Integrated Staff as the Chairman. It was created on 1 October 2001 based on the recommendations of the Group of Ministers which was set up in 2000 (post-Kargil) to review India's defence management. It acts as the point organisation for integration of policy, doctrine, war fighting and procurement by employing best management practices.

{"id": "625793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625793", "title": "Newburgh Conspiracy", "text": "Newburgh Conspiracy\n\nThe Newburgh Conspiracy was what appeared to be a planned military coup by the Continental Army in March 1783, when the American Revolutionary War was at its end. The conspiracy may have been instigated by members in the Congress of the Confederation, who circulated an anonymous letter in the army camp at Newburgh, New York on March 10, 1783. Soldiers were unhappy that they had not been paid for some time and unfunded pensions that had been promised. The letter suggested that they should take unspecified action against Congress to resolve the issue. The letter was said to have been written by Major John Armstrong, aide to General Horatio Gates, although the authorship of its text and underlying ideas is a subject of historical debate.\n\nCommander-in-Chief George Washington stopped any serious talk of rebellion when he successfully appealed on March 15 in an emotional address to his officers asking them to support the supremacy of Congress. Not long afterward, Congress approved a compromise agreement it had previously rejected: it funded some of the pay arrears, and granted soldiers five years of full pay instead of a lifetime pension of half pay.\n\nThe motivations of numerous actors in these events are the subject of debate. Some historians allege that serious consideration was given within the army to some sort of \"coup d'état\", while others dispute the notion. The exact motivations of congressmen involved in communications with army officers implicated in the events are similarly debated.\n\nAfter the British loss at the Siege of Yorktown in October 1781, the American Revolutionary War died down in North America, and peace talks began between British and American diplomats. The American Continental Army, based at Newburgh, New York, monitored British-occupied New York City. With the end of the war and dissolution of the Continental Army approaching, soldiers who had long been unpaid feared that the Confederation Congress would not meet previous promises concerning back pay and pensions.\nCongress had in 1780 promised Continental officers a lifetime pension of half their pay when they were discharged. Financier Robert Morris had in early 1782 stopped army pay as a cost-saving measure, arguing that when the war finally ended the arrears would be made up. Throughout 1782 these issues were a regular topic of debate in Congress and in the army camp at Newburgh, and numerous memos and petitions by individual soldiers had failed to significantly affect Congressional debate on the subject.\n\nA number of officers organized under the leadership of General Henry Knox and drafted a memorandum to Congress. Signed by enough general officers that it could not be readily dismissed as the work of a few malcontents, the memo was delivered to Congress by a delegation consisting of General Alexander McDougall and Colonels John Brooks and Matthias Ogden in late December 1782. It expressed unhappiness over pay that was months in arrears, and concern over the possibility that the half pay pension would not be forthcoming. In the memo they offered to accept a lump sum payment instead of the lifetime half pay pension. It also contained the vague threat that \"any further experiments on their [the army's] patience may have fatal effects.\" The seriousness of the situation was also communicated to Congress by Secretary at War Benjamin Lincoln.\n\nCongress was politically divided on the subject of finance. The treasury was empty, and Congress lacked the power to compel the states to provide the necessary funds for meeting its obligations. An attempt to amend the Articles of Confederation to allow Congress to impose an import tariff known as an \"impost\" was decisively defeated by the states in November 1782, and some states had enacted legislation forbidding their representatives from supporting any sort of lifetime pension. Members of the \"nationalist\" faction in Congress who had supported the tax proposal (including Robert Morris, Gouverneur Morris, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton) believed that the army funding issues could be used as a lever to gain for Congress the ability to raise its own revenue.\nThe army delegation first met with Robert Morris and other nationalists. The politicians convinced McDougall that it was imperative for the army to remain cooperative while they sought funding. The hope they expressed was to tie the army's demands to those of the government's other creditors to force opposing Congressmen to act.\n\nOn January 6 Congress established a committee to address the army's memo. It first met with Robert Morris, who stated that there were no funds to meet the army's demands, and that loans for government operations would require evidence of a revenue stream. When it met with McDougall on January 13, the general painted a stark picture of the discontent at Newburgh; Colonel Brooks opined that \"a disappointment might throw [the army] into blind extremities.\" When Congress met on January 22 to debate the committee's report, Robert Morris shocked the body by tendering his resignation, heightening tension. The Congressional leadership immediately moved to keep Morris's resignation secret.\n\nDebate on a funding scheme turned in part on the issue of the pension. Twice the nationalists urged the body to adopt a commuted pension scheme (one that would end after a fixed time, rather than lifetime), but it was rejected both times. After the second rejection on February 4, a plot to further raise tensions began to take shape. Four days later, Colonel Brooks was dispatched back to Newburgh with instructions to gain the army leadership's agreement with the proposed nationalist plan. The army leadership was also urged by Gouverneur Morris to use its influence with state legislatures to secure their approval for needed changes. On February 12, McDougall sent a letter (signed with the pseudonym \"Brutus\") to General Knox suggesting that the army might have to mutiny by refusing to disband until it was paid. He specifically told Knox to not make any direct steps, but that he should \"not lose a moment preparing for events.\" Historian Richard Kohn is of the opinion that the purpose of these communications was not to foment a coup or military action against Congress or the states, but to use the specter of a recalcitrant army's refusal to disband as a political weapon against the antinationalists. The nationalists were also aware of a significant cadre of lower-level officers who were unhappy with General Washington's leadership and had gravitated to the camp of Major General Horatio Gates, a longtime Washington rival. These officers, Kohn believes, could be used by the nationalists to stage something that resembled a coup if necessary.\nThe arrival on February 13 of rumors that a preliminary peace agreement had been reached in Paris heightened the sense of urgency among the nationalists. Alexander Hamilton wrote a letter to General Washington the same day, essentially warning him of the possibility of impending unrest among the ranks, and urging him to \"take the direction\" of the army's anger. Washington responded that he sympathized both with the plight of his officers and men and with those in Congress, but that he would not use the army to threaten the civil government. Washington believed such a course of action would violate the principles of republicanism for which they had all been fighting. It was unclear to the Congressional nationalists whether Knox, who had been a regular supporter of army protests to Congress, would play a role in any sort of staged action. In letters written February 21, Knox unambiguously indicated he would play no such part, expressing the hope that the army's force would only be used against \"the Enemies of the liberties in America.\"\n\nOn February 25 and 26 there was a flurry of activity in Philadelphia, which may have been occasioned by the arrival of Knox's letters. The nationalists had had little success in advancing their program through Congress, and continued to use rhetoric repeating concerns over the army's stability. On March 8 Pennsylvania Colonel Walter Stewart arrived at Newburgh. Stewart was known to Robert Morris; the two had previous dealings when Stewart proposed coordinating activities of private creditors of the government, and he was aware of the poor state of affairs in Philadelphia. His movement to Newburgh had been ordered by Washington (he was returning to duty after recovering from an illness) and would not necessarily draw notice. Although his movements at camp are not known in detail, it appears likely that he met with General Gates not long after his arrival. Within hours rumors began flying around the Newburgh camp that the army would refuse to disband until its demands were met.\n\nOn the morning of March 10 an unsigned letter began circulating in the army camp. Later acknowledged to be written by Major John Armstrong, Jr., aide to General Gates, the letter decried the army's condition and the lack of Congressional support, and called upon the army to send Congress an ultimatum. Published at the same time was an anonymous call for a meeting of all field officers for 11 a.m. the next day.\nWashington reacted with dispatch. On the morning of the 11th in his general orders he objected to the \"disorderly\" and \"irregular\" nature of the anonymously called meeting, and announced that there would be a meeting of officers on the 15th instead. This meeting, he said, would be presided over by the senior officer present, and Washington requested a report of the meeting, implying that he would not attend. On the morning of the 12th a second unsigned letter appeared, claiming Washington's agreement to a meeting as an endorsement of the conspirators' position. Washington, who had initially thought the first letter to be the work of individuals outside the camp (specifically citing Gouverneur Morris as a likely candidate), was compelled to admit this unlikely given the speed at which the second letter appeared.\n\nThe March 15 meeting was held in the \"New Building\" or \"Temple\", a 40 by 70 foot (12 by 21 m) building at the camp. After Gates opened the meeting, Washington entered the building to everyone's surprise. He asked to speak to the officers, and the stunned Gates relinquished the floor. Washington could tell by the faces of his officers, who had not been paid for quite some time, that they were quite angry and did not show the respect or deference as they had toward Washington in the past.\n\nWashington then gave a short but impassioned speech, now known as the , counseling patience. His message was that they should oppose anyone \"who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood.\" He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers. He gazed upon it and fumbled with it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them. He then said: \"Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country.\" This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a great deal for the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years. Many of those present were moved to tears, and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter. He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty. Knox and Colonel Brooks were then appointed to a committee to draft a suitable resolution. Approved by virtually the entire assembly, the resolution expressed \"unshaken confidence\" in Congress, and \"disdain\" and \"abhorrence\" for the irregular proposals published earlier in the week. Historian Richard Kohn believes the entire meeting was carefully stage-managed by Washington, Knox, and their supporters. The only voice raised in opposition was that of Colonel Timothy Pickering, who criticized members of the assembly for hypocritically condemning the anonymous addresses that only days before they had been praising.\n\nGeneral Washington had sent copies of the anonymous addresses to Congress. This \"alarming intelligence\" (as James Madison termed it) arrived while Congress was debating the pension issues. Nationalist leaders orchestrated the creation of a committee to respond to the news, which was deliberately populated with members opposed to any sort of pension payment. The pressure worked on Connecticut representative Eliphalet Dyer, one of the committee members, and he proposed approval of a lump sum payment on March 20. The final agreement was for a five years' full pay instead of the lifetime half pay pension scheme originally promised. They received government bonds which at the time were highly speculative, but were in fact redeemed 100 cents on the dollar (i.e., at full value) by the new government in 1790.\nThe soldiers continued to grumble, with the unrest spreading to the noncommissioned officers (sergeants and corporals). Riots occurred and mutiny threatened. Washington rejected suggestions that the army stay in operation until the states found the money for the pay. On April 19, 1783, his General Orders of the day announced the end of hostilities against Great Britain. Congress thereafter ordered him to disband the army, since everyone agreed that a large army of 10,000 men was no longer needed, and the men were eager to go home. Congress gave each soldier three months pay, but since they had no funds Robert Morris issued $800,000 in personal notes to the soldiers. Many soldiers sold these notes to speculators, some even before they left camp, in order to be able to make their way home. Over the next several months, much of the Continental Army was furloughed, although many of the rank and file realized it was effectively a disbandment. The army was formally disbanded in November 1783, leaving only a small force at West Point and several scattered frontier outposts.\n\nDiscontent related to pay had resurfaced in Philadelphia in June 1783. Due in part to a critical miscommunication, troops in eastern Pennsylvania were led to believe that they would be discharged even before Morris' promissory notes would be distributed, and they marched to the city in protest. Pennsylvania President John Dickinson refused to call out the militia (reasoning they might actually support the mutineers), and Congress decided to relocate to Princeton, New Jersey. There is circumstantial evidence that several participants in the Newburgh affair (notably Walter Stewart, John Armstrong, and Gouverneur Morris) may have played a role in this uprising as well.\n\nThe main long-term result of the Newburgh affair was a strong reaffirmation of the principle of civilian control of the military, and banishing any possibility of a coup as outside the realm of republican values. It also validated Washington's stature as a leading proponent of civilian control.\n\nHistorian Richard Kohn writes that a number of key details about the individuals and their motivations are not known, and probably never will be. For example, it is unclear exactly how much Colonels Brooks and Stewart, the principal messengers in the affair, knew. The intent of the Gates group has been the subject of some debate: Kohn argues that they were intent on organizing some form of direct action (although he disclaims the idea that this would necessarily take the form of a traditional \"coup d'état\"), while historian Paul David Nelson claims Kohn's thesis is circumstantial and poorly supported by primary materials. A letter written by General Gates in June 1783 illustrates the disagreement: in the letter Gates writes that the purpose of the events was to pressure Congress. Kohn argues that Gates is writing after the fact to cover his tracks, while Nelson claims Gates is giving a candid account of the affair. Historian C. Edward Skeen writes that Kohn's case is weak because it relies heavily on interpretation of written statements and is not well supported by the actions of the alleged conspirators. He notes, for example, that there is ample evidence suggesting mutinous sentiments were not obviously circulating in the Newburgh camp between the arrivals of Brooks and Stewart; Kohn counters that the relative quiet in camp masked significant undercurrents of unhappiness.\n\nDavid Cobb, who served on Washington's staff during the affair, wrote in 1825, \"I have ever considered that the United States are indebted for their republican form of government solely to the firm and determined republicanism of George Washington at this time.\" Skeen notes that the event has served to significantly burnish Washington's reputation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42103121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42103121", "title": "Peace psychology", "text": "Peace psychology\n\nPeace psychology is a subfield of psychology and peace research that deals with the psychological aspects of peace, conflict, violence, and war. Peace psychology can be characterized by four interconnected pillars: (1) research, (2) education, (3) practice, and (4) advocacy. The first pillar, research, is documented most extensively in this article.\n\nPeace psychological activities are based on psychological models (theories) and methods; they are usually normatively bound in their means and objectives by working towards the ideal of sustainable peace using (as far as possible) non-violent means. Violence and peace are usually defined in terms of Johan Galtung's extended conceptualization of peace, according to which peace is not merely the absence of personal (direct) violence and war (= negative peace), but also the absence of structural (indirect) and cultural violence (= positive peace). The ideal of peace can also be conceptualized as the comprehensive implementation of human rights (civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights); this should, among other purposes, ensure the satisfaction of basic human needs, such as positive personal and social identity, sense of control, security, (social) justice, well-being, a safe environment, and access to adequate food and shelter.\n\nOrganizations that focus on peace psychology include, for example, in the United States the Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict, and Violence (Peace Psychology Division [Division 48] of the American Psychological Association) and Psychologists for Social Responsibility, a nongovernmental organization based in Washington, DC. Germany has the Forum Friedenspsychologie, and the Australian Psychological Society has an Interest Group called Psychologists for Peace. On the international level, there is the Committee for the Psychological Study of Peace as well as the International Network of Psychologists for Social Responsibility, which links organizations from (among other countries) Germany, Finland, the United States, Australia, Costa Rica, India, and Italy.\n\nPeace psychological research can be analytically (research \"on\" peace) or normatively (research \"for\" peace) oriented. Regardless of its analytical or normative orientation, peace psychological research mainly deals with the \"psychological aspects of the formation, escalation, reduction, and resolution of conflicts\" (including war), the \"psychosocial conditions conducive or detrimental to a sustainable peace\", and the \"psychosocial effects of war and violence\". In each case, different levels of analysis and explanation are relevant: from the level of individuals to groups, social organizations and institutions, states and state systems (e.g., the European Union), military alliances (e.g., NATO), and collective security systems (e.g., the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE]).\n\nPeace psychology focuses on the psychological aspects of the formation, escalation, reduction, and resolution of conflicts. A conflict exists when the expectations, interests, needs, or actions of at least two parties to the conflict are perceived by at least one of the parties to be incompatible. Peace psychology is mainly concerned with conflicts between social groups (intergroup conflicts, such as between ethnic groups, clans, religious groups, states etc.), in terms of domains like power, wealth, access to raw materials and markets, cultural or religious values, honor, dignity, or recognition. In conflicts one has to distinguish between (overt) positions (e.g., \" we don't negotiate with X\") and underlying interests (e.g., power, spheres of influence and wealth) as well as between current triggers (e.g., violence at a political protest) and systematic, enduring, structural causes (e.g., deprivation of a group's political participation or access to professional employment). Although conflicts are inevitable and can lead to positive change when dealt with constructively, the escalation of conflicts and in particular the occurrence of violence are preventable. Psychological processes of information processing (attention, perception, memory, thinking, judgment), emotion, and motivation influence substantially how a conflict is handled, and in particular whether conflicts escalate to violent episodes. An important factor is the different points of view of the conflict parties, such as when behavior that is based on positive intentions is perceived by the opponent as aggressive and therefore contributes to escalation. Conflicts can easily escalate. A cycle of violence can arise in which both parties are involved, and original victims can become perpetrators, without realizing it (\"victim myth\").\n\nConflicts can be intensified specifically through the construction of enemy images, psychological warfare, and propaganda promulgated by the media, political elite, educational systems, socialization, cultural symbols and other means. Enemy images may have a kernel of truth, but overstate the negative sides of the opponent. The core features of a strong enemy image include: (1) a negative evaluation of the opponent (e.g., aggressive, immoral, but also inferior), (2) a one-sided blame for negative events, and (3) a different evaluation of similar actions of one's own side than the enemy (\"double standard\"; e.g., build-up of arms on one’s own side is self-defense, on the enemy's it is aggression). These constructions can cause dehumanization of the opponent, so that moral standards no longer apply. In extreme cases, it may seem acceptable, even desirable, for the opponent to suffer and be killed. The construction of the enemy image has the central function of justifying armament, violence, and war. In addition, it enhances the individual and collective self-image.\n\nPsychological warfare includes methods of generating or strengthening war support among the civilian population and the military. These methods include disinformation using the media (war propaganda), but also sabotage, displacement, murder, and terror. War propaganda consists of two complementary strategies: (1) repeating, highlighting, and embellishing with detail information that functions to intensify the enemy image or threat perceptions, and (2) ignoring and devaluing information that may lead to de-escalation. In addition, negative behavior of the adversary may be provoked (e.g., by maneuvers at the state borders) or charges that the enemy engaged in heinous acts may be entirely invented (e.g., the Nayirah testimony).\n\nDifferent peace psychological strategies for non-violent conflict resolution are discussed (conflict de-escalation, conflict resolution, conflict transformation). One can distinguish between strategies on the \"official level\" (e.g., measures of tension reduction and trust build such as Charles E. Osgood's \"Graduated and Reciprocated Initiatives in Tension Reduction\" [GRIT], negotiations, mediation), approaches of \"unofficial diplomacy\" (interactive problem-solving workshops), and strategies at the level of peace and conflict \"civil society\" (e.g., peace journalism, contact between social groups).\n\nOsgood's GRIT model was designed as a counter-concept to the arms race in the East-West conflict, in which the former superpowers, USA and USSR, constantly increased the quantity and quality of their arms so that the destruction of humankind by a nuclear war seemed increasingly possible. The GRIT model, in contrast, aimed to de-escalate and create an atmosphere of mutual trust. One party publicly announces and performs a verifiable, concrete step to reduce tension, and asks or invites the other side to do something similar (developing a spiral of trust). Care is taken so that each step does not endanger the safety of one's own side. GRIT was designed to reverse the tension involved in the nuclear arms race by having each side engage in graduated and reciprocal inititiatives. While there is no firm evidence, it has been suggested that U.S. President Kennedy and the Soviet leader Khrushchev based their negotiations after the Cuban missile crisis on this concept.\n\nWhen conflicted parties are engaged in long-lasting, severe conflicts, it can be difficult to have constructive bilateral negotiations. In this case, a third party (e.g., a social scientist or reputed politician) can serve as a mediator in order to facilitate conflict management. Mediators must be well aware of the conflict and its history, should have the confidence of both conflict parties, and need to be familiar with conflict analysis and communication strategies. Important strategies include establishing trust, working out the essential elements of conflict, and possibly dividing the problem so that at least partial solutions can be achieved and violence can be prevented or stopped. Problems arise when mediators are biased and have strong individual interests. Mediation success is more likely if the conflict is moderately intense, the power difference between the parties is low, and the mediators have high prestige (as a person or because of organizational affiliation).\n\nIn severe, long-lasting conflicts, it may be advisable to intervene at a level below official diplomacy. Interactive problem solving is such an informal approach to bring members of the conflict parties together. These can include citizens who are well-respected from different areas of society, such as media, business, politics, education, or religion. A team of social scientists (e.g., psychologists) initiate and promote a problem-solving process with the elements of conflict diagnosis, generation of alternatives, and development of nonviolent solutions that results in outcomes that are satisfactory to all parties involved. There is the expectation or hope that the participants influence their governments and public opinion so that official negotiations can follow. Psychologically important components of the process are that the respective self and enemy images are corrected. Interactive problem solving was used in particular in the Israel-Palestine conflict by the U.S. psychologist Herbert Kelman and his team.\n\nMedia are often involved in the formation of enemy images and escalation of conflict. Peace journalism, in contrast, has the objective of investigating and using the influence of the media as a means of encouraging the constructive, non-violent resolution of conflict. Key strategies include representing the conflicting parties as well as the conflict and its history appropriately, identifying propaganda, and articulating the suffering of the people.\n\nThe collective action and peaceful demonstrations of the population toward peaceful and socially just ends can have an influence on the decisions of those in power – particularly in democracies. Citizens' commitment depends, among other factors, on the existence of opportunities in society, individual value orientations (e.g., valuing non-violence, social justice), the presence of role models, and the perceived probability of success of one's actions.\n\nContacts between opposing groups (e.g., on the level of municipalities, associations, universities, trade unions) can contribute to building positive relationships and the reduction of prejudice (see contact hypothesis). Conditions associated with the improvement of intergroup relations when groups come in contact with one another include: The actors involved have similar social status; there are common goals that can be achieved through cooperation; and the contacts are supported by authorities in society.\n\nIn asymmetric conflicts, where one conflict party is politically, economically, and/or militarily clearly superior, the stronger party may not be interested in a truly sustainable conflict resolution. Under asymmetric conditions, when the root causes of the conflict cannot be sufficiently addressed, structural violence persists. For such situations, approaches have been developed such as nonviolent resistance and liberation psychology, which originated in Latin America and is related to liberation theology.\n\nNonviolent resistance refers to public, non-violent behavior directed against injustice; it involves publicly explicating one's own intentions, committing to communicate with the other side, and the willingness to endure negative consequences of one's own actions. Methods of nonviolent resistance range from protests (e.g., demonstrations) to non-cooperation (e.g., strikes, boycotts) to civil resistance (e.g., traffic blockades). Particularly well known are the actions, speeches, and writings of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King.\n\nPeace psychology examines war and violence between groups also with the aim of illustrating the psychological and social costs of war and violence and to document the human suffering caused. The psychological consequences include, in particular, traumatization (mainly of the civilian population, but also members of the military), cognitive and emotional damage, and the destruction of trustful social relationships. Wars often do not resolve the underlying problems; they often provoke new violence and wars. For example, in post-war societies an increased level of family and community violence can be observed. In addition, resources necessary to deal with civilian issues (e.g., education, health, social welfare) are lost. There is still little comprehensive and objective research on the consequences and costs of war.\n\nEven when violence has been stopped or a Peace Treaty reached, to prevent the risk of a renewed escalation, physical and economic reconstruction as well as socio-political and psychosocial interventions are required. These interventions aim to cure psychosocial wounds of war, build trust, develop a common collective memory, recognize past wrongdoing, and achieve reconciliation and/or forgiveness. Examples are trauma therapy and Truth and Reconciliation Commissions.\n\nAlso, irrespective of any specific conflict and violence, peace psychological research looks at the psychosocial conditions that hamper or promote sustainable peace. The basic aim is to transform cultures of violence into cultures of peace.\n\nThe following cultural characteristics are obstacles to the development of sustainable peace: the view of one's own group (ethnicity, religion, nation, etc.) to be superior and more valuable and others as inferior and of little value (or in the extreme case: no value); the development of enemy images, dehumanization of others, legitimization of violence and damage; underlying beliefs (ideologies) such as ethnocentrism, social dominance orientation, authoritarianism, nationalism, militarism, and an education system that promotes these ideologies; power differentials that are defended or increased by the powerful and that create unequal conditions in areas such as wealth, health, education, and political participation (structural violence).\n\nAmong factors conducive to the development of sustainable peace are: the fundamental belief that conflicts are frequent, but that they can be solved without violence and for the benefit of the various conflict parties; the concept of humanism with the features of human dignity, pacifism, empathy, respect, tolerance and solidarity, and respect for all people or for humanity as a whole; critical proximity to one's own group that – in addition to positive identification – also integrates own weaknesses, mistakes, and committed wrongdoings in the collective self-concept.\n\nIn the transformation of cultures of violence into cultures of peace the focus on human rights is of high importance. Human rights are inalienable rights that apply to all human beings, without distinction as to sex, color, ethnicity, language, religion, political opinion, or social origin (prohibition of discrimination). The UN Human Rights Charter contains the essential documents of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR, 1948) and the Twin Covenants (1966, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). The UDHR consists of 30 articles with more than 100 individual rights, including civil and political rights (e.g., right to life, prohibition of torture, right to fair and public trial, right to asylum, freedom of speech, regular elections), but also social, economic, and cultural rights (including the right to work, rest, holidays with pay, protection from unemployment, the right to food, clothing, housing, medical care, and free primary education). Of particular importance in the UN's human rights concept is that all human rights are significant (indivisibility) and that they apply to all people (universality). Psychological research on human rights has mainly examined knowledge, attitudes, and readiness to act in support of human rights. Representative surveys in Germany show that the realization of human rights is considered to be very important, but at the same time knowledge of human rights is low and inaccurate. The results show a \"halving\" of human rights: Some civil rights are known, while economic and social rights are hardly considered human rights. Of importance in peace psychology are also analyses of whether human rights are used in the sense of peace or whether they are abused for the construction of enemy images or to prepare wars.\n\nPeace psychological findings are used in the content and practice of peace education at various levels, from primary school to secondary and tertiary education (e.g., in the form of peace psychology courses at universities) to vocational training.\n\nThe Conflict Information Consortium at the University of Colorado offers the Beyond Intractability project, an openly accessible, cooperative learning platform.\n\nPeace psychology practice refers, for example, to trauma therapeutic work, the implementation of trainings in nonviolent conflict resolution, and activities in such roles as conflict mediator or civil peace worker. Of particular importance is the cooperation between research and practice, such as in the form of evaluation research, to contribute to the continuous improvement of practice.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1334130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1334130", "title": "Posadnik", "text": "Posadnik\n\nPosadnik (Cyrillic: \"посадник\", (literally: \"по-садник\" - \"pre-sident\") was the mayor in some East Slavic cities or towns. Most notably, the posadnik (equivalent to a stadtholder, burgomeister, or podestà in the medieval west) was the mayor of Novgorod and Pskov. The term comes from the Old Church Slavic \"posaditi,\" meaning to put or place; they were so-called because the prince in Kiev originally placed them in the city to rule on his behalf. Beginning in the 12th century, they were elected locally.\n\nDespite legends of posadniks such as Gostomysl that were set in the 9th century, the term \"posadnik\" first appeared in the Primary Chronicle under the year 997. The earliest Novgorodian posadniks include Dobrynya (an uncle of Vladimir the Great), his son Konstantin Dobrynich and Ostromir, who is famous for patronizing the Ostromir Gospels, among the first books published in Russia (it is now housed in the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg). Also mention in a document from year 1189 referenced in SDHK 44456.\n\nIn the Novgorod Republic, the city posadnik was elected from among the boyars by the veche (public assembly). The elections were held annually. Novgorod boyars differed from boyars in other Rus' lands in that the category was not caste-like and that every rich merchant could reasonably hope to reach the rank of boyar. Valentin Yanin, the Soviet \"dean\" of medieval Novgorodian history, has found that most posadniks held the office consecutively for sometimes a decade or more and then often passed the office on to their sons or another close relative, indicating that the office was held within boyar clans and that the elections were not really \"free and fair.\" Yanin's theory challenged historians' understanding of the Novgorod Republic, showing it to be a boyar republic with little or no democratic elements. It also showed the land-owning boyarstvo to be more powerful than the merchant and artisan classes, which until that time were thought to play a significant role in the political life of the city. It also called into question the true nature of the veche, which up until that time had been considered democratic by most scholars. Yanin's interpretation of the Novgorod government as an hereditary oligarchy is not universally accepted, however.\n\nOriginally there was one posadnik, but gradually over time the office multiplied until, by the end of the Republic, there were something like 24 posadniks. There were also posadniks for each of the city's boroughs (called ends - \"kontsy\", singular \"konets\" in Russian). The multiplication of the office dates to the 1350s, when Posadnik Ontsifor Lukinich implemented a series of reforms. Retired posadniks took the title \"old posadnik\", or \"старый посадник\") and the current, serving posadnik was known as the \"stepennyi\" posadnik (\"степенный посадник\"). In accordance with the reform of 1416-1417, the number of posadniks was increased threefold and stepennyi posadniks were to be elected for a six-month period. In this manner, the various boyar clans could share power and one or another of them would neither monopolize power or be left out if they lost an election. It, however, diluted power in the boyarstvo. Some scholars have argued that the Archbishop of Novgorod became the head of the Republic and stood above the fray of partisan politics that raged among the boyardom, but the archbishops seem to have shared power with the boyardom and the collective leadership tried to rule by consensus. The dilution of boyar power may, however, have weakened Novgorod in the 15th century, thus explaining the series of defeats it suffered at Moscow's hands and the eventual fall of independent Novgorod. \n\nThe posadnikdom (mayoralty) was abolished along with the veche when Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow took the city in 1478. In fact, upon being asked by Archbishop Feofil (1470-1480) on behalf of the Novgorodians what type of government he wanted, Ivan (speaking through Prince Patrikeev) told them \"there will be no veche bell in our patrimony of Novgorod; \"there will be no posadnik\", and we will conduct our own government.\"\n\nThere were 78 known posadniks in Pskov between 1308 and 1510. The posadnichestvo was abolished in Pskov in 1510 when Grand Prince Vasily III took direct control of the city.\n"}

{"id": "45330969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45330969", "title": "Roscoe Dunjee", "text": "Roscoe Dunjee\n\nRoscoe Dunjee (1883–1965) was an American civil rights activist, journalist, and editor in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He founded the \"Black Dispatch\" in 1915, the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City, and used it as a platform to support civil rights and reveal injustices. Long active in the local chapter of the NAACP, in 1932 he brought together several chapters to found the state chapter or branch of the NAACP. He served as its president for 16 years, and was also on the national board of the NAACP.\n\nDunjee was a leader in Oklahoma City, using his newspaper to advance racial integration in housing, university admission, education, transportation and other public accommodations. He worked for fair jury selection and against lynchings.\n\nRoscoe Dunjee was born June 21, 1883 in Harpers Ferry, Jefferson County, West Virginia. His father was Reverend John William, who worked at Storer College, a historically black college, and his mother was Lydia Ann Dunjee.\n\nHis family migrated to Oklahoma in 1892, as his father was representing the Baptist Home Missionary Society. Roscoe had a brother, Irving, and three sisters, Ella, Drusilla, and Blanche. In 1903, when the young Dunjee was 20 their father died.\n\nHe returned from Langston College, a historically black college in Langston, Oklahoma that then emphasized technical and industrial trades. Dunjee had learned to set type by working after hours in the print shop of \"The Langston Herald,\" a small community paper. Dunjee took on the responsibility of earning a living to support his mother and a younger brother and sister. The family farm had produced vegetables for the family. Young Dunjee decided to enlarge the operation and become a truck farmer, selling directly to the public. He also worked as a bellhop at the Stewart Hotel in Oklahoma City, but looked for more opportunities. He educated himself also by reading widely in his father's 1500-volume library.\n\nInterested in the growing movement of black fraternalism, Dunjee joined the Pythian Grand Lodge and began lecturing in its behalf throughout the state. He also enlisted new members, and his reputation as an organizer grew. When Dunjee was traveling throughout Oklahoma, he could see the difficult conditions of black migrant sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Not only was the Negro unable to earn a living wage, the state had passed discriminatory laws related to segregation of transportation and other public accommodations. Dunjee began thinking seriously about establishing a newspaper that could tell the Negro story and reply to white racism.\n\nIn 1915, when he was 32 years of age, he had a chance to purchase a job printing plant from Oliva J. Abby, an instructor in the Oklahoma City public schools, whose printer husband had become ill. He founded his own newspaper, the \"Black Dispatch\", the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City. He used this as a platform to publish editorials against segregation and report unfair treatment of blacks. The newspaper grew from a local publication to a national one, at one point boasting nearly 20,000 subscribers. Dunjee would regularly report on lynchings of blacks in both Oklahoma and Texas.\n\nHe worked to change voter laws that prohibited or constrained black voters from the polls. Oklahoma's new 1908 constitution, passed after statehood, had raised barriers to voter registration, effectively disenfranchising blacks and other minority voters. It joined former states of the Confederacy across the South in taking such action. In 1916 the state passed a grandfather clause that enabled white voters to escape certain restrictions related to literacy. Dunjee's efforts contributed to court challenges; ultimately lawyers of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) overturned the grandfather clause in the US Supreme Court case \"Guinn v. Allwright\".\n\nDunjee publicized the murder trial of Jess Hollins. He was a black man arrested for the rape of a white woman, to which he confessed without having seen counsel. He was rapidly sentenced to death four days after the alleged attack in December 1931. Dunjee reported on the case, supporting an appeal. The judge said he moved fast because he feared another Tulsa Race Riot, as had taken place in 1921. The state court ruled that Hollins deserved a jury trial. He was convicted by an all-white jury in 1934 and again sentenced to death. The case was appealed to the US Supreme Court, which ruled in \"Hollins v. State of Oklahoma\" (1935), that the systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury had been grounds for reversing Hollins' conviction. It directed a new trial. Hollins was convicted by another all-white jury and sentenced to life in prison. He died in 1950, and is now widely believed to have been innocent.\n\nIn 1916 the Oklahoma Board of Commissioners passed an ordinance forbidding black residents from moving into a house on a block occupied by at least 75% white residents. Dunjee funded the cases of several black residents who were attempting to integrate areas not zoned for blacks. William Floyd was a black shoemaker who purchased a home in a majority-white neighborhood. Floyd was jailed four times for attempting to occupy his newly purchased home. Dunjee bailed Floyd out each time and encouraged him to return to the home. In this period the US Supreme Court ruled in \"Buchanan v. Warley\" (1917) that racially discriminatory state and local ordinances for housing were unconstitutional. A judge in Oklahoma ruled the state law was unconstitutional on those grounds.\n\nDunjee was active in the NAACP, the Oklahoma Youth Legislature, the National Negro Democratic Association, and the Negro Business League. He played a vital role in desegregating Oklahoma State University in 1948 (Rummel).\n\nDunjee never married, nor had any known children. Although he sold the newspaper in 1954 to another publisher, he worked there until his death in 1965.\n\n\nRoscoe Dunjee published Oklahoma City’s first black newspaper, the \"Black Dispatch\", from 1915 to 1954. Its name refers to \"Black Dispatches\", the term during the American Civil War for intelligence given to the Union by free or enslaved African Americans in the South.)\n\nThe \"Black Dispatch\" was a member of the Western Negro Press Association during its formative years. It later subscribed to the Associated Negro Press, which boasted of having 112 member newspapers in 1921.

Each district is an independent special-purpose government, or dependent school systems, under the guidelines of each U.S. state government and local school boards. A school district is a legally separate body corporate and politic. School districts are local governments with powers similar to that of a town or a county including taxation and eminent domain, except in Virginia, whose school divisions have no taxing authority and must depend on another local government (county, city, or town) for funding. Its governing body, which is typically elected by direct popular vote but may be appointed by other governmental officials, is called a \"school board\", \"board of trustees\", \"board of education,\" \"school committee\", or the like. This body appoints a \"superintendent\", usually an experienced public school administrator, to function as the district's chief executive for carrying out day-to-day decisions and policy implementations. The school board may also exercise a quasi-judicial function in serious employee or student discipline matters.\n\nSchool districts in the Midwest and West tend to cross municipal boundaries, while school districts in New England and the Mid-Atlantic regions tend to adhere to city, township, and/or county boundaries. school districts were independent governmental units in 26 states, while in 17 states there were mixes of independent school districts and school districts subordinate to other local governments. In nine states there were only school districts subordinate to local governments.\n\nNot all school systems constitute school districts as distinct bodies corporate. In most Southern states, school systems operate either as an arm of county government, or at least share coextensive boundaries with the state's counties. In Maryland, most school systems are run at the county level, but the Baltimore City system operates separately, at a county-equivalent level. In New York, most school districts are separate governmental units with the power to levy taxes and incur debt, except for the five cities with population over 125,000, where the schools are operated directly by the municipalities. The Hawaii State Department of Education functions as a single statewide school district. This is unique among the states, but the District of Columbia Public Schools operates district public schools in Washington, DC and the Puerto Rico Department of Education operates all public schools in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, thus they also function as single school districts.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1951 the number of school districts declined from 108,579 to 70,452, a decrease by 38,127 or 35%. Many states had passed laws facilitating school district consolidation. In 1951 the majority of the school districts in existence were rural school districts only providing elementary education, and some school districts did not operate schools but instead provided transportation to other schools. The Midwest (North Central U.S.) had a large number of rural school districts.\n\nPreviously areas of the Unorganized Borough of Alaska were not served by school districts, but instead served by schools directly operated by the Alaska Department of Education and by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools. The state schools were transferred to the Alaska State-Operated School System (SOS) after the Alaska Legislature created it in 1971; that agency was terminated in 1975, with its schools transferred to the newly created Alaska Unorganized Borough School District, which was broken apart into twenty-one school districts the following year.\n\nIn the 2002 Census of Governments, the United States Census Bureau enumerated the following numbers of school systems in the United States:\n\nSchool districts in the US have reduced the number of their employees by 3.3%, or 270,000 between 2008 and 2012, owing to a decline in property tax revenues during and after the Great Recession.\n\nAlthough these terms can vary slightly between various states and regions, these are typical definitions for school district constitution:\n\n\nThese terms may not appear in a district's name, even though the condition may apply.\n\nThere are various approaches can when making decisions in assigning teachers. The deciding in assigning teachers can occur with the collaboration of human resource staff or decisions from the collaboration with principals and teachers. Although the decisions for teacher assignment can vary base on school districts, there are two most popular approaches that are currently occurring in assigning teachers. The first popular approach is assigning students to teachers based on sharing the same characteristics as their students. For instance, principals assign teachers to students based on academic performance, teachers’ personalities, teachers teaching styles, and teachers’ classroom management skills. During this assignment practices, there are some collaboration with teachers and principals. The second most popular approach is that teachers can be assigned based on their ability to improve students’ standardized test scores. This is identified as “staffing to the test” in which principals observe the influence teachers have on students’ standardized test scores and then strategically move teachers to certain subjects or grades where standardized test are given.\n\nEven though two approaches are used to assign teachers to students, there are some obstacles that principals encounter when making teacher assignment decisions. For instance, one conflict is parents demand that their child be assigned to a specific teacher. The second conflict is that principals need to take into consideration policies, such as tenure or collective bargaining, which can influence teacher assignment practices. Due to these challenges, many have suggested that principals should collaborate with teacher unions in order to address these conflicts.\n\nOutside the United States, autonomous districts or equivalent authorities often represent various groups seeking education autonomy. In European history, as in much of the world, religious (confessional), linguistic, and ethnic divisions have been a significant factor in school organization. This paradigm is shifting.\n\nIn England and Wales, school boards were established in 1870, and abolished in 1902, with county council and county borough councils becoming the local education authorities.\n\nIn France, the system of the carte scolaire was dismantled by the beginning of the 2007 school year. More school choice has been given to French students; however, priority is given to those who meet the following criteria:\n\n\nIn Germany, schools are run and funded by the general regional entities, usually the States of Germany or municipalities. School districts in the meaning of distinct legal entities do not exist. \n\nIn Italy, school districts were established in 1974 by the \"Provvedimenti Delegati sulla scuola\" (\"Assigned Laws [to the Government] about the school\"). Each district must contain a minimum of 10,000 inhabitants. The national government attempted to link the local schools with local society and culture and local governments. The school districts were dissolved in 2003 by the \"legge finanziaria\" (law about the government budget) in an attempt to trim the national budget.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43120395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43120395", "title": "Socialist Peasants' Party", "text": "Socialist Peasants' Party\n\nThe Socialist Peasants' Party (Romanian: \"Partidul Socialist Țărănesc\", or \"Partidul Socialist Țărănist\", PSȚ) was a short-lived political party in Romania, presided over by the academic Mihai Ralea. Created nominally in 1938 but dissolved soon after, it reemerged during World War II. A clandestine group, it opposed the fascist regime of Ion Antonescu, although its own roots were planted in authoritarian politics. Looking to the Soviet Union for inspiration, the PSȚ was cultivated by the Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), and comprised a faction of radicalized social democrats, under Lothar Rădăceanu.\n\nPerceived as a communist tool, the PSȚ was prevented by other parties from participating in the August 23 Coup against Antonescu. It entered its legal phase in the late months of 1944, but was soon absorbed into the more powerful Ploughmen's Front.\n\nRalea entered politics as one of the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ) intellectuals in Iași, before his 1938 move to Bucharest. In this context, he was a prominent figure in the centrist faction of the party, with Armand Călinescu as his ally. A political and social theorist, he endorsed the PNȚ's agrarian-and-corporatist notion of a \"peasant state\", against the social-democratic wing of the party. As scholar Angela Harre notes, Ralea and other PNȚ leaders \"tried to use the vague picture of a peasant state to counterbalance the growing fascist impact on society with an alternative democratic state model.\" During that time, Ralea had established contacts with the outlawed Communist Party, and already supported its antifascist agenda. PCdR contacts viewed him as one of the \"bourgeois personalities with antifascist views.\"\n\nBy the 1937 election, which saw pro-democratic parties unable to maintain a clear majority, the \"peasant state\" doctrine looked set to crumble. Harre argues: \"A corporatist democracy became obsolete from the middle of the 1930s on, when the strongly polarized Romanian society did not resist the split between urban modernity and a rural traditional way of life any longer.\" In 1938, Ralea was editor of the National Peasantist organ, \"Dreptatea\", but at odds with PNȚ leader Iuliu Maniu. He broke away from the party to establish the PSȚ, in name only. According to Corneliu Coposu, at the time a leader of the PNȚ youth, Ralea's party was \"stillborn\".\n\nAfter King Carol II banned the PNȚ and all other mainstream parties, Ralea transformed himself into a pillar of Carol's authoritarian-corporatist National Renaissance Front (FRN). He was highly decorated by the king, and appointed Minister of Labor in March of that year. In this capacity, he organized the \"Muncă și Voe Bună\" leisure service, directly modeled on fascist precedents such as \"Dopolavoro\", and converted the staples of socialist propaganda in support of the FRN.\n\nIn 1940, the FRN regime was unable to secure Romania against Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union: the country ceded Bessarabia and Northern Transylvania, after which the regime crumbled. It was replaced by the Nazi-aligned National Legionary State, an uneasy partnership between Antonescu and the Iron Guard. The latter made efforts to prosecute figures associated with the FRN, and Ralea was consequently stripped of his academic postings. He was reinstated in 1941, after the clash between the Guard and Antonescu. However, owing to Ralea's communist sympathies, Antonescu ordered his constant surveillance by \"Siguranța\", the country's secret police.\n\nRalea's contacts with the PCdR became a nuisance once Romania joined Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union. From December 1942 to March 1943, he was interned alongside other dissenters in Târgu Jiu camp. Upon his release, he resumed his contacts with other dissenting academics of Iași—Iorgu Iordan, Constantin Ion Parhon, Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa—with whom, the \"Siguranța\" noted, he intended to start a \"political action\". It did not materialize into a political movement. During summer 1943, Ralea resumed his contacts with the PNȚ, and was received by Maniu. This interview surprised the mainstream National Peasantists, for whom Ralea was a pariah (Maniu himself had implied that Ralea had \"not a trace of character\"). According to Coposu, Maniu reminded Ralea of his 1938 defection, and rejected his offer to rejoin the \"democratic opposition\" to Antonescu. Maniu suggested instead that Ralea and other \"former supporters of Carol II\" create their own \"antihitlerite combat front, independent from the consistently democratic elements\". He appreciated Ralea's rejection of Antonescu's \"catastrophic orientation\" and commitment to \"the country's salvation\", but noted that they could only buy him a measure of leniency \"for that hour when we shall be evaluating the past mistakes that have thrown this country into dejection.\"\n\nDuring late 1943, Ralea and other dissident National Peasantists were in Brașov, where they began referring to themselves as a distinct Socialist Peasants' Party, and worked closely with an antifascist economist and doctrinaire, Victor Jinga. With a mandate from the PCdR, Ralea also approached Petru Groza of the Ploughmen's Front and Gheorghe Tătărescu, the former Premier and leader of the National Liberal Party (PNL), who had already publicized their opposition to Antonescu's foreign policy. The newly (re)established PSȚ, also known as \"Socialist Union of Workers and Peasants\", was soon joined by Rădăceanu. The latter, formerly a figure of importance in the Social Democratic Party (PSDR), had earlier established his own clandestine Marxist faction. Another figure of relative importance was Stanciu Stoian, himself a PNȚ defector, who was also affiliated with another underground force, the Union of Patriots.\n\nAccording to historian Adrian Cioroianu, the Socialist Peasants' Party, \"entirely minor\", had a \"ghostly\" existence under Antonescu's rule. It soon approached the PCdR and, represented by Ralea and Stoian, accepted inclusion into the \"Patriotic Antihitlerite Front\". Journalist Victor Frunză claimed the latter was also a shady organization, also deeming the very existence (beyond the adoption of a name) doubtful. However, according to the same author, Rădăceanu and Ralea were among the PCdR's more credible outside sympathizers: \"they moved to the left of the left for reasons of a personal predisposition toward totalitarianism.\"\n\nAlongside the PNȚ, PSDR, and National Liberals, the Communists were called in to organize the August 23 Coup against Antonescu. An understanding was reached in March 1944, when the four groups set up a National Democratic Bloc (BND). The PCdR, marginally relevant in this alliance, tried to extend his influence by obtaining seats for the \"Antihitlerite\" parties: Ralea's PSȚ, Groza's Ploughmen's Front, and the Union of Patriots. The move was vetoed by the mainstream parties. During a new meeting with Ralea, Maniu also rejected the PSȚ offer to reunite or align itself with the PNȚ. On May 24, 1944, the PSȚ also entered a \"National-Democratic Coalition\", formed around the National Liberal Party–Tătărescu, which had a platform of loyalism toward King Michael I and \"active political collaboration with the Soviets.\" It also comprised Groza's Front, the Union of Patriots, the PSDR, MADOSZ, and remnants of the Democratic Nationalist Party, under Petre Topa.\n\nRalea and his group continued to campaign on their own. A \"Siguranța\" report of June 27 mentions that the PSȚ had received pledges and support from leftists such as Demostene Botez, Scarlat Callimachi, N. D. Cocea, and D. I. Suchianu. In July 1944, Jinga produced a manifesto for the post-Antonescu era, prophesying a socialized economy and liberal democracy. Ralea had nevertheless lost the support of Rădăceanu and his followers, who returned to the PSDR as a distinctly pro-communist inner-party faction. A PSȚ man, Grigore Geamănu, still had a significant part to play in the preparation of the coup, helping PCdR's Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej to break out of Târgu Jiu camp. \n\nThe BND then put an end to Antonescu's regime, aligning Romania with the Allied Powers, but also led the way for the Soviet occupation of Romania. The PSȚ emerged into legality on September 2, one of the seven parties mentioned by Premier Constantin Sănătescu in his decree on the transition to democracy. Its newly established daily, \"Dezrobirea\" (\"Liberation\"), publicized Jinga's July manifesto as a PSȚ party program. \"Dezrobirea\" also praised Ralea's own antifascism, and claimed for the PSȚ a pedigree of \"more than six years\" of ideological combat. As noted by historian Lucian Boia, such statements may imply that Ralea wished to present his FRN activity and his pro-communism as a coherent whole.\n\nAlmost immediately, Ralea's party was co-opted on other PCdR-controlled alliances. The \"Antihitlerite Front\" was formalized on September 6, when it denounced the alliance with the PNȚ and the PNL, and published its appeal to the populace on September 17. The Front then transformed itself into a broader \"National Democratic Front\", in stated opposition to Sănătescu's government. As members of this coalition, the Ploughmen's Front and the Socialist Peasantists had a particularly close relationship. In tandem, the PSȚ grew to include other figures formerly associated with the FRN including Mihail Ghelmegeanu, Octav Livezeanu, and Tudor Vianu (chairman of the National Theater Bucharest). The party also received into its ranks Ralea's student, poet Teohar Mihadaș, who was hiding his earlier involvement with the Iron Guard.\n\nIn November 1944, the PSȚ was absorbed into the Ploughmen's Front. Its leader, Groza, became Prime Minister of a communist-aligned cabinet in which Ralea was Arts Minister; he would later serve as Ambassador to the United States, while Stoian became Minister of Religious Affairs.\n\nAlready by 1945, former PSȚ politicians were manifesting their opposition to communization. Soviet advisers noted with concern that Ghelmegeanu was influencing Groza to unseal his agreements with the PCdR. During his time as a diplomat, Ralea pressed the Americans to intervene in Romania and balance out Soviet influence, as a guarantee against the collectivization of peasant property. Returning to Romania after the full imposition of a communist regime, he was awarded a seat in the Great National Assembly with the formal elections of 1948.\n\nBy 1949, the Securitate secret police was clamping down on some less loyal PSȚ members. Mihadaș had established contacts with the anticommunist maquis and Western countries. He was arrested and tortured, being forced to invent a conspiracy that dragged into it various members of the political and literary underworld. Ralea himself was placed under Securitate surveillance, once he began expressing his mistrust of the Communist Party. His Securitate file lists him as an \"opportunistic element, a danger to our regime.\" Ghelmegeanu and Vianu were also marginalized, while Suchianu was arrested and imprisoned. Throughout the late 1950s and early '60s, Ralea maintained cordial relations with the communist leader, Gheorghiu-Dej, and backed the regime's gradual adoption of nationalist principles. He died in 1964, a member of the Romanian Council of State.\n\n"}

{"id": "13364205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13364205", "title": "The Pennsylvania Society", "text": "The Pennsylvania Society\n\nThe Pennsylvania Society is an annual weekend retreat for Pennsylvania's politicians and business leaders held in New York City. It began during the late 19th century as a meeting of Pennsylvanians living in New York City who gathered annually beginning in 1899 to discuss events in their home state. As the first few meetings developed into an annual event, it morphed into weekend-long retreat where political networking and fundraising took place in New York's finest clubs, restaurants, and hotels. The main event of the weekend is the \"Pennsylvania Society Dinner,\" which is sponsored by \"The Pennsylvania Society,\" a nonprofit corporation. In recent years the receptions hosted by lobbyists, political committees, and corporations have taken on increased importance.\n\nIt has been criticized because of its image as a stereotypical \"smoke-filled room\" where lobby groups gain access to government officials, a few of whom have been known to use taxpayer funds to pay their way to New York. Other observers criticize the retreat for being held in New York instead of within Pennsylvania.\n\nThe tradition for Pennsylvania's political and business retreat dates to 1899, when James Barr Ferree, a native Pennsylvanian living in New York invited a group of 55 other Pennsylvanians living in New York to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to discuss current affairs in their native state. The dinner became a recurring event and the group began calling themselves \"The Pennsylvania Society of New York.\" It later developed into an annual gathering of Pennsylvania politicians and businessmen on New York's \"neutral ground.\" The organization later changed its name to The Pennsylvania Society and became a nonprofit charitable organization. It was incorporated in 1903, and currently claims 2,000 members. While it sponsors a high school essay contest, the main function of the organization is to organize the weekend retreat.\n\nThe gathering began as an exclusively Republican event, but it now includes a sizable number of Democrats. The early years of the meeting were reminiscent of the stereotypical smoke-filled room, where Pennsylvania steel, coal and oil magnates met in closed-door meetings to select their political candidates. That public perception continues, with political legend telling of New York-based businessmen summoning Pennsylvania's politicians to New York to receive their instructions for the following year.\n\nThe main attraction of the weekend is the \"Pennsylvania Society Dinner,\" a black tie event held in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on the final night of the weekend. In 2005, about 1,500 individuals attended. However, much of the \"real action\" takes place in the invitation-only dinners and receptions hosted by businesses, candidates, and lobbying firms throughout the weekend. In an attempt to attract more attendees, hosts have hired top tier guests, including Jon Stewart, Lewis Black, and George H.W. Bush, who ended his 2003 speech with a reference to Dana Carvey's impression of him by saying, \"Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent.\" Several events have become well known for drawing high-powered guests, including the events hosted by the Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association. In 2004, an evening at an Upper East Side cigar lounge hosted by Republican national committeewoman Christine Toretti Olson gained significant praise from attendees. In a 2005 event, Rick Santorum was able to raise $46,000 for his 2006 re-election campaign and $130,000 for the Pennsylvania Republican Party.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Society has become known as the \"unofficial start of the next year's big political season\" because of its reputation as a place for potential political candidates to make contacts, meet fundraisers, and make a name for themselves early in the electoral process.\n\nFormer Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Bill DeWeese said in 2003 that the Pennsylvania Society is \"a magnificent re-creation of the gilded age and the era of the robber barons of the late 19th century, when Fricks and Carnegies and Pews dominated Pennsylvania's commercial and political scene. Slender elements of its original purpose endure. However, it is primarily a hell of a party.\"\n\nPublic watchdogs have criticized the event as a chance for \"wealthy special interests to mingle with the movers and shakers in state government\" or as a gathering for \"fat cat\" politicians away from their Pennsylvania constituents.\n\nDuring the 2005 Pennsylvania Society weekend, Gene Stilp and Eric Epstein, governmental reform and anti-pay raise activists, hosted the \"Pennsylvania People's Dinner,\" a reform-themed potluck dinner in the \"darkened, barely heated\" East Wing of the Pennsylvania State Capitol while the members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly are in New York City. The event, described as \"part parody, part celebration\" of the November repeal of the controversial pay raise, featured paper plates and folding chairs for the potluck style dinner. The hosts decorated the capitol with toy pigs, the mascot of the anti-pay-raise movement, and stuffed cows, mocking John Perzel's defense of the pay raise by claiming that \"immigrant cow-milkers\" make as much as legislators. The dinner has become an annual event, with the lack of lighting and heating becoming part of the tradition. The event has undergone several name changes: in 2006 it was called the \"Pennsylvania New Society Dinner,\" in 2007 it was the \"Real Pennsylvania Society Dinner.\"\n\nAttendees have been known to enjoy the New York City tourist attractions, including the Broadway theatre and the Fifth Avenue shopping district almost as much as, if not more than, the political networking opportunities.\n\nPolitical pundits frequently note the irony of holding the Pennsylvania Society in New York. In 2003, Ed Rendell suggested that the $20–$40 million economic impact from the event would best be directed to a city in Pennsylvania, but said \"since I can't get a budget passed, I'm going to leave that for another day.\" In 2005, Philadelphia City Council unanimously passed a resolution sponsored by Frank DiCicco calling for the event to be moved within Pennsylvania.\n\"Everybody who is anybody, and everybody who wants to be somebody, is there.\"\"The three-day crush of Manhattan cocktail parties known as the Pennsylvania Society is a requisite stop for aspiring candidates and potential donors.\"\n\nMany attendees downplay the Pennsylvania Society's corrupt image, with Ken Davis, chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Party, telling the \"Philadelphia Inquirer,\" \"I don't know anybody who's been bought at Pennsylvania Society. Rented, maybe – but not bought.\"\n\n\n"}

Using her inheritance, she purchased 50 acres of land at Heath Common and proceeded to give away plots of land free of charge to anyone who was willing to settle there. She lived in a house she named Sanctuary Cottage, part of which was kept open for any passing stranger who needed shelter or refreshment...\n\nVera Pragnell was inspired both by Christianity (in particular William E. Orchard and the Fellowship of Reconciliation) as well as the principles of pioneering socialist Edward Carpenter. She imposed no conditions or rules on prospective settlers and insisted that The Sanctuary was open to everyone. Initially, all who came to live there were given a half-acre plot on which they would park a caravan or build a simple house. Eventually communal facilities were created such as a shop, a school and a building used for theatre and dancing.\n\nLacking a single political or spiritual focus, The Sanctuary attracted a wide range of individuals as residents or visitors, often with unorthodox and radical views. These included pagans such as the occultist, poet and publisher Victor Neuburg and Dion Byngham, ex-leading light of the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry. Other residents included anarchist W. C. Owen as well as Communist Party members. Artists were also attracted to the community, such as the Shakespearian actor Wilfred Walter.\n\nA number of the residents and visitors were friends and associates of Edward Carpenter, who was a supporter and inspiration to the community. In 1928, Vera Pragnell published her book \"The Story of the Sanctuary\" and dedicated it to the \"splendid pioneer\" Edward Carpenter with a poem by Victor Neuburg praising Carpenter as \"our Youth's doyen\". Vera had a personal connection with Carpenter, as in 1927 she had married the painter Dennis Earle, who had been previously been known as Ted Earle when he was Carpenter's lover \n\nThe unconventional lifestyles of some members of the community began to generate scandal in the popular press, with stories featuring nudism and 'free love' and allegations that they encouraged a girl to run away from home and live at the Sanctuary\n\nBy the early 1930s, Vera Pragnell's original inspiration had been lost amid disputes and disillusionment. Sanctuary residents began to register formal ownership of their own properties and from 1934 onwards the area was developed by Earle as a residential estate known as Longbury Hill.\n\nDuring World War II, the Kenyan independence leader Jomo Kenyatta lived in the area whilst working on a local farm. Communist Party youth camps continued to be held there until the 1960s.\n\nToday, the history of the area is remembered in the street names Vera's Walk and Sanctuary Lane and the houses known as Sanctuary Cottages. A memorial shelter remains, erected and decorated by Dennis Earle, containing boards telling the story of The Sanctuary.\n\nThe area known as The Sanctuary was located in the parish of Washington, West Sussex (not Storrington). Vera Pragnell and Dennis Earle are buried in the graveyard at Washington Parish Church.\nA play entitled Sanctuary, featuring Vera Pragnell and Victor Neuburg, written by Chris Green, was presented at the 2012 Brighton Fringe Festival.\n"}

The truce was declared in the days just before the 1992 Los Angeles riots, and although not universally adhered to, was a major component of the decline of street violence in the city during the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.\n\nThe truce was influenced by the decision between two rival \"sets\" (sub-groups) within the extensive Crips gang to call a ceasefire. Many of the large American street gangs, such as the Crips and their primary rivals the Bloods, had formed in the late 1960s and the 1970s to fight each other, but by the 1980s disorganization and the growth of crack cocaine had led to infighting among sets within the gangs. By the early 1990s, after 20 years of increasing internecine gang warfare across public housing projects that saw peak crime rates in Los Angeles, gang members themselves began trying to stem the violence.\n\nIn late April 1992, sets from Crips and Bloods in the Watts neighborhood in southern Los Angeles convened to negotiate peace. The Grape Street Crips from the Jordan Downs Projects, the P Jay Watts Crips from the Imperial Courts housing projects, and the Bounty Hunter Bloods from the Nickerson Gardens housing projects met in the Imperial Courts Project gym. Football legend and activist Jim Brown, and hip-hop artists of the West Coast Rap All-Stars, helped the rivals to negotiate their truce, and the factions would go on to draft a formal peace treaty modelled on a ceasefire 1949 Armistice Agreements reached between Israel and Egypt. Within days of the truce, despite the relative lawlessness caused by the 1992 Los Angeles riots, most of the African-American and Latino gangs in the city declared themselves at peace and there were no major flare ups in violence. The Watts truce is generally credited with contributing to the trend in declining street violence rates in Los Angeles.\n\n"}
