{"id": "43732508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43732508", "title": "American Union of Associationists", "text": "American Union of Associationists\n\nThe American Union of Associationists (AUA) was a national organization of supporters of the economic ideas of Charles Fourier (1772–1837) in the United States of America. Organized in 1846 in New York City as a federation of independent local Fourierist groups, the AUA published a weekly magazine called \"The Harbinger\" and published more than 70 books and pamphlets, which helped it to enjoy a brief moment of influence spreading the ideas of communitarianism to a circle of leading intellectuals. \n\nThe failure of the Fourierist model in its various practical incarnations led to the rapid dissolution of the Fourierist movement and with it the AUA, however, and the organization rapidly atrophied as the decade of the 1840s drew to a close. The final issue of the official AUA organ, \"The Harbinger,\" was published in February 1849 and the final national meeting of the organization took place in 1851.\n\nThe 1840 publication of the book \"Social Destiny of Man\" by Albert Brisbane (1809–1890) and subsequent publication of a regular column by him in the pages of Horace Greeley's \"New York Tribune\" ushered in a period of popular enthusiasm for the ideas of Charles Fourier in the United States. \n\nAmerican Fourierists were divided between the bookish advocates of \"pure\" Fourierism such as Brisbane, Osborne Macdaniel, and Parke Godwin — who advocated for the establishment of very specific Fourierist \"phalanx\" (commune), properly funded and containing between 1600 and 1800 people — and those who sought immediate implementation of Fourierist cooperative ideas at whatever size determined by available funds and the number of committed participants. These practical communitarians, exemplified by George Ripley and his transcendentalist experiment near Boston called Brook Farm, initially held sway. \n\nIn the years 1843 and 1844 a faddish boom saw the launch of more than two dozen Fourierism \"Associations\" (communal economic units) in the Northeast and Midwest. To this were added various \"Fourierist clubs\" scattered across the country. Most of these efforts proved short-lived and by 1846 the Fourierist movement was already in retreat. \n\nCommitted believers in Fourier's ideas did not see a structural cause to the mass failure of Fourierist \"phalanxes\" (communes) however, instead concentrating on the obvious underfinancing and haphazard operation of the first experiments in communalism. Intent on making a new start, Fourierist leaders sought to create a national organization to share ideas through publications, raise funds, and to concentrate efforts onto the formation of a single properly founded phalanx which would serve as a practical model for emulation. The American Union of Associationists (AUA) was the organization established as the mechanism for coordinating and refocusing Fourierist efforts in America.\n\nPrevious efforts to bring together Fourierist Associations were regional in nature and oriented towards the immediate creation of phalanxes, with three conferences taking place in 1843 and 1844 — one each for the Midwest, New York City, and New England. The so-called Western Fourier Convention, held in Pittsburgh in September 1843, was intended to concentrate the efforts of participants upon one \"Model Western Association\" but owing to personal jealousies, local rivalries, and fundamental philosophical differences ultimately lead to the formation of four small and impoverished experiments in the states of Ohio and Illinois. Three of these died in the crib, with only one lasting past 1846.\n\nThe second regional gathering, held in December 1843, was held in Boston under the auspices of the Brook Farm transcendentalists. It was at this gathering that the Brook Farm principals announced their formal conversion to the ideas of Fourierism. Plans were made to coordinate the activities of Brook Farm with the Christian Hopedale Community and the Northampton Association of Education and Industry (Ross Farm) through quarterly meetings. Three such conclaves were held before the idea was abandoned in October 1844 due to the divergent interests of the three communal experiments. The Boston convention also led to the formation in January 1844 of a formal regional organization, the New England Fourier Society, in which Brisbane and William Henry Channing played a leading role.\n\nEfforts in Western New York proved somewhat fruitful, with a March 1844 meeting in Rochester resulting in the formation of a group called the American Industrial Union (AIU), attended by representatives of seven phalanxes. The group opened an office in Rochester in May and attempted to aid its member Associations through cooperative purchasing of supplies and coordinating trade of the products of each. The AIU soon was forced to terminate due to the rapid collapse of its member phalanxes, however, although the idea behind the organization made a lasting impression on prominent Fourierist leaders.\n\nThese regional meetings were followed by a first attempt at a truly national conclave, with New York Fourierist leaders issuing a call for a \"General Convention of the Friends of Association in the United States,\" held in New York City from April 4-6, 1844.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31555694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31555694", "title": "Andries Tatane", "text": "Andries Tatane\n\nAndries Tatane (22 February 1978 – 13 April 2011) was a 33-year-old South African citizen who was shot and killed by police officers during a service delivery protest in Ficksburg. Seven police officers accused of his murder and assault were acquitted in the Ficksburg Regional Court in March 2013.\n\nAndries was a member of the ANC until 2008 when he left the ANC to join the breakaway party COPE. In the months before he died he left COPE to join the Meqheleng Concerned Citizens (MCC), an autonomous local community organisation. He was a mathematics teacher, a community activist, journalist, community newspaper publisher and possible independent candidate for the municipal elections due to take place in May 2011. He was married to Rose Tatane.\n\nOn 13 April 2011, Andries Tatane, together with 4,000 other protesters, took to the streets and marched to Setsoto Municipal Offices in Ficksburg, Free State, South Africa to protest against poor service delivery in the area. The protesters were met by police members who attempted to disperse the crowd with water cannons. While some arrested protesters were being bundled into police vans, Tatane tried to argue with the police and to block a water cannon vehicle, at which point he was grabbed around one arm by a police officer. Tatane was seen to pull his arm away from the officer who then started to beat him with a baton. Tatane appeared to move aggressively towards this officer. Four or five other police officers then pulled him away and began to kick and beat him with batons. During this time he was twice shot in the chest. Tatane collapsed shortly after and died on the scene 20 minutes later.\n\nWhile Tatane's death as a result of police action during a protest is by no means a unique event in South Africa, it had notably garnered greater nationwide attention than any previous such occurrence. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that the entire incident was filmed on T.V. cameras and later broadcast during the prime time evening news of the national broadcaster, the SABC.\n\nFollowing Tatane's death, there has been public outrage about the manner in which he died.\n\nTatane's death has been described as \"a watershed moment in public perceptions of state violence after apartheid\".\n\nAn investigation into his death was launched by the Independent Complaints Directorate's commission. The South African Police Service has also launched their own internal investigation into the matter. The death of Tatane has placed both the issue of rising anger over a lack of service delivery as well as police brutality in the media spotlight, with comparisons being drawn to the deaths of Hector Pieterson and Steve Biko at the hands of police during the height of apartheid.\n\nIt has also emerged that this was not an isolated incident and that the ICD has investigated 1,769 separate incidents of people dying in police custody or as a result of police action in 2010. National Police Commissioner Bheki Cele's statement in late August 2009 that police officers should be able to \"shoot to kill\" without worrying about the consequences will undoubtedly be brought to the forefront again.\n\nThe ANC's National Spokesperson, Jackson Mthembu, condemned the brutality, but also chastised the SABC for broadcasting the footage during the prime time news, citing the fact that it might have upset sensitive viewers, calling on the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) to investigate the SABC's editorial decision. Mthembu has been one of the most vocal supporters of planned legislation to introduce a Media Appeals Tribunal to govern the South African media; legislation which is currently held in abeyance.\n\nAfter visiting the Tatane family in Meqheleng, Ficksburg, on 19 April 2011, Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, Dr Thabo Makgoba, directed attention to the lack of justice and delivery on promises which had preceded the incident and points out the irony of the protesters having been met with water cannons, \"attacked with the very thing they don’t have the pleasure of in their daily lives.\" He called on the Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Sicelo Shiceka, to \"visit and see the appalling conditions under which God’s people live\" and the Minister of Human Settlements, Tokyo Sexwale, to \"provide houses\". He added that \"Minister Nathi Mthethwa and President Zuma should publicly apologise for this embarrassing act of aggression by police.\"\n\nThe Archbishop has subsequently said: \"Let us affirm and call for a renaming of our police services back to 'safety and security' and not a police 'force', for this force seems to maim and kill rather than offer safety and security.\" \n\nThere was an election boycott in the area following Tatane's death. In May 2011 it was reported that the Meqheleng Concerned Citizens group was a credible structure with growing influence. However, by December 2011 it had degenerated to the point of being described as \"a toothless organisation led by calculating tenderpreneurs\".\n\nA number of police officers were charged with Tatane's murder but they were found not guilty on the grounds that Tatane's murderers could not be identified as they were wearing helmets. However, a British journalist was easily able to identify his killers from video footage.\n\nIn poetry, Andries Tatane's death is referenced in a work by Adam Haupt, entitled \"For Andries Tatane\". This poem has since been republished as the epilogue to a scholarly book titled \"Static: Race & Representation in Post-Apartheid Music, Media & Film\" \n"}
{"id": "41612950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41612950", "title": "Anti-fascism", "text": "Anti-fascism\n\nAnti-fascism is opposition to fascist ideologies, groups and individuals. The anti-fascist movement began in a few European countries in the 1920s, and eventually spread to other countries around the world. It was at its most significant shortly before and during World War II, where the fascist Axis powers were opposed by many countries forming the Allies of World War II and dozens of resistance movements worldwide. Anti-fascism has been an element of movements holding many different political positions, including social democratic, nationalist, liberal, conservative, communist, Marxist, capitalist, anarchist, socialist, and centrist viewpoints.\n\nWith the development and spread of Italian Fascism, i.e. original fascism, the National Fascist Party's ideology was met with increasingly militant opposition by Italian communists and socialists. Organizations such as the Arditi del Popolo and the Italian Anarchist Union emerged between 1919–1921, to combat the nationalist and fascist surge of the post-World War I period.\n\nIn the words of historian Eric Hobsbawm, as fascism developed and spread, a \"nationalism of the left\" developed in those nations threatened by Italian irredentism (e.g. in the Balkans, and Albania in particular). After the outbreak of World War II, the Albanian and Serbian resistances were instrumental in antifascist action and underground resistance. This combination of irreconcilable nationalisms and leftist partisans constitute the earliest roots of European anti-fascism. Less militant forms of anti-fascism arose later. For instance, during the 1930s in Britain, \"Christians – especially the Church of England – provided both a language of opposition to fascism and inspired anti-fascist action\".\n\nThe diversity of political entities that share only their anti-fascism has prompted the historian Norman Davies to argue in his book \"\" that anti-fascism does not offer a coherent political ideology, but rather that it is an \"empty vessel\". Davies further asserts that the concept of anti-fascism is a \"mere political dance\" created by Josef Stalin and spread by Soviet propaganda organs in an attempt to create the false impression that Western democrats by joining the USSR in the opposition to fascism could in general align themselves politically with communism. The motive would be to lend legitimacy to the dictatorship of the proletariat and was done at the time the USSR was pursuing a policy of collective security. Davies goes on to point out that with Winston Churchill as a notable exception, the concept of anti-fascism gained widespread support in the West, except that its credibility suffered a serious but temporary blow while the USSR and Nazi Germany coordinated their wars of aggression in Eastern Europe under their Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.\n\nAnti-fascist movements emerged first in Italy, during the rise of Mussolini, but soon spread to other European countries and then globally. In the early period, Communist, socialist, anarchist and Christian workers and intellectuals were involved. Until 1928, the period of the United front, there was significant collaboration between the Communists and non-Communist anti-fascists. In 1928, the Comintern instituted its ultra-left \"Third Period\" policies, ending co-operation with other left groups, and denouncing social democrats as \"social fascists\". From 1934 until the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the Communists pursued a Popular Front approach, of building broad-based coalitions with liberal and even conservative anti-fascists. As fascism consolidated its power, and especially during World War II, anti-fascism largely took the form of Partisan or Resistance movements.\n\nIn Italy, Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime used the term \"anti-fascist\" to describe its opponents. Mussolini's secret police was officially known as \"Organizzazione per la Vigilanza e la Repressione dell'Antifascismo\" (OVRA), Italian for \"Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism\").\n\nIn the Kingdom of Italy in the 1920s, anti-fascists—many from the labour movement—fought against the violent Blackshirts and against the rise of fascist leader Benito Mussolini. After the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) signed a pacification pact with Mussolini and his Fascist Revolutionary Party (PFR) on 3 August 1921, and trade unions adopted a legalist and pacified strategy, members of the workers' movement who disagreed with this strategy formed the \"Arditi del popolo\". The General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the PSI refused to officially recognize the anti-fascist militia, while the Italian Communist Party (PCI) ordered its members to quit the organization. The PCI organized some militant groups, but their actions were relatively minor, and the party maintained a non-violent, legalist strategy. The Italian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni, who exiled himself to Argentina following the 1922 March on Rome, organized several bombings against the Italian fascist community.\n\nItalian liberal anti-fascist Benedetto Croce wrote \"Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals\", which was published in 1925. Another notable Italian liberal anti-fascist around that time was Piero Gobetti.\nBetween 1920 and 1943, several anti-fascist movements were active among the Slovenes and Croats in the territories annexed to Italy after World War I, known as the Julian March. The most influential was the militant insurgent organization TIGR, which carried out numerous sabotages, as well as attacks on representatives of the Fascist Party and the military. Most of the underground structure of the organization was discovered and dismantled by the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism (OVRA) in 1940 and 1941, and after June 1941, most of its former activists joined the Slovene Partisans.\n\nDuring World War II, many members of the Italian resistance left their homes and went to live in the mountainside, fighting against Italian fascists and German Nazi soldiers. Many cities in Italy, including Turin, Naples and Milan, were freed by anti-fascist uprisings.\n\nThe anti-fascist resistance emerged within the Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947), who the Fascists meant to deprive of their culture, language and ethnicity. The 1920 burning of the National Hall in Trieste, the Slovene center in the multi-cultural and multi-ethnic Trieste by the Blackshirts, Benito Mussolini who, at the time, was yet to become Duce, praised as a being a \"masterpiece of the Triestine fascism\" (). Not only in multi-ethnic areas, but also in the areas where the population was exclusively Slovene, the use of Slovene language in public places, including churches, was forbidden. Children, if they spoke Slovene, were punished by Italian teachers who were brought by the Fascist State from Southern Italy. The Slovene teachers, writers, and clergy were sent to the other side of Italy.\n\nThe first anti-fascist organization, called TIGR, was formed by Slovenes and Croats in 1927 in order to fight Fascist violence. Its guerrilla fight continued into the late 1920s and 1930s when by the mid-1930s, already 70,000 Slovenes fled Italy mostly to Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia) and South America.\n\nThe Slovene anti-fascist resistance in Yugoslavia during World War II was led by Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. The Province of Ljubljana, occupied by Italian Fascists, saw the deportation of 25.000 people, equaling 7.5% of the total population, filling up Rab concentration camp and Gonars concentration camp and other Italian concentration camps.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s in the Weimar Republic, Communist Party and Social Democratic Party members advocated violence and mass agitation amongst the working class to first stop the \"Freikorps\" movements in immediate post-WW I Germany, and not long thereafter, Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party. Soviet revolutionary Leon Trotsky wrote:\nThere were several anti-Nazi militant and paramilitary groups. These included the Social Democrat-dominated Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold (formed in February 1924), the Communist paramilitary and propaganda organisation Roter Frontkämpferbund (Red Front Fighters League or RFB, formed in summer 1924) and the Communist Kampfbund gegen den Faschismus (Fighting-Alliance against Fascism, formed in 1930). The Roter Front was a paramilitary organization affiliated with the Communist Party of Germany that engaged in street fights with the Nazi Sturmabteilung. Its first leader was Ernst Thälmann, who would later die in a concentration camp and become widely honored in East Germany as an anti-fascist and socialist. In 1932, during the United Front period, Antifaschistische Aktion was formed as a broad-based alliance in which Social Democrats, Communists and others could fight legal repression and engage in self-defence against Nazi paramilitaries. Its two-flag logo, designed by Max Keilson and Max Gebhard, is still widely used as a symbol of militant anti-fascists globally.\n\nIn Spain, large-scale anti-fascist movements were first seen in the 1930s, before and during the Spanish Civil War. The republican government and army, the Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias (MAOC) linked to the Communist Party (PCE), the International Brigades, the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), Spanish anarchist militias, such as the Iron Column and the autonomous governments of Catalonia and the Basque Country, fought the rise of Francisco Franco with military force. The Friends of Durruti, associated with the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI), were a particularly militant group. Thousands of people from many countries went to Spain in support of the anti-fascist cause, joining units such as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the British Battalion, the Dabrowski Battalion, the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, the Naftali Botwin Company and the Thälmann Battalion, including Winston Churchill's nephew, Esmond Romilly. Notable anti-fascists who worked internationally against Franco included: George Orwell (who fought in the POUM militia and wrote \"Homage to Catalonia\" about this experience), Ernest Hemingway (a supporter of the International Brigades who wrote \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" about this experience), and radical journalist Martha Gellhorn.\n\nSpanish anarchist guerrilla Francesc Sabaté Llopart fought against Franco's regime until the 1960s, from a base in France. The Spanish Maquis, linked to the PCE, also fought the Franco regime long after the Spanish Civil war had ended.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s in the French Third Republic, anti-fascists confronted aggressive far-right groups such as the Action Française movement in France, which dominated the Latin Quarter students' neighborhood. After fascism triumphed via invasion, the French Resistance () or, more accurately, resistance movements fought against the Nazi German occupation and against the collaborationist Vichy régime. Résistance cells were small groups of armed men and women (called the \"maquis\" in rural areas), who, in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities, were also publishers of underground newspapers and magazines such as \"Arbeiter und Soldat\" (\"Worker and Soldier\") during World War 2, providers of first-hand intelligence information, and maintainers of escape networks.\n\nThe rise of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the 1930s was challenged by the Communist Party of Great Britain, socialists in the Labour Party and Independent Labour Party, anarchists, Irish Catholic dockmen and working class Jews in London's east end. A high point in the struggle was the Battle of Cable Street, when thousands of eastenders and others turned out to stop the BUF from marching. Initially, the national Communist Party leadership wanted a mass demonstration at Hyde Park in solidarity with Republican Spain, instead of a mobilisation against the BUF, but local party activists argued against this. Activists rallied support with the slogan \"They shall not pass,\" adopted from Republican Spain.\n\nThere were debates within the anti-fascist movement over tactics. While many east end ex-servicemen participated in violence against fascists, Communist Party leader Phil Piratin denounced these tactics and instead called for large demonstrations. In addition to the militant anti-fascist movement, there was a smaller current of liberal anti-fascism in Britain; Sir Ernest Barker, for example, was a notable English liberal anti-fascist in the 1930s.\n\nThere were fascist elements in the United States in the 1930s such as Friends of New Germany, the German American Bund, the Ku Klux Klan, and Charles Coughlin.\n\nDuring the United States Red Scare after the end of World War II, the term \"premature anti-fascist\" came into currency to describe Americans who had strongly agitated or worked against fascism, such as by fighting for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, before fascism was seen as a proximate and existential threat to the United States (which only occurred generally after the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and universally after the attack on Pearl Harbor). The implication was that such persons were Communists or Communist sympathizers whose loyalty to the United States was suspect. However, historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr have written that no documentary evidence has been found of the US government referring to American members of the International Brigades as \"premature antifascists\"; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office of Strategic Services, and United States Army records used terms such as \"Communist\", \"Red\", \"subversive\", and \"radical\" instead. Haynes and Klehr indicate that they have instead found many examples of members of the XV International Brigade and their supporters referring to themselves sardonically as \"premature antifascists\".\n\nAnti-fascist Italian expatriates in the United States founded the Mazzini Society in Northampton, Massachusetts in September 1939 to work toward ending Fascist rule in Italy. Political refugees from Mussolini's regime, they disagreed among themselves whether to ally with Communists and anarchists or to exclude them. The Mazzini Society joined together with other anti-Fascist Italian expatriates in the Americas at a conference in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1942. They unsuccessfully promoted one of their members, Carlo Sforza, to become the post-Fascist leader of a republican Italy. The Mazzini Society dispersed after the overthrow of Mussolini as most of its members returned to Italy.\n\nThe anti-fascist movements which emerged during the period of classical fascism, both liberal and militant, continued after the defeat of the Axis powers in response to the resilience and mutation of fascism in Europe and elsewhere. In Germany, for example, in 1944, as Nazi rule crumbled, veterans of the 1930s anti-fascist struggles formed \"Antifaschistische Ausschüsse,\" \"Antifaschistische Kommittees\" or \"Antifaschistische Aktion\" groups (all typically abbreviated to Antifa).\n\nAfter World War II, Jewish war veterans in the 43 Group continued the tradition of militant confrontations with Oswald Mosley's Union Movement. In the 1960s, the 62 Group continued the struggle against neo-Nazis.\n\nIn the 1970s, fascist and far-right parties such as the National Front (NF) and British Movement (BM) were making significant gains electorally, and were increasingly bold in their public appearances. This was challenged in 1977 with the Battle of Lewisham, when thousands of people disrupted an NF march in South London. Soon after, the Anti-Nazi League (ANL) was launched by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). The ANL had a large-scale propaganda campaign and squads that attacked NF meetings and paper sales. The success of the ANL's campaigns contributed to the end of the NF's period of growth. During this period, there were also a number of black-led anti-fascist organisations, including the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) and local groups like the Newham Monitoring Project.\n\nThe SWP disbanded the ANL in 1981, but many squad members refused to stop their activities. They were expelled from the SWP in 1981, many going on to found Red Action. The SWP used the term squadism to dismiss these militant anti-fascists as thugs. In 1985, some members of Red Action and the anarcho-syndicalist Direct Action Movement launched Anti-Fascist Action (AFA). Their founding document said \"we are not fighting Fascism to maintain the status quo but to defend the interests of the working class\". Thousands of people took part in AFA mobilisations, such as Remembrance Day demonstrations in 1986 and 1987, the Unity Carnival, the Battle of Cable Street's 55th anniversary march in 1991, and the \"Battle of Waterloo\" against Blood and Honour in 1992. After 1995, some AFA mobilisations still occurred, such as against the NF in Dover in 1997 and 1998. However, AFA wound down its national organisation and some of its branches and had ceased to exist nationally by 2001.\n\nThere was a surge in fascist activity across Europe from 1989 to 1991 after the collapse of Communism. In 1991, the Campaign Against Fascism in Europe (CAFE) coordinated a large militant protest against the visit to London by French right-wing leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen. This sparked a surge in anti-fascist organisations throughout Europe. In the UK alone, in 1992 a number of left-wing groups formed anti-fascist front organisations, such as a re-launched ANL in 1992, the Socialist Party's Youth against Racism in Europe YRE, and the Revolutionary Communist Party's Workers Against Racism. A number of black-led organisations, along with the Labour Party Black Sections and the National Black Caucus, formed the Anti-Racist Alliance in 1991, which eventually became the National Assembly Against Racism.\n\nIn August 2018, the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for a revival of \"an Anti-Nazi League-type cultural and political campaign\" following a number of far-right and racist incidents in the UK, including fascist attacks on a socialist bookshop by members of the far-right and UKIP, marches in favour of far-right activist Tommy Robinson and high-profile Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. This \"welcome and timely\" call to action was supported in a \"Guardian\" letter signed by the league's founders, which included former Labour minister Peter Hain, political activist Paul Holborow and leading musicians from Rock Against Racism.\n\n\n"}

Under the \"new state security laws,\" she was expected \"to face charges of incitement to violence and publishing of 'false statements likely to be prejudicial to state security'\" (ibid.). Parliament reportedly passed \"the public order and security bill ... by acclamation and not by formal vote\" in January 2002 (\"The Guardian\" 10 Jan. 2002). These laws reportedly gave \"sweeping powers to clamp down on the opposition\" (ibid.). Peta Thornycroft was reportedly released by the police \"on a High Court order after four nights in detention\" (AFP 1 Apr. 2002).\n\nNo reports on the official mandate, policies and procedures of the CIO, and on what their uniforms look like, could be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate.\n\nThis response was prepared after researching publicly accessible information currently available to the Research Directorate within time constraints. This esponse is not, and does not purport to be, conclusive as to the merit of any particular claim to refugee status or asylum.\nr\nIn recent years international human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have criticised the CIO's role in alleged internal repression, which is said on occasions to have involved torture.\n\nIn his book \"Serving Secretly\", Flower complained about the undue influence of Irish Catholics in top positions during his early days in the BSA Police. He thought that this matter had been resolved in the late 1940s after a commission of enquiry. The Commissioner of Police at the time Mugabe became Prime Minister, most of the other top police officers were Catholic and Irish or had strong Irish connections.\nThe Central Intelligence Organisation, otherwise known as the CIO, is an arm of the Zimbabwe security sector whose line of work is inherently classified. For a very long time the organisation and its operations have ignited public debate and fueled speculation.\n\nIsaac Moyo is the head of the CIO and is referred to as a director general. He is deputised by Aaron Nhepera. The intelligence organisation consists of nine key branches which include internal, external, counter-intelligence, military intelligence, training, close security unit, technical, administration and another simply known as branch six. The other directors who come immediately after Moyo head these other branches. The directors are duty bound to report directly to the President thereby effectively bypassing the minister of defence. Immediately under the directors are deputy directors, assistant directors, provincial intelligence officers, district intelligence officers, senior intelligence officers, assistant senior intelligence officers and ordinary-level intelligence officers.\n\nThe function of the organisation is to provide high level security to the state from threats both within and outside Zimbabwe. The organisation also offers high level security to high ranking government officials like the President, various government employees like ministers and diplomats working in and outside Zimbabwe. Regionally the organisation works with other Intelligence organisations from other African countries under a regional body called Central Intelligence and Security Services of Africa CISSA to tackle problems that threaten the stability of the continent and hamper development like terrorism and extremism.\n\nThere have been numerous reports of gross human rights abuses allegedly perpetrated by the organisation which range from unlawful abductions, torturing of civilians at undisclosed locations among others. Some of the specific incidents in which the Intelligence organisation was fingered include the attack on Nelson Chamisa at the Harare International Airport, the brief disappearance of former ZBC News host Jestina Mukoko and the abductions of Zimbabweans living in South Africa. It is also accused for the abduction of Itai Dzamara, a Zimbabwean activist. These are some allegations that have been leveled against the organisation in the media. There were also unconfirmed reports linking the Central Intelligence Organisation to the closure of Zimweb Internet in December 2001 and the looting of diamonds at the Marange Diamond fields among other malpractices.\n\nApplying for a job in the organisation is not public knowledge like other arms of the Zimbabwe security sector like the police or the army. It has been proposed that they recruit people with preexisting links and others have even proposed that the process of recruitment is a long process in which the one being recruited is researched on to verify their suitability to the job. There have reports linking the organisation with Midlands State University in which the organisation was said to be targeting University graduates for their recruitment sessions, Matebeleland is also one of the alleged areas in which the recruitment sessions are said to have taken place in recent years.\n"}

In monotheistic faiths references to God are used in constructs such as \"God's Chosen People\". The phenomenon of a \"chosen people\" is particularly common in the\nIsraelite tradition, where it originally referred to the Israelites—in fact Jews refer to this as a burden to spread the message of one God. Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of Israelite ancestry, as is the case for the Christian Identity and Black Hebrew sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the \"true Israel\". Others claim a \"spiritual\" chosenness, including most Christian denominations, who traditionally believe the church has replaced Israel as the People of God.\n\nAnthropologists commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of ethnocentrism.\n\nIn Judaism, \"chosenness\" is the belief that the Jews, via descent from the ancient Israelites, are the chosen people, i.e. chosen to be in a covenant with God. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the Book of Deuteronomy as the verb \"bahar\" (), and is alluded to elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible using other terms such as \"holy people\". Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature. The three largest Jewish denominations—Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah.\n\nIn Mormonism, all Latter Day Saints are viewed as covenant, or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the ordinance of baptism. In contrast to supersessionism, Latter Day Saints do not dispute the \"chosen\" status of the Jewish people.\nMost practicing Mormons receive a patriarchal blessing that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through \"adoption;\" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the tribes of Israel). It is a widely held belief that most members of the faith are in the tribe of Ephraim or the tribe of Manasseh.\n\nThe Christian Identity movement sees the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, Nordic and kindred peoples of the world as both the descendants of the ancient Israelites and the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Christian Identity, though not organized as a religion, comprises certain individuals, churches and some prison gangs with a white supremacist theology\nthat promotes a racial interpretation of Christianity. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who regarded Europeans as the \"chosen people\" and Jews as the cursed offspring of Cain. White supremacist sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.\n\nBased on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via Kebra Nagast, Rastas believe that Israel's King Solomon, together with Ethiopian Queen of Sheba, conceived a child which began the Solomonic line of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when Beta Israel, Ethiopia's ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during Operation Moses in 1985.\n\nSun Myung Moon taught that Korea is the chosen nation, selected to serve a divine mission and was \"chosen by God to be the birthplace of the leading figure of the age\" and was the birthplace of \"Heavenly Tradition\", ushering in God's kingdom.\n\nThe NOI teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the Atlantic slave trade they were systematically denied knowledge of their history, language, culture, and religion and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Founder Elijah Muhammad called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of Allah and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.\n\n"}

Due to internal disagreement between its various factions ERAS was eventually dissolved in 2014, with one faction forming the bi-communal group \"ΔΡΑΣυ-Eyelem\" and participating in the Cypriot European Elections of the same year.\n\nERAS identified itself as a communist political party. It claimed to hold a strong position in favor of the welfare state and supported the permanent nationalisation of the banking sector. It supported the reduction of Defense expenses and the duration of conscription in the National Guard. It held a strong anti-austerity position concerning the austerity measures agreed upon between the Troika and the government of Cyprus. It chose not to support any candidate in the 2013 presidential elections, stating that \"within the current conditions, we should have had our own candidate in order to strongly express the ideas and strength of the radical left\" but that \"since ERAS is a recently founded committee, we deemed that we do not have at the moment the organisational capacity or the resources to undergo an electoral campaign\". The Committee also stated that the AKEL-backed candidate, Stavros Malas, does not \"guarantee in any way the defense of the interests of the people and the working class and promotes the delusion that it is possible in the conditions of this crisis to retain the social interest without opposition to the central decisions of the bourgeoisie.\"\n\nERAS has also stated support for the abolition of benefits of high-ranking state officials, the right to abortion, the decriminalisation of cannabis and the right of civil partnership recognition for homosexual couples.\n\nOn 8 November 2012, ERAS organised the first protest against austerity and the Troika negotiations that were still taking place. Protesters were gathered outside the House of Representatives holding banners and shouting slogans against austerity. Leaflets with alternative proposals for the economy were distributed in the protest, with proposals including the nationalisation of banking, the reduction of the army and the freezing of the army budget, and the increase of the corporate tax. Members of the New Internationalist Left (NEDA) also participated in the protest. On 11 January 2013, members of ERAS organised a protest outside the hotel that hosted the meeting of the European People's Party in Cyprus. The protesters shouted against neo-liberalism, capitalism and the memorandum, while some of them wore masks with the faces of various European leaders.\n"}

While it was a relatively minor party, it took part in the first democratically elected government in East Germany in 1990, and is especially known because future Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel started her political career within the party.\n\nIt was founded in October 1989, based on existing politically active church groups. Founding members included Wolfgang Schnur, Friedrich Schorlemmer, Rainer Eppelmann, Günter Nooke and Thomas Welz. The organisation became a political party on December 16/17, 1989 in Leipzig. The party convention adopted a more conservative program than some of the founding members, like Schorlemmer, were willing to bear, so they left the party. Others, like Nooke, who left some time later, resented the growing cooperation with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of East Germany, which had been a member of the Communist-dominated National Front of parties and mass organisations that had supported the Communist regime.\n\nDemocratic Awakening now supported rapid German reunification and joined the Alliance for Germany (\"Allianz für Deutschland\") along with the CDU and German Social Union (DSU) for the 1990 Volkskammer elections on March 18. Only a few days prior to the elections, party chairman Schnur had to confess to having been an informer for the Ministry for State Security (Stasi), and resigned. Although Alliance for Germany won the elections, Democratic Awakening only collected 0.9% of votes, amounting to four seats in the Volkskammer. Eppelmann became minister for disarmament and defense in the new government and new party chairman. On August 5, 1990 Democratic Awakening ceased to exist after merging into the East German CDU, which in turn on 3 October 1990 merged into its West German counterpart, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\n\nFrom February 1990, Angela Merkel served as the party's spokeswoman. After the mergers, Merkel was elected in the post-unification election as a member of the all-German Bundestag for the CDU, and eventually became Chancellor of Germany in 2005.\n\n"}

The database holds two types of information: 1) genomic information of microorganisms, linked to, 2) metadata of those microorganism such as epidemiological details. The database includes all genera of microorganisms: bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi.\n\nFor genotyping of microorganisms for medical diagnosis, or other purposes, scientists may use a wide variety of DNA profiling techniques, such as PCR, PFGE and MLST. A complication of this broad variety of pre-WGS techniques is the difficulty to standardize between techniques, laboratories and microorganisms, which may be overcome using the complete DNA code of the genome generated by WGS techniques. For straight forward diagnostic identification the WGS information of a microbiological sample is fed into a global genomic database and compared using BLAST procedures to the genomes already present in the database. In addition, WGS data may be used to back calculate to the different pre-WGS genotyping methods, so previous collected valuable information is not lost. For the global microbial identifier the genomic information is coupled to a wide spectrum of metadata about the specific microbial clone and includes important clinical and epidemiological information such as the global finding place(s), treatment options and antimicrobial resistance, making it a general microbiological identification tool.This makes personalized treatment of microbial disease possible as well as real-time tracing systems for global surveillance of infectious diseases for food safety and serving human health.\n\nThe initiative for building the database arose in 2011 and when several preconditions were met : 1) WGS has become mature and serious alternative for other genotyping techniques, 2) the price of WGS has started falling dramatically and in some cases below the price of traditional identifications, 3) vast amounts of IT resources and a fast Internet have become available, and 4) there is the idea that via a cross sectoral and One Health approach infectious diseases may be better controlled.\n\nStarting the second millennium, many microbiological laboratories, as well as national health institutes, started genome sequencing projects for sequencing the infectious agents collections they had in their biobanks. Thereby generating private databases and sending model genomes to global nucleotide databases such as GenBank of the NCBI or the nucleotide database of the EMBL. This created a wealth of genomic information and independent databases for eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic genomes. The need to further integrate these databases and to harmonize data collection, and to link the genomic data to metadata for optimal prevention of infectious diseases, was generally recognized by the scientific community. In 2011, several infectious disease control centers and other organizations took the initiative of a series of international scientific- and policy-meetings, to develop a common platform and to better understand the potentials of an interactive microbiological genomic database. The first meeting was in Brussels, September 2011, followed by meetings in Washington (March 2012) and Copenhagen (February 2013).

It has been called as much \"an online store that uses Mr. Jones's commentary to move merchandise\", as a media outlet.\n\nInfoWars was created in 1999 by American conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who remains its controlling influence. \"InfoWars\" features \"The Alex Jones Show\" on their broadcasts and was established as a public-access television program aired in Austin, Texas in 1999.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, the website was promoted by bots connected to the Russian government.\n\nIn 2016, Paul Joseph Watson was hired as editor-at-large. In February 2017, political commentator Dr Jerome Corsi was hired as Washington bureau chief, after InfoWars was granted a White House day pass. \"The Guardian\" has accused Corsi, who is Catholic, \"of being anti-Islamic, anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic and homophobic, and of exploiting racial prejudices in an attempt to 'scare white America.\n\nIn May 2017, Mike Cernovich joined the \"InfoWars\" team as a scheduled guest host for \"The Alex Jones Show\", with CNN reporting the \"elevation to InfoWars host represents the meteoric rise in his profile\".\n\nIn June 2017, it was announced Roger Stone, a former campaign advisor for Donald Trump, would be hosting his own \"InfoWars\" show \"five nights a week\", with an extra studio being built to accommodate his show.\n\nIn March 2018, some of the biggest brands in the U.S. suspended their ads from InfoWars' YouTube channels, after CNN notified them.\n\nIn July 2018, YouTube removed four of InfoWars' uploaded videos that violated its policy against hate speech and suspended posts for 90 days. Facebook also banned Jones after it determined four videos on his pages violated its community standards in July 2018. In August 2018, YouTube, Apple, and Facebook removed content from Jones and InfoWars, citing their policies against hate speech and harassment.\n\nThe following table lists InfoWars main staff members.\nWhile Jones has stated, \"I'm not a business guy, I'm a revolutionary\", he spends much of InfoWars air time pitching health-enhancement and survivalist products to loyal viewers. As a private firm, Infowars and its affiliated companies (\"a web of limited-liability companies\") do not have to report make public financial statements, so that observers can only estimate its revenue and profits.\n\nPrior to 2013, Jones focused on building a \"media empire\". By 2013, Alex Seitz-Wald of \"Salon\" estimated that Jones was earning as much as USD$10 million a year between subscriptions, web and radio advertising, and sales of DVDs, T-shirts, and other merchandise.\n\nThat year, Jones changed his business model to incorporate selling proprietary dietary supplements, including one that promises to \"supercharge\" cognitive functions. \n\nUnlike most talk radio shows, InfoWars itself does not directly generate income. It gets no syndication fees from its syndicater GCN, no cut of the advertising that GCN sells, and it does not sell its three minutes per hour of national advertising time. The show no longer promotes its video service (though it still exists), and has not made any documentary films since 2012. Virtually all money is made by selling Jones' dietary supplements to viewers and listeners.\n\nThe diet supplement products sold on Infowars are \"largely produced by Dr. Edward F. Group III, a Houston chiropractor and founder of dietary-supplement-maker Global Healing Center\".\n\nA lesser source of revenue for InfoWars are its \"money bomb\" telethons, which resemble \"public-radio fund drives\", except that InfoWars is a for-profit institution. Charlie Warzel reports that \"three former Infowars \"employees told BuzzFeed News that a money bomb could easily raise $100,000 in a day\".\n\nAs of 2014, \"operations were bringing in more than $20 million a year in revenue ... according to testimony Mr. Jones gave in a court case\". Most of his revenue in 2014 \"came from the sale of products like supplements\", according to records \"viewed by \"The New York Times\"\". 2014 court proceedings also show that InfoWars was successful enough for Jones and his wife at that time to be planning to \"build a swimming pool complex ... featuring a waterfall and dining cabana with a stone fireplace. Mr. Jones bought four Rolex watches in one day in 2014, and spent $40,000 on a saltwater aquarium. Assets of Jones and his wife at the time \"included a $70,000 grand piano, $50,000 in firearms and $752,000 in silver, gold and precious metals\".\n\nThe loss of social media platforms from being banned by Facebook, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Pinterest may have led to appeals by Jones to viewers: \"The enemy wants to cut off our funding to destroy us. If you don't fund us, we'll be shut down.\"\n\nInfoWars disseminates various conspiracy theories, such as speaking against the HPV vaccine and claiming that the 2017 Las Vegas shooting was part of a conspiracy.\n\nInfoWars advocates New World Order conspiracy theories, 9/11 conspiracy theories, chemtrails, conspiracy theories involving Bill Gates, supposed covert government weather control programs, claims of rampant domestic false flag operations by the US Government (including 9/11) and the unsupported claim that millions voted illegally in the 2016 US presidential election. Jones frequently uses InfoWars to assert that new high-profile mass shootings are conspiracies or \"false flag\" operations, claims which are often then spread. This has been characterized as Second Amendment \"fan fiction\".\n\nInfowars has published and promoted fake news, and Jones has been accused of knowingly misleading people to make money. As part of the FBI's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, Infowars was investigated to see if it was complicit in the disseminating of fake news stories put out by Russian bots.\n\nFrom May 2014 to November 2017, InfoWars republished articles from multiple sources without permission, including over 1,000 from Russian state-sponsored news network RT, as well as a smaller number of stories from news outlets such as CNN, the BBC, and \"The New York Times\".\n\nInfoWars has regularly accused mass shootings of being false flags and survivors of them as crisis actors by the United States government. InfoWars host Alex Jones has promoted the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories. Jones was widely criticized for claiming that the Sandy Hook massacre was \"completely fake\" and \"manufactured\".\n\nIn March 2018, six families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as well as an FBI agent who responded to the attack filed a defamation lawsuit against Jones for his role in spreading conspiracy theories about the shooting.\n\nJones has also accused David Hogg and other survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting of being crisis actors.\n\nInfoWars promoted fabricated Pizzagate claims. The fake claims led to harassment of the owner and employees of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C. pizzeria targeted by the conspiracy theories, including threatening phone calls, online harassment, and death threats. The owner sent a letter to Jones in February 2017 demanding a retraction or apology. (Such a letter is required before a party may seek punitive damages in an action for libel under Texas law).\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Jones issued an apology in March 2017. Alex Jones said that \"I want our viewers and listeners to know that we regret any negative impact our commentaries may have had on Mr. Alefantis, Comet Ping Pong, or its employees. We apologize to the extent our commentaries could be construed as negative statements about Mr. Alefantis or Comet Ping Pong, and we hope that anyone else involved in commenting on Pizzagate will do the same thing.\" InfoWars also issued a correction on its website.\n\nInfoWars reporter Owen Shroyer also targeted East Side Pies, a group of pizza restaurants in Austin, Texas, with similar fake \"Pizzagate\" claims. Following the claims, the pizza business was targeted by phone threats, vandalism, and harassment, which the co-owners called \"alarming, disappointing, disconcerting and scary.\"\n\nIn 2017, InfoWars (along with similar sites) published a fake story about U.S. yogurt manufacturer Chobani, with headlines including \"Idaho yogurt maker caught importing migrant rapists\" and \"Allegations that Chobani's practice of hiring refugees brought crime and tuberculosis to Twin Falls\". Chobani ultimately filed a federal lawsuit against Jones, which led to a settlement on confidential terms in May 2017. Jones offered an apology and retraction, admitting that he had made \"certain statements\" on InfoWars \"that I now understand to be wrong\".\n\nIn February 2018, Alex Jones was accused by former employees of antisemitism and sexual harassment of women staff members\".\" Jones denied the allegations.\n\nTwo former employees filed complaints against Jones.\n\nOn July 27, 2018, Facebook suspended the official page of pundit and political commentator Alex Jones for 30 days. The website claims that Jones participated in hate speech against Robert Mueller. This was swiftly followed by action from other bodies- on August 6, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify all removed content by Alex Jones and InfoWars from their platforms for violating their policies. YouTube removed channels associated with Infowars, including The Alex Jones Channel, which had gained 2.4 million subscriptions prior to its removal. On Facebook, four pages associated with InfoWars and Alex Jones were removed due to repeated violations of the website's policies. Apple removed all podcasts associated with Jones from its iTunes platform and its podcast app. On August 13, Vimeo removed all of Jones' videos because they \"violated our terms of service prohibitions on discriminatory and hateful content\".\n\nJones' accounts have also been removed from Pinterest, MailChimp and LinkedIn. As of early August, Jones still had active accounts on Instagram and Twitter. Twitter, however, ultimately decided to permanently deactivate Jones' account as well as the InfoWars account in September 2018.\n\nJones tweeted a Periscope video calling on others \"to get their battle rifles ready against antifa, the mainstream media, and Chicom operatives\". In the video he also says, \"Now is time to act on the enemy before they do a false flag.\" Twitter cited this as the reason to suspend his account for a week on August 14. On September 6, Twitter permanently banned InfoWars and Alex Jones for repeated violations of the site's terms and conditions. Twitter cited abusive behavior, namely a video that \"shows Jones shouting at and berating CNN journalist Oliver Darcy for some 10 minutes during congressional hearings about social media.\" On September 7, 2018, the Infowars app was removed from the Apple App Store. On September 20, 2018, PayPal informed InfoWars that they would cease processing payments in 10 days. The reason cited was that Infowars' \"promotion of hate and discrimination runs counter to our core value of inclusion.\"\n\nAlex Jones is the main host, and operator of InfoWars. The show is a platform for other hosts as well.\n\nOwen Shroyer (born 1989) is an American political activist and commentator from St. Louis who now lives and works in Texas. He is considered to be part of the US alt-right movement.\n\nShroyer previously worked as an AM radio host in St. Louis on KXFN and later KFNS. He began hosting a podcast and posting YouTube videos of his views.\n\nShroyer has been quoted as supporting conspiracy theories about the Clinton family.\n\nIn July 2016, Shroyer stopped CNN presenter Van Jones in the streets of Cleveland and attempted to engage him in an unscheduled on-camera debate. Van Jones participated willingly, and put forward well-constructed arguments, leading Shroyer to admit his opinion of Van Jones had changed favorably following the encounter.\n\nOn September 2, 2017, while covering a pro-immigrant rally that took place in Austin, Texas, for InfoWars, Shroyer repeatedly put questions to protesters. He started to question a teenager, Olivia Williams, about her views. She, in return, called him a \"fucking idiot\", leading to international coverage of the incident.\n\nIn November 2017, Shroyer was quoted as saying that Trump supporters outnumbered anti-Trump protesters at an antifa rally held in Austin on November 4, 2017. Infowars headlines had previously supported a conspiracy theory that the event would be the beginning of a planned \"insurgency\" against Trump, although Shroyer had said he did not believe antifa was a real threat.\n\nOther hosts on the show include Anthony Cumia, Mike Cernovich, Roger Stone, Paul Joseph Watson, David L. Knight, Gerald Celente, Lionel, and Telly Blackwood.\n"}

{"id": "66436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66436", "title": "Iraq disarmament crisis", "text": "Iraq disarmament crisis\n\nThe Iraq disarmament crisis was claimed as one of primary issues that led to the multinational invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003. Since the 1980s, Iraq was widely assumed to have been producing and extensively running the programs of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. During the heights of Iran–Iraq War, Iraq had used its offensive chemical program against Iran and Kurdish civilians, also in the 1980s. With the French and Soviet assistance given to Iraqi nuclear program, its primary facility was secretly destroyed by Israel in 1981.\n\nAfter the Gulf War in 1990, the United Nations located and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi chemical weapons and related equipment and materials with varying degrees of Iraqi cooperation and obstruction, but the Iraqi cooperation later diminished in 1998. The disarmament issue remained tense throughout the 1990s with U.S. at the UN, repeatedly demanding Iraq to allow inspections teams to its facilities. Finally, this disarmament crises reached to its climax in 2002-2003, when U.S. President George W. Bush demanded a complete end to what he alleged was Iraqi production of weapons of mass destruction, and reasoned with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to comply with UN Resolutions requiring UN weapons inspectors unfettered access to areas those inspectors thought might have weapons production facilities.\n\nSince the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq had been restricted by the United Nations (UN) from developing or possessing such weapons. It was also required to permit inspections to confirm Iraqi compliance. Bush repeatedly backed demands for unfettered inspection and disarmament with threats of invasion. On 20 March 2003, a multinational alliance containing the armed forces of the United States and United Kingdom launched an invasion of Iraq in 2003. After the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, a number of failed Iraqi peace initiatives were revealed.\n\nIn the decade following the 1991 Gulf War, the United Nations passed 16 Security Council resolutions calling for the complete elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Member states communicated their frustration over the years that Iraq was impeding the work of the special commission and failing to take seriously its disarmament obligations. Iraqi security forces had on several occasions physically prevented weapons inspectors from doing their job and in at least one case, took documents away from them.\n\nOn 29 September 1998, the United States Congress passed the \"Iraq Liberation Act\" supporting the efforts of Iraqi opposition groups to remove Saddam Hussein from office. The Act was signed by President Clinton on 31 October 1998. On the same day, Iraq announced it would no longer cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.\n\nThe UN, under Kofi Annan, brokered a deal wherein Iraq would allow weapons inspectors back into the country. Iraq ceased cooperating with inspectors only days later. The inspectors left the country in December. Inspectors returned the following year as part of The United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC).\n\nPaul Wolfowitz, the military analyst for the United States Department of Defense under Ronald Reagan, had formulated a new foreign policy with regard to Iraq and other \"potential aggressor states\", dismissing \"containment\" in favor of \"preemption\", with the goal of striking first to eliminate threats.\n\nThis policy was short-lived, however, and Clinton, along with George H. W. Bush, Colin Powell, and other former Bush administration officials, dismissed calls for preemption in favor of continued containment. This was the policy of George W. Bush as well for his first several months in office. The September 11, 2001 attacks brought to life Wolfowitz's and other \"hawks'\" advocacy for preemptive action; Iraq was widely agreed to be a likely subject of this new policy. Powell continued to support the philosophy behind containment.\n\nFollowing the Gulf War, the Iraqi Army was reduced to 23 divisions with a total of about 375,000 troops. The Iraqi Air Force was reduced to less than 300 aircraft. The Iraqi Navy was almost completely destroyed, and its few remaining operational vessels were in a poor state of repair, the crews were estimated to be in a poor state of readiness, and its capabilities were reduced to that of limited mining and raiding missions. Any rebuilding that was done went into the Republican Guard, and the formation of the Special Republican Guard.\n\nDuring most of 2002 and into 2003, the United States government continued to call for \"regime change\" in Iraq and threatened to use military force to overthrow the Iraqi government unless Iraq rid itself of all weapons of mass destruction (WMD) it supposedly possessed and convinced the UN that it had done so.\n\nUS diplomatic pressure to bring Iraq to compliance quickly created a diplomatic crisis in the UN, where some members were in agreement with the U.S. position, while others dissented, notably the permanent Security Council members France, Russia and the People's Republic of China, and fellow NATO members Germany and Belgium.\n\nThe Bush administration began a military buildup in the region, and after pushing hard gained passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1441. Led by Hans Blix, Head of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and Mohamed ElBaradei Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Resolution brought weapons inspectors back to Iraq in November 2002.\n\nInspectors began visiting sites where WMD production was suspected, but found no evidence of such activities, except for 18 undeclared empty 122 mm chemical rockets that were destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision. P. 30 Inspectors also found that the Al-Samoud-2 and Al-fatah missiles violated the UN range restrictions, the former also being partially destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision.\n\nOn March 7, 2003 Hans Blix reported accelerated cooperation throughout the month of February but it was still not \"immediate\" and \"unconditional\" as called for by UN Security Council Resolution 1441. He informed the UN security council that \"it will not take years, nor weeks, but months\" to verify whether Iraq had complied with its disarmament obligations.\n\nU.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair met in the Azores islands for an \"emergency summit\" over the weekend of March 15–16, 2003, after which Bush declared that, despite Blix's report, \"diplomacy had failed\" to compel Iraq to comply with UN Resolution inspection requirements, and stated his intention to use military force to attack Iraq in what was, according to the Bush administration, compliance with the threat of \"serious consequences\" in UN 1441.\n\nSeveral close allies of the U.S. (e.g. Germany, Belgium and France) opposed a military intervention because they asserted it would increase rather than decrease the risk of terrorist attacks. Although the British government and some governments of other members of the EU and NATO supported the US position, opinion polls show that in general their populations were against an attack, especially an attack without clear UN Security Council support. Millions of people in the major cities of Europe, and hundreds of thousands in major cities of North America, participated in peace marches on 15 February 2003.\n\nOn 7 October 2002 President Bush stated:\n\"Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism, and practices terror against its own people. The entire world has witnessed Iraq's eleven-year history of defiance, deception and bad faith.\"\n\nOn 17 March 2003 Bush stated in an address to the nation:\n\n\"Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's neighbors and against Iraq's people.\"\n\nTwo days later on March 19, 2003, as the invasion of Iraq began, Bush stated in an address to the nation:\n\n\"\"My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.\"\n\nOn October 11, 2002, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with then British Prime Minister Tony Blair. At a news conference, he said:\n\nIn a February 2003 joint declaration by Russia, Germany and France, Jacques Chirac remarked:\n\nThe position of whether the invasion was legal under international law is unclear. Article 2 of the United Nations Charter forbids UN members from employing \"the threat or use of force\" against other states in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. Two exceptions exist to the rule: self-defense (Article 51) or an authorization by the Security Council to protect international peace and security (Chapter VII).\n\nThe government of the United States said publicly, and the British pledged privately, that they were willing to invade Iraq with or without Security Council authorization.\n\nThere have been two military actions carried out with the approval of the Security Council. These two instances were the Korean War and the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nThe United States does not recognize the jurisdiction of any international court over its citizens or military, holding that the United States Supreme Court is its final authority. One example of this policy is that the United States did not ratify the International Criminal Court (ICC) treaty, and on 6 May 2002 it informed the UN that it has no intention to do so.\n\nAs of 24 February 2005 neither Iraq nor the United States have ratified the ICC treaty, and therefore neither the US attack on Iraq nor subsequent actions in Iraq fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC. The actions of signatories such as the United Kingdom and Spain could however fall under the ICC jurisdiction.\n\nOn March 17, 2003, Peter Goldsmith, Attorney General for England and Wales, set out his government's legal justification for an invasion of Iraq. He said that the 1990 Security Council Resolution 678 authorised force against Iraq, which was suspended but not terminated by the 1991 Resolution 687, which imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. A material breach of resolution 687 would revive the authority to use force under resolution 678. In Resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq was in material breach of resolution 687 because it had not fully carried out its obligations to disarm, and in early 2003 sent teams of weapons inspectors to verify the facts on the ground.\n\nMost member governments of the United Nations Security Council made clear that in their view, after resolution 1441 there was still no authorization for the use of force. However, the US and its allies argued that no resolution authorizing the invasion would be necessary anyway as they acted in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter and by customary international law. The exercise of that right could not be banned by ceasefire. Since Iraq was not actively disarming themselves and hid WMDs from UN inspectors many times, the US and its allies had every right to assume that Iraq was holding WMDs. If the UN failed to force compliance, the US and the UK - as parties of the 1991 conflict - would invade Iraq without the UN, as they had already done in their intervention in the Kosovo War. Yoram Dinstein equates this to police officers cornering a convicted violent felon and saying \"put your hands on your head\", but instead he pulls something small and black (whether a gun or not) out of his pocket. Officers would have been justified in shooting him because he could have possessed something that is dangerous.\n\nThe Constitution grants the power to declare war exclusively to the United States Congress, but declares the President to be Commander-in-Chief of the US military. Because of this division of power, there has long been controversy regarding the authority of the President outside of a declared war. Nonetheless, of the many instances the United States has exercised force outside its borders, only five have been as part of a declared war.\n\nIn 1973, amid increasing domestic controversy about the Vietnam War, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution to limit the ability of the president to undertake prolonged military action without Congressional authority. No president since has recognized the constitutionality of this act, and most legal scholars believe it would not survive a challenge in court.\n\nTo avoid initiating a crisis under the War Powers Resolution, the Bush administration sought explicit approval from the Congress to exercise force in Iraq. On October 9, 2002, the Congress passed the Iraq Resolution which explicitly authorized the President to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate. This raises the issue of whether or not Congress has the authority to delegate legislative power to the executive branch. However, in a recent United States Supreme Court case, \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,\" the Supreme Court ruled that the military commissions that the President had established, (and defended by arguing that he was given the power to create military courts by this resolution), were unconstitutional because they were unauthorized by Congress.\n\nThe Constitution also provides that international treaties ratified by the United States are among the highest law of the land (US Constitution, Article VI). The UN Charter is a treaty ratified by the US, which forbids member states, including the US, from attacking fellow member states, including Iraq, except in two carefully circumscribed situations (see UN Charter).\n\nAfter the invasion of Iraq, the Iraq Survey Group, headed by David Kay was formed to find the alleged weapons of mass destruction. Apart from a small quantity of degraded pre-1991 shells, nothing was found.\n\n\n"}

It occurred in 2010 but was only brought to mainstream public attention in 2012.\n\nErik Almqvist, Kent Ekeroth and Christian Westling, all high-ranking members of the Sweden Democrats (the first two were members of parliament when the incident was uncovered, Ekeroth as their candidate as Attorney General), had been involved in a verbal altercation with comedian Soran Ismail. Footage from the incident, captured by Ekeroth, shows that Erik Almqvist had told Ismail, who is of Kurdish descent, that he \"acts like a wog\", argues \"like a little pussy\" and that Sweden is \"my country, not yours\". He also called a woman \"little whore\" and a man \"\"blatte\" lover\". Ekeroth was also shown to shove a woman into the side of a car, and finally, the three politicians armed themselves with iron pipes from a nearby construction site after receiving a threat from a witness.\n\nErik Almqvist initially denied any involvement in the scandal, but later confessed when the footage was released. The Sweden Democrats and Erik Almqvist justified the trio's actions by stating that Ismail had insulted them in his comedy routine, and that the man who had threatened them had claimed to belong to a criminal organization. Footage released later on proved that Almqvist hadn't at all believed the man's statement, and after talking to the police about the incident, casually remarked to the other two that \"sucking up always helps\".\n\nThe Sweden Democrats has also criticized Expressen, who released the initial story, for cherry picking only certain parts of the footage. Expressen responded by publishing the unedited footage, proving that the incident had indeed occurred as stated.\n\nAfter the events were uncovered, Erik Almqvist resigned from all of his party duties except for his parliamentary seat on November 14, 2012. On December 30, 2012, he resigned from his parliamentary seat and also rescinded his party membership. He later relocated to Hungary and has continued to manage the Sweden Democrat paper \"Samtiden\".\n\nKent Ekeroth resigned from his assignment as spokesperson for justice policy on November 21, 2012 and took a two-month leave from his party duties. He has since filed copyright claims regarding the footage used and is highly active within the party again.\n\nPlease note that all the following sources are in Swedish.\n"}

National Security Agency is a United States class action lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) against the National Security Agency (NSA) and several high-ranking officials in the administration of 43rd U.S. president George W. Bush, charging an \"illegal and unconstitutional program of dragnet communications surveillance\".\n\nThe case was filed on behalf of Carolyn Jewel and several other AT&T customers on September 18, 2008, and is based on documentation provided by former AT&T technician Mark Klein.\n\nThe case was dismissed on January 21, 2010, by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker, who concluded that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing because their claims amounted to a \"general grievance\" against the government. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the case on December 29, 2011. NSA whistleblower William Binney testified in July 2012 in support of the EFF that the NSA was \"purposefully violating the Constitution\". On July 8, 2013, Judge Jeffrey White of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California declined to dismiss the lawsuit under the state secrets privilege. Later in 2013 the court ordered the government to explain the effects of intelligence leaks about the NSA's surveillance activities, primarily by Edward Snowden, on the national security impact of the case. The NSA reasserted the state secrets privilege on December 20, 2013, and declassified portions of its assertions of the state secrets privilege the following day.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, Judge White imposed a Temporary Restraining Order, requiring the NSA and other parties to halt the destruction of evidence until a final resolution of the case. On June 5, 2014, the EFF filed a motion for an emergency hearing requesting that the court enforce this Temporary Restraining Order after discovering that the Government had continued the destruction of evidence. A motion filed by the government claimed that doing so would have severe consequences \"including the possible suspension of the Section 702 program and potential loss of access to lawfully collected signals intelligence information on foreign intelligence targets\".\n\nOn February 10, 2015, Judge White dismissed a challenge by the plaintiffs of the constitutionality of the UPSTREAM data collection program. The court ruled that the challenge would require the \"impermissible disclosure of state secret information\", and also ruled that the plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue their claims. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the NSA's collection of Internet and phone content. Judge White also wrote that some of the EFF's factual allegations about the program were not correct, but did not identify any specific inaccuracies.\n\nOn May 19, 2017, Judge White ordered the government to provide \"all relevant evidence necessary to prove or deny that plaintiffs were subject to NSA surveillance via tapping into the Internet backbone\". \n\n\n"}

He has held academic posts at the University of Sydney, the University of Vermont, and the University of Edinburgh, and has been professor of epidemiology and community medicine at the University of Ottawa since 1969.\n\nLast’s initial research emphasis was on primary medical care, as reflected in work conducted mainly during the 1960s; this substantial body of work (approximately 30 published papers over the decade, selections cited here) includes observations on the health of immigrants, maternal and child health, communication issues and community health services, and the organization and economics of medical care in Australia. He published also on issues of measurement, record keeping, evaluation and quality of care. And addressing the challenge being faced by the United Kingdom, which was experiencing an exodus of physicians, he addressed related aspects of medical manpower planning.\n\nPerhaps his most enduring contribution to the health care research literature of the 1960s was a description of the \"iceberg\": a common phenomenon in the natural history of disease where only a relatively small proportion of cases of a given disease, \"the tip of the iceberg\", comes to the attention of the health care system. The \"submerged part\" goes undiagnosed and unreported. The proportion of missed cases varies with the disease and its severity. This contribution (including a table on clinical and subclinical disease) was incorporated (and duly referenced) by Jerry Morris, a long-standing colleague of Last, in his textbook on Uses of Epidemiology.\n\nA leader in the development of ethical standards for epidemiology and public health, Last led the International Epidemiological Association initiative to develop guidelines on ethical conduct of epidemiological research, practice, and teaching (1987–93); he was a member of the Working Group of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences that drafted International Guidelines for Ethical Review of Epidemiological Studies (1991).\n\nHe has made numerous contributions to the public health reference literature, especially in the capacity of a scientific editor. He edited four editions of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (1980, 1986, 1991, 1998), known as \"Maxcy-Rosenau-Last\" and is editor-emeritus of the 15th edition in 2008. As founding editor, he produced four editions of the Dictionary of Epidemiology (1983, 1988; 1995, 2001); The successor and current editor of the dictionary is the Catalan scholar Miquel Porta. This dictionary has been translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Persian, Serbian, Slovakian, Russian and Ukrainian. He co-edited the Oxford Illustrated Companion to Medicine 3rd edition (2001) and An Encyclopedia of Public Health (2002). He was contributing editor on public health sciences and practice for Stedman's Medical Dictionary (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005) and the New Oxford American Dictionary (2001). He was scientific editor of the Canadian Journal of Public Health 1981-1991, editor of the Annals of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada 1990-1998, and interim editor of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in 1988-89. Author of Public Health and Human Ecology (1987, 1996), he continues to contribute to the field: as editor of a Dictionary of Public Health (2006), and as coauthor of Global Public Health - Ecological Foundations (2013).\n\nHis main scholarly interests today are the interactions of ecosystem health with human health: he has served in related advisory capacities, including as a reviewer (1998–99) for the Health Sector Working Group of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nIn a 2014 interview, in his 88th year, John Last was asked: \"What are some key lessons you’ve learned over your career?\" In reply, this is what he said:\n\n\"I’ve been in public health for over 50 years, and I’ve learned a lot. And I’m still a student. I learn something new every day. I think of myself as a perpetual learner. I believe it’s helped to keep me youthful: I am an old man in years of life lived, but I’ve preserved my youthful enthusiasm for learning, and that has kept me young in spirit. In terms of key lessons, avoid getting locked into rigid positions. Tolerate ambiguity. Conditions are changing and they’re going to go on changing. It’s absolutely essential to keep an open mind, keep your options open, and of course, keep your skills up-to-date. And be prepared to defend controversial issues. Remain flexible, so you can adapt to changing conditions. A species that over-specializes to cope with a particular set of conditions is in danger of extinction when conditions change. Over-specialized professional people likewise risk extinction (i.e., becoming redundant) when conditions change. That’s why it’s essential to remain flexible and adaptable.\"\n\nLater in the same interview, he stated: \"...our duty as public health officials is to assemble, assess and evaluate the evidence on public health problems affecting the population we serve. We must show leadership in presenting this evidence to elected officials to whom we are answerable, and must be prepared also to communicate this evidence to the general public, along with actions needed to control the public health problems that we identify. We must be prepared to defend our decisions, which are sometimes opposed by eloquent representatives of powerful vested interest groups. To be effective in this role, we need political savvy – sometimes the most important of the skills we possess.\"\n\nJohn Last's honors include an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Medicine at Uppsala University, Sweden, 1993, and MD Honoris Causa of Edinburgh University, 2003. He was Wade Hampton Frost lecturer, American Public Health Association, 1989; Scholar in Residence, Rockefeller Foundation's Villa Serbelloni Study and Conference Center, Bellagio, 1992. In recognition of lifetime achievements, he received the Duncan Clark Award of the Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine in 1994, the Abraham Lilienfeld Award of the American College of Epidemiology in 1997, the Defries Award, highest honour of the Canadian Public Health Association in 2006, and the Sedgwick Memorial Medal of the American Public Health Association in 2008. He is an honorary life member of the International Epidemiological Association, the American College of Epidemiology, the American Public Health Association, the UK Society for Social Medicine, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the British Medical Association.\n\nIn 2012 John Last was admitted as an Officer of the Order of Canada in recognition of his service to public health sciences.\n\n"}

{"id": "341594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341594", "title": "Land reform in Zimbabwe", "text": "Land reform in Zimbabwe\n\nLand reform in Zimbabwe officially began in 1980 with the signing of the Lancaster House Agreement, as an effort to more equitably distribute land between black subsistence farmers and white Zimbabweans of European ancestry, who had traditionally enjoyed superior political and economic status. The programme's targets were intended to alter the ethnic balance of land ownership. Inequalities in land ownership were inflated by a growing overpopulation problem, depletion of over-utilised tracts, and escalating poverty in subsistence areas parallel with the under-utilisation of land on commercial farms. However, the predominantly white commercial sector also provided a livelihood for over 30% of the paid workforce and accounted for some 40% of exports. Its principal crops included sugarcane, coffee, cotton, tobacco and several varieties of high-yield hybrid maize. Both the commercial farms and the subsistence sector maintained large cattle herds, but over 60% of domestic beef was furnished by the former. In sharp contrast, the life of typical subsistence farmers was difficult, and their labour poorly rewarded. As erosion increased, the ability of the subsistence sector to feed its adherents diminished to an alarming degree.\n\nLand hunger was at the centre of the Rhodesian Bush War, and was addressed at Lancaster House, which sought to concede equitable redistribution to the landless without damaging the white farmers' vital contribution to Zimbabwe's economy. At independence from the United Kingdom in 1980, the Zimbabwean authorities were empowered to initiate the necessary reforms; as long as land was bought and sold on a willing basis, the British government would finance half the cost. In the late 1990s, Prime Minister Tony Blair terminated this arrangement when funds available from Margaret Thatcher's administration were exhausted, repudiating all commitments to land reform. Zimbabwe responded by embarking on a \"fast track\" redistribution campaign, forcibly confiscating white farms without compensation.\n\nThe government's land distribution is perhaps the most crucial and most bitterly contested political issue surrounding Zimbabwe. It has been criticised for the violence and intimidation which marred several expropriations, as well as the parallel collapse of domestic banks which held billions of dollars' worth of bonds on liquidated properties. The United Nations has identified several key shortcomings with the contemporary programme, namely failure to compensate ousted landowners as called for by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the poor handling of boundary disputes, and chronic shortages of material and personnel needed to carry out resettlement in an orderly manner.\n\nAs of 2011, 237,858 Zimbabwean households had been provided with access to land under the programme. A total of 10,816,886 hectares had been acquired since 2000, compared to the 3,498,444 purchased from voluntary sellers between 1980 and 1998. By 2013, every white-owned farm in Zimbabwe had been either expropriated or confirmed for future redistribution. The compulsory acquisition of farmland without compensation was discontinued in early 2018.\n\nThe foundation for the controversial land dispute in Zimbabwean society was laid at the beginning of European settlement of the region, which had long been the scene of mass movements by various Bantu peoples. In the sixteenth century, Portuguese explorers had attempted to open up Zimbabwe for trading purposes, but the country was not permanently settled by European immigrants until three hundred years later. The first great Zimbabwean kingdom was the Rozwi Empire, established in the eleventh century. Two hundred years later, Rozwi imperial rule began to crumble and the empire fell to the Karanga peoples, a relatively new tribe to the region which originated north of the Zambezi River. Both these peoples later came to form the nucleus of the Shona civilisation, along with the Zezuru in central Zimbabwe, the Korekore in the north, the Manyika in the east, the Ndau in the southeast, and the Kalanga in the southwest.\n\nMost Shona cultures had a theoretically communal attitude towards land ownership; the later European concept of officiating individual property ownership was unheard of. Land was considered the collective property of all the residents in a given chiefdom, with the chief mediating disagreements and issues pertaining to its use. Nevertheless, male household heads frequently reserved personal tracts for their own cultivation, and allocated smaller tracts to each of their wives. Population growth frequently resulted in the over-utilisation of the existing land, which became greatly diminished both in terms of cultivation and grazing due to the larger number of people attempting to share the same acreage.\n\nDuring the early nineteenth century, the Shona were conquered by the Northern Ndebele (also known as the \"Matabele\"), which began the process of commodifying Zimbabwe's land. Although the Ndebele elite were uninterested in cultivation, land ownership was considered one major source of an individual's wealth and power—the others being cattle and slaves. Ndebele monarchs acquired large swaths of land for themselves accordingly.\n\nThe first white farmers began to immigrate from South Africa and the United Kingdom during the late nineteenth century, less than a hundred years after the Ndebele invasions. This reflected a larger trend of permanent European settlement in the milder, drier regions of Southern Africa as opposed to the tropical and sub-tropical climates further north. In 1889 Cecil Rhodes and the British South Africa Company (BSAC) introduced the earliest white settlers to Zimbabwe as prospectors, seeking concessions from the Ndebele for mineral rights. Collectively known as the \"Pioneer Column\", the settlers established the city of Salisbury, now Harare. Rhodes hoped to discover gold and establish a mining colony, but the original intention had to be modified as neither the costs nor the returns on the overhead capital matched the original projections. Local gold deposits failed to yield the massive returns which the BSAC had promised its investors, and the military costs of the expedition had caused a deficit. An interim solution was the granting of land to the settlers in the hopes that they would develop productive farms and generate enough income to justify the colony's continued administrative costs. The region was demarcated as \"Southern Rhodesia\" after 1898.\n\nBetween 1890 and 1896, the BSAC granted an area encompassing 16 million acres—about one sixth the area of Southern Rhodesia—to European immigrants. By 1913 this had been extended to 21.5 million acres. However, these concessions were strictly regulated, and land was only offered to those individuals able to prove they had the necessary capital to develop it. Exceptions were made during the Ndebele and Shona insurrections against the BSAC in the mid-1890s, when land was promised to any European men willing to take up arms in defence of the colony, irrespective of their financial status. The settlers of the Pioneer Column were granted tracts of 3,150 acres apiece, with an option to purchase more land from the BSAC's holdings at relatively low prices (up to fifteen times cheaper than comparable land on the market in South Africa).\n\nFriction soon arose between the settlers and the Ndebele and Shona peoples, both in terms of land apportionment and economic competition. In 1900, Southern Rhodesia's black population owned an estimated 55,000 head of cattle, while European residents owned fewer than 12,000. Most of the pastureland was being grazed by African-owned cattle, accordingly. However, in less than two decades the Ndebele and Shona came to own over a million head of cattle, with white farmers owning another million as well. As the amount of available pasture for the livestock quickly dwindled, accompanied by massive amounts of overgrazing and erosion, land competition between the three groups became intense. A number of successive land commissions were thus appointed to study the problem and apportion the land.\n\nThe colonial government in Southern Rhodesia delineated the country into five distinct farming regions which corresponded roughly to rainfall patterns. Region I comprised an area in the eastern highlands with markedly higher rainfall best suited to the cultivation of diversified cash crops such as coffee and tea. Region II was highveld, also in the east, where the land could be used intensively for grain cultivation such as maize, tobacco, and wheat. Region III and Region IV endured periodic drought and were regarded as suitable for livestock, in addition to crops which required little rainfall. Region V was lowveld and unsuitable for crop cultivation due to its dry nature; however, limited livestock farming was still viable. Land ownership in these regions was determined by race under the terms of the Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act, passed in 1930, which reserved Regions I, II, and III for white settlement. Region V and a segment of Region II which possessed greater rainfall variability were organised into the Tribal Trust Lands (TTLs), reserved solely for black African ownership and use. This created two new problems: firstly, in the areas reserved for whites, the ratio of land to population was so high that many farms could not be exploited to their fullest potential, and some prime white-owned farmland was lying idle. Secondly, the legislation resulted in enforced overuse of the land in the TTLs due to overpopulation there.\n\nThe Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act reserved 49 million acres for white ownership and left 17.7 million acres of land unassigned to either the white preserve or the TTLs. While a survey undertaken by the colony's Land Commission in concert with the British government in 1925 found that the vast majority of black Rhodesians supported some form of geographic segregation, including the reservation of land exclusively for their use, many were disillusioned by the manner in which the legislation was implemented in explicit favour of whites. The overcrowded conditions in the TTLs compelled large numbers of Shona and Ndebele alike to abandon their rural livelihoods and seek wage employment in the cities or on white commercial farms. Those who remained on tracts in the TTLs found themselves having to cope with topsoil depletion due to overuse; large amounts of topsoil were stripped of their vegetation cover and rendered unproductive as a consequence. To control the rate of erosion, colonial authorities introduced voluntary destocking initiatives for livestock. When these met with little success, the destocking programme became mandatory in 1941, forcing all residents of the TTLs to sell or slaughter animals declared surplus. Another 7.2 million acres were also set aside for sale to black farmers, known as the Native Purchase Areas.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Southern Rhodesia passed the African Land Husbandry Act, which attempted to reform the communal system in the TTLs by giving black Africans the right to apply for formal title deeds to specific tracts. This legislation proved so unpopular and difficult to enforce that incoming Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith ordered its suspension in the mid 1960s. Smith's administration subsequently recognised the traditional leaders of each chiefdom as the final authority on land allocation in the TTLs.\n\nFollowing Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence, land legislation was again amended with the Rhodesian Land Tenure Act of 1969. The Land Tenure Act upended the Land Apportionment Act of 1930 and was designed to rectify the issue of insufficient land available to the rapidly expanding black population. It reduced the amount of land reserved for white ownership to 45 million acres and reserved another 45 million acres for black ownership, introducing parity in theory; however, the most fertile farmland in Regions I, II, and III continued to be included in the white enclave. Abuses of the system continued to abound; some white farmers took advantage of the legislation to shift their property boundaries into land formerly designated for black settlement, often without notifying the other landowners. A related phenomenon was the existence of black communities, especially those congregated around missions, which were oblivious to the legislation and unwittingly squatting on land redesignated for white ownership. The land would be sold in the meantime, and the government obliged to evict the preexisting occupants. These incidents and others were instrumental in eliciting sympathy among Rhodesia's black population for nationalist movements such as the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), which sought to overthrow the Rhodesian government by force of arms.\n\nThe escalation of the Rhodesian Bush War in the 1970s led to a significant amount of rural displacement and interrupted agricultural activity. The disruption of veterinary services resulted in massive livestock losses, and the cultivation of cash crops was hampered by guerrilla raids. The murder of about three hundred white farmers during the war, as well as the conscription of hundreds of others into the Rhodesian Security Forces, also led to a drop in the volume of agricultural production. Between 1975 and 1976 Rhodesia's urban population doubled as thousands of rural dwellers, mostly from TTLs, fled to the cities to escape the fighting. A campaign of systematic villagisation followed as the Rhodesian Army shifted segments of the black population into guarded settlements to prevent their subversion by the insurgents.\n\nIn 1977, the Land Tenure Act was amended by the Rhodesian parliament, which further reduced the amount of land reserved for white ownership to 200,000 hectares, or 500,000 acres. Over 15 million hectares were thus opened to purchase by persons of any race. Two years later, as part of the Internal Settlement, Zimbabwe Rhodesia's incoming biracial government under Bishop Abel Muzorewa abolished the reservation of land according to race. White farmers continued to own 73.8% of the most fertile land suited for intensive cash crop cultivation and livestock grazing, in addition to generating 80% of the country's total agricultural output. This was a vital contribution to the economy, which was still underpinned by its agricultural exports.\n\nLand reform emerged as a critical issue during the Lancaster House Talks to end the Rhodesian Bush War. ZANU leader Robert Mugabe and ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo insisted on the redistribution of land—by compulsory seizure, without compensation—as a precondition to a negotiated peace settlement. This was reflective of prevailing attitudes in their guerrilla armies, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) respectively, and rural support bases, which had high expectations of the redistribution of land. The British government, which mediated the talks, proposed a constitutional clause underscoring property ownership as an inalienable right to prevent a mass exodus of white farmers and the economic collapse of the country. This was enshrined in Section 16 of the Zimbabwean Constitution, 1980. To secure Mugabe and Nkomo's support for the constitutional agreement, Lord Carrington announced that the United Kingdom would be prepared to assist land resettlement with technical assistance and financial aid. The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations, Sir Shridath Ramphal, also received assurances from the American ambassador in London, Kingman Brewster, that the United States would likewise contribute capital for \"a substantial amount for a process of land redistribution and they would undertake to encourage the British government to give similar assurances\".\n\nThe Lancaster House Agreement stipulated that farms could only be taken from whites on a \"willing buyer, willing seller\" principle for at least ten years. White farmers were not to be placed under any pressure or intimidation, and if they decided to sell their farms they were allowed to determine their own asking prices. Exceptions could be made if the farm was unoccupied and not being used for agricultural activity.\n\nSouthern Rhodesia's independence was finally recognised as the Republic of Zimbabwe on April 18, 1980. As Zimbabwe's first prime minister, Mugabe reaffirmed his commitment to land reform. The newly created Zimbabwean Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment announced later that year that land reform would be necessary to alleviate overpopulation in the former TTLs, extend the production potential of small-scale subsistence farmers, and improve the standards of living of rural blacks. Its stated goals were to ensure abandoned or under-utilised land was being exploited to its fullest potential, and provide opportunities for unemployed, landless peasants.\n\nDespite extensive financial assistance from the UK, the first phase of Zimbabwe's land reform programme was widely regarded as unsuccessful. Zimbabwe was only able to acquire 3 million hectares (7.41 million acres) for black resettlement, well short of its intended target of 8 million hectares (19.77 million acres). This land was redistributed to about 50,000 households. Many former supporters of the nationalist movements felt that the promises of Nkomo and Mugabe with regards to the land had not been truly fulfilled. This sentiment was especially acute in Matabeleland, where the legacy of the Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act was more disadvantageous to black Zimbabweans than other parts of the country.\n\nFunds earmarked for the purchase of white farms were frequently diverted into defence expenditure throughout the mid 1980s, for which Zimbabwean officials received some criticism. Reduction of funding posed another dilemma: property prices were now beyond what the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment could afford to meet its goals. It was also unable to build sufficient roads, clinics, and schools for the large number of people it was resettling in new areas. After 1983, the domestic budget could no longer sustain resettlement measures, and despite British aid the number of farms being purchased gradually declined for the remainder of the decade.\n\nIn 1986, the government of Zimbabwe cited financial restraints and an ongoing drought as the two overriding factors influencing the slow progress of land reform. However, it was also clear that within the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment itself there was a lack of initiative and trained personnel to plan and implement mass resettlements. Parliament passed the Land Acquisition Act in 1985, which gave the government first right to purchase excess land for redistribution to the landless. It empowered the government to claim tracts adjacent to the former TTLs (now known simply as \"Communal Areas\") and mark them for resettlement purposes, provided the owners could be persuaded to sell.\n\nBetween April 1980 and September 1987, the acreage of land occupied by white-owned commercial farms was reduced by about 20%.\n\nAfter the expiration of the entrenched constitutional conditions mandated by the Lancaster House Agreement in the early 1990s, Zimbabwe outlined several ambitious new plans for land reform. A National Land Policy was formally proposed and enshrined as the Zimbabwean Land Acquisition Act of 1992, which empowered the government to acquire any land as it saw fit, although only after payment of financial compensation. While powerless to challenge the acquisition itself, landowners were permitted some lateral to negotiate their compensation amounts with the state. The British government continued to help fund the resettlement programme, with aid specifically earmarked for land reform reaching £91 million by 1996. Another £100 million was granted for \"budgetary support\" and was spent on a variety of projects, including land reform. Zimbabwe also began to court other donors through its Economic Structural Adjustment Policies (ESAP), which were projects implemented in concert with international agencies and tied to foreign loans.\n\nThe diversion of farms for personal use by Zimbabwe's political elite began to emerge as a crucial issue during the mid 1990s. Prime Minister Mugabe, who assumed an executive presidency in 1987, had urged restraint by enforcing a leadership code of conduct which barred members of the ruling party, ZANU-PF, from monopolising large tracts of farmland and then renting them out for profit. Local media outlets soon exposed huge breaches of the code by Mugabe's family and senior officials in ZANU-PF. Despite calls for accountability, the party members were never disciplined. Instead of being resettled by landless peasants, several hundred commercial farms acquired under the Land Acquisition Act continued to be leased out by politically connected individuals. In 1994, a disproportionate amount of the land being acquired was held by fewer than 600 black landowners, many of whom owned multiple properties. One study of commercial farms found that over half the redistributed land that year went to absentee owners otherwise unengaged in agriculture.\n\nThe perceived monopolisation of land by the ruling party provoked intense opposition from the ESAP donor states, which argued that those outside the patronage of ZANU-PF were unlikely to benefit. In 1996, party interests became even more inseparable from the issue of land reform when President Mugabe gave ZANU-PF's central committee overriding powers— superseding those of the Zimbabwean courts as well as the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture—to delegate on property rights. That year all farms marked for redistribution were no longer chosen or discussed by government ministries, but at ZANU-PF's annual congress.\n\nIn 1997 the government published a list of 1,471 farms it intended to buy compulsorily for redistribution. The list was compiled via a nationwide land identification exercise undertaken throughout the year. Landowners were given thirty days to submit written objections. Many farms were delisted and then re-listed as the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture debated the merits of acquiring various properties, especially those which ZANU-PF had ordered be expropriated for unspecified \"political reasons\". Of the 1,471 individual property acquisitions, about 1,200 were appealed to the courts by the farmowners due to various legal irregularities. President Mugabe responded by indicating that in his opinion land reform was a strictly political issue, not one to be questioned or debated by the judiciary.\n\nThe increasing politicisation of land reform was accompanied by the deterioration of diplomatic relations between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom. Public opinion on the Zimbabwean land reform process among British citizens was decidedly mediocre; it was perceived as a poor investment on the part of the UK's government in an ineffectual and shoddily implemented programme. In June 1996, Lynda Chalker, British secretary of state for international development, declared that she could not endorse the new compulsory acquisition policy and urged Mugabe to return to the principles of \"willing buyer, willing seller\". \n\nOn 5 November 1997, Chalker's successor, Clare Short, described the new Labour government's approach to Zimbabwean land reform. She said that the UK did not accept that Britain had a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe. Notwithstanding the Lancaster House commitments, Short stated that her government was only prepared to support a programme of land reform that was part of a poverty eradication strategy. She had other questions regarding the way in which land would be acquired and compensation paid, and the transparency of the process. Her government's position was spelt out in a letter to Zimbabwe's Agriculture Minister, Kumbirai Kangai:\n\nThe letter concluded by stating that a programme of rapid land acquisition would be impossible to support, citing concern about the damage which this might do to Zimbabwe's agricultural output and its prospects of attracting investment.\n\nKenneth Kaunda, former president of Zambia, responded dismissively by saying \"when Tony Blair took over in 1997, I understand that some young lady in charge of colonial issues within that government simply dropped doing anything about it.\"\n\nIn June 1998, the Zimbabwe government published its \"policy framework\" on the Land Reform and Resettlement Programme Phase II (LRRP II), which envisaged the compulsory purchase over five years of 50,000 square kilometres from the 112,000 square kilometres owned by white commercial farmers, public corporations, churches, non-governmental organisations and multinational companies. Broken down, the 50,000 square kilometres meant that every year between 1998 and 2003, the government intended to purchase 10,000 square kilometres for redistribution.\n\nIn September 1998, the government called a donors conference in Harare on LRRP II to inform the donor community and involve them in the program: Forty-eight countries and international organisations attended and unanimously endorsed the land program, saying it was essential for poverty reduction, political stability and economic growth. They agreed that the inception phase, covering the first 24 months, should start immediately, particularly appreciating the political imperative and urgency of the proposal.\n\nThe Commercial Farmers Union freely offered to sell the government 15,000 square kilometres for redistribution, but landowners once again dragged their feet. In response to moves by the National Constitutional Assembly, a group of academics, trade unionists and other political activists, the government drafted a new constitution. The draft was discussed widely by the public in formal meetings and amended to include restrictions on presidential powers, limits to the presidential term of office, and an age limit of 70 for presidential candidates. This was not seen as a suitable outcome for the government, so the proposals were amended to replace those clauses with one to compulsorily acquire land for redistribution without compensation. The opposition mostly boycotted the drafting stage of the constitution claiming that this new version was to entrench Mugabe politically.\n\nGuerrilla veterans of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) began to emerge as a radical force in the land issue around this time. The guerrillas forcefully presented their position that white-owned land in Zimbabwe was rightfully theirs, on account of promises made to them during the Rhodesian Bush War. Calls for accelerated land reform were also echoed by an affluent urban class of black Zimbabweans who were interested in making inroads into commercial farming, with public assistance.\n\nThe government organised a referendum on the new constitution in February 2000, despite having a sufficiently large majority in parliament to pass any amendment it wished. Had it been approved, the new constitution would have empowered the government to acquire land compulsorily without compensation. Despite vast support in the media, the new constitution was defeated, 55% to 45%.\n\nA few days later, the pro-Mugabe Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) organised several people (including but not limited to war veterans; many of them were their children and grandchildren) to march on white-owned farmlands, initially with drums, song and dance. This movement was officially termed the \"Fast-Track Land Reform Program\" (FTLRP). The predominantly white farm owners were forced off their lands along with their workers, who were typically of regional descent. This was often done violently and without compensation. In this first wave of farm invasions, a total of 110,000 square kilometres of land had been seized. Several million black farm workers were excluded from the redistribution, leaving them without employment. According to Human Rights Watch, by 2002 the War Veterans Association had \"killed white farm owners in the course of occupying commercial farms\" on at least seven occasions, in addition to \"several tens of [black] farm workers\". The first white farmers to die as a direct consequence of the resettlement programme were murdered by Zimbabwean paramilitaries in mid-2000. More commonly, violence was directed against farmworkers, who were often assaulted and killed by the war veterans and their supporters. Violent confrontations between the farmers and the war veterans occurred and resulted in exchanges of gunfire, as well as a state of armed siege on the affected farms.\n\nOfficially the land was divided into small-holder production, so called A1 schemes and commercial farms, called A2 schemes. There is however much overlap between the two categories.\n\nThe violent takeover of Alamein Farm by retired Army General Solomon Mujuru sparked the first legal action against one of Robert Mugabe's inner circle. In late 2002 the seizure was ruled illegal by the High and Supreme Courts of Zimbabwe; however the previous owner was unable to effect the court orders and General Mujuru continued living at the farm until his death on 15 August 2011. Many other legal challenges to land acquisition or to eviction were not successful.\n\nOn 10 June 2004, a spokesperson for the British embassy, Sophie Honey, said:\n\nThe Minister for Lands, Land Reform and Resettlement, John Nkomo, had declared five days earlier that all land, from crop fields to wildlife conservancies, would soon become state property. Farmland deeds would be replaced with 99-year leases, while leases for wildlife conservancies would be limited to 25 years. There have since been denials of this policy, however.\n\nParliament, dominated by Zanu-PF, passed a constitutional amendment, signed into law on 12 September 2005, that nationalised farmland acquired through the \"Fast Track\" process and deprived original landowners of the right to challenge in court the government's decision to expropriate their land. The Supreme Court of Zimbabwe ruled against legal challenges to this amendment. The case (Campbell v Republic of Zimbabwe) was heard by the SADC Tribunal in 2008, which held that the Zimbabwean government violated the SADC treaty by denying access to the courts and engaging in racial discrimination against white farmers whose lands had been confiscated and that compensation should be paid. However, the High Court refused to register the Tribunal's judgment and ultimately, Zimbabwe withdrew from the Tribunal in August 2009.\n\nIn January 2006, Agriculture Minister Joseph Made said Zimbabwe was considering legislation that would compel commercial banks to finance black peasants who had been allocated formerly white-owned farmland in the land reforms. Made warned that banks failing to lend a substantial portion of their income to these farmers would have their licenses withdrawn.\n\nThe newly resettled peasants had largely failed to secure loans from commercial banks because they did not have title over the land on which they were resettled, and thus could not use it as collateral. With no security of tenure on the farms, banks have been reluctant to extend loans to the new farmers, many of whom do not have much experience in commercial farming, nor assets to provide alternative collateral for any borrowed money.\n\nConflicting reports emerged regarding the effects of Mugabe's land reform programme. In February 2000, the African National Congress media liaison department reported that Mugabe had given himself 15 farms, while Simon Muzenda received 13. Cabinet ministers held 160 farms among them, sitting ZANU-PF parliamentarians 150, and the 2,500 war veterans only two. Another 4,500 landless peasants were allocated three. The programme also left another 200,000 farmworkers displaced and homeless, with just under 5% receiving compensation in the form of land expropriated from their ousted employers. The Institute of Development Studies of the University of Sussex published a report countering that the Zimbabwean economy is recovering and that new business is growing in the rural areas. The study reported that of around 7 million hectares of land redistributed via the land reform (or 20% of Zimbabwe's area), 49.9% of those who received land were rural peasants, 18.3% were \"unemployed or in low-paid jobs in regional towns, growth points and mines,\" 16.5% were civil servants, and 6.7% were of the Zimbabwean working class. Despite the claims by critics of the land reform only benefiting government bureaucrats, only 4.8% of the land went to business people, and 3.7% went to security services. About 5% of the households (not the same as 5% of the land) went to absentee farmers well connected to ZANU-PF. Masvingo is however a part of the country with relatively poor farming land, and it is possible more farms went to \"cell-phone farmers\" in other parts of the country, according to the study. The study has been criticised for focusing on detailed local cases in one province (Masvingo Province) and ignoring the violent nature of resettlement and aspects of international law. Critics continue to maintain that the primary beneficiaries are Mugabe loyalists. As of 2011, there were around 300 white farmers remaining in Zimbabwe.\n\nBefore 2000, land-owning farmers had large tracts of land and used economies of scale to raise capital, borrow money when necessary, and purchase modern mechanised farm equipment to increase productivity on their land. Because the primary beneficiaries of the land reform were members of the Government and their families, despite the fact that most had no experience in running a farm, the drop in total farm output has been tremendous and has even produced starvation and famine, according to aid agencies. Export crops have suffered tremendously in this period. Whereas Zimbabwe was the world's sixth-largest producer of tobacco in 2001, in 2005 it produced less than a third the amount produced in 2000. Zimbabwe was once so rich in agricultural produce that it was dubbed the \"bread basket\" of Southern Africa, while it is now struggling to feed its own population. About 45 per cent of the population is now considered malnourished. Crops for export such as tobacco, coffee and tea have suffered the most under the land reform. Annual production of maize, the main everyday food for Zimbabweans, was reduced by 31% during 2002 to 2012, while annual small grains production was up 163% during the same period. With over a million hectares converted from primarily export crops to primarily maize, production of maize finally reached pre-2001 volume in 2017 under Mnangagwa's \"command agriculture\" programme.\n\nLand reform caused a collapse in Zimbabwe's tobacco crop, its main agricultural export. In 2001, Zimbabwe was the world's sixth-largest producer of tobacco, behind only China, Brazil, India, the United States and Indonesia. By 2008, tobacco production had collapsed to 48 million kg, just 21% of the amount grown in 2000 and smaller than the crop grown in 1950.\n\nIn 2005, the contract system was introduced into Zimbabwe. International tobacco companies contracted with small-scale subsistence farmers to buy their crop. In return, the farmers received agricultural products such as seeds and fertiliser, as well as advice and supervision. Production revived as the small-scale black farmers gained experience in growing tobacco. In 2014, Zimbabwe produced 217 million kg of tobacco, the third-largest crop on record. This increase in production came at the cost of quality as the capacity to produce higher-value cured high-nicotine tobacco was lost being largely replaced by lower-value filler-quality tobacco.\n\nCritics of the land reforms have contended that they have had a serious detrimental effect on the Zimbabwean economy.\n\nThe rebound in Zimbabwean GDP following dollarisation is attributable to loans and foreign aid obtained by pledging the country's vast natural resources—including diamonds, gold, and platinum—to foreign powers.\n\nIn response to what was described as the \"fast-track land reform\" in Zimbabwe, the United States government put the Zimbabwean government on a credit freeze in 2001 through the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (specifically Section 4C titled Multilateral Financing Restriction), which collapsed the trade surplus in 2002. Where there was a trade surplus of $322 million in 2001, in 2002 the credit freeze led to a trade deficit of $18 million, to grow rapidly in subsequent years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51584004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51584004", "title": "Operation Mississippi Hustle", "text": "Operation Mississippi Hustle\n\nOperation Mississippi Hustle is an ongoing federal investigation initiated in 2014 or earlier by the United States Attorney and prosecuted in the United States Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. It has examined the relationship between officials of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and various for-profit prison contractors and subcontractors who have provided services to the five private prisons in the state. (One has since been closed in September 2016.)\n\nThe FBI revealed a long history of corruption and bribery, beginning as early as 1997. The investigation resulted in indictments on November 6, 2014 against Chris Epps, long-serving Commissioner of the Department of Corrections; the previous day he resigned from his state office and as president of the American Correctional Association (ACA). He had received bribes and kickbacks worth at least $1.47 million, based on contracts of $868 million with private prison operators and related service providers. \n\nBy October 2018, the US Attorney for Southern Mississippi had won indictments against sixteen other officials, consultants, contractors and businessmen, including two former state legislators, and more were expected. Eleven have pleaded guilty, one killed himself, and the identity of another has not yet been made public. The ex-mayor of Walnut Grove, William Grady Sims, finished his sentence. Six other defendants were convicted and are in federal custody. Theresa Malone's ex-legislator husband was not indicted, and died during the proceedings. After a double lung transplant and subsequent serious complications, she has yet to be sentenced. Four Louisiana defendants await trial.\n\nThe Mississippi Attorney General announced in February 2017 that he was filing civil suits against 15 prison contractors and several individuals, for damages and punitive damages related to the corruption cases. He said that \"state law requires that they must also forfeit and return the entire amount of the contracts paid by the state.\"\n\nIn the late 20th century, Mississippi began to enter into contract with private prison management companies to build and operate prisons. It eventually had contracts for six for-profit prisons: Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility, for inmates under 18 who had been convicted as adults;East Mississippi Correctional Facility, devoted to treatment of state prisoners with mental illness; Marshall County Correctional Facility; Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility; Wilkinson County Correctional Facility, which was converted to maximum security after receiving numerous prisoners transferred from Mississippi State Penitentiary following settlement of a class-action suit there, and Delta Corrrectional Facility, which closed after an escape. Contracts were also made for related mental and medical health services, education, telecommunications, and food services. In 2002 Christopher Epps was appointed as Commissioner of Mississippi Department of Corrections; he served under three governors.\n\nOn November 6, 2014, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi announced indictments he had obtained against the Commissioner Chris Epps and his associate Cecil McCrory, a consultant and Republican former state house member. The government charged that, beginning as early as 2005, Epps had begun to take bribes from various contractors and subcontractors for the state; they had been passed through McCrory and another consultant, Robert Simmons. Those payments had been structured to fall beneath the mandated reporting amount so that bank deposits would not come to the attention of federal banking authorities. Epps resigned as commissioner and as the president of the ACA the day before the indictments were announced. Both defendants entered into plea bargains and became cooperating witnesses; initially they were to assist the government with the identification of the originators of those bribes, who were also to be prosecuted with the help of both men.\n\nEpps had been appointed to the Commissioner post in 2002 by Democratic Governor Ronnie Musgrove, and was retained by his successors, Republican governors Haley Barbour in 2004, and Phil Bryant in 2012. In 2011, Epps had told assembled attorneys involved in negotiating lawsuits that had been brought against the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility and the East Mississippi Correctional Facility, that he could not end the contracts of the for-profit companies operating Mississippi's prisons \"because of all the money they spread around Jackson,\" the state capital. His remarks were made during the period when the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Mississippi has said Epps was receiving more than $700,000 in bribes, including the purchase of a beachfront condo on his behalf.\n\nThe government's revised estimates of those alleged bribes to Epps have increased to an estimated total of at least $1.47 million. Over the next two years, the U.S. Attorney filed numerous indictments against persons alleged to have paid the bribes, and he indicated that further indictments would be forthcoming. A year after entering a plea of guilty, McCrory requested that he be allowed to change his plea to one of \"not guilty\" and go to trial. This request was rejected by the judge. Many other defendants pleaded \"guilty;\" others \"not guilty.\" One defendant committed suicide shortly before his arraignment. Numerous corporations were ordered by the presiding Federal judge, Henry Travillion Wingate to produce business records. Some complied, others ignored the subpoenas, and four requested that the information they were willing to provide be kept under seal, which the judge took under advisement.\n\nOn November 1, 2016, while still awaiting sentencing, Epps was arrested for breaking into the home he had forfeited to the federal government as a part of his plea bargain. He had removed light fixtures and other items which he moved to his nearby previous domicile, which he was again occupying. His bail was revoked and in December 2016, Judge Wingate ruled that he would be held in jail until sentencing. On May 24, 2017, Epps received a sentence of almost 20 years.\n\n\nMississippi was among the many states that began to rely in the late 20th century and early 21st century on private contractors to build and operate prisons to house its growing number of inmates convicted and sentenced under increased criminalization of drug possession and a variety of mandatory sentencing laws. The private prisons and management included contracts with GEO Group, which purchased Cornell Corrections, the Texas firm that built and operated the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in Walnut Grove, Mississippi. The prison opened in 2001 in an unincorporated area of Leake County, but the town annexed the prison property to increase its population and tax base; it derived 15% of its revenues from the prison corporation's payment in lieu of taxes. The East Mississippi Correctional Facility was another private prison, operated by Florida's GEO Group, then by Utah's Management and Training Corporation. Numerous contractors served other public and for-profit facilities, providing related telecommunications, food services, health, and other services.\n\nAccording to Leake County Sheriff Greg Waggoner, he initiated the federal investigation into the state Department of Corrections activities. In 2009, he said, Epps' MDOC leased buildings owned by Cecil McCrory in Walnut Grove, Mississippi, for what became the Walnut Grove Transition Center. MDOC also contracted with McCrory to operate the male and female facilities. Although Walnut Grove's longtime mayor, Sims, had no correctional experience, McCrory appointed him as the warden of the Transition Center. In addition, Sims had a separate contract for revenues from 19 vending machines at the Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility.\n\nWalnut Grove was to be a model transition center: a type of halfway house as part of a state effort to support newly released inmates in adjusting to life outside prison. The center charged newly released inmates $20 a day for room and board in dormitories, and was paid a supplement of $6 daily, per bed, by the MDOC. Nearby Walnut Grove residents complained that the center residents were poorly supervised and seemed to be roaming in town without structured activities.\n\nAccording to Waggoner, \"It looked like everything new that happened with MDOC, Cecil [McCrory] was involved in... They [residents of the center] were not supposed to be out at all.\" He said, \"If I ran my facility like that, Epps would have shut me down, but it seemed like there was no problem when McCrory did it.\" After Sims was reported to have taken a female inmate to a motel in nearby Carthage for sex in November 2009, Sheriff Waggoner became involved. He reported the allegation to MDOC, which assigned an internal investigator to assist the sheriff in an investigation.\n\nInvestigators from both Leake County and the state jointly talked to the female inmate, gathering evidence to refer the case to the county district attorney. In the spring of 2010, before they could do so, the MDOC investigator came to Waggoner and told him it was over. \"We're closing the case down,\" he told Waggoner, who was \"shocked\" and asked, \"What do you mean?\" Waggoner told a reporter, \"You could tell he wasn't happy about it but that he was given orders.\" Waggoner said firing a man who committed a felony doesn't end an investigation. It ends when the man is indicted and brought to justice; \"If you have knowledge of a felony and chose not to pursue it, you're negligent in your duty.\" Stunned by the MDOC's termination of the Sims investigation, Waggoner called U.S. Attorney John Dowdy for advice. Dowdy said he contacted the FBI afterward to report the situation. The FBI launched an investigation against Sims and eventually Epps, and named it, \"Mississippi Hustle.\" \n\nOn November 6, 2014, the Federal Government of the United States announced that it had indicted Epps on corruption charges; these charges were based on his dealings with the for-profit prison industry. The federal indictment stated that McCrory, a Republican and former Mississippi State House member, was a businessman who served as the chairperson of the Rankin County School District's board of education. He had paid Epps with kickbacks and bribes totaling more than $1 million. Those transactions included a $200,000 payment, as part of the mortgage of Epps' primary residence in the Jackson area. Epps leveraged the resulting increased equity together with another bribe payment to buy a condominium; he later traded up the latter for a larger, more expensive condo. In exchange, Epps directed contracts to McCrory-owned companies for prison-services contracts, as well as to related companies that hired McCrory as a paid consultant. Per the indictment, the activity started in 2007 and ended on March 12, 2014. Epps entered an initial plea of not guilty, and he received a bond of $25,000.\n\nMcCrory had previously served as a judge and former Sheriff's investigator. He started a prison commissary company, G.T. Enterprises, selling it at a substantial profit to the Centric Group holding company, which owns the Keefe Commissary Network (KCN). McCrory also had gone to work for Correctional Communications Inc. \"I brought Cecil in, in 1996, to help me with political connections,\" said owner and consultant, Sam Waggoner. \"I do all the work, and Cecil did the political stuff. I talk to him about twice a year.\" Waggoner, of Carthage, said the scandal had affected his business, and he worried he'd lose some of the 40 or so contracts he and McCrory had been given during the past two decades. \"Nobody wants to be associated with the company because of the stigma,\" he said. \"But he did no contracts with the county jails, no connections with the sheriffs or anything like that.\" Sam Waggoner subsequently pleaded guilty to bribery.\n\nIn November 2014 Governor Phil Bryant, formerly the State Auditor, ordered rebids of the four operating contracts for prisons that had been awarded by Epps to Utah-based Management and Training Corporation (MTC). Bryant directed interim Corrections Commissioner Richard McCarty to stop negotiations with MTC over renewing a $60-million-a-year contract to manage four private prisons, which held 4,000-plus state inmates. MTC had been sued for mistreatment of inmates in two of those prisons. A fifth private prison was still under contract to CCA.\n\nCecil McCrory plea bargained to lesser federal charges. He had begun working as a consultant to MTC, GEO Group's successor operator in Mississippi for state prison contracts. It had held a $60 million contract to operate three Mississippi prisons: Walnut Grove Correctional Facility, East Mississippi Correctional Facility and Marshall County Correctional Facility, which had been managed by GEO Group, and a fourth, Wilkinson County Correctional Facility, which had been managed by the Corrections Corporation of America. MTC fired McCrory, claiming they had known nothing of his criminal activities.\n\nChristopher Epps In February 2015, pleaded guilty to corruption-related charges: one count of filing a false tax return and one count of conspiracy to launder money. As part of the plea, he forfeited two Mercedes Benz vehicles and his two residences. Epps and McCrory blamed each other for beginning the bribery scheme. Sentencing was first scheduled for June 9, 2015, but a day earlier, the U.S. Attorney for Mississippi said the sentencing was indefinitely delayed, as they were pursuing additional indictments.\n\nWilliam Martin Supervisor of Harrison County , a former prosecutor, was indicted in February 2015. He committed suicide hours before he was scheduled to appear on charges of bribery and corruption.\n\nIrb Benjamin On August 22, 2015, the US Attorney announced the indictment for bribery of Epps in connection with the drug and alcohol treatment programs that his company provided under contract to MDOC prisons. In addition, Benjamin was paid at least $862,000 to acquire and maintain ACA accreditation for jails in numerous counties. Passing ACA standards was required if the prisons were to gain contracts to hold state prisoners. Epps had been elected in 2010 as the president of the ACA, and resigned the day before his indictment was announced.\n\nEpps personally received at least the $1.47 million in bribes for steering what Assistant US Attorney LaMarca estimated to be $800 million in contracts between 2006 and 2014. Judge Wingate was to hear the cases of others who were charged with bribing Epps.\n\nBenjamin, had represented Alcorn County in the State House from 1976–80 and the State Senate 1984-92. He later worked for Republican Lieutenant Governor Eddie Briggs, who ran as a candidate for the governorship. Alcorn County paid Benjamin, president and lobbyist for Mississippi Correctional Management (MCM), $114,000 a year , although he lived more than 200 miles away. The attorney of the Alcorn County Board of Supervisors said the supervisors were not required to seek bids before giving Benjamin the contract as warden, because it was a contract for services, which are exempt from state bid laws. He was also paid $5,000 a month to handle and maintain accreditation by the American Correctional Association for the Alcorn's Regional Correctional Facility and another $4,500 a month as warden of the jail.\n\nBenjamin had formed his business MCM in 1996, when the state Department of Corrections and counties started hiring private contractors to operate prisons and smaller regional jails. MCM operated the Grenada County Jail for several years. Benjamin said the company also had jail accreditation contracts worth $4,000 or $5,000 per month with other counties, including Chickasaw, Hancock, Holmes, Marion, Pearl River, Washington and Yazoo. In the past, he also worked as a $3,000-a-month jail consultant for DeSoto County. The DeSoto County Board of Supervisors supervisors had approved his contract in December 2008, saying: \"Mr. Benjamin was recommended by Commissioner Epps at the state level.\" On November 25, 2014, Benjamin said that he was not aware of the Epps recommendation.\n\nBenjamin pleaded guilty to federal charges on October 18, 2016. He faced 10 years in prison, plus a fine of up to a quarter-million dollars. Benjamin said that he was \"pressured\" by Epps; the contractor estimated he had paid the Commissioner between $180,000 and $225,000 in cash bribes to secure support for his contracts for operation of the regional jails. His plea also covered bribes paid for drug and alcohol rehab programs which his company ran. Assistant US Attorney LaMarca told Judge Wingate, \"it's just a matter of time\" until others whom Benjamin informed upon were indicted.\n\nRobert Simmons, a consultant, on February 11, 2016 was indicted for giving kickbacks to Epps from three contractors involved in constructing expansions of the Walnut Grove and East Mississippi correctional facilities; his kickbacks included part of a $10,000-a-month fee he got from AJA Management and Technical Services of Jackson, Mississippi and more from a second unnamed contractor. He also gave Epps kickbacks on fees involving contracts awarded to Sentinel Offender Services of Irvine, California, which supervises probationers and parolees, allegedly paying Epps $1,400 a month from his $4,000-a-month consulting fee. When pleading guilty before U.S. District Judge Sul Ozerden in Gulfport on February 18, Simmons said that bribery was \"the cost of doing business in Mississippi.\"\n\nIn April 2016, McCrory informed the court that he wanted to change his plea to \"not guilty\" and requested a trial. As a consequence, the judge postponed Epps' sentencing until July 18, 2016. Epps had first been scheduled for sentencing on April 11, 2016, after pleading guilty to money laundering and filing false tax returns. The sentencing of Epps and Brandon businessman McCrory, scheduled for July 19, 2016, was delayed again by Judge Wingate to give their defense lawyers additional time to review materials concerning how much money was gained by the 15 corporations that paid bribes to the pair. Prosecutors hoped to use the evidence to increase the recommended prison sentences for Epps and McCrory. Epps faced a possible 23 years after his 2015 guilty plea to money laundering and filing false tax returns related to $1.47 million in bribes. Numerous companies denied knowing that their consultants were making kickbacks to Epps and others. GEO Group's Finance Director John Tyrell testified that, \"We often have consultants...\"\n\nGEO was paying McCrory $5,000 monthly, which President and Chief Operating Officer Wayne Calabrese later increased to $10,000 (Calabrese has since retired). GEO's Finance Director Tyrrell did not answer the question as to why the amount was doubled. He speculated it may have been because on August 10, 2010, GEO Group, had absorbed Cornell Companies in a merger. Cornell, which was absorbed into GEO Group in 2010, had been operating Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility and had been accused in a lawsuit of mistreatment of prisoners; the settlement included conversion of the facility to adults only. McCrory remained free on bail, with sentencing proceedings postponed three times in 2017. Outstanding issues related to how much consideration he should receive for his cooperation, including recording conversations with other participants in the schemes. His imprisonment was delayed after his defense requested that the amount of his prospective $150,000 fine be reduced. Wingate had already reduced it to $20,000, after McCrory liquidated assets in order to pay the million-plus forfeiture sum. Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood subpoenaed McCrory who gave a deposition in Hood's civil cases against corrupt companies and bureaucrats who obtained contracts while Epps' was MDOC Commissioner, including Florida's GEO Group. The prosecutors expect a final judgment to be entered shortly that will include setting a new date for McCrory to report to prison. Cecil McCrory initially pleaded guilty to a single count of money laundering conspiracy and faced up to 20 years in prison. He agreed to forfeit $1.7 million in assets. After he was sentenced to 8 1/2 years, on February 3, 2017, McCrory continued free on bail, with the judge indicating that his prison time could be reduced after the other defendants in the case are sentenced. McCrory asked that his anticipated fine be lowered considerably, however, since he had liquidated the great bulk of his assets. McCrory's sentencing was postponed numerous times, with his attorney disputing the fine Judge Wingate intended to impose. Eventually, the $20,000 fine was not reduced further.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Darren LaMarca had announced in June 2016, that eleven additional subjects of the investigation may face criminal charges in the Epps' bribery cases. Ten more people could face federal indictments; another could face state charges, which had been expected by mid-July. LaMarca estimated that the corruption's net benefit to contractors exceeded $65 million. Investigators have determined that Epps demanded bribes to exercise his influence, not only at the state level, but among county supervisors. Epps controlled where state inmates were placed, giving him influence over local jails. Besides Criminal Chief LaMarca, Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Lemon, financial analyst Kim Mitchell, acting U.S. Attorney Harold Brittain and FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Freeze, were involved in investigating and prosecuting the case. They estimated a total of $65 million in questionable contracts were involved in the scheme. Given the amount, federal sentencing guidelines recommended that Epps could receive a maximum of 23 years. However, Epps' lawyer asked the judge to sentence Epps based only on the value of the bribes he collected. If the lower amount of $1.47 million had been used, Epps faced a recommended sentence between 14 and 17 1/2 years. Wingate had latitude in sentencing. Because of Epps' cooperation in providing information about those paying the bribes, prosecutors recommended a shorter sentence for the former commissioner.\n\nCalculating benefit to 16 contractors necessitated examining their accounts. On June 30, John Colette, Epps' defense attorney, said he had received more than 1,500 pages of documents in the previous week and would require at least 30 days to review them. Four companies asked Wingate to shield their information from public view; four more did not respond to subpoenas. Wingate said he would hold a hearing by July 16, 2016, to consider requests for protective orders, and to consider contempt orders against companies that had failed to respond to disclosure requests.\n\nDr. Carl Reddix, an obstetrician/gynecologist and owner of Health Assurance LLC, a firm in Jackson, Mississippi, was indicted on July 20, 2016, for seven-count returned by a federal grand jury, was charged with paying bribes and kickbacks to Epps in return for contract awards with the MDOC and for-profit prison operators. The contracts for four for-profit Mississippi prisons held by Wexford Health Sources were sequentially taken and subsequently awarded to Reddix. In 2008, his company received a contract to \"provide inmate health care services\" at the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility, which was renewed in 2011. Transfers of contracts for the state's East Mississippi Correctional Facility and Marshall County Correctional Facility followed in 2012. The final contract was for Wilkinson County Correctional Facility, awarded in 2013. The attorney for Reddix said he had been the victim of a \"shakedown.\" Chief Judge Daniel Jordan sentenced Reddix to six years in prison, plus two years of supervised release. He was fined $15,000 and required to forfeit more than $1.2 million. U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said that Reddix had personally made 36 bribe payments to Epps over a three-year period. He reported to prison on January 29, 2018 and is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Butner 1 Medium custody, in North Carolina.\n\nMark Longoria, CEO of Drug Testing Corporation of Houston, Texas, was also indicted for paying a bribe to Epps.\n\nTeresa Malone is the widow of former State Representative Bennett Malone, who died on December 17, 2017. He served in the legislature for 36 years and chaired the Mississippi House Corrections Committee until his resignation in 2015. On July 25, 2016, she was indicted for giving bribes to Epps through McCrory, from 2010 until 2014, on behalf of medical services provider AdminPros LLC. She initially pleaded not guilty. On October 6, 2017, she changed her plea to guilty to paying kickbacks to Epps in exchange for receiving an MDOC consulting agreement. She admitted to getting $225,000.00 from the agreement with an out of state contractor arranged by Epps, receiving $5,000.00 monthly between October, 2010, through July, 2014, from which she paid Epps between $1,000.00 to $1,750.00 month. Malone was to be sentenced on January 10, 2018, by Judge Wingate and faced a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000.00 fine. However she was admitted to a hospital due to complications from a lung transplant, and Judge Wingate indefinitely delayed her sentencing.\n\nGuy E. \"Butch\" Evans, an insurance broker, was indicted in August 2016. In 2012 Evans was awarded a contract as the insurance broker of record for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. He was given exclusive access to MDOC employees to sell policies and products; he received commissions from insurance companies. He kicked back $1,400 to $1,700 per month to Epps for 16 months, starting in January 2013. The Evans arrangement ended with the Epps indictment. Wingate initially rescheduled the trial until April 3, 2017, for Evans. On March 31, 2018, it was announced that Evans would waive indictment and plead guilty to a lesser offence, one that had not yet been charged. In April 2018, Evans pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting tax evasion while paying Epps $19,200. \n\nOn May 24, 2017, at the time of the sentencing of Epps, LaMarca and John Colette, attorney for Epps, said his cooperation could lead to charges against six or seven others, including conspirators from outside Mississippi. An additional indictment had been obtained but remained sealed. \n\nIn October 2018, four Louisiana businessmen, including Michael LeBlanc Sr. and his son, Michael Jr., Tawasky L. Ventroy, and Jacque B. Jackson were indicted and arrested on charges of conspiracy, paying bribes and attempting to pay bribes to Epps and Kemper County, Mississippi, Sheriff James Moore. In the month before the Epps and McCrory indictments became public in 2014, LeBlanc Sr. called Epps to confirm Ventroy would meet with Epps. Ventroy brought $2,000 to Epps. LeBlanc Sr. and agreed to give something with a value of $5,000 or more with the intent to have Epps help with the awarding and retaining the contracts for LeBlanc Sr.’s company for inmate commissary services and telephone services with the Kemper County Regional Correctional Facility and elsewhere. Jackson allegedly worked for LeBlanc Jr. to help secure the contracts. After the initial Epps' indictment, bribes were also made to Moore, who was covertly cooperating with the FBI investigation. U.S. Attorney Michael Hurst of the Southern District of Mississippi thanked Moore for \"coming forward and working with us to catch those who violate our corruption laws.”\n\nSims pleaded guilty to interfering with a witness and received a seven-month sentence, plus six months' home confinement. Sims had also been ordered on October 25, 2011, by then-Mississippi State Auditor Stacey Pickering, to repay $31,530 for using city employees and equipment to work on the Correctional Facility and the privately owned Transitional Center. He was released from custody on January 9, 2013.\n\nOn September 15, 2016, Biloxi consultant Robert A. Simmons was sentenced by Judge Sul Ozerden to seven years and three months for his part in the MDOC bribery scandal. A sealed record filed by the U.S. Attorney's office indicated he had provided the government with \"substantial assistance at great risk.\" His cooperation, plus a clean prior record, led the judge to sentence him to less than the nine years required by federal sentencing guidelines. The Department of Justice had initially confronted him with considerable evidence against him, including video and audio recordings, and wiretaps. Simmons had been paid a $10,000 monthly fee by AJA Management & Technical Services Inc. of Jackson, Mississippi, for 18 months as it managed expansions of the Walnut Grove and East Mississippi state prisons. Simmons kicked back a portion of that monthly fee to Chris Epps. Simmons admitted bribing Epps from 2005 to 2014, and Martin from 2005 through 2011. Martin committed suicide just prior to the first hearing on his indictment in February 2015. Simmons is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Forrest City, Arkansas, and his anticipated release date is March 28, 2023.\n\nAfter delaying Epps' sentencing twice, Judge Wingate Wingate also delayed sentencing for Rankin County businessman Cecil McCrory and businessman Sam Waggoner. Sam Waggoner pleaded guilty in August 2015 to a single count of bribery, waiving indictment in a plea bargain. In November his sentencing was postponed due to his undergoing heart surgery. He admitted to Judge Wingate that he paid more than $108,000 in kickbacks to Epps from a consulting contract with prison phone company Global Tel-Link (GTL). GTL had been awarded the Mississippi prison telephone business monopoly. As a result of the prosecutors' efforts to determine the value of the damages suffered by the state of Mississippi as a result of the bribery scheme, Waggoner's sentencing was again delayed. On January 19, 2017, the 62-year-old Waggoner was sentenced to five years in federal prison, with two years of supervised release and a $200,000 fine. He had received 5 percent of phone revenues as a consultant for Global Tel-Link, which provided phone services at Mississippi state prisons. He had told the FBI that before their investigation started, he wrote Epps saying he wanted to end the payments. In a meeting Epps ripped the letter into \"teeny, tiny pieces,\" flushing it down a toilet, telling him their arrangement would continue. Waggoner said: \"He was basically my boss.\" Waggoner paid bribes to Epps from 2012 until at least Aug. 26, 2014. Waggoner is being held at the Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth. His anticipated release date is July 15, 2021.\n\nAmong other persons charged with bribing Epps, Irb Benjamin, a former state legislator and Alcorn County jail warden, pleaded guilty on October 18, 2016. He faced 10 years in prison, plus a fine of up to a quarter-million dollars. Wingate sentenced him to 70 months in prison, fined the former Democratic state representative and senator $100,000, and ordered him to forfeit $260,782. Wingate said the length of his sentence could be reduced, depending on the convictions of others involved. Benjamin, who said he was \"pressured\" by Epps, estimated that he paid the commissioner between $180,000 and $225,000 in cash bribes to secure support for the regional jails. His plea also covered bribes paid for drug and alcohol rehab programs which his company ran under contract to the state. LaMarca told Wingate, \"it's just a matter of time\" until others whom Benjamin informed upon were indicted. Benjamin is being held at the minimum security Federal Correctional Institution, Forrest City, Arkansas, with an anticipated release date of June 13, 2022.\n\nOn August 3, 2016, Longoria, who had been recorded by Epps, pleaded guilty to a single felony count of bribery. He had supplied drug testing urine cups and was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $368,000 and ordered to forfeit $131,000 on February 14, 2017. He is being held at Federal Correctional Institution, Forrest City, Arkansas, with an anticipated release date of September 13, 2021.\n\nOn December 8, 2016, McCrory repeated his request to change his plea, claiming he had received ineffective aid of counsel in April 2015 and had been pressured by the prosecutor. On December 21, 2016, Judge Wingate rejected McCrory's request to withdraw his plea, ruling it had been made with sufficient advice of counsel. In the FBI's first interview with him, McCrory had admitted to laundering $40,000 in cash for Epps; he began wearing a recording device for his conversations with Epps. After being sentenced to 8 1/2 years, on February 3, 2017, McCrory remained free on bail. Judge Wingate said that his time may be reduced after the other defendants in the case are sentenced. He was to report to prison on November 30, 2017, and as of December 17, 2017, McCrory was being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Talladega, Alabama, with an anticipated release date of April 24, 2025.\n\nTheresa Malone's trial was delayed, due to complications resulting from a double lung transplant. On July 17, she changed her plea to guilty of the charges that involved her paying bribes to Epps in return for continuance of the medical services vendor monitoring and Medicaid eligibility contracting which the state had with AdminPros, LLC. Her sentencing is anticipated for September. As of November 30, 2017, Malone was not yet in federal custody.\n\nOn November 1, 2016, while out on bail and awaiting sentencing, Epps was arrested by the Flowood, Mississippi Police Department. He was charged with breaking into his former primary residence, which he had given up to the federal government as part of his plea agreement. He had removed light fixtures and other items. They were recovered at his nearby second home. Appearing in court on November 3, Epps said he had made a \"terrible mistake,\" and wanted only to retrieve some outside floodlights for Halloween. On November 15, 2016, Epps petitioned the court to be allowed release to house arrest. Epps had remained in jail since his November arrest on burglary charges when his bail was revoked. In December 2016, Judge Wingate rejected Epps' requst for home confinement, saying he would be held in jail until his sentencing scheduled for May 2017. On May 24, 2017, Epps was sentenced to 325 months in federal prison. The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, Darren LaMarca, had made a sentence recommendation of 13 years, due to the substantial cooperation Epps provided, which FBI agent Ty Breedlove characterized to the court as one of the best confidential sources in his career. Wingate responded that the gross value of the contracts Epps received kickbacks on was $868 million, characterizing those offenses by saying, \"It's staggering, his criminal conduct.\" By July 2017 he was moved to Federal Correctional Institution, Seagoville in Seagoville, Texas.\n\nJudge Wingate recused himself from trying the Carl Reddix case, which was consequently assigned to Chief Judge Daniel Jordan. In a plea bargain, on May 3, 2017, Reddix, who was accused of paying over $170,000 in bribes, pleaded guilty to a single count of bribery. He was scheduled to be sentenced August 1, 2017, and remained free on $10,000 bail, with his sentencing delayed until September. At issue is the amount of restitution for which he might be liable, with prosecutors seeing payment of $1.27 million. In October, the judge rejected his arguments and required him to pay the full amount requested by prosecutors. Reddix was sentenced by Judge Jordan to 72 months in prison, plus two years of supervised release. He was fined $15,000 and required to forfeit more than $1.2 million. U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said that Reddix had personally made 36 bribe payments to Epps over a three-year period. He reported to prison on January 29, 2018 and is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Butner 1 Medium custody, in North Carolina.\n\nIn April 2017, consultant Michael Goddard pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI regarding a bribe he received from Health Assurance in connection with a jail health care contract for Jefferson County, Alabama. Goddard was scheduled to be sentenced August 2, 2017, and faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Butner Low custody, North Carolina, with a scheduled release date of November 1, 2023.\n\nThe total number of defendants who had pleaded guilty by May 7, 2017, stood at ten.\n\nLaMarca disclosed that six or seven investigations remain open, in Mississippi and Louisiana, and one more indictment has been obtained but remains sealed.\n\nOn February 8, 2017, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood announced he had filed civil cases against 15 corporations and numerous individuals who had engaged in contracts with the MDOC and Epps, seeking damages and punitive damages. Hood said,\n\nThe state of Mississippi has been defrauded through a pattern of bribery, kickbacks, misrepresentations, fraud, concealment, money laundering and other wrongful conduct.\" He continued, \"These individuals and corporations that benefited by stealing from taxpayers must not only pay the state's losses, but state law requires that they must also forfeit and return the entire amount of the contracts paid by the state. We are also seeking punitive damages to punish these conspirators and to deter those who might consider giving or receiving kickbacks in the future.\" Besides Teresa Malone and Carl Reddix, the defendants included Michael Reddix; Andrew Jenkins; Management & Training Corporation; The GEO Group, Inc.; Cornell Companies, Inc.; Wexford Health Sources, Inc.; The Bantry Group Corporation; AdminPros, L.L.C.; CGL Facility Management, LLC; Mississippi Correctional Management, Inc.; Branan Medical Corporation; Drug Testing Corporation; Global Tel*Link Corporation; Health Assurance, LLC; Keefe Commissary Network, LLC of St. Louis; Sentinel Offender Services, L.L.C. and AJA Management & Technical Services, Inc.\n\nOn May 18, 2017, Hood announced that the state had made the first settlement, involving Alere Inc., which had purchased Branan Medical Corporation. Alere paid two million dollars. Eight lawsuits in bribery schemes are pending. They had accused at least 10 individuals and 12 out-of-state corporations of using so-called \"consultants\" to fix more than $800 million in Mississippi prison contracts. Subsequently, two more corporations settled those suits. In November 2017, Sentinel Offender Services LLC, which provides inmate electronic monitoring, settled its case, which had involved a two million dollar contract, for $1.3 million. Hood said his office by that time had retrieved $5.8 million on behalf of Mississippi taxpayers. However, GEO Group, formerly Wackenhut Corrections, which had operated many MDOC prisons between 1994 and 2012, continued to fight the charges. GEO Vice President for corporate relations, Pablo Paez, stated, \"During our entire tenure as a service provider to the State, our company was never aware of or involved in any improprieties within the Mississippi Department of Corrections.\" In February, 2018, Hood cited the Epps corruption when opposing passage of legislation in the state house which would make it more difficult for the state to have remedies for behavior involving fraud or corruption, noting, \"Corporations have just flat got our Legislature doing their bidding.\" He said the bill would, \"protect crooks and scam artists by gutting the Consumer Protection Act. They would not only block future cases, but would also be used to slow down or block late-stage pending cases .\"\n\nAs of February 2015, Epps was still eligible to receive benefits from the state Public Employees' Retirement System.\n\n"}
{"id": "24187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24187", "title": "Prussian Confederation", "text": "Prussian Confederation\n\nThe Prussian Confederation (, ) was an organization formed on 21 February 1440 at Marienwerder by a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 cities in Prussia, to oppose the arbitrariness of the Teutonic Knights. It was based on the basis of an earlier similar organization, the Lizard Union established in 1397 by Chełmno Land nobles. \n\nIn 1454, the leader of the Confederation, Johannes von Baysen (Jan Bażyński), formally asked King Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland as a fief. This marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War between the Order's State and Poland, with the Prussian cities financing the military costs of the latter.\n\nAccording to the 1411 First Peace of Thorn which followed the Teutonic Knights' defeat in the Battle of Grunwald, the Teutonic Order had to pay high reparations to the Kingdom of Poland. The monastic state imposed high taxes on the cities to raise the funds as well as to re-arm for another war against Poland. In the 1420s, Grand Master Paul von Rusdorf brought stability to the Order and its relations, but fighting with Poland resumed in 1431, when the Knight's invasion into Poland during the Lithuanian Civil War sparked another Polish-Teutonic conflict. \n\nAfter about three decades of growing discontent, the Prussian leaders (see Prussian estates) organized themselves to oppose the rule of the order more effectively. On 14 March 1440, a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 Prussian cities, under the leadership of the Hanseatic cities of Danzig (Gdańsk), Elbing (Elbląg), Thorn (Toruń) and Königsberg (Królewiec), founded the Prussian Confederation in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn). Several more towns joined on 3 April, although Bütow (Bytów) did not. In Danzig, the new members signed a document which was kept in the archives of Thorn.\n\nAfter Grand Master Paul von Rusdorf died in 1441, his successor, Konrad von Erlichshausen, continued to negotiate a compromise until his own death in 1449. The confederation lobbied for support against the Teutonic Order within the Holy Roman Empire. Ludwig von Erlichshausen, Grand Master from 1450 to 1467, took a more aggressive stance towards the confederation. He filed a lawsuit at the court of Emperor Friedrich III (Frederick III), whose verdict of 1453 declared the confederation illegal.\n\nIn February 1454, the Prussian Confederation rose against the Teutonic Order's rule. Gabriel von Baysen and Johannes von Baysen, now leading the confederation with the support of Jan de Jani and Mikołaj Szarlejski, both of the Clan of Ostoja, requested the protection of King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland. They also asked for, and received, a guarantee of their continued city rights and privileges for the nobility. \n\nThe resulting Thirteen Years' War ended in the defeat of the Teutonic Order and the 1466 Second Peace of Thorn. The Order lost control of western Prussia. As Royal Prussia, it became a province of Poland, with some local rights of autonomy. Stibor de Poniec of the Clan of Ostoja become Lord of tregality of Malbork. The Teutonic Knights retained eastern Prussia, but only under the overlordship of the Polish king. The Prussian Confederation, with its members now practically divided, ceased to exist as such.\n\nBoth the Polish and Teutonic sides agreed to seek the confirmation of the Second Peace of Thorn from Emperor Frederick III and Pope Paul II, but they also agreed that this confirmation would not be needed for validation of the treaty. Soon after, however, a dispute about the status of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia started a smaller conflict called the War of the Priests.\n\nTowns which founded the Prussian Confederation on 14 March 1440:\n\nTowns which joined the Prussian Confederation on 3 April 1440:\n"}

The resolution was sent to all the agricultural chambers and was adopted by the Canterbury, Lincolnshire, Monmouthshire, Totnes and Worcestershire Chambers as well as the Chester, Holderness, Liverpool and Wadhurst Farmers' Clubs.\n\nOn 26 June 1907, the resolution formed the centre of discussion for a meeting of Secretaries of the various agricultural chambers. They concluded that they were \"strongly of opinion that an Independent Agricultural Party is absolutely necessary and could be formed.\" On 5 November 1907 the Organisational Committee of the Central Chamber of Agriculture produced a report that concluded that they were \"strongly of opinion that the value of such a party as that proposed depends far more on its absolute independence and singleness of aim than on its numerical strength, and recommend that the efforts to establish it shall at first be concentrated on those constituencies whence it would be possible to secure a thoroughly compact and reliable body.\" Jesse Collings supported the report, as in his opinion Parliament was dominated by commercialism and without organisation the representation of agriculture was useless.\n\nAn Agricultural Representation Committee of the Central Chamber of Agriculture produced a similar report on the matter 5 May 1908, coming to the same conclusion that parliamentary representation was necessary. However, the opposition of a small number of members of the Central Chamber of Agriculture meant that a section of paragraph 9 of the Agricultural Representation Committee's report was deleted. This paragraph detailed how a Special Standing Committee, separate to the Chamber, would work to create an Agricultural Party. Following the deletion of this section, the resolution was passed 49 votes to 6. However, the succeeding years the resolution was all but forgotten as members of the Central Chamber of Agriculture turned their attention to national political happenings.\n\nIn October 1923, the idea of an agricultural or rural political party was revived by the prominent agriculturalist Christopher Hatton Turnor at a meeting of the Grantham Farmers' Union. This revival was continued by Sir Herbert Matthews, Secretary of the Central Chamber of Agriculture. It was agreed that the Honorary Secretary of the Party would be Sir Herbert Matthews and the Honorary Treasurer would be Mr George Cooper, a Warwickshire farmer and agricultural writer. In January 1924, Sir Herbert Matthews set out the parliamentary programme for the party.\n\n\nIt was announced that the trustees of the party would be Christopher Hatton Turnor and Colonel C. H. Hoare, a member of a well known banking family. The offices of the party were at Westminster Palace Gardens.\n\nIn January 1924, at a meeting of the Devon Farmers' Union at Exeter, Mr R. R. Robbins, Vice-President of the National Farmers Union, conducted an attack on the idea of a rural or agrarian party. He also disproved the suggestion that landowners, labourers and farmers should unite under a single banner, instead he preferred cooperation when necessary. He asked his audience, \"Does the nation want maximum production and maximum employment, or good farming? The two things are not the same; they are essentially different. Good farming is possible without either subsidies or protection. Good farming means farming on safety first principles. It means cutting one's coat according to one's cloth. It means, under existing world conditions, diminished aggregate production and diminished employment.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "105891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=105891", "title": "Samuel P. Huntington", "text": "Samuel P. Huntington\n\nSamuel Phillips Huntington (April 18, 1927 – December 24, 2008) was an American political scientist, adviser and academic. He spent more than half a century at Harvard University, where he was director of Harvard's Center for International Affairs and the Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professor. During the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Huntington was the White House Coordinator of Security Planning for the National Security Council. He is best known for his 1993 theory, the \"Clash of Civilizations\", of a post-Cold War new world order. He argued that future wars would be fought not between countries, but between cultures, and that Islamic extremism would become the biggest threat to world peace. Huntington is credited with helping to shape U.S. views on civilian-military relations, political development, and comparative government.\n\nHuntington was born on April 18, 1927, in New York City, the son of Dorothy Sanborn (née Phillips), a short-story writer, and Richard Thomas Huntington, a publisher of hotel trade journals. His grandfather was publisher John Sanborn Phillips. He graduated with distinction from Yale University at age 18, served in the U.S. Army, earned his Master's degree from the University of Chicago, and completed his Ph.D. at Harvard University where he began teaching at age 23.\n\nHe was a member of Harvard's department of government from 1950 until he was denied tenure in 1959. Along with Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had also been denied tenure, he moved to Columbia University in New York. From 1959 to 1962 he was an associate professor of government at Columbia, where he was also deputy director of their Institute of War and Peace Studies. Huntington was invited to return to Harvard with tenure in 1963 and remained there until his death. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. Huntington and Warren Demian Manshel co-founded and co-edited \"Foreign Policy\". Huntington stayed as co-editor until 1977.\n\nHis first major book was \"\" (1957), which was highly controversial when it was published, but presently is regarded as the most influential book on American civil-military relations. He became prominent with his \"Political Order in Changing Societies\" (1968), a work that challenged the conventional opinion of modernization theorists, that economic and social progress would produce stable democracies in recently decolonized countries.\n\nHe also was co-author of \"\", a report issued by the Trilateral Commission in 1976. In 1977, his friend Brzezinski – who had been appointed National Security Adviser in the administration of Jimmy Carter – invited him to become White House Coordinator of Security Planning for the National Security Council. He served in this position until the end of 1978.\n\nHuntington continued to teach undergraduates until his retirement in 2007.\n\nHe met his wife, Nancy Arkelyan, when they were working together on a speech for 1956 presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson. They had two sons, Nicholas and Timothy.\n\nAfter several years of declining health, Huntington died on December 24, 2008, at age 81 on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.\n\nDuring 1968, just as the United States' war in Vietnam was becoming most intense, Huntington published \"Political Order in Changing Societies\", which was a critique of the modernization theory which had affected much U.S. policy regarding the developing world during the prior decade.\n\nHuntington argues that, as societies modernize, they become more complex and disordered. If the process of social modernization that produces this disorder is not matched by a process of political and institutional modernization—a process which produces political institutions capable of managing the stress of modernization—the result may be violence.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Huntington was an advisor to governments, both democratic and dictatorial. During 1972, he met with Medici government representatives in Brazil; a year later he published the report \"Approaches to Political Decompression\", warning against the risks of a too-rapid political liberalization, proposing graduated liberalization, and a strong party state modeled upon the image of the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). After a prolonged transition, Brazil became democratic during 1985.\n\nDuring the 1980s, he became a valued adviser to the South African regime, which used his ideas on political order to craft its \"total strategy\" to reform apartheid and suppress growing resistance. He assured South Africa's rulers that increasing the repressive power of the state (which at that time included police violence, detention without trial, and torture) can be necessary to effect reform. The reform process, he told his South African audience, often requires \"duplicity, deceit, faulty assumptions and purposeful blindness.\" He thus gave his imprimatur to his hosts' project of \"reforming\" apartheid rather than eliminating it.\n\nHuntington frequently cited Brazil as a success, alluding to his role in his 1988 presidential address to the American Political Science Association, commenting that political science \"played a modest role in this process\". Critics, such as British political scientist Alan Hooper, note that contemporary Brazil has an especially unstable party system, wherein the best institutionalized party, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's Workers' Party emerged in opposition to controlled-transition. Moreover, Hooper claims that the lack of civil participation in contemporary Brazil results from that top-down process of political participation transitions.\n\nIn his 1991 book, \"\", Huntington made the argument that beginning with Portugal's revolution during 1974, there has been a third wave of democratization which describes a global trend which includes more than 60 countries throughout Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa which have undergone some form of democratic transition. Huntington won the 1992 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for this book.\n\nDuring 1993, Huntington provoked great debate among international relations theorists with the interrogatively-titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\", an influential, oft-cited article published in \"Foreign Affairs\" magazine. In the article, he argued that, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Islam would become the biggest obstacle to Western domination of the world. The West's next big war therefore, he said, would inevitably be with Islam. Its description of post-Cold War geopolitics and the \"inevitability of instability\" contrasted with the influential End of History thesis advocated by Francis Fukuyama.\n\nHuntington expanded \"The Clash of Civilizations?\" to book length and published it as \"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\" in 1996. The article and the book posit that post-Cold War conflict would most frequently and violently occur because of cultural rather than ideological differences. That, whilst in the Cold War, conflict occurred between the Capitalist West and the Communist Bloc East, it now was most likely to occur between the world's major civilizations—identifying seven, and a possible eighth: (i) Western, (ii) Latin American, (iii) Islamic, (iv) Sinic (Chinese), (v) Hindu, (vi) Orthodox, (vii) Japanese, and (viii) African. This cultural organization contrasts the contemporary world with the classical notion of sovereign states. To understand current and future conflict, cultural rifts must be understood, and culture—rather than the State—must be accepted as the reason for war. Thus, Western nations will lose predominance if they fail to recognize the irreconcilable nature of cultural tensions. Huntington argued that this post-Cold War shift in geopolitical organization and structure requires the West to strengthen itself culturally, by abandoning the imposition of its ideal of democratic universalism and its incessant military interventionism. Underscoring this point, Huntington wrote in the 1996 expansion, \"In the emerging world of ethnic conflict and civilizational clash, Western belief in the universality of Western culture suffers three problems: it is false; it is immoral; and it is dangerous.\"\n\nThe identification of Western Civilization with the Western Christianity (Catholic-Protestant) was not Huntington's original idea, it was rather the traditional Western opinion and subdivision before the Cold War era.\n\nCritics (for example articles in \"Le Monde Diplomatique\") call \"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\" the theoretical legitimization of American-caused Western aggression against China and the world's Islamic and Orthodox cultures. Other critics argue that Huntington's taxonomy is simplistic and arbitrary, and does not take account of the internal dynamics and partisan tensions within civilizations. Furthermore, critics argue that Huntington neglects ideological mobilization by elites and unfulfilled socioeconomic needs of the population as the real causal factors driving conflict, that he ignores conflicts that do not fit well with the civilizational borders identified by him, and they charge that his new paradigm is nothing but realist thinking in which \"states\" became replaced by \"civilizations\". Huntington's influence upon U.S. policy has been likened to that of British historian Arnold Toynbee's controversial religious theories about Asian leaders during the early twentieth century.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" obituary on Samuel Huntington notes, however, that his \"emphasis on ancient religious empires, as opposed to states or ethnicities, [as sources of global conflict] gained...more cachet after the Sept. 11 attacks.\"\n\nHuntington wrote that Ukraine might divide along the cultural line between the more Catholic western Ukraine and Orthodox eastern Ukraine:\nWhile a statist approach highlights the possibility of a Russian-Ukrainian war, a civilizational approach minimizes that and instead highlights the possibility of Ukraine splitting in half, a separation which cultural factors would lead one to predict might be more violent than that of Czechoslovakia but far less bloody than that of Yugoslavia.\nHuntington's last book, \"Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity\", was published during May 2004. Its subject is the meaning of American national identity and the possible cultural threat posed to it by large-scale Latino immigration, which Huntington warns could \"divide the United States into two peoples, two cultures, and two languages\".\n\nHuntington is credited with inventing the phrase \"Davos Man\", referring to global elites who \"have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite's global operations\". The phrase refers to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where leaders of the global economy meet.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the South African apartheid government of P.W. Botha became increasingly preoccupied with security. On Huntington's advice, Botha's government established a powerful state security apparatus to \"protect\" the state against an anticipated upsurge in political violence that the reforms were expected to cause. The 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest, with the government becoming increasingly dominated by Botha's circle of generals and police chiefs (known as securocrats), who managed the various States of Emergencies.\n\nIn 1986, Huntington was nominated for membership to the National Academy of Sciences. The entire academy voted on the nomination, although many scientists were unfamiliar with the nominee. Professor Serge Lang, a Yale University mathematician, disturbed this electoral status quo by challenging Huntington's nomination. Lang campaigned for others to deny Huntington membership, and eventually succeeded; Huntington was twice nominated and twice rejected. A detailed description of these events was published by Lang in \"Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case\" which occupies the first 222 pages of his 1998 book \"Challenges\".\n\nLang was inspired by the writings of mathematician Neal Koblitz, who accused Huntington of misusing mathematics and engaging in pseudo-science. Lang claimed that Huntington distorted the historical record and used pseudo-mathematics to make his conclusions seem convincing. As an example he used Huntington's 1968 book \"Political Order in Changing Societies\", in which Huntington argued that South Africa was a \"satisfied society\" in the 1960s. Lang didn't believe the conclusion, so he looked at how Huntington justified this claim and concluded that he used a method which was simply not valid. Lang suspected that he was using false pseudo-mathematical argument to give arguments that he wanted to justify greater authority. It was, said Lang, \"a type of language which gives the illusion of science without any of its substance.\" Lang documents his accusations in his book \"Challenges\".\n\nHuntington’s supporters included Herbert A. Simon, a 1978 laureate of the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The \"Mathematical Intelligencer\" offered Simon and Koblitz an opportunity to engage in a written debate, which they accepted.\n\nHuntington's prominence as a Harvard professor and (as then) director of Harvard's Center for International Affairs led to significant coverage of his defeated nomination to the NAS by the media, including \"The New York Times\" and \"The New Republic\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "738686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=738686", "title": "Separation of powers under the United States Constitution", "text": "Separation of powers under the United States Constitution\n\nSeparation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu in \"The Spirit of the Laws\", in which he argued for a constitutional government with three separate branches, each of which would have defined abilities to check the powers of the others. This philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. This United States form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as Montesquieu advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it. Montesquieu was one of the foremost supporters of separating the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. His writings considerably influenced the opinions of the framers of the United States Constitution.\n\nStrict separation of powers did not operate in the United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSome U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government \"separate and distinct.\"\n\nCongress has the sole power to legislate for the United States. Under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any other agency. In this vein, the Supreme Court held in the 1998 case \"Clinton v. The city of New York\" that Congress could not delegate a \"line-item veto\" to the President, by powers vested in the government by the Constitution.\n\nWhere Congress does not make great and sweeping delegations of its authority, the Supreme Court has been less stringent. One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of non-delegation was \"Wayman v. Southard\" 23 U.S. (10 Wet.) 1, 42 (1825). Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe judicial procedure; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While Chief Justice John Marshall conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between \"important\" subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that \"a general provision may be made, and power is given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details.\"\n\nMarshall's words and future court decisions gave Congress much latitude in delegating powers. It was not until the 1930s that the Supreme Court held a delegation of authority unconstitutional. In a case involving the creation of the National Recovery Administration called \"A.L.A. Schechtes\", 295 U.S. 495 (1935), Congress could not authorize the president to formulate codes of \"fair competition.\" It was held that Congress must set some standards governing the actions of executive officers. The Court, however, has deemed that phrases such as \"just and reasonable,\" \"public interest\" and \"public convenience\" suffice.\n\nExecutive power is vested, with exceptions and qualifications, in the President. By law (Section 2.) the president becomes the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, Militia of several states when called into service, has power to make treaties and appointments to office \"with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,\" receive Ambassadors and Public Ministers, and \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\" (Section 3.) By using these words, the Constitution does not require the president to personally enforce the law; rather, officers subordinate to the president may perform such duties. The Constitution empowers the president to ensure the faithful execution of the laws made by Congress and approved by the President. Congress may itself terminate such appointments, by impeachment, and restrict the president. Bodies such as the War Claims Commission (created by the War Claims Act of 1948), the Interstate Commerce Commission ,and the Federal Trade Commission—all quasi-judicial—often have direct Congressional oversight.\n\nCongress often writes legislation to restrain executive officials to the performance of their duties, as laid out by the laws Congress passes. In \"Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha\" (1983), the Supreme Court decided (a) The prescription for legislative action in Art. I, § 1—requiring all legislative powers to be vested in a Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives—and § 7—requiring every bill passed by the House and Senate, before becoming law, to be presented to the president, and, if he disapproves, to be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House—represents the Framers' decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure. This procedure is an integral part of the constitutional design for the separation of powers. Further rulings clarified the case; even both Houses acting together cannot override Executive vetos without a majority. Legislation may always prescribe regulations governing executive officers.\n\nJudicial power—the power to decide cases and controversies—is vested in the Supreme Court and inferior courts established by Congress. The judges must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, hold office during good behavior and receive compensations that may not be diminished during their continuance in office. If a court's judges do not have such attributes, the court may not exercise the judicial power of the United States. Courts exercising the judicial power are called \"constitutional courts.\"\n\nCongress may establish \"legislative courts,\" which do not take the form of judicial agencies or commissions, whose members do not have the same security of tenure or compensation as the constitutional court judges. Legislative courts may not exercise the judicial power of the United States. In \"Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co.\" (1856), the Supreme Court held that a legislative court may not decide \"a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty,\" as such a suit is inherently judicial. Legislative courts may only adjudicate \"public rights\" questions (cases between the government and an individual and political determinations).\n\nThe president exercises a check over Congress through his power to veto bills, but Congress may override any veto (excluding the so-called \"pocket veto\") by a two-thirds majority in each house. When the two houses of Congress cannot agree on a date for adjournment, the president may settle the dispute. Either house or both houses may be called into emergency session by the president. The Vice President serves as president of the Senate, but he may only vote to break a tie.\n\nThe president, as noted above, appoints judges with the Senate's advice and consent. He also has the power to issue pardons and reprieves. Such pardons are not subject to confirmation by either the House of Representatives or the Senate, or even to acceptance by the recipient. The President is not mandated to carry out the orders of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court does not have any enforcement power; the enforcement power lies solely with the executive branch. Thus, the executive branch can place a check on the Supreme Court through refusal to execute the orders of the court. For example, in \"Worcester v. Georgia\", President Jackson refused to execute the orders of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe president is the civilian Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. He has the authority to command them to take appropriate military action in the event of a sudden crisis. However, only the Congress is explicitly granted the power to declare war per se, as well as to raise, fund and maintain the armed forces. Congress also has the duty and authority to prescribe the laws and regulations under which the armed forces operate, such as the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and requires that all Generals and Admirals appointed by the president be confirmed by a majority vote of the Senate before they can assume their office.\n\nCourts check both the executive branch and the legislative branch through judicial review. This concept is not written into the Constitution, but was envisioned by many of the Constitution's Framers (for example, \"The Federalist Papers\" mention it). The Supreme Court established a precedent for judicial review in \"Marbury v. Madison\". There were protests by some at this decision, born chiefly of political expediency, but political realities in the particular case paradoxically restrained opposing views from asserting themselves. For this reason, precedent alone established the principle that a court may strike down a law it deems unconstitutional.\n\nA common misperception is that the Supreme Court is the only court that may determine constitutionality; the power is exercised even by the inferior courts. But only Supreme Court decisions are binding across the nation. Decisions of a Court of Appeals, for instance, are binding only in the circuit over which the court has jurisdiction.\n\nThe power to review the constitutionality of laws may be limited by Congress, which has the power to set the jurisdiction of the courts. The only constitutional limit on Congress' power to set the jurisdiction of the judiciary relates to the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court may exercise only appellate jurisdiction except in cases involving states and cases affecting foreign ambassadors, ministers or consuls.\n\nThe Chief Justice presides in the Senate during a president's impeachment trial. The rules of the Senate, however, generally do not grant much authority to the presiding officer. Thus, the Chief Justice's role in this regard is a limited one.\n\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, decided in 1819, established two important principles. One of which explains that states cannot make actions to impede on valid constitutional exercises of power by the federal government. The other explains that Congress has the implied powers to implement the express powers written in the Constitution to create a functional national government. All three branches of the US government have certain powers and those powers relate to the other branches of government. One of these powers is called the express powers. These powers are expressly given, in the Constitution, to each branch of government. Another power is the implied powers. These powers are those that are necessary to perform expressed powers. There are also inherent and concurrent powers. Inherent powers are those that are not found in the Constitution yet the different branches of government can still exercise them. Concurrent powers are those that are given to both state and federal governments. There are also powers that are not lined out in the Constitution that are given to the federal government. These powers are then given to the states in a system called federalism. \nCongress is one of the branches of government so it has a lot of powers of its own that it uses to pass laws and establish regulations. These include express, implied, and concurrent powers. It uses its express powers to regulate bankruptcies, business between states and other nations, the armed forces, and the National Guard or militia. They also establish all laws necessary and proper for carrying out other powers. In addition to this Congress makes laws for naturalization. Implied powers are used to keep the regulation of taxes, the draft, immigration, protection of those with disabilities, minimum wage, and outlaw discrimination. Congress’s inherent powers are used to control national borders, deal with foreign affairs, acquire new territories, defend the state from revolution, and decide the exclusion or establishment of aliens. Concurrent powers makes it so that both federal and state governments can create laws, deal with environmental protection, maintain national parks and prisons, and provide a police force. \nThe judicial branch of government holds powers as well. They have the ability to use express and concurrent powers to make laws and establish regulations. They use express powers to interpret laws and perform judicial review. Implied powers are used by this branch to declare laws that were previously passed by a lower court unconstitutional. They can also use express powers to declare laws that are in the process of being passed unconstitutional. Concurrent powers are used to make it so that state courts can conduct trials and interpret laws without the approval of federal courts and federal courts can hear appeals form lower state courts. \nThe executive branch also has powers of its own that they use to make laws and establish regulations. The powers that are used in this branch are express, implied, and inherent. The President uses express powers to approve and veto bills and to make treaties as well. The President is constitutionally obligated to make sure that laws are faithfully executed and uses their powers to do just this. He uses implied powers to issue executive orders and enter into treaties with foreign nations. The executive branch uses inherent powers to establish executive privilege, which means that they can enforce statutes and laws already passed by Congress. They can also enforce the Constitution and treaties that were previously made by other branches of government. \n\nThe Constitution does not explicitly indicate the pre-eminence of any particular branch of government. However, James Madison wrote in Federalist 51, regarding the ability of each branch to defend itself from actions by the others, that \"it is not possible to give to each department an equal power of self-defense. In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates.\"\n\nOne may claim that the judiciary has historically been the weakest of the three branches. In fact, its power to exercise judicial review—its sole meaningful check on the other two branches—is not explicitly granted by the U.S Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court exercised its power to strike down congressional acts as unconstitutional only twice prior to the Civil War: in \"Marbury v. Madison\" (1803) and \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857). The Supreme Court has since then made more extensive use of judicial review.\n\nThroughout America's history dominance of one of the three branches has essentially been a see-saw struggle between Congress and the president. Both have had periods of great power and weakness such as immediately after the Civil War when republicans had a majority in Congress and were able to pass major legislation and shoot down most of the president's vetoes. They also passed acts to essentially make the president subordinate to Congress, such as the Tenure of Office Act. Johnson's later impeachment also cost the presidency much political power. However the president has also exercised greater power largely during the 20th century. Both Roosevelts greatly expanded the powers of the president and wielded great power during their terms.\n\nThe first six presidents of the United States did not make extensive use of the veto power: George Washington only vetoed two bills, James Monroe one, and John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams none. James Madison, a firm believer in a strong executive, vetoed seven bills. None of the first six Presidents, however, used the veto to direct national policy. It was Andrew Jackson, the seventh President, who was the first to use the veto as a political weapon. During his two terms in office, he vetoed 12 bills—more than all of his predecessors combined. Furthermore, he defied the Supreme Court in enforcing the policy of ethnically cleansing Native American tribes (\"Indian Removal\"); he stated (perhaps apocryphally), \"John Marshall has made his decision. Now let him enforce it!\"\n\nSome of Jackson's successors made no use of the veto power, while others used it intermittently. It was only after the Civil War that presidents began to use the power to truly counterbalance Congress. Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, vetoed several Reconstruction bills passed by the \"Radical Republicans.\" Congress, however, managed to override fifteen of Johnson's twenty-nine vetoes. Furthermore, it attempted to curb the power of the presidency by passing the Tenure of Office Act. The Act required Senate approval for the dismissal of senior Cabinet officials. When Johnson deliberately violated the Act, which he felt was unconstitutional (Supreme Court decisions later vindicated such a position), the House of Representatives impeached him; he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.\n\nJohnson's impeachment was perceived to have done great damage to the presidency, which came to be almost subordinate to Congress. Some believed that the president would become a mere figurehead, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives becoming a \"de facto\" prime minister. Grover Cleveland, the first Democratic President following Johnson, attempted to restore the power of his office. During his first term, he vetoed over 400 bills—twice as many bills as his 21 predecessors combined. He also began to suspend bureaucrats who were appointed as a result of the patronage system, replacing them with more \"deserving\" individuals. The Senate, however, refused to confirm many new nominations, instead demanding that Cleveland turn over the confidential records relating to the suspensions. Cleveland steadfastly refused, asserting, \"These suspensions are my executive acts ... I am not responsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to submit my actions to them for judgment.\" Cleveland's popular support forced the Senate to back down and confirm the nominees. Furthermore, Congress finally repealed the controversial Tenure of Office Act that had been passed during the Johnson Administration. Overall, this meant that Cleveland's Administration marked the end of presidential subordination.\n\nSeveral 20th-century presidents have attempted to greatly expand the power of the presidency. Theodore Roosevelt, for instance, claimed that the president was permitted to do whatever was not explicitly prohibited by the law—in direct contrast to his immediate successor, William Howard Taft. Franklin Delano Roosevelt held considerable power during the Great Depression. Congress had granted Franklin Roosevelt sweeping authority; in \"Panama Refining v. Ryan\", the Court for the first time struck down a Congressional delegation of power as violative of the doctrine of separation of powers. The aforementioned \"Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States\", another separation of powers case, was also decided during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency. In response to many unfavorable Supreme Court decisions, Roosevelt introduced a \"Court Packing\" plan, under which more seats would be added to the Supreme Court for the president to fill. Such a plan (which was defeated in Congress) would have seriously undermined the judiciary's independence and power.\n\nRichard Nixon used national security as a basis for his expansion of power. He asserted, for example, that \"the inherent power of the President to safeguard the security of the nation\" authorized him to order a wiretap without a judge's warrant. Nixon also asserted that \"executive privilege\" shielded him from all legislative oversight; furthermore, he impounded federal funds (that is to say, he refused to spend money that Congress had appropriated for government programs). In the specific cases aforementioned, however, the Supreme Court ruled against Nixon. This was also because of an ongoing criminal investigation into the Watergate tapes, even though they acknowledged the general need for executive privilege. Since then, Nixon's successors have sometimes asserted that they may act in the interests of national security or that executive privilege shields them from Congressional oversight. Though such claims have in general been more limited than Nixon's, one may still conclude that the presidency's power has been greatly augmented since the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nMany political scientists believe that separation of powers is a decisive factor in what they see as a limited degree of American exceptionalism. In particular, John W. Kingdon made this argument, claiming that separation of powers contributed to the development of a unique political structure in the United States. He attributes the unusually large number of interest groups active in the United States, in part, to the separation of powers; it gives groups more places to try to influence, and creates more potential group activity. He also cites its complexity as one of the reasons for lower citizen participation.\n\nSeparation of powers has again become a current issue of some controversy concerning debates about judicial independence and political efforts to increase the accountability of judges for the quality of their work, avoiding conflicts of interest, and charges that some judges allegedly disregard procedural rules, statutes, and higher court precedents.\n\nMany legislators hold the view that separation of powers means that powers are shared among different branches; no one branch may act unilaterally on issues (other than perhaps minor questions), but must obtain some form of agreement across branches. That is, it is argued that \"checks and balances\" apply to the Judicial branch as well as to the other branches—for example, in the regulation of attorneys and judges, and the establishment by Congress of rules for the conduct of federal courts, and by state legislatures for state courts. Although in practice these matters are delegated to the Supreme Court, the Congress holds these powers and delegates them to the Supreme Court only for convenience in light of the Supreme Court's expertise, but can withdraw that delegation at any time.\n\nOn the other side of this debate, many judges hold the view that separation of powers means that the Judiciary is independent and untouchable within the judicial sphere. In this view, separation of powers means that the Judiciary alone holds all powers relative to the judicial function and that the Legislative and Executive branches may not interfere in any aspect of the Judicial branch. An example of the second view at the state level is found in the Florida Supreme Court holding that only the Florida Supreme Court may license and regulate attorneys appearing before the courts of Florida, and only the Florida Supreme Court may set rules for procedures in the Florida courts. The State of New Hampshire also follows this system.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4098911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4098911", "title": "Sonderaktion 1005", "text": "Sonderaktion 1005\n\nThe Sonderaktion\" 1005 (), also called Aktion\" 1005, or \"Enterdungsaktion\" () began in May 1942 during World War II to hide any evidence that people had been murdered by Nazi Germany in \"Aktion Reinhard\" in occupied Poland. The operation, which was conducted in strict secrecy from 1942–1944, used prisoners to exhume mass graves and burn the bodies. These work groups were officially called \"Leichenkommandos\" (\"corpse units\") and were all part of \"Sonderkommando\" 1005; inmates were often put in chains in order to prevent escape.\n\nIn May 1943, the operation moved into occupied territories in Eastern and Central Europe to destroy evidence of the Final Solution. \"Sonderaktion 1005\" was used to conceal the evidence of massacres committed by \"SS-Einsatzgruppen\" Nazi death squads that had massacred millions of people including 1.3 million Jews according to Historian Raul Hilberg, as well as Roma and local civilians. The \"Aktion\" was overseen by selected squads from the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" and \"Ordnungspolizei\".\n\nIn March 1942, \"SS-Obergruppenführer\" Reinhard Heydrich placed \"SS-Standartenführer\" Paul Blobel in charge of the \"Aktion\" 1005, though its start was delayed after Heydrich was assassinated in June 1942. It was after the end of June that \"SS-Gruppenführer\" Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo finally gave Blobel his orders. While the principal aim was to erase evidence of Jewish exterminations, the \"Aktion\" would also include non-Jewish victims of Nazi \"Einsatzgruppen\".\n\nBlobel began his work experimenting at Chełmno (Kulmhof). Attempts to use incendiary bombs to destroy exhumed bodies were unsuccessful as the weapons set fire to nearby forests. The most effective way was eventually found to be giant pyres on iron grills. The method involved building alternating layers of corpses and firewood on railway tracks. Afterwards remaining bone fragments could be crushed by pounding with heavy dowels or in a grinding machine and then re-buried in pits. The operation officially began at Sobibór extermination camp. The \"Leichenkommando\" exhumed the bodies from mass graves around the camp and then burned them, after which task the workers were executed. The process then moved to Bełżec in November 1942. The Auschwitz and Majdanek camps had crematoria with furnace rooms on site to dispose of the bodies, therefore the \"Aktion\" 1005 commandos were not needed there. Surplus corpses were burned by their own prisoners \"(pictured)\". \nThe semi-industrial incineration of corpses at the Treblinka extermination camp began as soon as the political danger associated with the earlier burials was realized. In 1943, the 22,000 Polish victims of the Soviet Katyn massacre were discovered near Smolensk in Russia and reported to Adolf Hitler. Their remains were well preserved underground, attesting to the Soviet mass murder. By April 1943, the Nazi propaganda began to draw attention of the international community to this war crime. The Katyn Commission was formed to make detailed examinations in an effort to drive a wedge between the Allies. Meanwhile, the secret orders to exhume mass graves and burn the hundreds of thousands of victims instead came directly from the Nazi leadership in April. The corpses that had been buried at Treblinka with the use of a crawler excavator were dug up and cremated on the orders of Heinrich Himmler himself, who visited the camp in March 1943. The instructions to utilise rails as grates came from \"Scharführer\" Herbert Floss, the camp's cremation expert. The bodies were placed on cremation pyres that were up to long, with rails laid across the pits on concrete blocks. They were splashed with petrol over wood, and burned in one massive blaze attended by roughly 300 prisoners who operated the pyres. In Bełżec, the round-the-clock operation lasted until March 1943. In Treblinka, it went on at full speed until the end of July.\n\nThe operation also returned to the scenes of earlier mass killings such as Babi Yar, Ponary, the Ninth Fort, as well as Bronna Góra. By 1944, with Soviet armies advancing, \"SS-Obergruppenführer\" Wilhelm Koppe, head of the \"Reichsgau Wartheland\" ordered that each of the five districts of General Government territory set up its own Aktion 1005 commando to begin \"cleaning\" mass graves. The operations were not entirely successful as the advancing Soviet troops reached some of the sites before they could be cleared.\n\nAt the Nuremberg Trials after World War II, a deputy of Adolf Eichmann, \"SS-Hauptsturmführer\" Dieter Wisliceny gave the following testimony regarding \"Aktion\" 1005.\n\nBlobel was sentenced to death by the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal in the \"Einsatzgruppen\" Trial. He was hanged at Landsberg Prison on June 8, 1951. Nearly 60,000 deaths are attributable to Blobel though during testimony at Nuremberg he alleged he only killed between 10,000–15,000 people.\n\nThe prosecution at the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 attempted to prove that Eichmann was Blobel's superior, but the court did not accept it. Blobel's superior was in fact Heinrich Müller.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8173330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8173330", "title": "The Soldier and the State", "text": "The Soldier and the State\n\nThe Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations is a 1957 book written by political scientist Samuel P. Huntington. In the book, Huntington advances the theory of objective civilian control, according to which the optimal means of asserting control over the armed forces is to professionalize them. This is in contrast to subjective control, which involves placing legal and institutional restrictions on the military's autonomy. Edward M. Coffman has written that \"[a]nyone seriously interested in American military history has to come to terms with Samuel P. Huntington's \"The Soldier and the State.\"\n\nIn the first chapter titled \"Officership as a Profession\", Huntington immediately states his thesis of the book. The purpose is to describe how the \"modern officer corps is a professional body and the modern officer a professional man.\" Additionally, \"Officership as a Profession\", Huntington defines qualities of a profession and argues that the officer corps conforms to this definition. The qualities of a profession are (1) Expertise, (2) Responsibility, and (3) Corporateness. Specifically, the officer corps display specialized knowledge in the management of violence, maintains a monopoly on education and advancement in their field, and have an overarching responsibility to the society they serve and thus do not 'compete' in the open market. The military profession requires comprehensive study and training, and thus expertise, of an intellectual set of skills: organizing of forces, planning of activities, and executing and directing activities. The military expertise, the management of violence, includes the science of war and combat as well as organizational and administrative skills. The specializations of the military profession expands far and wide since there are engineers, pilots, mechanics, ordinance experts, and more. Huntington argues this 'professional ethic' differentiates 'officers' from amateur groups engaged in violence (reservists, mercenaries, technical specialists, etc.). Huntington stresses that 'professionalism' entails a mutually binding relationship between society and its 'professionals.' The military profession requires that military officers fulfill its duties to its country by compliance with political officials running the state and government. It is the responsibility of the military to provide the public good of common defense since it acts as an agent to the principal government and citizenry. However, each step up in the hierarchy within the military profession demands more responsibility and skill because they are authorized to make more strategic decisions. In the case of the officer corps, officers are entrusted with evaluating the security of the state and providing expert advice to its leaders, and society in turn must afford a measure of deference to their professional expertise and institutions. (Huntington highlights the fact that the President cannot usurp the military hierarchy and appoint a lieutenant to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff). Additionally Huntington argues the officership displays a decidedly 'corporate character' as the officers tend to: live apart from general society, delineate hierarchy by specific uniforms and insignia, and maintain a strict separation (within the Department of Defense) from lay people who merely 'administer violence' (reservists). Corporateness refers to the distinct and unique features specific to a profession that which separate it from other professions. Entrance to the profession is restricted with high standards and fulfillment, military academia, and ranks.\n\nChapter two outlines the “rise of the military profession in Western society.” He describes that the officer corps consisted of mercenaries from the breakdown of feudalism until their replacement by aristocratic officers after the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) and why neither the mercenaries nor aristocrats were professionals under his definition. Finally in the 19th century the idea of the aristocratic military genius was replaced by the Prussian reliance upon “average men succeeding by superior education, organization and experience.” \n\nChapter three discusses the military mind and military professional ethic. He notes misconceptions regarding the military mind and seeks \"to elaborate the professional military ethic with respect to (1) basic values and perspectives, (2) national military policy, (3) the relation of the military to the state.\" He summarizes the ethic as \"conservative realism...It exalts obedience as the highest virtue of military men. The military ethic is thus pessimistic, collectivist, historically inclined, power-oriented, nationalistic, militaristic, pacifist, and instrumentalist in its view of the military profession.\" \n\nChapter four is a discussion of civil-military relations in theory. He defines subjective civilian control (where military professionalism is reduced due to co-opting of the military by civilian political groups) and objective civilian control - where military professional thrives as it is far removed from politics. He describes the effect of four ideologies (liberalism, fascism, Marxism, conservatism) on military professionalism and civilian control.\n\nChapter five analyzes the military professional in the German and Japanese societies where it became dominant as militarism. He states that, \"no country has had a wider variety of experiences in civil-military relations than modern Germany\", with its officer corps achieving unmatched \"high standards of professionalism\" and then being \"completely prostituted\" under Nazism. He details the varying situations of the imperial, World War I, republican, and Nazi periods. In contrast, \"Japanese civil-military relations remained in a single relatively stable pattern from 1868 to 1945\" where the \"military played a persistently active role in the politics of their country.\" He argues that \"in both countries the disruption of the civil-military balance reflected more basic constitutional disorders\" and \"that disruption helped undermine the nation's security: distorting the perspective and judgment of soldiers and statesmen.\" \n\nChapter six describes the military in the traditional liberal American political context in four sections: liberalism and the Constitution as historical constants of American civil-military relations, the prevalence of liberalism in the U.S., the liberal approach to military affairs, and the military hero in liberal politics. He details how \"the American liberal approach to military affairs was hostile, static and dominant; the conservative approach of the Federalists and the South sympathetic, constructive and thwarted.\" The elements of American liberalism which influenced international relations \"were (1) its indifference to international affairs, (2) its application of domestic solutions to international affairs, and (3) its search for objectivity in international affairs.\" He also states that \"the United States, by virtue of its noninvolvement in the balance of power was able to pursue foreign policy objectives defined in terms of universal ideals rather than in terms of national interests.\" He discusses the \"hostile image of the military profession\" and \"liberal military policy\". He argues that the non-professional military hero was traditionally welcomed in liberal America while the professional military hero was generally not successful politically.\n\nChapter seven explains the structure of civil-military relations provided by the conservative U.S. constitution and civil control of the military.\n\nChapter eight outlines the American military tradition up to the Civil War.\n\nChapter nine is “The Creation of the American Military Profession”. It outlines the contributions of key individuals and institutions and describes the origins of the American military mind.\n\nChapter ten covers the period 1890 to 1920, including “Neo-Hamiltonism”, Alfred Mahan and Leonard Wood.\n\nChapter eleven covers interwar civil-military relations and the military ethic of the period.\n\nChapter twelve covers World War II.\n\nChapter thirteen outlines civil-military relations in the first decade after World War II.\n\nChapter fourteen is “The Political Roles of the Joint Chiefs.”\n\nChapter fifteen describes the impact of the separation of powers on civil-military relations during the Cold War.\n\nChapter sixteen analyzes the Cold War structure of the Defense Department in the context of civil-military relations.\n\nChapter seventeen discusses the challenges faced by the heightened ongoing defense needs of the Cold War versus the tradition of American liberalism and the move “Towards a New Equilibrium” between the two.\n"}
{"id": "28362175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28362175", "title": "Tropico 4", "text": "Tropico 4\n\nTropico 4 is a Simulator video game that combines city management and political manipulation. The game was developed by Haemimont Games and published by Kalypso Media. Like the first and third games in the series, it centers on a customizable main character titled \"El Presidente\" – the dictator who runs the island banana republic. The Mac OS X version of the game (Tropico 4: Gold Edition, which includes the Modern Times expansion pack) was released by Feral Interactive on July 25, 2013, as well as DLC packs \"Dash for Growth\" and \"Captain of Industry\". DLC pack \"State of Emergency\" was released by Feral on April 3, 2014.\n\n\"Tropico 4\" includes added support for Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe game has 10 preconfigured maps, but the player can make their own island by choosing \"Random Island\". Upon choosing a random island, a player may customize the size of the island, vegetation, mineral deposits, and elevation, as well as other game parameters. There are various expansion packs which will also give access to more islands. \n\nAfter choosing the island, the player may choose an avatar, or they can make their own avatar. In customize characters, players may choose: gender, costumes, skin tone, hat, hairstyle, accessories, mustache, beard, earrings, traits, quality, and rise to power. After completing one mission, the character's current traits will level up.\n\nAs El Presidente, the player can see in every citizen's needs, happiness, skills, thoughts and political ideology. The demands of Tropicans include food, health, leisure, and faith. These are fulfilled by erecting specific buildings, for example: If the citizens demand leisure the player must try to build a pub, restaurant, movie theater, or some other form of entertainment. Each individual citizen has a unique set of characteristics that influences their motivation, priorities and actions.\n\nA citizen unable to satisfy their needs will become unhappy and may protest peacefully, become a criminal or join the rebels. Individual protesters negatively affect nearby citizens' respect for El Presidente, potentially influencing the next election; the player loses the game if El Presidente loses an election. As a group, rebels will periodically attack and attempt to destroy buildings; if they destroy the palace, the game is lost. Palace guards and an army are needed to defend against rebel attacks. \n\nThere are a variety of factions in Tropico as well, each influencing the player's strategy. Tropicans join factions in different ways: some will fanatically support one faction, some are less fanatical but remain loyal, some switch sides according to situation, and some do not prefer to join certain factions or any faction at all. Appealing to the factions' needs is crucial to keeping the population under control and avoiding being overthrown, be it by a coup d'état or by losing one of the elections held occasionally. However, some factions' policies and demands conflict with those of others.\n\nThe game's campaign consists of 20 missions spread over 10 different maps. They start out with the player character, \"El Presidente,\" having seized control of the island of Tropico. Imports can be monitored as well as exports (whereas the previous games in the series only allowed for coverage on exports). \"Tropico 4\" includes more superpowers. A council of ministers exists with which the player can consult on a range of different issues. The player will have to deal with natural disasters and the demands of different political factions each with its own ideological outlook.\n\nThe game has a variety of humorous elements including running satirical commentary by fictional radio station Tropico News Today, and subtle touches such as liaisons between priests and cabaret girls. The \"loading\" and \"saving\" screens have quotes from various dictators, leaders, politicians, and revolutionaries such as Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx, John F. Kennedy, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Augusto Pinochet, Nikita Khrushchev, Leon Trotsky, Mobutu Sese Seko, Todor Zhivkov, Vladimir Putin, Josip Broz Tito, Muammar Gaddafi, Ferdinand Marcos, Imelda Marcos and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It, like its predecessors, features a Latin soundtrack, this time drawn mainly from the albums \"Elementos\" and \"Oñejo\" by Alex Torres and His Orchestra.\n\nCapitalists are the wealthy and enterprising people of the island. Naturally, their agenda pits them against the communists. They respect a low crime rate, charging for housing, and having a diverse and competitive economy. They are led by Antonio Lopez, a wealthy opportunist who promotes the sale of dangerous products and even sells firearms to the rebels for a quick buck. If the Capitalists' demands are not being met, they will resort to thievery to make money and will steal a portion of all income.\n\nCommunists are the largest faction more concerned about the quality of housing and healthcare on the island. Comrade Vasquez, their leader, is an eccentric who frequently spouts communist slogans. In the event that the Communists become upset, rebels from Cuba will begin to infiltrate your island and fight against your regime.\n\nIntellectuals are more progressive, contrary to the more conservative Religious faction and the Spartan Militarists. They are led by Miss Pineapple, who is also el Presidente's lover and a cabaret dancer. The Intellectuals prefer edicts that benefit the educational sector, and are easily agitated by some others, especially book burning, which will drive them away. Upsetting the Intellectuals will cause student protests, making it so no Tropicans graduate from High Schools or Colleges.\n\nThe Religious are a conservative Catholic faction led by Reverend Estaban, a drunkard who uses rum during his sermons to worship God. They are very concerned about faith among Tropicans, and building churches and cathedrals increase their influence. If the Religious faction is upset, priests and bishops will speak against you, spreading dissent among any who attend sermons on the island.\n\nMilitarists are interested in the defense of Tropico. They are quite sizeable, and lack of support might result in rebellions, terrorist attacks or invasions. General Rodriguez leads the militarists. The militarists are mostly detractors of the intellectuals, and are thus mostly illiterate. Low wages for soldiers may cause the Militarists to stage a coup.\n\nEnvironmentalists strive to preserve the natural beauty of Tropico. Led by the hippie Sunny Flowers, an anchorwoman and conspiracy theorist, they oppose any efforts to scar the environment, even for economic purposes like logging and mining, and thus are opponents of the Capitalists. Passing anti-pollution laws appeases them. If not appeased, Environmentalists will attempt to blockade your industrial buildings.\n\nNationalists are in charge of caring for and preserving the Tropican people and their customs. They generally oppose immigrants, who, according to leader el Diablo, a violent skinhead, take lucrative jobs away from Tropicans. They will oppose any foreign-friendly policies and are at loggerheads with Communists and Capitalists. When ignored, Nationalists will start riots on the island. These riots quickly escalate into battles between Tropicans and immigrants.\n\nLoyalists are a faction who are always loyal to el Presidente. They are led by El Presidente's personal advisor, Penultimo. Most of their members have below average intelligence and have been brainwashed with all the propaganda beautifying el Presidente. They will never rebel; in return they demand that el Presidente act like a \"true leader,\" shun democracy, and cultivate his image through facilities such as a museum dedicated to el Presidente's childhood.\n\nThe game follows the protagonist, El Presidente, as he works towards restoring the power that he lost in the Caribbean after averting a nuclear war perpetrated by the US vice president in order to rise to power. It is divided into three acts:\n\nEl Presidente arrives at his new island where he begins his goal to build an ideal nation for his people. To do so, he focuses his administration on several islands, developing the economic potential of each one, until he is ousted from power after being framed for the murder of the current US president. He is then forced to flee his country and heads off to other parts of Tropico.\n\nForced to take a new identity and flee his republic, El Presidente begins his revenge by establishing a base of power at Isla Oscura. There El Presidente learns that he was victim of a conspiracy involving Keith Preston, the CEO of Fruitas Inc. (a parody of the United Fruit Company), the rebel leader Marco Moreno (a parody of Che Guevara), UN Inspector Brunhilde Van Hoof (a parody of Margaret Thatcher) and his former mentor Generalissimo Santana (a parody of Fidel Castro). After enacting his revenge on the conspirators and clearing his name, El Presidente regains his position as rightful ruler of Tropico.\n\nReinstated into power, El Presidente focuses on rebuilding his nation, until his former enemies reappear and sell him information about the true mastermind behind his downfall, the US Vice President Nick Richards (a parody of Richard Nixon), who had the US president killed to assume his place. Around this time, perestroika hits the USSR and Tropico offers their assistance to the nation in exchange for evidence incriminating Nick Richards that leads to his demise. El Presidente then puts the final touches to make Tropico a powerful and prosperous nation.\n\nThe game was announced in the middle of August 2010 in a press release by publisher Kalypso Media. \"Tropico 4\" was released on both Xbox 360 and PC, as was predecessor \"Tropico 3\". Unlike its predecessors, \"Tropico 4\" can be played through the Onlive platform.\n\nAn expansion, titled \"Modern Times\", was released on March 27, 2012. It features a new single-player campaign which takes place a year after the events of Tropico 4. After El Presidente's success in rebuilding Tropico, he leaves on a well deserved vacation, only to find when he returns that his lackey Penultimo has predictably run the entire nation into the ground amid the 2008 economic crisis. While working to put the country back on track, El Presidente crosses paths with the elusive shadow organization \"The Conclave,\" and it's up to him to help save the world again while lining his pockets.\n\n\"Modern Times\" also adds a timeline element, where real-world historical events affect gameplay. In addition, new buildings are introduced in accordance to the timeline.\n\nOn December 15, the first of many DLC packs was released, titled \"Junta\". Since then, several more DLC packs have been released, including \"Plantador\", \"Quick Dry Cement\", \"Pirate Heaven\", \"Megalopolis\", \"Vigilante\", \"Voodoo\", \"Propaganda!\", \"The Academy\" and the most recent DLC, \"Apocalypse\". Each DLC pack includes new buildings, a new island, a new mission, a new trait, and, depending on the DLC, new clothing options for El Presidente and new decor. The DLC \"Modern Times\" also modernizes the gameplay adding in events and such which would have happened slightly earlier or during the present day.\n\nA demo version was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace and Steam. It contains 4 tutorial missions and 1 campaign mission. Many buildings are not available for construction.\n\nThe game has received generally positive reviews and holds a 78/100 score on Metacritic based on 46 reviews for the PC version and 77/100 based on 18 reviews for the Xbox 360 version. Most critics had praised the title for its addictive gameplay, great sense of humor and the excess of variety. However, a number of reviews had cited \"Tropico 4\" as bearing too many similarities to its predecessor, as well as a lack of innovation. \"GameSpot\" commented that \"Tropico 4 is a likeable and engaging sequel that expands on its predecessor but doesn't offer much new depth.\" \"IGN\" stated that \"if you’re the type that's spent hours with the likes of Civilization or SimCity, or has an unhealthy need to be in control, then it’s time to become El Presidente.\"\n"}
{"id": "482540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=482540", "title": "United Farmers of Alberta", "text": "United Farmers of Alberta\n\nThe United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) is an association of Alberta farmers that has served different roles in its 100-year history – as a lobby group, a successful political party, and as a farm-supply retail chain. As a political party, it formed the government of Alberta from 1921 to 1935.\n\nSince 1935, it has primarily been an agricultural supply cooperative headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. , UFA operates 35 farm and ranch supply stores in Alberta, over 110 fuel stations in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, and 25 outdoor adventure sporting goods stores in Western Canada and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nUFA was founded in 1909 as a government lobby group following a merger between the Alberta Farmers' Association and Alberta branches of the Canadian Society for Equity. The UFA began as a non-partisan organization whose aim was to be a lobby group promoting the interest of farmers in the province. In 1913, under president William John Tregillus, the UFA successfully pressured Alberta's Liberal government to organize the Alberta Farmers' Cooperative Elevator Company (AFCEC), which joined with other Prairie elevator companies to eventually become the United Grain Growers.\nTregillus was the first president of the AFCEC.\n\nThe UFA was a believer in the co-operative movement and supported women's suffrage. In 1912 women founded the parallel United Farm Women of Alberta, and in 1914, women were granted full membership rights in UFA itself.\n\nBy 1920, UFA had become the most influential lobby group in Alberta with over 30,000 registered members.\n\nUnder pressure of losing influence to the upstart Alberta Non-Partisan League – which ran in four rural constituencies in the 1917 provincial election, winning two – and dissatisfied with the existing political parties, UFA entered the political arena in 1919. Some prominent UFA members (including its president, Henry Wise Wood) at first opposed entering into direct politics, as opposed to lobbying, however, because they thought abandoning the UFA's non-partisan policy would cause the UFA to break up.\n\nIn 1919, the UFA won a by-election in the Cochrane constituency. In 1921, Robert Gardiner won a seat in a federal by-election, becoming UFA's first Member of Parliament. \nEncouraged by this, UFA ran in 45 of Alberta's 61 ridings in the 1921 provincial election. To the surprise of nearly everyone, including themselves, UFA took 38 seats in the election, winning a majority government, and sweeping the Liberals out of power after almost 16 years. UFA and Progressive party candidates also captured all but two of the Alberta federal seats in the 1921 federal election (the other two were taken by Labour candidates).\n\nAs was the case with other United Farmer governments in Manitoba and Ontario, the UFA was elected unexpectedly and without a leader. To form its cabinet it went outside the Legislature to recruit a Premier, as did the other United Farmer governments. The UFA even approached Liberal leader Charles Stewart to remain as premier. Stewart declined, however, not wanting to lead the assembly as a member of the opposition. UFA President Henry Wise Wood also declined, and Vice-President Percival Baker, an elected MLA, died 24 hours after the election. Ultimately, UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield was named the first UFA Premier. Among his cabinet were Irene Parlby, the second female cabinet minister in the British Empire, and Calgary Labour Party MLA Alex Ross as Minister of Public Works.\n\nThe United Farmers government initiated several reforms, including improving medical care, broadening labour rights and making the tax system fairer. It made good on its promise of electoral reform, bringing in a measure of proportional representation through the STV. In 1923, the government formed the Alberta Wheat Pool and upset some of its support base by ending Prohibition, replacing it with open sale of alcohol through government-owned liquor stores and carefully regulated beer parlours, and refusing to establish a provincial bank, a bank owned by the provincial government, despite UFA conventions calling for it.\n\nIn 1925, John E. Brownlee, who was already widely believed to be the \"true\" leader of the United Farmers, succeeded Greenfield as Premier. Brownlee led the party to a second majority government in the 1926 election.\n\nIn 1929, after years of negotiating, Brownlee gained control over Alberta's natural resources. This was a right other provinces were granted at Confederation or upon entry into Confederation, but which Alberta and Saskatchewan were denied when they became provinces in 1905, instead receiving a yearly cash subsidy from the federal government. This deal would later become a critical factor in Alberta's economic success as the province's oil deposits were exploited.\n\nRiding a wave of popularity resulting from this agreement, Brownlee led the United Farmers to a third majority government in the 1930 election, despite alienating socialists and labour groups as he led the party in a conservative fashion, and despite the quickly deteriorating financial conditions.\n\nThe Great Depression had a critical impact on the United Farmers' fortunes, as the crash in grain prices and simultaneous drought in southern Alberta hurt its support base, farmers. The government, with reduced tax revenue, engaged in cuts in services, staff and wages. The province was in debt after the grandiose spending of the relatively prosperous 1920s. The government also bailed out the hard-pressed Alberta Wheat Pool in 1929. Banks were repossessing the farms of many farmers who were unable to pay off their loans and interest when grain prices were lower than the cost of production. The governments` Liberal and Conservative opponents grew louder and they hoped to become popular. At the same time, however, the government faced opposition from socialists calling for more interventionist anti-capitalist policies and for radical monetary reform. The latter stance was supported by William Aberhart's Social Credit movement, which in 1933–35 grew to a potent force among the province's farmers.\n\nHenry Wise Wood retired as president of the UFA, more-radical-minded UFA MP Robert Gardiner, a member of the Ginger Group became president; the UFA conventions passed increased calls for strong government measures to address the province's widespread poverty; the UFA joined with the Canadian Labour Party and other political groups to help found the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the first Canada-wide farmer/labour political party (other than the revolutionary Communist Party of Canada). Premier Brownlee on more than one occasion opposed the UFA's leftward slide. The final blow for Brownlee occurred when he was caught up in a sex scandal as he was accused of seducing a young clerk working in the Attorney General's office. Brownlee resigned in disgrace in July 1934.\n\nRichard G. Reid succeeded Brownlee as Premier, however with many voters jumping to the new Social Credit Party, the United Farmers' fall in politics was as rapid as its rise. The party was wiped off the political map in the 1935 election, losing all of its seats and tallying only 11 percent of the vote.\n\nOf the nine UFA MPs elected in the 1930 federal election, eight joined the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation after it was formed in 1932. All eight ran as CCF candidates in the 1935 federal election and were defeated by a Social Credit landslide. The ninth UFA MP, William Thomas Lucas of Camrose, ran as a Conservative and was also defeated by the Socreds.\n\nTwo years after the UFA government was defeated, the organization withdrew from electoral politics. In 1938, the CCF committed itself to run candidates in the next provincial and elections, setting up local riding clubs for that purpose. In 1939, UFA officially disbanded its political arm, still continuing as a farmers supply co-operative. Many of the left-wing members of the UFA organization joined the CCF, though that party would not win the support of most former UFA voters. Many right-wing and centrist members of the UFA joined the Alberta Unity Movement, an attempt to form a coalition between United Farmers, Liberals and Conservatives to defeat Social Credit in the 1940 provincial election.\n\nThe CCF was folded into the New Democratic Party in 1961. Its Alberta wing claims the Alberta CCF's history as its own, thus making it a linear descendant of the UFA.\n\nThe United Farmers of Alberta ran candidates in several federal elections in alignment with, but usually to the left of, the Progressive Party of Canada with a number of UFA MPs sitting in the House of Commons with the Ginger Group of left wing MPs.\n\nFollowing Robert Gardiner's election in a federal by-election prior to the 1921 election, Alberta farmer ran 14 candidates (some as UFA, some as Progressive Party candidates) in the 1921 federal election, not running in two Calgary ridings where strong Labour candidates carried the farmer-worker banner. All the UFA candidates (and the two Calgary Labour candidates) were elected, the incumbent Liberal MPs and Conservative contenders not getting one seat. In 1926, the province's Progressive MPs ran for re-election as UFA candidates. Eight of the UFA's 9 remaining MPs joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation when it was formed in 1932. All eight ran as CCF candidates in the 1935 federal election and were defeated. The ninth, William Thomas Lucas, ran as a Conservative in 1935 and was also defeated by the Social Credit landslide that were elections in Alberta that year.\n\n\nFollowing the dissolution of its political wing, UFA focused on its commercial operations. UFA entered into a partnership with Maple Leaf Fuels, a subsidiary of Imperial Oil in 1935 to distribute fuel to its members. The next year it began to open retail stations under the Maple Leaf brand across the province.\n\nThe first farm supply store opened in Calgary in 1954, and a second in Edmonton in 1957. That same year, UFA bought the assets of Maple Leaf Fuels, giving the co-op greater control over the business.\n\nIn 1984, UFA opened its first cardlock fuel agency in Calgary. Today, UFA has over 100 cardlock facilities across three provinces and was the largest cardlock network in Alberta.\n\nUFA has over 120,000 members and with 2007 revenues of over $1.8 billion, UFA is ranked as the 37th largest business in Alberta by revenue according to Alberta Venture magazine.\n\nIn March 2009, UFA purchased Wholesale Sports in western Canada, and 15 Sportsman's Warehouse locations throughout the Northwest United States, which it then re-branded as Wholesale Sports.\n\nF/S = Farm & Ranch Supply\n\nP = Petroleum Agency / Cardlock\n\n102: Petro Locations (P) / 36: Farm & Ranch Supply (F/S):\n2: Petro Locations (P) / 0: Farm & Ranch Supply (F/S):\n3: Petro Locations (P) / 0: Farm & Ranch Supply (F/S):\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9913276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9913276", "title": "When Smuts Goes", "text": "When Smuts Goes\n\nWhen Smuts Goes is a dystopian novel by Dr. Arthur Keppel-Jones. The novel is set during a future history of South Africa, following the ascension of Afrikaner nationalists and their increasingly destructive quest for total \"apartheid\". It foreshadowed the fall of Jan Christiaan Smuts and his United Party administration, a rupture in ties with the British Commonwealth, and the declaration of a Second South African Republic. Presiding over the regime which follows is Obadja Bult, a dominion theologian influenced by the ideals of the former \"Ossewabrandwag\". His blunt authoritarian streak gives spark to racial conflict—culminating in foreign intervention and troubled majority rule.\n\nAs World War II draws to a close, white politics in the Union of South Africa are glaringly polarised - reflecting the struggle between Daniel Malan's Reunited National Party, whose followers demand a republic, and the United Party of Jan Smuts, who wish to retain their British monarch. Smuts' outstanding electoral victory in 1943 is fast becoming a distant memory; the Nationalists have consolidated by 1948 and go on to win Calvinia, Potchefstroom, Springs, and Caledon. \n\nUnited Prime Minister Oudstryder dissolves parliament in 1952, the tercentenary of Jan van Riebeeck's landing at the Cape of Good Hope. His Nationalist rivals take advantage of the occasion, organising a massive pageant in Cape Town. Speeches, processions, and gatherings mushroom at famous battlefields. British imperialism is decried as the national enemy. A wave of Afrikaner patriotism rocks South Africa as the polls are opened: Oudstryder and his pro-English colleagues are doomed. The triumphant Nationalists return 83 seats against the United Party's 56, securing a majority in every province but Natal.\n\nThe book correctly predicted the end of the long tenure in power of the United Party of Jan Smuts and the rise to power of the National Party, followed by a rupture with the British Commonwealth and the proclamation of a second \"South African Republic\".\n\nIn Keppel-Jones' prediction, however, the National Party institutes a totalitarian fascist-style dictatorship and completely suppresses all dissent—to a far greater degree than the actual apartheid government was to implement even in its most repressive phases.\n\nKeppel-Jones further predicts a mass exodus of South Africa's British diaspora; an uprising led by the Zulus, which is suppressed with much bloodshed; a constant state of overt and guerrilla warfare; a totally intransigent attitude by the Afrikaner leadership leading to increasing tensions with the rest of the world, culminating with an international military intervention—which leads to the toppling of the regime, followed by the killing or expulsion of the remaining white population, much of it migrating to Argentina; and an economic collapse and social degeneration, with the inexperienced and incompetent new government proving unable to maintain the political and economic structures which were handed over to them by the international community.\n\nResearcher Gary Baines compared the book's deeply pessimistic message and its looking forwards to a disastrous future to the tone of J.M. Coetzee's \"Waiting for the Barbarians\" several decades later in 1982.\n\n"}
