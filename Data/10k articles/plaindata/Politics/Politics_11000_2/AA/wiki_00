Despite violent opposition, Iceland's membership in NATO was confirmed. \n\nAfter the event, protests by anti-NATO activists were commonplace. The left parties in 1950s and 1960s parliamentary elections promised to put an end to the bilateral U.S.-Icelandic Defence Agreement, but dropped these promises after becoming part of the ruling coalitions. The slogan \"Iceland out of NATO and the Army out!\" (\"Ísland úr NATO og herinn burt!\") became a part of Icelandic culture. In 1974, the government proposed closing down the Keflavik base, but a petition campaign gathered a quarter of the population's signatures. The government fell out of power, and it was replaced by a decidedly pro-NATO government. On September 30, 2006, the US Navy unilaterally withdrew the last of its military force from Keflavík airport.\n\nIn 2016 the United States began preparations to re-occupy the base. In 2017, the United States announced its intention to construct a modern air base on the peninsula.\n\n"}
{"id": "5013592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5013592", "title": "6 February 1934 crisis", "text": "6 February 1934 crisis\n\nThe 6 February 1934 crisis was an anti-parliamentarist street demonstration in Paris organized by multiple far-right leagues that culminated in a riot on the Place de la Concorde, near the seat of the French National Assembly. The police shot and killed 15 demonstrators. It was one of the major political crises during the Third Republic (1870–1940). Frenchmen on the left feared it was an attempt to organize a fascist \"coup d'état\". According to historian Joel Colton, \"The consensus among scholars is that there was no concerted or unified design to seize power and that the leagues lacked the coherence, unity, or leadership to accomplish such an end.\"\n\nAs a result of the actions of that day, several anti-fascist organisations were created, such as the \"Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes\", in an attempt to thwart the rise of fascism in France. After World War II, several historians, among them , argued, while some leagues had been indisputably pushing for a \"coup\", François de La Rocque had, in fact, turned in a liberal direction, toward a respect for constitutional order. However, if the lack of coordination among the fascist leagues undermined the idea of a fascist conspiracy, the fascist actions on 6 February were an uncoordinated but violent attempt to overthrow the \"Cartel des gauches\" government elected in 1932.\n\nÉdouard Daladier, who was president of the national Council, replaced Camille Chautemps on 27 January 1934 because of accusations of corruption (including the Stavisky Affair). Daladier, who had been a popular figure, was nonetheless forced to resign on 7 February. He was replaced by the conservative Gaston Doumergue as head of the government; this was the first time during the tenure of the Third Republic a government fell because of pressures from the street.\n\nFrance was affected in 1931, somewhat later than other Western countries, by the 1929 Great Depression, which had been triggered by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 (\"Black Thursday\"). The economic and social crisis particularly affected the middle classes, traditional supporters of the Republic (in particular of the Radical-Socialist Party). Parliamentary instability followed, with five governments between May 1932 and January 1934, which fueled the anti-parliamentarist movement.\n\nThe latter took advantage also of a succession of political and financial scandals, such as the Marthe Hanau Affair (she had used her political supporters to attract, with her newspaper \"La Gazette du Franc\", the savings of the \"petite bourgeoisie\"); the Oustric Affair (the criminal bankruptcy of banker Albert Oustric provoked the fall of André Tardieu's government in 1930, because of the involvement of his Minister of Justice in it); and, finally, the immediate cause of the 6 February 1934 demonstrations, the Stavisky Affair.\n\nThis new scandal, which involved Bayonne's \"Crédit municipal\" bank, exploded in December 1933. The embezzler Alexandre Stavisky, known as \"le beau Sasha\" (\"the handsome Sasha\") was linked to several Radical deputies, including a minister of Camille Chautemps's government. The press later revealed that Stavisky had benefited from a 19-month postponement of his trial because the public prosecutor was Chautemps' brother-in-law. On 8 January 1934, Alexandre Stavisky was found dead. According to the police report, he had committed suicide, a conclusion that provoked general disbelief. According to the right wing, Chautemps had had him assassinated to keep him from revealing any secrets. The press then started a political campaign against alleged governmental corruption, while the far right demonstrated. At the end of the month, after the revelation of yet another scandal, Chautemps resigned. Édouard Daladier, another member of the Radical Party, succeeded him on 27 January 1934.\n\nSince 9 January, thirteen demonstrations had already taken place in Paris. While the right wing was trying to use the affair to replace the left-wing majority elected during the 1932 elections, the far right took advantage of its traditional themes: antisemitism, xenophobia (Stavisky was a naturalized Ukrainian Jew), hostility toward Freemasonry (Camille Chautemps was a Masonic dignitary), and anti-parliamentarism. As historian Serge Bernstein emphasized, the Stavisky Affair was exceptional neither in its seriousness nor in the personalities put on trial, but in the right wing's will to use the opportunity to make a left-wing government resign. In this aim, it could take advantage of the fact that the radical socialists did not have an absolute majority in the National Assembly and thus the government was weak.\n\nHowever, it was the dismissal of the police prefect Jean Chiappe that ultimately provoked the massive demonstrations of 6 February. Chiappe, who was openly right-wing, was very soft on far-right activism, which essentially took place in the streets (demonstrations, riots, attacks against the few left-wing students in the Quartier Latin by the monarchist \"Camelots du Roy\", the youth organization of the \"Action Française\", etc.). According to the left wing, Chiappe's dismissal was due to his involvement in the Stavisky Affair while the right wing denounced the result of negotiations with the Radicals: the departure of Chiappe would have been exchanged for support for Daladier's new government.\n\nRight-wing anti-parliamentary leagues had been the main activists during the January 1934 demonstrations. Although these leagues were not a new phenomenon (the old \"Ligue des Patriotes\" (\"Patriot League\") had been founded by Paul Déroulède in 1882), they played an important role following World War I, in particular when the left wing was in power, as it had been since the 1932 legislative elections.\n\n\nOn the night of 6 February, the leagues, which had gathered in different places in Paris, all converged on Place de la Concorde, located in front of the National Assembly, but on the other side of the Seine river. The police and guards managed to defend the strategic bridge of the Concorde, despite being the target of all sorts of projectiles. Some rioters were armed, and the police fired on the crowd. Disturbances lasted until 2:30 AM. 16 people were killed and 2,000 injured, most of them members of the \"Action Française\".\n\nFar-right organisations had the most important role in the riots; most of the UNC veterans avoided the Place de la Concorde, creating some incidents near the Elysée palace, the president's residence. However, Communists belonging to the rival left-wing veterans' organization ARAC may have been involved; one public notice afterward attacked the governing centre-left coalition (known as the \"Cartel des gauches\"). The Cartel had the unarmed veterans who shouted \"Down with the robbers, long live France!\" killed.\n\nThe American journalist John Gunther wrote in 1940 that the \"Croix-de-feu\" \"could easily have captured the Chamber of Deputies. But [de la Rocque] held his men back. 'France wasn't ready,' he explained\". It was possible, Gunther said, that \"like Hitler, he hopes to gain power by legal means.\" While on the right side of the Seine (north, on the Place de la Concorde), the policemen's charges contained the rioters with difficulty, the \"Croix-de-feu\" had chosen to demonstrate in the south. The Palais Bourbon, seat of the National Assembly, is much more difficult to defend on this side, but the \"Croix-de-feu\" limited themselves to surrounding the building without any major incident before dispersing. Because of this attitude, they earned the pejorative nickname of \"Froides Queues\" in the far-right press. Contrary to the other leagues which were intent on overthrowing the Republic, it thus seemed that Colonel de la Rocque finally decided to respect the constitutional legality.\n\nIn the National Assembly, the right wing attempted to take advantage of the riots to push the \"Cartel des gauches\" government to resign. The left wing, however, rallied around president of the Council Édouard Daladier. The session was ended after blows were exchanged between left and right-wing deputies.\n\nDuring the night, president of the Council Édouard Daladier took the first measures to obtain the re-establishment of public order. He did not exclude the possibility of declaring a state of emergency, although he finally decided against it. However, the next day the judiciary and the police resisted his directives. Moreover, most of his ministers and his party withdrew their support. Thus, Daladier finally chose to resign. This was the first time during the Third Republic that a government had to resign because of pressure from the streets.\n\nThe crisis was finally resolved with the formation of a new government under the direction of former president of the Republic (1924–31) Gaston Doumergue, a conservative whom the leagues seemed to accept. Qualified as a \"National Union government\", it included the most important figures of the parliamentary right wing, among them André Tardieu, Louis Barthou, and Louis Marin, although several Radical-Socialists and Philippe Pétain, who was named Minister of War, were also part of it. Pétain would later be the leader of the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II.\n\nFollowing 6 February, the left wing was convinced that a fascist conspiracy had taken place, and that it had been temporarily blocked. The importance of the anti-parliamentarist activity of far-right leagues was undeniable. Some of them, such as the \"Francisque\", had copied all of their characteristics from the Italian \"Fascio\" leagues which had marched on Rome in 1922, thus leading to the imposition of the fascist regime. Although historian Serge Bernstein has showed that Colonel de la Rocque had probably been convinced of the necessity of respecting constitutional legality, this was not true of all members of his \"Croix-de-feu\" movement, which also shared, at least superficially, some characteristics of the fascist leagues, in particular their militarism and fascination for parades.\n\nOn 9 February 1934, a socialist and communist counter-demonstration took place while Daladier was being replaced by conservative Gaston Doumergue. Nine people were killed during incidents with the police forces. On 12 February the CGT trade union (socialist and reformist at the time) and the CGTU (communist) decided to call for a one-day general strike, while the SFIO socialist party and the communist party decided to call for a separate demonstration. However, at the initiative of the popular base of these movements, the demonstrations finally united themselves into one. Thus, this day marked a first tentative union between the socialists and the communists. It had at its core the anti-fascism shared by both Marxist parties; a union had been opposed since the 1920 Tours Congress split, but this new rapprochement led to the 1936 Popular Front (consisting of radicals and socialists and supported without participation in the government by the Communist party). This antifascist union was in line with Stalin's directives to the Comintern, which had asked the European communist parties to ally with other left-wing parties, including social-democrats and socialists, in order to block the contagion of fascist and anti-communist regimes in Europe.\n\nFurthermore, several anti-fascist organizations were created in the wake of the riots, such as the \"Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes\" (Watchfulness Committee of Antifascist Intellectuals, created in March 1934) which included philosopher Alain, ethnologist Paul Rivet and physicist Paul Langevin. The anarchist movement also took part in many antifascist actions.\n\nFollowing the crisis, the parliamentary right also began to get closer to the counter-revolutionary far right. Several of its leaders would lose all trust in parliamentary institutions. Daniel Halévy, a French historian of Jewish descent, publicly declared that following 6 February 1934 he was now a \"man of the extreme right\". Although he personally abhorred Italian fascism or German national socialism, he went on to support the Pétain regime in Vichy. The radicalization of the right wing would accelerate after the election of the Popular Front in 1936 and the Spanish Civil War (1936–39).\n\nIn the view of the far right, 6 February represented a failed opportunity to overthrow the Republic (\"la gueuse\"), which only presented itself again in 1940 following the \"étrange défaite\" (Marc Bloch) or \"divine surprise\" (Charles Maurras), that is the 1940 defeat during the Battle of France against Germany. This deception prompted several far-right members to radicalize themselves, turning toward fascism, national-socialism or the wartime Vichy regime.\n\nDespite the fears of the left wing, the 6 February crisis was not a fascist conspiracy. The far-right leagues were not united enough and most of them lacked any specific objectives. However, their violent methods, their paramilitary appearances, their cult of leadership, etc., explained why they have often been associated with fascism. Beyond these appearances, however, and their will to see the parliamentary regime replaced by an authoritarian regime, historians René Rémond and Serge Bernstein do not consider that they had a real fascist project. Opposing this view, other historians, such as Michel Dobry or Zeev Sternhell, considered them as being fully fascist leagues. Brian Jenkins claimed it was pointless to look for a fascist essence in France and preferred to make comparisons which led, according to him, to a clear convergence between Italian fascism and the majority of the French leagues, in particular the \"Action Française\" (in other words, Jenkins considers fascism an Italian historic phenomenon, and though a fascist-like movement existed in France, it should not be called \"fascist\" as that name should be reserved for Benito Mussolini's movement).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5318304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5318304", "title": "Active citizenship", "text": "Active citizenship\n\nActive citizenship refers to a philosophy espoused by organizations and educational institutions which advocates that members of charitable organizations, companies or nation-states have certain roles and responsibilities to society and the environment, although those members may not have specific governing roles.\n\nActive citizenship can be seen as an articulation of the debate over rights versus responsibilities. If a body gives rights to the people under its remit, then those same people might have certain responsibilities to uphold. This would be most obvious at a country or nation-state level, but could also be of wider scope, such as the Internet (Netizen) or Earth (global citizenship). The implication is that an active citizen is one who fulfils both their rights and responsibilities in a balanced way.\n\nA problem with this concept is that although rights are often written down as part of the law, responsibilities are not as well defined, and there may be disagreements amongst the citizens as to what the responsibilities are. For example, in the United Kingdom, citizens have the right to free health care, but voting in elections is not compulsory, even though many people would define this as a responsibility.\n\nWriting a clear definition of responsibilities for an active citizen is much more problematic than writing a list of rights. For example, although voting might be considered a basic responsibility by many people, there are some who through disability or other issues are not able to participate fully in the voting process.\n\nAn active citizen is someone who takes a role in the community; the term has been identified with volunteering by writers such as Jonathan Tisch, who wrote in the \"Huffington Post\" in 2010 advocating that busy Americans should try to help others, particularly by offering high-level professional expertise in such areas as banking, education, engineering, and technology to help the less fortunate. \n\nActive citizenship is considered an OoF by some due to its vague definition. Examples include volunteering, donating, and recycling.\n\nDue to concerns over such things as a lack of OoF in elections (reflected by low voter turnout), the British Government launched a citizenship education programme several years ago. Citizenship education is now compulsory in UK schools up to 14 and is often available as an option beyond that age.\n\nIn Scotland, UK, active citizenship has been one of the three major themes of community policy since The Osler Report (section 6.6) in 1998. The Scottish Government's 2009 guidelines for Community learning and development, Working and Learning Together, has active citizenship as a target within other policy aims. Britain has a points-based immigration system, and in 2009 was Oofed a probationary period for newly admitted immigrants which would examine, in part, how well they were being so-called \"active citizens\".\n\nIn Denmark, \"active citizenship\" is part of the curriculum in \"Danish teacher's Education\". The course is defined as 36 lessons.\n\nIn Canada, there is an Active Citizenship Course being run at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. It is a compulsory course that is delivered by the Language Studies Department to all students at the college.\nOrganizations that cite active citizenship as part of their mission or vision statement include the following:\n\n\nIn the United States, writer Catherine Crier wondered in the \"Huffington Post\" about whether Americans had lost sight of Thomas Jefferson's sense of \"active citizenship\". Crier lamented how Americans have tended to neglect participating in voluntary associations, and tend to live as \"strangers apart from the rest\", quoting Tocqueville. In contrast, writer Eboo Patel in \"Newsweek\" suggested that president Obama had a somewhat different sense of active citizenship, meaning strong families, a vibrant civic center in which persons of different faiths and secular backgrounds work together, with government acting as a \"catalyst.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "68651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68651", "title": "Ambassador", "text": "Ambassador\n\nAn ambassador is an official envoy, especially a high-ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment. The word is also often used more liberally for persons who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities and fields of endeavor such as sales.\n\nAn ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital. The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an embassy, whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded diplomatic immunity in the host country. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an ambassador has the highest diplomatic rank. Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a chargé d'affaires in place of an ambassador.\n\nThe equivalent to an ambassador exchanged among members of the Commonwealth of Nations are known as High Commissioners. The \"ambassadors\" of the Holy See are known as Papal or Apostolic Nuncios.\n\nThe term is derived from Middle English \"ambassadour\", Anglo-French \"ambassateur\", ultimately of Latin origin from the word Ambaxus-Ambactus, meaning servant or minister; akin to Old High German \"ambaht\", \"service\". The first known usage of the term is in the Bible.\nThe foreign government to which an ambassador is assigned must first approve the person. In some cases, the foreign government might reverse its approval by declaring the diplomat a \"persona non grata\", i.e. an unacceptable person. This kind of declaration usually results in recalling the ambassador to their home nation. In accordance with the Congress of Vienna of 1815 and the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the ambassador and embassy staff are granted diplomatic immunity and personal safety while living abroad.\n\nDue to the advent of modern technologies, today's world is a much smaller place in relative terms. With this in mind, it is considered important that the nations of the world have at least a small staff living in foreign capitals in order to aid travelers and visitors from their home nation. As an officer of the foreign service, an ambassador is expected to protect the citizens of their home country in the host country.\n\nAnother result of the increase in foreign travel is the growth of trade between nations. For most countries, the national economy is now part of the global economy. This means increased opportunities to sell and trade with other nations. When two nations are conducting a trade, it is usually advantageous to both parties to have an ambassador and perhaps a small staff living in the other land, where they act as an intermediary between cooperative businesses.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of foreign diplomatic missions is to work for peace. This task can grow into a fight against international terrorism, the drug trade, international bribery, and human trafficking. Ambassadors help stop these acts, helping people across the globe. These activities are important and sensitive and are usually carried out in coordination with the Defense Ministry of the state (or the Defense Department in the U.S.) and the head of the nation.\n\nThe rise of the modern diplomatic system was a product of the Italian Renaissance (from around AD 1300). The use of ambassadors became a political strategy in Italy during the 17th century. The political changes in Italy altered the role of ambassadors in diplomatic affairs. Because many of the states in Italy were small in size, they were particularly vulnerable to larger states. The ambassador system was used to disperse information and to protect the more vulnerable states.\n\nThis practice then spread to Europe during the Italian Wars. The use and creation of ambassadors during the 15th century in Italy has had long-term effects on Europe and, in turn, the world's diplomatic and political progression. Europe still uses the same terms of ambassador rights as they had established in the 16th century, concerning the rights of the ambassadors in host countries as well as the proper diplomatic procedures. An ambassador was used as a representative of the state in which they are from to negotiate and disseminate information in order to keep peace and establish relationships with other states. This attempt was employed in the effort to maintain peaceful relations with nations and make alliances during difficult times.\n\nThe use of ambassadors today is widespread. States and non-state actors use diplomatic representatives to deal with any problems that occur within the international system. Ambassadors now normally live overseas or within the country in which it is assigned to for long periods of time so that they are acquainted with the culture and local people. This way they are more politically effective and trusted, enabling them to accomplish goals that their host country desires.\n\nThe Congress of Vienna of 1815 formalized the system of diplomatic rank under international law:\nAmbassadors are diplomats of the highest rank, formally representing the head of state, with plenipotentiary powers (i.e. full authority to represent the government). In modern usage, most ambassadors on foreign postings as head of mission carry the full title of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. \"Ordinary\" ambassadors and non-plenipotentiary status are rarely used, although they may be encountered in certain circumstances. The only difference between an extraordinary ambassador and an ordinary ambassador is that while the former's mission is permanent, the latter serves only for a specific purpose.\nAmong European powers, the \"ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary\" was historically regarded as the personal representative of the Sovereign. The custom of dispatching ambassadors to the head of state rather than the government has persisted. For example, ambassadors to and from the United Kingdom are accredited to or from the Royal Court of St James's. Ambassadors hold the highest diplomatic rank and have precedence over chargés d'affaires, who are accredited by the foreign minister. Ambassadors also outranked envoys until the 1960s, when the last legations were upgraded to embassies.\n\nBecause members of the Commonwealth of Nations have or had a common head of state, they do not exchange ambassadors, but instead have High Commissioners, who represent the government, rather than the head of state. The diplomat representing the Holy See is titled a nuncio. In diplomatic usage, both the high commissioner and nuncio are considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador. Resident Coordinators within the United Nations system are accredited to the Head of State and have the same rank as ambassador.\n\nAmbassadors carry formal letters of credence from their head of state, addressed to the host country's head of state. Because many Commonwealth countries have the same head of state, the accreditation of a High Commissioner is in the form of a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one head of government (Prime Minister) to that of another. The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to foreign and Commonwealth states: e.g., British High Commissioners are formally titled \"The High Commissioner for Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom\", whereas British Ambassadors to foreign countries are known as \"Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador\".\n\nAn ambassador-at-large is a diplomat of the highest rank or a minister who is accredited to represent their country. But unlike the ambassador-in-residence, who is usually limited to a country or embassy, the ambassador-at-large can be appointed to operate in several usually neighbouring countries, a region or sometimes a seat of international organizations such as the United Nations or European Union. In some cases, an ambassador-at-large may even be specifically assigned a role to advise and assist the state or Government in particular issues.\n\nHistorically, presidents or prime ministers have commissioned special diplomatic envoys for specific assignments, primarily overseas but sometimes also within the country as ambassadors-at-large.\n\nWhile the title generally reflects the ambassador's second head position as head of a diplomatic mission, in some countries the term may also represent a rank held by career diplomats, as a matter of internal promotion, regardless of the posting, and in many national careers it is quite common for them to be appointed to other functions, especially within the ministry/ministries in charge of foreign affairs, in some countries in systematic alternation with actual postings.\n\nThe formal form of address for an ambassador is generally the form that would be used to address a head of state: \"(Your/His/Her) Excellency\" followed by name or the country represented. In many countries, less formal variations are frequently used, such as \"Ambassador\" followed by name, or the name followed by \"Ambassador of...\". In the United States, \"Mister/Madam Ambassador\" may be used. The Republic of Kosovo has bestowed the title of honorary ambassador to nine prominent individuals. This is a rare example of an appointment for life by presidential decree of an ambassador by a sovereign state. Honorary ambassadors are entitled to the same precedence and honors as career ambassadors in the Republic of Kosovo.\n\nIn some countries, a former ambassador may continue to be styled and addressed as ambassador throughout their life (in the United States, \"Mr. Ambassador\" or \"Madam Ambassador\" may be heard). In other countries, ambassador is a title that accrues to its holder only with respect to a specific position, and may not be used after leaving or beyond the position. Some countries do not use the term while an ambassador is in the home country, as the office holder is not an ambassador there; for example, a Canadian ambassador while in Canada is not generally addressed as ambassador, although they may be referred to as \"Canadian ambassador to ...\"; that is, with reference to a specific job function; the person is addressed or styled as ambassador only while holding such office.\n\nIn a less formal sense, the phrase is used for high-profile non-diplomatic representatives of various entities (rarely states), mainly cultural and charitable organizations, often as willing figureheads to attract media attention; for example, film and pop stars make appeals to the public at large for UNESCO activities (see UNESCO Goodwill Ambassadors), sometimes during press-swarmed visits in the foreign country.\n\nIn French speaking regions such as metropolitan France, Guadeloupe, Réunion, Quebec, or Wallonia, the title of \"ambassadeur personne\" is used.\n\n\n\n"}

It is celebrated on various dates around the world. In 2012, the United Nations declared the official day to be May 4, some countries prefer to celebrate it on 28/29 February), which was recognised by many countries worldwide, including Australia, New Zealand, France, Lebanon, the United Kingdom and the United States. \n\nThe original event was organized by David Shepherd and Travis Price of Berwick, Nova Scotia, who in 2007 bought and distributed 50 pink shirts after male ninth grade student Chuck McNeill was bullied for wearing a pink shirt during the first day of school. In Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia Premier Rodney MacDonald proclaimed the second Thursday of September \"Stand Up Against Bullying Day\" in recognition of these events.\n\nIn 2008, the then Premier of British Columbia, Gordon Campbell proclaimed February 27 to be the provincial anti-bullying day. It was then celebrated on February 25 in 2009. In 2009, Boys and Girls Clubs worked on pink T-shirts that say \"Bullying Stops Here.\" and \"Pink Shirt Day\" for Anti-Bullying Day.\n\nIn 2012, the United Nations declared May 4 as Anti-Bullying Day.\n\nIn 2018, New Zealand celebrated Anti-Bullying Day on 18 May.\n\nAnti-Bullying Day was instituted to prevent further bullying. The United States Department of Justice showed that one out of four kids will be bullied during their adolescence. Most of the time it continues after the first incident; statistics show that 71 percent of students that are bullied, continue to be bullied, making it a problem with no end. According to the Yale School of Medicine, a study in 2010 discovered a connection between being bullied and suicide. The term to describe this is \"bullycide\" where someone who is bullied commits suicide as a result.\n\nAnti-Bullying Day activities can take place at schools, workplaces, or any peer group location. They may include \"abolishing bullying\" rallies, information and networking booths to help the community in understanding the evils of bullying, and publicizing anti-discrimination organizations. Examples include Blue Shirt World Day of Bullying Prevention, National Bullying awareness month, and Pink Shirt Day. Other features include handouts, resources, and information promoting the message of the \"National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence\". Examples of other activities include races, conferences, video-creating competitions such as the \"ScreenIt!\" and the \"Back me up\" competitions, and community events, all used to spread awareness of bullying and violence.\n\n\n"}

Anti-capitalists, in the strict sense of the word, are those who wish to replace capitalism with another type of economic system.\n\nSocialism advocates public or direct worker ownership and administration of the means of production and allocation of resources, and a society characterized by equal access to resources for all individuals, with an egalitarian method of compensation.\n\n\nSocialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalizations that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit (such as high-pressure advertisement); thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.\n\nSocialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need; they argue that \"making money\", or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand.\n\nPrivate ownership imposes constraints on planning, leading to inaccessible economic decisions that result in immoral production, unemployment and a tremendous waste of material resources during crisis of overproduction. According to socialists, private property in the means of production becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralized, socialized institutions based on private appropriation of revenue (but based on cooperative work and internal planning in allocation of inputs) until the role of the capitalist becomes redundant. With no need for capital accumulation and a class of owners, private property in the means of production is perceived as being an outdated form of economic organization that should be replaced by a free association of individuals based on public or common ownership of these socialized assets. Socialists view private property relations as limiting the potential of productive forces in the economy.\n\nEarly socialists (Utopian socialists and Ricardian socialists) criticized capitalism for concentrating power and wealth within a small segment of society, and does not utilise available technology and resources to their maximum potential in the interests of the public.\n\nFor the influential German individualist anarchist philosopher Max Stirner, \"private property is a spook which \"lives by the grace of law\" and it \"becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law\". In other words, private property exists purely \"through the protection of the State, through the State's grace.\" Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner argued that \"[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'? Not that of labour\", rather it is \"interest-bearing possession ... labouring capital, therefore ... labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one's own, but labour of capital and of the—subject labourers\".\" French anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. The Spanish individualist anarchist Miguel Gimenez Igualada saw \"capitalism [as] an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it State capitalism or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State.\".\n\nWithin anarchism there emerged a critique of wage slavery which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-voluntary slavery, where a person's livelihood depends on wages, especially when the dependence is total and immediate. It is a negatively connoted term used to draw an analogy between slavery and wage labor by focusing on similarities between owning and renting a person. The term \"wage slavery\" has been used to criticize economic exploitation and social stratification, with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in sweatshops), and the latter as a lack of workers' self-management, fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy. Libertarian socialists believe if freedom is valued, then society must work towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with direct democracy, voluntary federation, and popular autonomy in all aspects of life, including physical communities and economic enterprises. With the advent of the industrial revolution, thinkers such as Proudhon and Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use, Luddites emphasized the dehumanization brought about by machines while later Emma Goldman famously denounced wage slavery by saying: \"The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves.\". American anarchist Emma Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. \"The only demand that property recognizes,\" she wrote in \"Anarchism and Other Essays\", \"is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade.\" She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, \"turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron.\"\n\nNoam Chomsky contends that there is little moral difference between chattel slavery and renting one's self to an owner or \"wage slavery\". He feels that it is an attack on personal integrity that undermines individual freedom. He holds that workers should own and control their workplace. Many libertarian socialists argue that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial manufacture, while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor. As such, they see a distinction between the concepts of \"private property\" and \"personal possession\". Whereas \"private property\" grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not, and regardless of its productive capacity, \"possession\" grants no rights to things that are not in use.\n\nIn addition to individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker's \"big four\" monopolies (land, money, tariffs, and patents), Kevin Carson argues that the state has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization, in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. He believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions, whereas Carson also focuses on organizational issues. Carson holds that “Capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the Middle Ages, was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier feudal conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable.” Carson coined the pejorative term \"vulgar libertarianism,\" a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase \"vulgar political economy,\" which Karl Marx described as an economic order that \"deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life].\"\n\nKarl Marx saw capitalism as a historical stage, once progressive but which would eventually stagnate due to internal contradictions and would eventually be followed by socialism. Marx claimed that capitalism was nothing more than a necessary stepping stone for the progression of man, which would then face a political revolution before embracing the classless society. Marxists define capital as \"a social, economic relation\" between people (rather than between people and things). In this sense they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers (\"the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer\"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore exploit the workerforce. In Karl Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class, and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.\n\nFascists opposed both international socialism and free market capitalism, arguing that their views represented a third position. They claimed to provide a realistic economic alternative that was neither \"laissez-faire\" capitalism nor communism. They favored corporatism and class collaboration, believing that the existence of inequality and social hierarchy was beneficial (contrary to the views of socialists), while also arguing that the state had a role in mediating relations between classes (contrary to the views of liberal capitalists).\n\nBarter is a system of exchange where goods or services are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money. It is distinguishable from gift economies in many ways; one of them is that the reciprocal exchange is immediate and not delayed in time. It is usually bilateral, but may be multilateral (i.e., mediated through barter organizations) and, in most developed countries, usually only exists parallel to monetary systems to a very limited extent. Barter, as a replacement for money as the method of exchange, is used in times of monetary crisis, such as when the currency may be either unstable (e.g., hyperinflation or deflationary spiral) or simply unavailable for conducting commerce.\nBartering could be considered a social starting point towards an anti-capitalist system, by negating the need for a medium of exchange.\n\nWage slavery refers to a situation where a person's livelihood depends on wages or a salary, especially when the dependence is total and immediate. It is a pejorative term used to draw an analogy between slavery and wage labor by focusing on similarities between owning and renting a person.\n\nThe term wage slavery has been used to criticize exploitation of labour and social stratification, with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in sweatshops), and the latter as a lack of workers' self-management, fulfilling job choices, and leisure in an economy. The criticism of social stratification covers a wider range of employment choices bound by the pressures of a hierarchical society to perform otherwise unfulfilling work that deprives humans of their \"species character\" not only under threat of starvation or poverty, but also of social stigma and status diminution. It has been argued by some centre-left and left leaning activists that the economy of the contemporary United States constitutes a softer form of wage slavery, in which conditions are not grinding, but nonetheless not conducive to individual economic progress.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3150876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3150876", "title": "Beylerbey", "text": "Beylerbey\n\nBeylerbey or Beylerbeyi (; \"Bey of Beys\", meaning \"the Commander of Commanders\" or \"the Lord of Lords\"; originally Beglerbeg[i] in older Turkic) was a high rank in the western Islamic world in the late Middle Ages and early modern period, from the Seljuks of Rum and the Ilkhanids to Safavid Persia and the Ottoman Empire. Initially designating a commander-in-chief, it eventually came to be held by senior provincial governors. In Ottoman usage, where the rank survived the longest, it designated the governors-general of some of the largest and most important provinces, although in later centuries it became devalued into a mere honorific title. Its equivalents in Arabic were \"amir al-umara\", and in Persian, \"mir-i miran\".\n\nThe title was also used by the Khans of the Indian (later Pakistani) princely state of Kalat.\n\nThe title originated with the Seljuqs, and was used in the Sultanate of Rum initially as an alternative for the Arabic title of \"malik al-umara\" (\"chief of the commanders\"), designating the army's commander-in-chief. Among the Mongol Ilkhanids, the title was used to designate the chief \"amir al-ulus\" (\"emir of the state\")—also known by the Turkic title \"ulusbegi\" and the Arabic \"amir al-umara\"–while in the Golden Horde it was applied to all the holders of the rank of \"amir al-ulus\". The Mamluks of Egypt possibly used it as an alternative title for the \"atabak al-asakir\", the commander-in-chief of the army.\n\nThe Ottomans used the title from the late 14th until the mid-19th century, with varying meanings and degrees of importance. The early Ottoman state continued to use the term \"beylerbey\" in the meaning of commander-in-chief, held by princes of the Ottoman dynasty: under the Ottoman Empire's founder, Osman I (ruled 1299–1326), his son Orhan held the post, and during Orhan's reign (1324–1362), his brother Alaeddin Pasha and Orhan's son Süleyman Pasha.\n\nThe first step towards the transformation of the office into a gubernatorial title occurred when the title was given by Murad I (r. 1362–89) to Lala Shahin Pasha, as a reward for his capture of Adrianople (modern Edirne) in the 1360s. In addition, Lala Shahin was given military authority over the Ottoman territories in Europe (Rumelia). This marked the \"beylerbey\" effectively as the viceroy of the European territories as the Sultans still resided in Anatolia, and as the straits of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, which connected the two parts of the Ottoman state, continued to escape full Ottoman control until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nAfter Lala Shahin's death, sometime in 1385–87 he was succeeded in the position of commander-in-chief in Rumelia by Çandarlı Kara Halil Hayreddin Pasha. In 1393, Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1389–1402) appointed Kara Timurtash as \"beylerbey\" and viceroy was in Anatolia, when Bayezid crossed over into Europe to campaign against Mircea I of Wallachia. This process marked the birth of the first two, and by far the most important, \"beylerbeyliks\", of Rumelia and Anatolia, while the third \"beylerbeylik\", that of Rûm, followed soon after.\nThe \"beylerbey\" was in charge of a province—termed \"beylerbeylik\" or generically \"vilayet\", \"province\", while after 1591 the term \"eyalet\" was used and \"beylerbeylik\" came to mean the office of \"beylerbey\"—further subdivided into \"sanjaks\" or \"\"liwa\"s\" under \"sanjakbeys\". With the continuous growth of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries, new provinces were established, and the ranks of the \"beylerbeys\" swelled to a maximum of 44 by the end of the 16th century. A list of \"eyalets\" in 1609 mentions 32 in total, of which 23 regular \"eyalets\" where revenue was distributed among the military fief-holders, while the rest (in North Africa and the Middle East) were under the \"salyane\" system, i.e. their revenue was sent to the imperial treasury, and the officials and soldiers were paid salaries from it. The size of these new provinces varied enormously: some containing as many as twenty \"sanjaks\", and others as few as two, including the \"beylerbey\"s own residence (or \"pasha-sanjakı\"). Among themselves, the various \"beylerbeys\" had an order of precedence based on the date of conquest or formation of their provinces. The \"beylerbey\" of Rumelia, however, retained his pre-eminence, ranking first among the other provincial governors-general, and being accorded a seat in the Imperial Council (\"divan\") after 1536. In addition, the post was occasionally held by the Sultan's chief minister, the Grand Vizier himself.\nIn his province, the \"beylerbey\" was regarded as a virtual viceroy of the Sultan: he had full authority over matters of war, justice and administration, except in so far as they were limited by the authority of other officials also appointed by the central government, chiefly the various fiscal secretaries under the \"mal defterdari\" and the \"kadı\", who could appeal directly to the imperial government. In addition, as a further check to their power, the Janissary contingents stationed in the province's cities were outside his authority, and \"beylerbeys\" were even forbidden from entering the fortresses garrisoned by the Janissaries. The \"beylerbey\" also had his own court and government council (\"divan\") and could freely grant fiefs (\"timars\" and \"ziamets\") without prior approval by the Sultan, although this right was curtailed after 1530, when his authority was restricted to smaller \"timars\" only. Having its origin in the military, the primary responsibility of the \"beylerbeys\" and their \"sanjakbeys\" was the maintenance the \"sipahi\" cavalry, formed by the holders of the military fiefs, whom they led in person on campaign.\n\nFrom the reign of Mehmed II (r. 1451–1481) onwards, the title of \"beylerbey\" also became an honorary court rank, coming after the viziers; both viziers and \"beylerbeys\" were titled pashas, with the viziers sporting three horse-tails and the \"beylerbeys\" two. From the 16th century on, however, viziers could be appointed as provincial \"beylerbeys\", enjoying precedence and authority over the ordinary \"beylerbeys\" of the neighbouring provinces. Towards the end of the 17th century, the title of \"beylerbey\" of Rumelia (\"Rumeli beylerbeysi\") also began to be awarded as an honorific rank, alongside the actual holder of the provincial post, even to officials unrelated to the provincial administration, such as the chief treasurer (\"defterdar\").\n\nBeginning in the 18th century, the Arabic title of \"wali\" began to be increasingly used for provincial governors-general at the expense of \"beylerbey\", except for the two original \"beylerbeys\" of Rumelia and Anatolia; the Arabic title \"amir al-umara\", and the Persian \"mir-i miran\" or \"mirmiran\", which had been used as equivalents of the \"beylerbey\", now increasingly came to refer only to the honorary rank, which in turn was increasingly devalued. The process culminated with the \"vilayet\" reform of 1864, after which \"wali\" became the only official designation for the governor-general of a province, while the title of \"beylerbey\" survived only in the honorary rank of \"Rumeli beylerbeysi\", which continued in use alongside its Perso-Arabian equivalents.\n\nUnder the Safavid dynasty of Persia, the title was used from ca. 1543/44 on for governors (generically styled \"hakim\") of the more important provinces. The title was thus used for the governors of Herat, Azerbaijan, Ganja, Karabakh, Shirvan, Fars, Iraq, and Astarabad. The Safavids also used the title of \"wali\" for provinces even more important than those of \"beylerbeys\". Towards the end of the Safavid period, the title of \"beylerbey\" had been eclipsed by that of \"wali\", most notably being the wali's of the shah's their Georgian lands.\n\n"}

The film stars Harshvardhan Kapoor in the lead role along with Priyanshu Painyuli, Ashish Verma and Nishikant Kamat and had its theatrical release on 1 June 2018. Later on, it was also screened at Neuchatel Film Festival. The film was commercially unsuccessful, but eventually gained popularity upon its digital release .\n\nThree young friends, Bhavesh (Priyanshu Painyuli), Siku (Harshvardhan Kapoor) and Rajat (Ashish Verma) come up with a YouTube channel \"Insaaf TV\", creating an online show about Insaaf (justice) trying to expose to people some common wrongdoings and corruption which are rampant in the city. Initially, their show garners success, where they, wearing paper-bag masks, help to solve or confront some small scale corruptions in and around their neighborhood. Time soon flies; Siku and Rajat get jobs at corporate sector after passing out from college. Their interest for Insaaf TV gradually fades out except for Bhavesh, who gets obsessed about eradicating corruption from society and continues with his vigilante acts despite a fall in their channel viewership. He receives an email from an elderly citizen about water problems existing in and around his locality and starts investigating the case. He discovers that the water pipes across the city meant for delivering water to the households have been fitted with extra pipes to siphon out water to water tankers which are then delivered to the various neighborhoods making people buy the same water which they were supposed to receive for free from the municipality. Bhavesh leaks this news to his channel and this results in the water mafia Patil (Pratap Phad), responsible for this act, starting to look into the true identity of the masked man behind Insaaf TV. \n\nIn the meantime, despite providing all the proper documents and doing multiple follow ups with the local police station, Siku's police clearance for his VISA processing to move to the US doesn't get approved until he pays bribe to the police officials to get the things done. Bhavesh becomes furious knowing this and they get initially engaged in a verbal tiff. An angered Bhavesh tells that all the govt. officials and politicians are corrupt and should be eradicated to cleanse the society with Siku recording his dialogues on his phone. Bhavesh punches Siku, breaking his nose. An enraged Siku uploads the video on Insaaf TV channel. Soon, Bhavesh is termed by the media as anti-national and unpatriotic. He is thrashed by the mob and then gets arrested thereby revealing his identity to Patil who warns him, but desperate to prove his innocence and uncover the truth to people, he sets out to gather evidence despite being injured. He gets caught in the process and Patil mauls him to death. The police hand over his body to Siku for last rites claiming it to be an accident and further warn him not to get involved into this. Blaming himself for Bhavesh's death, Siku tricks the police into believing that he has left for the US and takes refuge in an abandoned hotel which served as a safe house for their gang. He sets out covering his face in a mask and accidentally blows up Patil's pump house where he used to fill the siphoned water to the water trailers. It is then revealed that Patil has backing from the local political leader Rana (Nishikanth Kamath).\n\nSiku gets himself a new vigilante costume, buys a motorcycle, customizes it by fitting nitro cylinders and interrogates govt. officer Subhash Mhatre (Hrishikesh Joshi) who reveals that Bhavesh was killed by Patil as he was about to uncover his illegal water supply activities. A fight breaks out between him and Mhatre's men during the interrogation and a nearly overpowered Siku is saved by Bhavesh's martial arts trainer. Siku posts his interrogation video in Insaaf TV and introduces himself as Bhavesh Joshi, still alive. He also starts learning martial arts and other combat techniques from the martial arts trainer. As the video goes viral, Patil gets arrested by police. However, Mhatre gets killed soon with police claiming it to be a suicide and that Mhatre has taken his own life out of guilt as he was forced to wrongly confess about Patil by Bhavesh. Patil is released due to lack of evidence. Siku disguises himself and visits the dance bar where Patil comes every night. He plants a bug in Patil's VIP room and gets to know that he is planning to blow up the water pipes across the city to create an acute shortage of drinking water. However, police inspector Sunil Jadhav (Chinmayee Mandlekar) discovers him in the bar and after a long vehicular chase, a disguised Siku escapes, causing an enraged Patil to shoot a constable and forcing police to put the blame on Bhavesh. \n\nSuspicious about who is behind Insaaf TV after Bhavesh's demise, Rajat starts to keep an eye on Siku's girlfriend, Sneha ((Shreiyah Sabharwal) and discovers that he has not left India and has assumed the identity of Bhavesh Joshi. Siku arrives at the place targeted by Patil's men and fights them, later getting caught and unmasked in the process. They succeed in their mission to blow up the water pipes with an injured Siku watching in vain. Patil and Rana tell inspector Sunil to kill Siku and dump his body in water thus putting the blame on Bhavesh Joshi for this terrorist act against Mumbai. Sunil hesitantly shoots Siku. Getting to know of the location from his secret hideout, Rajat follows Siku and captures everything on camera. Once Siku is thrown into water, he rescues him and takes him to a hospital. However, Siku suggests him to let people think that he is dead and so Rajat admits him to the hospital under a fake alias of Mohan. As Siku recovers, Mumbai suffers from acute drinking water crisis. Rana meets the Chief Minister and tells him that he can arrange for water free of cost but instead should get the contracts of all future water related projects. Everyone gets drinking water for free and both the CM and Rana become heroes in common people's eyes. \n\nRajat delivers the video of that night to Sunil Jadhav via a kid and forces him to open an investigation about the blast. As the true news spreads across the city Bhavesh Joshi starts gaining support and protests start everywhere. At night, Siku infiltrates Rana's house and takes out all his security guards. Rana comes down from his bedroom and sees all his bodyguards are knocked out and encounters \"Bhavesh Joshi\" at the balcony. \n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Bhavesh is seen telling a driver to reverse his car from a no-entry road.\n\n\nThe film was officially announced sometime in April 2014. The title of the film was said to be \"Bhavesh Joshi\".\n\nThe makers of the film initially decided on Imran Khan for the lead. The role then went to Sidharth Malhotra, but he was eventually replaced by Harshvardhan Kapoor due to frequent delays in the film's pre-production schedule.\n\nThe principal photography of the film commenced in July 2016.The film shooting ended on 30th May 2017\n\nThe music of the film was composed by Amit Trivedi while the lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, Anurag Kashyap, Babu Haabi and Naezy.

{"id": "36473354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36473354", "title": "Born This Way Foundation", "text": "Born This Way Foundation\n\nThe Born This Way Foundation (BTWF) is an American non-profit organization founded in 2011 by singer Lady Gaga and her mother Cynthia Germanotta. Established at Harvard University, and named after Gaga's second studio album \"Born This Way\" (2011), the foundation aims to inspire youth and build better communities. BTWF works in partnership with the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and The California Endowment.\n\nThe foundation aims to create a \"braver, kinder world\" for youths; create safe-spaces, promote the learning of life skills, and provide opportunities to improve their local communities. In a statement, Lady Gaga said \"My mother and I have initiated a passion project [...] to establish a standard of bravery and kindness, as well as a community worldwide that protects and nurtures others in the face of bullying and abandonment.\"\n\nIn September 2012 Gaga was awarded the LennonOno Grant For Peace from Yoko Ono for her work with the foundation \"actively campaigning on pro-tolerance and peace issues.\" The award \"intends to keep that pop activism alive\" in the spirit of Ono and her late husband John Lennon whose song \"Imagine\" includes the famous line \"imagine all the people living life in peace.\"\n\nLady Gaga was always interested in the subject of bullying and the empowerment of young people. In 2011, Gaga met with U.S. President Barack Obama to talk on the subject. Her meeting was in part response to gay fourteen-year-old Jamey Rodemeyer, who killed himself because he was being bullied. He had recorded an \"It Gets Better\" video and before he died posted a line from a Lady Gaga song on his Facebook page. In 2010, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network stated, \"There has been heightened media attention surrounding the [recent] suicides.\" The same month, Tyler Clementi died, four other LGBT teenagers were reported to have committed suicide after being bullied about their homosexuality.\n\n\"The Guardian\" noted as well Gaga's interest in the \"history of devastating school shootings perpetrated by students felt to be social outcasts,\" they wrote:\nIn the documentary \"Inside the Outside\", Gaga told of being bullied herself and thrown in a trashcan while classmates looked on.\n\nThe organization was launched on February 29, 2012 by artist Lady Gaga and her mother Cynthia Germanotta, who said, \"challenge meanness and cruelty by inspiring young people to create a support system in their respective communities.\" Media proprietor Oprah Winfrey, writer Deepak Chopra, and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the inauguration. The Foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from retailer Barneys New York.\n\nThe BTWF was the beneficiary of Barneys New York's 2011 holiday campaign which also featured \"Lady Gaga’s Workshop.\" In May 2012, Viacom announced it would be the foundation's lead media partner for the development of events, programming and \"opportunities that empower young people to build a braver, kinder world.\" In August 2012, Gaga was named by American business magazine \"Forbes\", well known for its lists (richest Americans – the Forbes 400, Forbes list of billionaires, etc.), as fourteenth on their \"World's 100 Most Powerful Women\" list due in part to her BTWF work.\n\nIn March 2014, Roger Friedman of Showbiz411 criticized the foundation's spendings after its federal tax reports were released. The reports noted spending of $348,000 on its Born Brave Bus tour; approximately $1.5 million on fees related to Web and social media, publicity, and legalities, as opposed to only $5,000 in grants to individuals and other organizations. \"It’s unclear that anyone was really helped by the Born This Way Foundation other than lawyers, consultants, publicists and travel agents,\" Friedman wrote. \"We do the work,\" Lady Gaga wrote in response. \"We do not raise money and allocate the funds to other charities for them to do the work.\" \"A clear understanding of the differences between a grant-making organization and one that carries out its work directly would have made this a non-story,\" Cynthia Germanotta added. \"We are not a grant-maker that funds the work of other charities, and were never intended to be ... [But] we are having a profound impact in just a very short period of time.\"\n\nFrom March 28 to April 11, 2012, the BTWF ran a poster campaign \"to inspire bravery\" and encouraging supporters to submit images that answer the question \"What does bravery mean to you?\" with the 10 semifinalists selected by Gaga and her mother and leading to a prize for the winner(s), selected by fans.\n\nIn August 2012, BTWF Co-founder Cynthia Germanotta was one of the speakers at the U.S. Department of Education's third annual Federal Partners in Bullying Prevention Summit to coordinate \"anti-bullying efforts with the best available research,\" she appeared with White House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett with their speeches broadcast on C-SPAN. BTWF's work was discussed among other ongoing anti-bullying efforts.\n\nIn October 2014, the Connecticut Commission on Children held a Summit on Youth, Civics, and Positive School climate, co-sponsored by the BTWF, the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, the Connecticut Department of Education, the Anti-Defamation League, and the UConn NEAG School of Education. The Summit consisted of legislators and high school students from around the state, who shared their experiences with bullying and harassment, including an opening performance by high school freshman Nina Lee, whose anti-bullying song and video, entitled \"Try to Break Me,\" had caught the attention of State Senator Danté Bartolomeo, and culminated in a keynote address by Cynthia Germanotta on behalf of the BTWF. The BTWF's work with the Connecticut Commission on Children and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence continued thereafter, leading to the Emotion Revolution Survey and Summit.\n\nIn October 2012 the formalization of a seven-person Research and Advisory Board was announced that will advise on BTWF's \"youth empowerment and tolerance programs\" based on \"sound theory and research.\" Susan Swearer, University of Nebraska-Lincoln professor of school psychology in the College of Education and Human Sciences, will chair the group. Swearer has worked with BTWF since 2011 creating resources \"as it prepared to enter the national anti-bullying discussion,\" she co-directs the Bullying Research Network, which \"promotes international collaboration among bullying and peer victimization researchers.\" Also named to the board is C.J. Pascoe, the only sociologist, from Colorado College who studies gender, sexuality, inequality, youth and new media.\n\nGaga announced in May 2012 that the \"Born Brave Bus\" would follow her on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying and homophobia. In June 2012, \"Born Brave\" community and school groups, these localized groups dedicate to making positive change where they live. Born Brave Nation, a name chosen by the BTWF supporters, was requesting founding members in July 2012 but had not yet launched. The Born Brave Nation would later be headed by youths \"dedicated to building a kinder, braver world in their homes, schools, and communities\" and appears to accept anyone only up to the age of 100 years as a founder, teacher, student or supporter.\n\nIn August 2012 the BTWF launched a national youth advisory board, 24 young people ages 17–23 who will represent other young people. They initially attended a three-day summit at Paramount Pictures in Los Angeles, where they held discussions with youth advocate and journalist Anne Collier, and Maya Enista Smith, the CEO of Mobilize.org. During the summit the board provided feedback on upcoming programs and initiatives of the BTWF, \"helping to guide the Foundation’s plan for the coming year.\" The youth advisory board will serve as ambassadors to \"Born Brave Nation.\"\n\nIn 2012, Gaga expressed an interest in being part of the \"natural fabric of schooling.\" In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with supplier of office products Office Depot to create a range of limited edition back-to-school products including: \"empowerment gift cards\" containing motivational messages, and \"bravery bracelets.\" Office Depot agreed to donate 25% of the sale value for each item sold and guaranteed $1 million USD donation in 2012 to the foundation. This led the Florida Family Association, what \"New York Times\" noted was a one-man Christian fundamentalist organization,\nto accuse Office Depot of influencing teenagers to reject heterosexuality. In support of the efforts by Office Depot and the Born This Way Foundation, public service announcement videos were created by model and actor Patrick Schwarzenegger, and by pop singer Greyson Chance to be aired on Facebook, YouTube and other outlets.\n\nIn September 2012 Gaga launched a new project called \"A Body Revolution 2013\" to address poor body image and body acceptance, this was done, in part, because media outlets had negatively remarked on supposed weight gains by the performer. To start the project she posted images of herself in underwear and asked others to follow her lead stating \"May we make our flaws famous, and thus redefine the heinous.\" She accompanied the photos with statements that she suffered from the eating disorders bulimia and anorexia nervosa since she was 15.\n\nOn July 24, 2013 the BTWF announced a Crowdrise campaign with the stated goal of crowdsourcing the process of raising money to continue the Born Brave Bus tour. On January 7, 2016, at the CES 2016, it was announced that the foundation partnered with Intel, Vox Media and \"Re/code\" to fight online harassment to provide a safer online experience.\n\nOn October 16, 2016 toy company Mattel released the Zomby Gaga collector doll for pre-order as a part of their Monster High doll line in partnership with the BTWF. The doll is based on Gaga's Zombie Boy inspired skeleton tattoo make up and tuxedo look from the Born This Way music video and designed by Gaga's sister Natali Germanotta together with Mattel. The doll was released on Jan 2, 2017 with all proceeds benefitting the foundation.\n\n\n"}

Zinzun and many other members of the group were former low-ranking members of the Black Panther Party. The BPP left an important, and acknowledged, aesthetic and political legacy for members of CAPA but has never been viewed uncritically. Many members of CAPA believe that the Panther's vanguardist and patriarchal organizational methods obstructed the harnessing of the power of ordinary members of the black community and left the group overly vulnerable to decapitation by the government as various leaders were killed and imprisoned. CAPA aims at empowering those it serves and has adopted the motto \"we will work with you, not for you.\" This means that when a person approaches CAPA with a complaint about police brutality CAPA will assist them and seek to empower the victim(s) to actively participate in their case and act as representatives to the community.\n\nCAPA, along with other organizations, has been instrumental in facilitating the LA Gang Truce and seeks to recruit gang members to redirect their energies from criminal activities that harm themselves and the community toward community activism.\n\nThe organization is based in South Central LA and shares its headquarters with the Peace and Freedom Party. The organizations are distinct although there is a partial overlap in membership with both sets of members often interacting and cooperating. Since the early 1980s CAPA has maintained a close relationship with the ACLU which has often provided legal assistance to the group.\n\n"}
{"id": "3911743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3911743", "title": "Common European Home", "text": "Common European Home\n\nThe \"Common European Home\" was a concept created and espoused by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nThe concept has some antecedents in Brezhnev's foreign policy, who used the phrase during a visit to Bonn in 1981. However, at this time it was likely used in an attempt to sow discord between the United States and the European allies in the hopes of moderating American policy. Though Gorbachev used a similar phrase in a 1985 statement, calling the Old World \"our common house,\" perhaps the most famous use of the term arose when with Gorbachev presented his concept of \"our common European home\" or the \"all-European house\" during a visit to Czechoslovakia in April 1987. In his main address in Prague he declared:\n\nAt the time, Eastern European analysts viewed this rhetoric as a way for Gorbachev to prevent an outright revolt of Eastern European countries from the Soviet bloc. Jim Hoagland wrote that Gorbachev's \"Common European Home\" and Bush's \"Europe Whole and Free\" were competing concepts describing the same situation: an economic and ideological collapse of Soviet power concurrent with the European Community gaining new dynamism and economic clout.\n\nOn June 12, 1989, Gorbachev arrived in Bonn, and held private talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Richard von Weizsäcker. The following day, Kohl and Gorbachev signed a joint declaration supporting national self-determination, mutual reduction in nuclear and conventional forces, and a \"Common European Home\" in which Canada and the United States have a role. He also stated that by appropriating Charles de Gaulle's \"Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals\" geographical definition, Gorbachev was attempting to keep the Soviet Union presence prescribed.\n\nIn his July 6, 1989, speech before the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Gorbachev declared:\n\nOn November 29, 1989, Gorbachev, en route to the upcoming Malta summit with President George H.W. Bush, arrived in Italy. He gave a speech the next day at the Rome city hall in which he sketched out the notion of the \"Common European Home\" as a commonwealth of sovereign and economically interdependent nations. He then also proposed a 1990 meeting of CSCE, and met with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican the following day.\n\nAt the time, analysts such as Robert D. Hormats saw the nascent European Community as primely positioned to take on the role of a Common European Home due to its \"moral, political and social – as well as economic – strength.\" Ronald D. Asmus noted that \"Gorbachev's vision of a Common European Home was predicated on the belief that reform in Eastern Europe could be controlled and that reformist communist parties would continue to play an important role in their countries' politics, including in the G.D.R.\" Finally, Coit D. Blacker wrote that Soviet leadership \"appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Eastern Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in western Europe.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "53488048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53488048", "title": "Corruption in Eritrea", "text": "Corruption in Eritrea\n\nCorruption in Eritrea is a considered a deeply serious and growing problem. The level of corruption used to be considerably lower in Eritrea than in many other African countries. Indeed, it was traditionally viewed as having a “strong ‘anti-corruption’ culture” and considered relatively “egalitarian and corruption-free.” In 2006, a report by Bertelsmann Stiftung stated that corruption, as of that date, was not a serious problem within Eritrea. While noting that there had been “cases of corruption since independence,” they existed on a negligible level, although politically-motivated corruption allegations have been made. But, in fact, corruption is said to have been growing steadily worse ever since 1998, when, not long after the end of its decades-long war of independence, a border conflict with Ethiopia led to another war.\n\nAnother source stated in 2015 that over the previous decade, corruption had become ingrained in Eritrean everyday life, with bribes required for most government services. Other alleged types of corruption include the payments of ransoms for hostages “under the eyes of the government.”\n\nOn Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2014, Eritrea ranked at 166th out of 175 countries. On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being highly corrupt and 100 very clean, its score in recent years has declined from 25 in 2012 to 20 in 2013 to 18 in 2014.\n\nEritrea was a part of Ethiopia until 1991, when Eritreans won a civil war that had lasted for thirty years and were granted independence. After a UN-supervised referendum, in which Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for independence, Eritrea declared its independence in 1993. At that time, Eritrea had a weak private sector with few skilled workers, a situation that led the government to take steps to build a strong private sector. During the 1990s, the private sector began to flourish and the economy grew significantly, causing many observers in the West to view Eritrea “as a beacon of Africa.” The decades of war, however, had planted the seeds of many social and economic problems, corruption among them.\n\nA 1998 border conflict with Ethiopia led to another war, which ended in 2000. Despite the official end of the war, warfare has continued on a lower scale. Meanwhile the regime has been accused of clamping down on free speech, shutting down private newspapers, shrinking the private sector, and imposing indefinite military service. All of these moves against individual liberty, human rights, and the free market have been factors in increased corruption. As of 2006, Eritrea had not yet held free elections; the Constitution adopted at the time of independence had not yet been implemented; the president was ruling by decree; the National Assembly had last met in 2002; opposition parties were prohibited, as were civic organizations, the right to assemble, and freedom of the press; the judiciary was inactive; the ruling party, government, and military formed “one single conglomerate of power” with “a low level of transparency.” Since 2001, civil liberties had been “gradually restricted,” with “numerous arbitrary arrests” and human-rights violations on an “alarming” scale. From 126th place on Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index, Eritrea dropped to 134th in 2012 and 166th in 2014.\n\nThe increase in state ownership in Eritrea has been critiqued as a step back for economic freedom and for doing business generally, partly because it has caused rising corruption. The 2012 Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom named Eritrea the second-worst country in sub-Saharan Africa for economic liberty. The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Project Index for 2011 ranked Eritrea at 180th, with only three countries, Guinea Bissau, Central African Republic, and Chad, scoring worse. It has been suggested that since the government maintains control over foreign exchange, friends of government personnel are allowed to bring goods into the country and sell them at great profit, thus increasing opportunities for corruption. Nonetheless, economic growth has been very strong since 2011, largely because of country's mining boom, which has placed Eritea among the fastest growing nations on earth; but corruption has kept this new wealth from reaching as many people as it might have. At the same time, the country has also been ravaged by drought.\n\nAmong the supposed factors breeding corruption in Eritrea is the intense concentration of power. The Eritrean Constitution calls for a separation of powers among the judiciary, executive, and legislative branches, but this has never been implemented. Isaias Afwerki, who has been president since 1993, has usurped the Congress's constitutional powers and is generally viewed as being all-powerful. The 19-member Executive Council consists entirely of presidential cronies. Eritrea's business community is composed mainly of personal associates of the regime's economic officials, fronts for top-level officials of the ruling party, and people who “enjoy the patronage of senior officers of the security and military establishments.” The government “controls all foreign exchanges” and is “virtually the only legal source of imports,” a situation that makes it possible for military and government officials to profit by collaborating with illegal smugglers. Similarly, the country's strict laws about importation and the inconsistency in the granting of exit visas enable customs and immigration officials to profit from bribery and money laundering. A 2014 report has described institutional corruption has \"erode[d] the foundations\" of economic development. The state's control on the economy allows for little private investment, while extremely low government salaries encourage corruption.\n\nAn additional factor in the spread and persistence of corruption is the lack of an independent press to report on it. Eritrea has been described as “Africa's biggest prison for the media.” The only news media are government-owned, and experts compare them to the Soviet media.\n\nThe 1997 Eritrean Constitution calls for a judiciary that is independent from parliament. None of this has been implemented, however. Instead there is a judicial system consisting of two separate court systems: Regular Courts that adjudicate disputes based on law and Special Courts that adjudicate disputes that are not based on law. The latter courts are supposed to address corruption, but are themselves considered by Amnesty International and other experts to be “one of the most corrupt and inhumane court systems” globally.\n\nA 2013 report by Transparency International UK called Eritrea the “most militarised country in Africa,” with about 20% of its population in uniform. For this reason, many have called Eritrea the 'North Korea' of Africa. The army is not only large but also one of the nine most corrupt armed forces in the world, along with Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, the DRC, Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. According to TI, there is a possible scheme in place of public funds earmarked for \"secret\" military purposes in the name of national security which are in truth appropriated illicitly. There are said to be several military-owned businesses with “unauthorised private enterprise by military personnel.”\n\nIn 1996, Eritrea's government declared that all land would henceforth be considered the property of the state and would be re-distributed in accordance with need. It then confiscated a good deal of private land and turned it over to former soldiers, foreign investors, and resettlement programs. The 1990s also saw the privatization of some companies, and since 2000 the government has increasingly intervened in the economy and commerce and propagandized against private trade and business. These activities have involved a considerable amount of favoritism, kickbacks, and other forms of corruption.\n\nIn July 2013, Martin Plaut reported that since 2011, the government had earned over $900 million from the Bisha gold mine, but it was not known what had happened to the money. Even as the state was reportedly amassing huge mining profits, Plaut charged, poverty and hardship were worsening. “There is some evidence,” he stated, “that show the [government] is gambling and squandering state resources without any accountability.”\n\nEritrea, as of 2011, was one of 8 nations considered to be Countries of Particular Concern (CPC) by the US State Department owing to the abuse and persecution of Christians. “Up to 3,000 Christians from unregistered church groups were held in detention” in 2011, according to Amnesty International. Between 2002 and 2011, many churches were closed, and tens of thousands of Christians fled the country; state-owned media have told the public that suppressed Christian groups were being paid by the CIA to destabilize the government, and have actively encouraged citizens to turn in persons whom they suspect of holding prayer meetings in their homes. This mass religious persecution has provided an opportunity for extensive corruption of a specific kind on the part of ruling-party politicians and military officials, who have arrested suspected Christians under the country's official anti-Christian policy and held them in prisons, unofficial detention centers, and military barracks in exchange for ransom.\n\nThere is reportedly no real organized effort in Eritrea to combat corruption. The regime has been described as using a “so-called war on corruption” to crack down on political dissenters and opponents. In May 2015, the president urged a group of party and government officials to discuss American and European pressure on Eritrea to reform its government and release detainees, yet when some of those officials proposed that the government reform in certain areas to appease Western nations that send aid to Eritrea, the president underscored the need to stand up to pressure from the “hegemonic West.” Business leaders in Eritrea were reportedly “shivering with fear” over what the president's comments might signify; it was said to be unclear if the rumors signified a wave of jailing or not.\n\nShortly after the aforementioned meeting, the president addressed the country on the 24th anniversary of Eritrean independence, denouncing “deluded and corrupt” state officials who, he charged, amassed wealth illegitimately. “Such deplorable practices of corruption and theft,” said the president, “must be combated vigorously.”\n"}
{"id": "41397305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41397305", "title": "Country life movement", "text": "Country life movement\n\nThe country life movement was an early 20th century American social movement which sought to improve the living conditions of America's rural residents. The movement focused on preserving traditional rural lifestyles while addressing poor living conditions and social problems within rural communities. Despite the movement's rural focus, many of its adherents were urbanites who sought to bring progressive changes and technological improvements to rural areas. The movement had little success in changing rural ways of life; its principal successes were the promotion of agricultural extension programs and the development of national organizations to improve rural living.\n\nThe country life movement's adherents largely fell into three schools of thought. The first group was mainly composed of urban agrarians who wished to improve rural living conditions in order to prevent farmers from flocking to cities and abandoning rural lifestyles. This philosophy held that rural lifestyles espoused certain moral values which were a positive influence on urbanites. Historian William Bowers has described this philosophy as contradictory, as these reformers sought to preserve a rural past while adding elements of urban life to rural lifestyles.\n\nA second segment of country-lifers sought to improve what they saw as declining rural living conditions by introducing progressive ideals to rural life. This group attempted to institute successful urban social reforms in rural areas. These reforms were partially designed to improve the efficiency of American agriculture; the reformers feared that a degenerate rural population would not provide sufficient food for urbanites. The main two goals of this segment of reformers involved reforming rural schools and rural churches, which they saw as lagging behind their urban counterparts.\n\nThe third group affiliated with the movement consisted of farmers who sought to bring technological progress to their profession. This group promoted agricultural extension and attempted to bring industrial reforms to American farms. In addition, they promoted the idea that farmers should adopt business practices in their profession.\n\nU.S. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed the Commission on Country Life in 1908 to address concerns raised by the country life movement. Horticulturalist Liberty Hyde Bailey was appointed chairman of the commission. Other members of the commission included agricultural scientist and sociologist Kenyon L. Butterfield, forester Gifford Pinchot, and future U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Henry Cantwell Wallace. The commission proposed three objectives for the improvement of rural life: a national agricultural extension program, scientific surveys of rural life, and the establishment of a national agency devoted to rural progress. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 accomplished the first objective by allowing rural counties to establish advisors through land-grant universities who would help spread technology to rural living. The third goal was accomplished in 1919 through the creation of the American Country Life Association.\n\nAs late as 1920, half the population lived in rural areas. They experienced their own progressive reforms, typically with the explicit goal of upgrading country life. Special efforts were made to reach the rural South and remote areas, such as the mountains of Appalachia and the Ozarks.\n\nThe most urgent need was better transportation to get out of the mud. The railroad system was virtually complete; the need was for much better roads. The traditional method of putting the burden on maintaining roads on local landowners was increasingly inadequate. New York State took the lead in 1898, and by 1916 the old system had been discarded everywhere. Demands grew for local and state government to take charge. With the coming of the automobile after 1910, urgent efforts were made to upgrade and modernize dirt roads designed for horse-drawn wagon traffic. The American Association for Highway Improvement was organized in 1910. Funding came from automobile registration, and taxes on motor fuels, as well as state aid. In 1916, federal-aid was first made available to improve post-roads, and promote general commerce. Congress appropriated $75 million over a five-year period, with the Secretary of Agriculture in charge through the Bureau of Public Roads, in cooperation with the state highway departments. There were 2.4 million miles of rural dirt rural roads in 1914; 100,000 miles had been improved with grading and gravel, and 3000 miles were given high quality surfacing. The rapidly increasing speed of automobiles, and especially trucks, made maintenance and repair a high-priority item. Concrete was first used in 1909, and expanded until it became the dominant surfacing material in the 1930s.\n\nRural schools were often poorly funded, one room operations taught by young local women before they married, with occasional supervision by county superintendents. The progressive solution was modernization through consolidation, so the children could be attend modern Schools taught by full-time professional teachers who had graduated from the college programs and were certified and monitored by the county superintendent. Farmers complained at the expense, and also at the loss of control over local affairs, but in state after state the consolidation process went forward.\n\nNumerous other programs were aimed at rural youth, including 4-H clubs, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. County fairs not only gave prizes for the most productive agricultural practices, they also demonstrated those practices to an attentive rural audience. Programs for new mothers included maternity care and training in baby care.\n\nThe movement's attempts at introducing urban reforms to rural America often met resistance from traditionalists who saw the country-lifers as aggressive modernizers who were condescending and out of touch with rural life. The traditionalists said many of their reforms were unnecessary and not worth the trouble of implementing. Rural residents also disagreed with the notion that farms needed to improve their efficiency, as they saw this goal as serving urban interests more than rural ones. The social conservatism of many rural residents also led them to resist attempts for change led by outsiders. Most important, the traditionalists did not want to become modern, and did not want their children inculcated with alien modern values through comprehensive schools that were remote from local control. The most successful reforms came from the farmers who pursued agricultural extension, as their proposed changes were consistent with existing trends in agriculture at the time.\n"}

{"id": "1716988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1716988", "title": "Curtilage", "text": "Curtilage\n\nIn law, the curtilage of a house or dwelling is the land immediately surrounding it, including any closely associated buildings and structures, but excluding any associated \"open fields beyond\", and also excluding any closely associated buildings, structures, or divisions that contain the separate intimate activities of their own respective occupants with those occupying residents being persons other than those residents of the house or dwelling of which the building is associated. It delineates the boundary within which a home owner can have a reasonable expectation of privacy and where \"intimate home activities\" take place. It is an important legal concept in certain jurisdictions for the understanding of search and seizure, conveyancing of real property, burglary, trespass, and land use planning.\n\nIn urban properties, the location of the curtilage may be evident from the position of fences, wall and similar; within larger properties it may be a matter of some legal debate as to where the private area ends and the \"open fields\" start.\n\nThe word derives from ; or ' (\"court, yard, garden\"); ' (court) + ' (diminutive suffix) + ' (-age).\n\nAt common law, which derives from English law, curtilage has been defined as \"the open space situated within a common enclosure belonging to a dwelling-house.\" Black's Law Dictionary of 1891 defined it as:\nWhere American homes are generally less likely than their English counterparts to include fenced or walled enclosures, the courts have not strictly held to such a requirement. In practice, determining the boundaries of curtilage has proven to be imprecise and subject to controversy.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has held that for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, an area immediately surrounding a house or dwelling is curtilage if it harbors the \"intimate activity associated with the 'sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.'\"\n\nIn \"United States v. Dunn\" (1987), the Court provided guidance, saying that, \"curtilage questions should be resolved with particular reference to four factors: the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.\"\n\nIn \"Florida v. Jardines\" (2013), the Court held, in a 5-4 decision by Justice Antonin Scalia, that the curtilage may not be used by a police dog to sniff for marijuana:\n\nIn \"Collins v. Virginia\" (2018), the Court ruled that motor vehicles parked within the curtilage do not qualify for the motor vehicle exception for a warrantless reasonable search.\n\nIn \"Dunn\", the Court said that the location of a barn, being from the home and \"outside\" of the fence which completely encircled the home, suggested that it was outside the home's curtilage.\n\nIn \"Jardines\", the Court found that a porch right in front of a private house is part of the curtilage.\n\nIn \"Dunn\", the Court said that although the area \"was\" surrounded by a fence, the home was surrounded by a different fence and \"that\" fence was obviously intended to demark a specific area of land immediately adjacent to the house that is readily identifiable as part and parcel of the house.\n\nIn \"Dunn\", the Court said that law enforcement officials had evidence that the area was not being used for intimate activities of the home, namely that it was being used to store large amounts of phenylacetic acid (used in the illegal manufacture of drugs) and that it had a very, very strong smell.\n\nIn \"Jardines\", the Court specifically named a front porch as a prime example of curtilage; even though Girl Scouts or salespersons can knock on the front door, they must leave immediately if there is no answer.\n\nIn \"Dunn\", the Court said the area was not protected at all from observation by those standing in open fields. Although agents did peer into a barn that was arguably protected by the Fourth Amendment, any such observation from open fields was not protected. (This is the \"plain view doctrine\", though it is not labeled as such in \"Dunn\".)\n\nIn \"Jardines\", the Court noted that, while police can stop a person on an open highway, they are prohibited from peering into the windows of a private home from the front porch, absent probable cause.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects \"persons, houses, papers, and effects\". In modern cases, the Supreme Court interprets \"a house\" to mean \"a home and its curtilage\". It is not obvious when the Court first equated \"house\" with \"home\", though \"Prigg v. Pennsylvania\" (1842) seems to assume that \"house\" means \"home\".\n\nThe first uses of the term \"curtilage\" by the Supreme Court appeared in the decisions of two unrelated cases from 1864. \"United States v. Stone\" (1864), involved a boundary dispute over Fort Leavenworth, as to \"what lands properly belonged to this military post, and the proper curtilage necessary for the use and enjoyment of it\".\n\nIn \"Sheets v. Selden's Lessee\" (1864), the Court referred to \"a grant of a messuage or a messuage with the appurtenances will carry the dwelling-house and adjoining buildings, and also its orchard, garden, and curtilage.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court holds that the Fourth Amendment protects homes and their curtilage from unreasonable searches without a warrant. However, curtilage is afforded less protection than a home. Absent \"No Trespassing\" signs or fences with locked gates, it is considered reasonable for a person (including a police officer) to walk from a public area to the obvious main entrance to the home using the most obvious path in order to \"knock and talk\" with a resident. But otherwise, government agents need consent, a warrant, or probable cause of exigent circumstances to enter a home's curtilage.\n\nMany state constitutions have clauses similar to the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and many have \"castle laws\" which use the term \"curtilage\". Although states are entitled to interpret their definitions different from (and subordinate to) the U.S. Fourth Amendment, they generally interpret \"houses\" the same way as does the Supreme Court, including its definition of \"curtilage\".\n\nThe concept of curtilage is relevant to town and country planning in the United Kingdom, particularly as it relates to listed building legislation. The consideration afforded to a listed building may extend to other structures or landscape within the curtilage of the primary structure, if the item(s) in the curtilage is old enough, and physically attached to the main building or otherwise important to the setting of the structure. Current legislation uses a cut-off date of 1947, so that later additions, while they may be within the curtilage, are not included in the listing designation.\n\nThe listing of a building or structure does not define its specific curtilage, and so this can become a matter of interpretation and contention.

It also connotes a higher authority given to lower level functionaries, executives, and workers. This can be in any organization of any size, from a governmental authority to a corporation. However, the context in which the term is used is generally that of larger organizations. This distribution of power, in effect, has far-reaching implications for the fields of management, organizational behavior, and government.\n\nThe decisions arising from a process of decentralized decision-making are the functional result of group intelligence and crowd wisdom. Decentralized decision-making also contributes to the core knowledge of group intelligence and crowd wisdom, often in a subconscious way a la Carl Jung's collective unconscious.\n\nDecision theory is a method of deductive reasoning based on formal probability and deductive reasoning models. It is also studied in a specialized field of mathematics wherein models are used to help make decisions in all human activities including the sciences and engineering. (See also Game theory, Uncertainty, Expectation maximization principle.)\n\nDecentralization and centralization have been consistent themes throughout history pertaining to governmental authority and political theory. From the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, there have been periods of centralization and decentralization in societies worldwide. Almost any political movement, from the rise of city states in Roman times, to the later rise and downfall of feudal empires during the middle ages, to the rise of fascism in Germany prior to World War II, to the late 20th century formation of the European Economic Union, the history of Europe has been one of cycles of centralization and decentralization.\n\nMIT Professor Thomas W. Malone explains that \"decentralization has three general benefits:\n\n\nDecentralized decision-making, Malone says, tends to create less rigidity and flatter hierarchies in organizations. When upper management delegates decision-making responsibilities, there also exist wider spans of control among managers, creating a more lateral flow of information. Thus there will be more bottom up directional information flow, allowing for more innovation and efficiency closer to the means of production. This increased flow information thereby allows for innovation in what is called Total quality management.\n\n\n\n"}

Densho offers a free online digital archive of the primary sources for educational purposes.\n\nThe Japanese word \"denshō\" (伝承) means \"to pass on to future generations.\" The organization was founded in 1996 with a primary goal of collecting personal testimonies from Japanese Americans who were incarcerated in internment camps during World War II. Over the years, its mission expanded to \"educate, preserve, collaborate, and inspire action for equity\". Densho uses digital technology and best archival practices to collect, record, preserve, and share its oral histories, documents, photographs, newspapers, and other primary source materials documenting the wartime detention of nearly 120,000 people of Japanese descent without due process of law.\n\nDensho is a 501(c) 3 tax-exempt status, founded in Seattle in 1996 as a project of the Japanese American Chamber of Commerce of Washington State. It became an independent organization in 2002. The annual operating budget is approximately $.5 million. Densho has a Board of Trustees with nine members and a staff of seven, led by Executive Director Tom Ikeda. Program activities are supported by over 100 volunteers and graduate student interns. Financial support is provided by foundation and government grants, corporate sponsorship of the Sushi & Sake Fest fundraising event, and individual donations.\n\nDensho has received the first NPower Innovation Award for groundbreaking use of technology; the Association of King Country Historical Organization long-term project award; an American Library Association citation for online history; and a Washington State Historical Society award. The Executive Director, Tom Ikeda, has received a Humanities Washington Award for outstanding contributions to the humanities and the Japanese American Citizens League Biennium Award, among other honors.\n\nDensho's online archive contains over 700 hours of indexed and transcribed video interviews and 10,000 historic photos and documents. The website also includes free social studies curricula meeting Washington-State standards. Over 350 video interviews detail individuals' experiences at the 10 War Relocation Authority camps as well as the Justice Department and War Department detention facilities. In addition, Japanese Americans who were not detained, as well as Caucasian employees in the camps tell their stories to Densho. Prominent people such as Norman Mineta, Senator Daniel Inouye, Dale Minami are included in the collection, but the organization's goal is to capture life stories of diverse Japanese Americans from all walks of life. Densho continues to interview survivors of the camps and others who can describe how the forced removal and detention affected people's lives. The broader goal is to inform the public about the false basis for the mass incarceration so that a similar injustice does not affect another group.\n\nDensho presents public education programs such as author talks, and collaborates with cultural organizations such as the Wing Luke Asian Museum, the Museum of History and Industry, and the Washington State Holocaust Education Resource Center. Densho assists oral history generation and preservation by other ethnic heritage and cultural organizations, such as the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Community and the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. These efforts expand and enrich Densho’s mission by drawing connections with the Japanese American experience and other little-recorded and seldom discussed stories of discrimination, racism, and stereotyping faced by many ethnic communities, both in the past and today.\n\nDensho offers curriculum units investigating civil liberties issues. For example, the lesson \"Causes of Conflict\" guides students through a study of the issues of immigration via the essential question: \"How do conflicts over immigration arise from labor needs and social change?\" In the unit \"Dig Deep,\" they explore the media and the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II by asking the question, \"How do members of a democracy become fully informed so that they can participate responsibly and effectively?\" In the unit \"Constitutional Issues: Civil Liberties, Individuals, and the Common Good,\" students find answers to the question, \"How can the United States balance the rights of individuals with the common good?\" Densho's education efforts encourage students' critical thinking and respect for everyone's civil liberties.\n"}

The practice of exploitation colonialism contrasts with settler colonialism, the policy of conquering a country to establish a branch of the metropole (motherland). A reason for which a country might practice exploitation colonialism is the immediate financial gain produced by the low-cost extraction of raw materials by means of a native people, usually administered by a colonial government.\n\nThe geopolitics of an Imperialist power determine which of these colonial practices it will follow. In the example of the British Empire, colonists settled mainly in northern North America and in Australia, where the native populations declined due to disease and violence in the course of establishing a facsimile society of the metropole. Whereas the densely populated countries of the British Raj (1858–1947), in the Indian subcontinent, and the British occupation of Egypt and South Africa, as well as the island of Barbados, were ruled by a small populace of colonial administrators (colonial government) that redirected the local economies to exploitation management to supply the metropole with food, raw materials, and some finished goods.\n\nExploitation was often reinforced by colonial European geographers who implemented theories such as environmental determinism, which suggested warmer climates produced less civilized people. These theories were among the scholarly canon that helped legitimize colonial activity and expansion into overseas territories.\n\nGeographers such as Friedrich Ratzel suggested that the survival of empire relied on its ability to expand its control and influence around the world. By implying a correlation between colonial expansion and national success, geographers were able to produce a sense of nationalism within many European nations. Their influence created a sense of pride that was able to reassure subjects that their nation’s activity abroad was beneficial to not only them, but that their presence was necessary within the territories being occupied.\n\nBarbados was claimed for the English in 1625 by Captain John Powell, and by the 1660s the English had come to regard Barbados as being by far and away their most highly prized possession anywhere in the New World. The island's value to England, and the enormous wealth of a minority of its English inhabitants, hinged on the relationship that had been forged during the previous twenty years between sugar and slavery.\n\n"}

{"id": "665257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=665257", "title": "Heimwehr", "text": "Heimwehr\n\nThe Heimwehr (, \"Home Guard\") or sometimes Heimatschutz (, \"Homeland Protection\")\nwere a nationalist, initially paramilitary group operating within Austria during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's Freikorps. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the Heimatblock, which cooperated with Engelbert Dollfuss' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the Fatherland Front by decree of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the \"Frontmiliz\".\n\nFormed mainly from demobilised soldiers after World War I, the Heimwehr were initially formed as loosely organized militias to defend the borders of Austria. As with Germany's Freikorps, there was no formal national leadership or political program at the beginning, but rather local groupings which responded actively to whatever they considered to be ideologically unpalatable. In Carinthia, for example, they formed to protect their region from Slovene and Yugoslav troops. Ignaz Seipel, Christian Social Austrian Chancellor at the time, reorganized the Heimwehr as an \"answer to the Socialist Schutzbund\"\nin an attempt to curb socialist power. The increasing politicalization of militias led to the Heimwehr involvement in helping the police suppress the July Revolt of 1927.\n\nThe most distinctive part of the \"Heimwehren\" uniforms was a green loden hat with the tail feather of a black grouse (which had earlier been the Symbol of the Tyrolean \"Kaiserschützen\"). Therefore, \"Heimwehr\" fighters were ridiculed by their opponents as \"rooster tails\" \"(Hahnenschwanzler)\".\n\nThe Heimwehr continued to lack any real national coherence up to 1930, when Heimwehr leaders committed themselves to the Korneuburg Oath, which established an Austrian conservative nationalism base (as distinct from the pan-German nationalism of the Nazi Party), a rejection of liberal democracy and Marxism, in favour of a more autocratic government, and a rejection of \"class struggle\" (\"see\" Austrofascism). This initiative was spearheaded by Richard Steidle, who was supported by German emigre Waldemar Pabst in his attempts to convince the Heimwehr to support the corporatist-state economic policy which Benito Mussolini was putting into practice in Italy.\n\nWhen Walter Pfrimer, regional head in Styria attempted a coup in 1931, he received no support from other Heimwehr leaders. After this, many Heimwehr groupings, including the Styrian section, increasingly defected to the Nazi Party.\n\nTensions continued between Austrian section of the Nazi Party, who believed in a pan-Germanic state, which would bring Austria into a Greater German Empire and the Heimwehr, who believed that Austria should remain an independent nation. This led to low level violence, including one incident where Nazi Party members attacked a Heimwehr march with eggs.\n\nAfter Engelbert Dollfuss created the Fatherland Front in 1934, he gained control over and incorporated the Heimwehr into other right-wing militaries with the help of Heimwehr leader Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg. Politically, the Heimwehr suffered a decline in support and significance due to the pan-German, nationalist allure of the Nazis and Italy's gradual reorientation of its foreign policy towards Germany. As a result of these factors, Dollfuss' successor, Kurt Schuschnigg, absorbed the remaining Heimwehr elements into the Fatherland Front in 1936, and it ceased to exist as a political grouping. Ernst Starhemberg was left out of the new governmental order in an attempt to end rivalries between private armies.\n\n"}
{"id": "5204901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5204901", "title": "History of the Labour Party (Ireland)", "text": "History of the Labour Party (Ireland)\n\nThe Labour Party has been part of the political scene in the Republic of Ireland throughout that state's existence. Although never attracting majority support, it has repeatedly participated in coalition governments.\n\nThe party was established in 1912 by James Connolly James Larkin, and William X. O'Brien and others as the political wing of the Irish Trade Union Congress. It intended to participate in a Dublin Parliament that would follow passage of the Home Rule Act 1914, which was suspended on the outbreak of World War I. Connolly was executed following the Easter Rising in 1916, and was succeeded as leader by Thomas Johnson. The party stood aside from the elections of 1918 and 1921, but despite divisions over acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty it did well in the 1922 elections, initially forming the main opposition party in the Dáil Éireann (parliament) of the Irish Free State.\n\nThe subsequent years were marked by rivalry between factions led by William X. O'Brien and James Larkin, with William Norton becoming leader. Between 1932 and 1938 the Labour Party supported Éamon de Valera's minority Fianna Fáil government. From 1948–1951 and from 1954–1957 the Labour Party entered government alongside Fine Gael and other parties, with Norton as Tánaiste. During this period the party also stood for elections in Northern Ireland, after a split in the Northern Ireland Labour Party. In 1960 Brendan Corish became the new Labour leader. As leader he advocated and introduced more socialist policies to the party. Between 1973 and 1987 Labour three times more went into coalition governments with Fine Gael. Dick Spring became leader in 1982, amid growing controversy within the party over these coalitions and the growth of parties to the left of Labour.\n\nIn 1990 Mary Robinson became President of Ireland with Labour support. After mergers with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Independent Socialist Party, Labour performed well in the 1992 general election and formed a coalition with Fianna Fáil, with Spring as Tánaiste, then in 1994 without a further election joined a coalition with Fine Gael and Democratic Left (the “Rainbow Coalition”). After defeat in the 1997 general election, Labour merged with Democratic Left, and the former Democratic Left member Pat Rabbitte became leader in 2002. Rabbitte implemented the “Mullingar Accord”, a pre-election voting pact with Fine Gael, but this did not lead to greater election success for Labour in the 2007 elections, and Rabbitte resigned to be replaced by Eamon Gilmore. The 2011 general election saw one of Labour's best results, with over 19% of the first-preference votes. Labour once more entered a coalition government with Fine Gael, and the Irish presidential election later that year saw the Labour Party's candidate, Michael D. Higgins, elected as President. However, Labour in government experienced a series of dismissals and resignations among its members in the Dáil. In 2014, Gilmore resigned as party leader after Labour's poor performance in the European and local elections, and Joan Burton was elected as the new leader.\n\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, considerable debate took place within the Irish Trade Union Congress on whether the organised trade union movement in Ireland should take part in political activity. James Connolly, and James Larkin as the leaders of the new and dynamic Irish Transport and General Workers Union (ITGWU), led the calls for political action and representation for trade unionists. Opposition came from northern trade unionists and others who wanted links with the British Labour Party, and from supporters of the Irish Parliamentary Party.\n\nThe catalyst for the launch of a congress-sponsored party was the introduction and successful progress of the Third Home Rule Bill in 1912. At its meeting in Clonmel in 1912, the congress took up the question of a political party. James Connolly presented the resolution that the congress establish its own party. He argued that since Home Rule was imminent and would take place once the House of Lords' delaying powers were exhausted in two years' time, that this period should be used to organise the new party. Connolly's resolution was carried by a wide margin with 49 voting for; 19 against; and 19 abstaining.\n\nThe congress also supported the introduction of salaries for members of parliament, public funding of elections and female suffrage. The founding of the Labour Party was disrupted by personality differences between Larkin and his fellow leaders, including Connolly. Nevertheless, the 1913 congress meeting under William O'Brien's chairmanship instructed the executive to proceed with the writing of a party constitution.\n\nThe proposed constitution limited party membership to affiliated trade unions and councils only and excluded individual membership and other involvement, such as by co-operative societies and socialist groups. Thomas Johnson argued that Labour would be \"swamped\" by farmer co-operatives and that individuals might join through trade councils. Connolly argued that there should be just one body and that a separate Labour Party as in Britain would encourage the \"professional politician\". The ITUC decided to add \"and Labour Party\" to its name and became the Irish Trade Union Congress and Labour Party (ITUC and LP). At the 1914 Congress, it was agreed for the first time to seek the reconstruction of society: \"the Congress urges that labour unrest can only be ended by the abolition of the capitalist system of wealth production with its inherent injustice and poverty.\" Curiously, the ITUC and LP took no part in the 1913 lock-out struggle in Dublin, and Labour did poorly in local elections in Dublin in January 1914.\n\nThe ITUC and LP was seriously troubled by the proposals in 1914 to exclude certain Ulster counties from Home Rule as this would undermine the potential of the new party by excluding the substantial industrial areas of north east Ulster. Fourteen of the 34 urban seats in the Home Rule parliament were to be in Belfast alone. The start of the First World War in the summer of 1914 transformed the political situation in Ireland. The Home Rule Bill became law but its operation was postponed until after the war. The official Labour position did not directly oppose Irish support for the British war effort, but it was critical of the war in general terms. Labour skirted the issue in an attempt to avoid division between unionist and nationalist trade unionists. Larkin opposed the war before he left for the USA and Connolly condemned John Redmond's support for Irish nationalists involvement in army recruitment. Gradually, Labour opposition to the spectre of conscription moved the party's position closer to that of the separatists. To avoid making a decision on the war, Labour called off its congress in 1915.\n\nJames Connolly was the only leading Labour figure to take part in the Easter Rising in 1916. His execution after the rebellion left the labour movement in some disarray. Liberty Hall, the physical symbol of the labour movement, was destroyed, and the files of the ITUCLP were seized. Many trade union leaders, in Dublin, who had not taken part in the Rising were interned, such as William O'Brien, but they were released later when the British realised that they had no direct involvement. Their absence allowed non-nationalist leaders to come to the fore, especially Thomas Johnson, who was not charismatic, but was a moderate and hardworking man.\n\nDespite his English background, his sheer diligence and devotion to his duties gave him the leading position in labour politics for the next decade. He managed to persuade the authorities to release the trade union leaders in time for the congress meeting in Sligo in August 1916. In his chairman's address, Johnson avoided taking a stand on the Rising and instead called for a minute's silence to honour the memory of Connolly and his comrades. He mourned the dead in the trenches and expressed personal support for the Allies. Johnson's stance in refusing to accept any responsibility for the Rising was regarded as a success as it avoided division between north and south, and laid the stress on economic and social issues.\n\nIn Larkin's absence and Connolly's demise, William X. O'Brien became the dominant figure in the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union joining it in January 1917, and quickly becoming the leader of that union and wielding considerable influence in the Labour Party. O'Brien, along with Johnson, also dominated the Irish Trade Union Congress and Labour Party. O'Brien took a leading role in the growing separatist movement that would become the revitalised Sinn Féin. The Labour Party, now led by Thomas Johnson, as successor to such organisations as D.D. Sheehan's (independent labour MPs) Irish Land and Labour Association (ILLA), found itself marginalised by the preeminence that Sinn Féin gave to the national question. De Valera and others expressed sympathy for the labour movement's objectives but made clear that Labour must wait. The congress-party strongly opposed the moves to introduce conscription into Ireland in 1918, and a twenty-four-hour strike was successfully called on 23 April 1918. Only the Belfast area ignored the strike call. That spring, Labour announced that it would take part in the General Election to be held immediately after the war ended. De Valera and other Sinn Féin leaders were highly critical of what they saw as a divisive step by the ITUCLP. At the congress held in August 1918, the executive reported that Labour's hour of destiny had struck and it found the movement ready. O'Brien urged the development of electoral machinery. At this moment, the first signs of the split between O'Brien and the Larkinites became evident. PT Daly, the protégé of Larkin, was locked in a struggle with O'Brien and was beaten by 114 votes to 109 for the post of secretary of the Congress. Daly was later to be purged by O'Brien from the leadership of the ITGWU, setting the scene for a long-lasting split in Irish trade unionism. Following the congress, Labour was finally forced to deal with the issues of national self-determination and abstention from parliament.\n\nSinn Féin entered into discussions with Labour to secure its abstention from the forthcoming election. Labour was again faced with the dilemma that it might win some seats by entering into a pact with Sinn Féin at the price of alienation of northern unionist workers. Labour offered a radical election programme. Among other objectives, it declared that it would win for the workers the collective ownership and control of the whole produce of their work; adopt the principles of the Russian Revolution; secure the democratic management of all industries in the interest of the nation; and abolish all privileges which were based on property or ancestry.\n\nIn the end, a special party conference voted by 96 votes to 23 that the ITUCLP would not contest the 1918 general election, to allow the election to take the form of a plebiscite on Ireland's constitutional status. Sinn Féin went on to gain 73 of the 105 seats in the General Election and convened the First Dáil in January 1919. The Democratic Programme of the First Dáil was jointly drafted by Seán T. O'Kelly of Sinn Féin and Thomas Johnson of Labour. Despite being eventually pruned of much of its socialist content, some of the original radical elements survived. Sinn Féin paid its debt of honour to the Labour Party for its abstention by including in the Programme that every citizen was to be entitled to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour; the government would concern itself with the welfare of children, and would care for the aged and infirm; and it would seek \"a general and lasting improvement in the conditions under which the working classes live and labour\".\n\nLabour took part in the 1920 local elections and won a significant role in local government for the first time. It gained 394 seats compared to 550 for Sinn Féin, 355 for the unionists, 238 for the old nationalists, and 161 independents.\n\nIn 1921, the ITUCLP again agreed with Sinn Féin that it would not take part in the election for the new Southern Ireland parliament envisaged by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. This left the field clear for Sinn Féin to treat these elections as the election to the Second Dáil. As a result of these decisions, the party was absent from the Dáil during the vital years of the independence struggle. Following the Truce of July 1921, Labour was not involved in any way in the negotiations that led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921, by which a new Irish Free State would be established as a Dominion of the British Empire equivalent in status to Canada.\n\nThe Anglo-Irish Treaty divided the Labour party. It did not take an official stand. From his American prison cell, Jim Larkin opposed the Treaty while the only Labour member of the Dáil, Richard Corish of Wexford spoke and voted for the Treaty. Johnson, never a republican, privately supported the Treaty, while O'Brien did not oppose it. Following the approval of the Treaty by the Dáil in January 1922, the executive of the ITUCLP succeeded at a special conference held in February, in passing a motion to participate in the forthcoming General Election. Successful Labour candidates were required to take their seats in the new Free State Dáil, and a reformist programme was adopted.\n\nJohnson and the other Labour leaders tried to stop the slide to civil war to no avail, including holding a one-day national strike across the 26 counties on 24 April. Labour candidates were nominated for the election on 16 June, despite the difficulties of poor organisation, internal opposition to participation and limited finance. When The Collins/De Valera Pact was agreed on 20 May, the pressure on the party was intensified. The Pact provided for the pro and anti Treaty sides to have one agreed slate of candidates with a coalition government to be established afterwards. Other parties and groups, including Labour, were asked to stand down again in the national interest. Effectively, the old Sinn Féin was about to deny a democratic election from being held and to prevent the public expressing their preferences. While de Valera had a notable success in persuading Patrick Hogan, a future Labour Ceann Comhairle, from standing in Clare, 18 other Labour candidates resisted the pressures on them from the IRA and went forward for election. These were perceived as pro-Treaty, and when Michael Collins repudiated the Pact four days before the election, it benefited the Labour Party as well as the pro-Treaty party. Seventeen of the eighteen Labour candidates won seats, with the 18th losing only by 13 votes. Some candidates had nearly twice the quota but had no running mates to transfer their surplus votes.\n\nAs well as being a triumph for the Labour Party, the election confirmed the popular acceptance of the Treaty. The Civil War broke out shortly later, between the IRA and the new National Army, and ravaged the country in the following months. The new Dáil did not meet until September preventing Labour from having any influence over events. Public opinion and voting habits crystallised in a deeply polarised fashion in this period between the two sides of the national movement, and led to the effective marginalisation of the Labour Party and of social and economic issues that was to last for the rest of the twentieth century.\n\nWhen the third Dáil eventually met in September, Labour attempted to amend the new Free State Constitution to remove the elements imposed by the Treaty but pragmatically accepted the new order when it was adopted. The Labour deputies took the controversial oath of fidelity to the British monarch, viewing it as a formality.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, an economic slump and collapse in union membership led to a loss in support for the party. In the 1923 election Labour only won 14 seats. However, from 1922 until Fianna Fáil TDs took their seats in 1927, Labour was the major opposition party in the Dáil. It attacked the lack of social reform by the Cumann na nGaedheal government. Johnson became the leading figure in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the leader of the Opposition to the new Government.\n\nIn 1923 Larkin returned to Ireland. He hoped to take over the leadership role he had left, but O'Brien resisted him. Larkin sided with the more radical elements of the party and in September that year he established the Irish Worker League.\n\nIn 1932 the Labour Party supported Éamon de Valera's first Fianna Fáil government, which had proposed a programme of social reform with which the party was in sympathy. In the 1940s it looked for a while as if Labour would replace Fine Gael as the main opposition party. In the 1943 general election the party won 17 seats, its best result since 1927. But further aspirations were disappointed as the party was damaged by internal division for the remainderof the decade.\n\nThe Larkin-O'Brien feud still continued, and worsened over time. In the 1940s the hatred caused a split in the Labour party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. In 1944 O'Brien left and founded the National Labour Party. O'Brien also withdrew the ITGWU from the Irish Trade Unions Congress and set up his own congress. The split damaged the Labour movement in the 1944 general election. It was only after Larkin's death in 1947 that an attempt at unity could be made.\n\nDuring this period the party also occasionally stood for election in Northern Ireland, on occasion winning the odd seat at both the Westminster Parliament and Stormont Parliament in the Belfast area. However the party is not known to have contested an election in the region since Gerry Fitt, then the party's sole Stormont MP, left the party to form the Republican Labour Party in 1964.\n\nFrom 1948–1951 and from 1954–1957 the Labour Party was the second-largest partner in the two inter-party governments. William Norton, the Labour leader, became Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare on both occasions.\n\nIn 1960 Brendan Corish became the new Labour leader. As leader he advocated and introduced more socialist policies to the party. Between 1973 and 1977 the Labour Party formed a coalition government with Fine Gael. The coalition partners lost the subsequent election in 1977. Corish resigned immediately after the defeat.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1982 and from 1982 to 1987, Labour participated in coalition governments with Fine Gael. In the later part of the second of these coalition terms, the country's poor economic and fiscal situation required strict curtailing of government spending, and Labour bore much of the blame for unpopular cutbacks in health and other social services. In the 1987 general election it received only 6.4% of the vote, and its vote was increasingly threatened by the growth of the Workers' Party. Fianna Fáil formed a minority government from 1987 to 1989 and then a coalition with the Progressive Democrats.\n\nThe 1980s saw fierce disagreements between left and right wings of the party. The more radical elements, led by figures including Emmet Stagg, opposed the idea of going into coalition government with either of the major centre-right parties. At the 1989 Labour conference in Tralee a number of socialist and Marxist activists, organised around the Militant newspaper, were expelled. These expulsions continued during the early 1990s and those expelled, including Joe Higgins went on to found the Socialist Party.\n\nThese rows ended with the defeat of the anti-coalition left. In the period since, there have been further discussions about coalitions in the Party but these disagreements have primarily been over the merits of different coalition partners rather than over the principle of coalition. Related arguments have taken place from time to time over the wisdom of entering into pre-election voting pacts with other parties. Indeed, former radicals like Stagg himself and Michael D. Higgins now themselves support coalition.\n\nIn 1990 Mary Robinson became the first President of Ireland to have been proposed by the Labour Party, although she contested the election as an independent candidate. Not only was it the first time a woman held the office but it was the first time, apart from Douglas Hyde, that a non-Fianna Fáil candidate was elected. Mary Robinson became one of the most outspoken and active presidents in the history of the state. In 1990 the Party merged with the Limerick East TD Jim Kemmy's Democratic Socialist Party and in 1992 it merged with Sligo–Leitrim TD Declan Bree's Independent Socialist Party.\n\nAt the 1992 general election on 25 November Labour won a record 19.3% of the first-preference votes, more than twice its share in the 1989 election. The party's representation in the Dáil doubled to 33 seats and, after a period of negotiations, Labour formed a coalition with Fianna Fáil, taking office in January 1993 as the 23rd Government of Ireland. Fianna Fáil leader Albert Reynolds remained as Taoiseach, and Labour leader Dick Spring became Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\nAfter less than two years the government fell in a controversy over the appointment of Attorney General, Harry Whelehan, as president of the High Court. The parliamentary arithmetic had changed as a result of Fianna Fáil's loss of two seats in by-elections in June and Labour negotiated a new coalition, the first time in Irish political history that one coalition replaced another without a general election. Between 1994 and 1997 Fine Gael, the Labour Party, and Democratic Left governed in the so-called Rainbow Coalition. Dick Spring of Labour became Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs again.\n\nLabour presented the 1997 election, held just weeks after spectacular victories for the French Parti Socialiste and Tony Blair's New Labour, as the first ever choice between a government of the left and one of the right, but the party, as had often been the case following its participation in coalitions, lost support and failed to retain half of its Dáil seats. A poor performance by Labour candidate Adi Roche in the subsequent election for President of Ireland led to Spring's resignation as party leader.\n\nIn 1997 Ruairi Quinn became the new Labour leader. Negotiations started almost immediately and in 1999 the Labour Party merged with Democratic Left, keeping the name of the larger partner.\n\nQuinn resigned as leader in 2002 following the poor results for the Labour Party in the general election, when the Labour Party was returned with only 21 seats, the same number of seats as it had held before that General Election. Former Democratic Left TD Pat Rabbitte became the new leader, the first to be elected directly by the members of the party.\n\nIn the June 2004 elections to the European Parliament, Proinsias De Rossa retained his seat for Labour in the Dublin constituency. This was Labour's only success in the election.\n\nFollowing the 2005 endorsement, by the Labour Party conference in Tralee, of a pre-election voting transfer pact with the Fine Gael party in 2005, the party saw increased co-operation between the party leaders, Pat Rabbitte and the Fine Gael leader, Enda Kenny, as well as the party's front benches.\n\nFollowing on from the Mullingar Accord, an election pact preceding the 2004 Local and European elections, where Fine Gael benefited largely, a number of mutually acceptable and compatible policy documents were published in the lead up to the elections. The two parties formed the \"Alliance for Change\" in the run up to the election and pursued joint policies and economic constings in major policy areas. However though Fine Gael gained 20 seats in the election in 2007, Labour's vote continued to stagnate at 10.13%, a marginal decline from 2002 and it returned with 20 seats, one less than before.\n\nRabbitte resigned as leader in August 2007, a year ahead of his six-year term came to an end. Éamon Gilmore, Deputy for Dún Laoghaire replaced Rabbitte, and expressed a preference for an independent strategy, emphasising the need for Labour to concentrate on itself, rather than following media interest in its alliance with other parties.\n\nThe Labour Party donated its archives to the National Library of Ireland in 2012. The records can be accessed by means of the call number: MS 49,494. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "788791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=788791", "title": "Incomes policy", "text": "Incomes policy\n\nIncomes policies in economics are economy-wide wage and price controls, most commonly instituted as a response to inflation, and usually seeking to establish wages and prices below free market level.\n\nIncomes policies have often been resorted to during wartime. During the French Revolution, \"The Law of the Maximum\" imposed price controls (by penalty of death) in an unsuccessful attempt to curb inflation, and such measures were also attempted after World War II. Peacetime income policies were resorted to in the US in August 1971 as a response to inflation. The wage and price controls were effective initially but were made less restrictive in January 1973, and later removed when they seemed to be having no effect on curbing inflation. Incomes policies were successful in the United Kingdom during World War II but less successful in the post-war era.\n\nIncomes policies vary from \"voluntary\" wage and price guidelines to mandatory controls like price/wage freezes. One variant is \"tax-based incomes policies\" (TIPs), where a government fee is imposed on those firms that raise prices and/or wages more than the controls allow.\n\nSome economists agree that a credible incomes policy would help prevent inflation. However, by arbitrarily interfering with price signals, it provides an additional bar to achieving economic efficiency, potentially leading to shortages and declines in the quality of goods on the market and requiring large government bureaucracies for enforcement. That happened in the United States during the early 1970s. When the price of a good is lowered artificially, it creates less supply and more demand for the product, thereby creating shortages.\n\nSome economists argue that incomes policies are less expensive (more efficient) than recessions as a way of fighting inflation, at least for mild inflation. Others argue that controls and mild recessions can be complementary solutions for relatively mild inflation.\n\nThe policy has the best chance of being credible and effective for the sectors of the economy dominated by monopolies or oligopolies, particularly nationalised industry, with a significant sector of workers organized in labor unions. Such institutions enable collective negotiation and monitoring of the wage and price agreements.\n\nOther economists argue that inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon, and the only way to deal with it is by controlling the money supply, directly or by changing interest rates. They argue that price inflation is only a symptom of previous monetary inflation caused by central bank money creation. They believe that without a totally planned economy the incomes policy can never work, the excess money in the economy greatly distorting other areas, exempt from the policy.\n\nDuring the French Revolution in the 1790s, \"The Law of the Maximum\" was imposed in an attempt to decrease inflation. It consisted of limits on wages and food prices. Many dissidents were executed for breaking this law. The law was repealed 14 months after its introduction.\n\nBy turning the crimes of price gouging and food hoarding into crimes against the government, France had limited success. With respect to its overt intention, that of ensuring the people were able to purchase food at a reasonable rate, the Maximum was mostly a failure. Some merchants having found themselves forced into a position to sell their goods for a price lower than what it cost to create it (i.e. cost of baking bread, growing vegetables, etc.,) chose to hide their expensive goods from the market, either for personal use or for sale on the black market. However, the General Maximum was very successful in deflecting a volatile political issue away from the Committee of Public Safety and Robespierre, enabling them to focus on larger political issues more closely related to completing the French Revolution.\n\nIn creating the General Maximum, Maximilien Robespierre shifted the attention of the French people away from government involvement in widespread shortages of money and food to a fight between consumers and merchants. The text of the General Maximum was written towards businessmen who were profiting on a large scale from the demise of the French economy. However, in practice, the law ultimately targeted local shopkeepers, butchers, bakers, and farmers-the merchants who were profiting the least from the economic crisis. With the General Maximum, Robespierre offered the people an answer regarding whom to blame for their poverty and their hunger. Furthermore, considering its association with the Law of Suspects, when a citizen informed the government about a merchant who was in violation of the law, they were considered to have done their civic duty.\n\nDuring World War II, price controls were used in an attempt to control wartime inflation. The Franklin Roosevelt Administration instituted the OPA (Office of Price Administration). That agency was rather unpopular with business interests and was phased out as quickly as possible after peace had been restored. However, the Korean War brought a return to the same inflationary pressures, and price controls were again established, this time under the OPS (Office of Price Stabilization).\n\nIn the early 1970s, inflation had been much higher than in previous decades, getting above 6% briefly in 1970 and persisting above 4% in 1971. U.S. President Richard Nixon imposed price controls on August 15, 1971. This was a move widely applauded by the public and a number of Keynesian economists. The 90-day freeze was unprecedented in peacetime, but such drastic measures were thought necessary. Also motivating the controls, on the same date that the controls were imposed, 15 August 1971, Nixon also suspended the convertibility of the dollar into gold, which was the beginning of the end of the Bretton Woods system of international currency management established after World War II. It was quite well known at the time that this would likely lead to an immediate inflationary impulse (essentially because the subsequent depreciation of the dollar would boost the demand for exports and increase the cost of imports). The controls aimed to stop that impulse. The fact that the election of 1972 was on the horizon likely contributed to both Nixon's application of controls and his ending of the convertibility of the dollar.\n\nThe 90-day freeze became nearly 1,000 days of measures known as Phases One, Two, Three, and Four, ending in 1973. In these phases, the controls were applied almost entirely to the biggest corporations and labor unions, which were seen as having price-setting power. However, 93% of requested price increases were granted and seen as necessary to meet costs. With such monopoly power, some economists saw controls as possibly working effectively (though they are usually skeptical on the issue of controls). Because controls of this sort can calm inflationary expectations, this was seen as a serious blow against stagflation.\n\nThe first wave of controls were successful at curbing inflation temporarily while the administration used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. However, the long-term effects proved to be destabilizing. Left unsuppressed after the initial price controls were relaxed, the overly expansionary policies proceeded to exacerbate inflationary pressures. Meat also began disappearing from grocery store shelves and Americans protested wage controls that didn't allow wages to keep up with inflation.\n\nSince that time, the U.S. government has not imposed maximum prices on consumer items or labor (although the cap on oil and natural gas prices persisted for years after 1973). During times of high inflation, controls have been called for; in 1980 during unprecedented inflation, \"BusinessWeek\" editorialized in favor of semi-permanent wage and price controls.\n\nDuring the 1974 federal election, Progressive Conservative Party leader Robert Stanfield proposed the imposition of a wage and price freeze on the Canadian economy as a response to rising inflation due to the oil crisis. The Liberal government under Pierre Trudeau was originally opposed to this idea, but after winning the election, introduced the Anti-Inflation Act in 1975. This act contained wage and price controls on parts of the economy and remained in force until 1978. In 1979 the anti-inflation board was dissolved and the Anti-Inflation Act repealed.\n\nThe National Board for Prices and Incomes was created by the government of Harold Wilson in 1965 in an attempt to solve the problem of inflation in the British economy by managing wages and prices.\nThe Callaghan government in the United Kingdom in the 1970s sought to reduce conflict over wages and prices through a \"social contract\" in which unions would accept smaller wage increases, and business would constrain price increases, imitating Nixon's policy in America. Price controls ended with the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979.\n\nAustralia implemented an incomes policy, called the Prices and Incomes Accord during the 1980s. The Accord was an agreement between trade unions and the Hawke Labor government. Employers were not party to the Accord. Unions agreed to restrict wage demands, and the government pledged action to minimise inflation and price rises. The government was also to act on the social wage. At its broadest this concept included increased spending on education as well as welfare.\n\nInflation declined during the period of the Accord, which was renegotiated several times. However, many of the key elements of the Accord were weakened over time, as unions sought a shift from centralised wage fixation to enterprise bargaining. The Accord ceased to play a major role after the recession of 1989–92, and was abandoned after the Labor government was defeated in 1996.\n\nItaly imitated the United States' price and wage controls in 1971, but soon gave up the policy to focus on controlling the price of oil.\n\nThe polder model in the Netherlands is characterized by tri-partite cooperation between employers' organizations such as VNO-NCW, labour unions such as the FNV, and the government. These talks are embodied in the Social Economic Council (Dutch: Sociaal-Economische Raad, SER). The SER serves as the central forum to discuss labour issues and has a long tradition of consensus, often defusing labour conflicts and avoiding strikes. Similar models are in use in Finland, namely Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement and universal validity of collective labour agreements.\n\nThe current polder model is said to have begun with the Wassenaar Accords of 1982 when unions, employers and government decided on a comprehensive plan to revitalize the economy involving shorter working times and less pay on the one hand, and more employment on the other.\n\nThe polder model is widely, but not universally, regarded as successful incomes management policy.\n\nThis model is also used in Belgium, hence its name (the \"polders\" are a region comprising the Netherlands and the northern part of Belgium).\n\nIn 1982, then Prime Minister and Finance Minister Rob Muldoon imposed a simultaneous freeze on wages, prices and interest rates in an effort to curb inflation, despite public resistance. These measures were subsequently repealed by Muldoon's successor David Lange and Finance Minister Roger Douglas.\n\nIn 2007, Robert Mugabe's government imposed a price freeze in Zimbabwe because of hyperinflation. That policy led only to shortages.\n\n"}
{"id": "38588985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38588985", "title": "Infamous Second Son", "text": "Infamous Second Son\n\nInfamous Second Son (stylized as inFAMOUS Second Son) is an action-adventure video game developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 4. It is the third installment in the \"Infamous\" series. The game was released worldwide on March 21, 2014. The player-controlled protagonist possesses superpower abilities that players use in combat and when traveling across the city. The story follows protagonist Delsin Rowe fighting the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) in a fictionalized Seattle. Over the course of the game, Delsin acquires new powers and becomes either good or evil as player choices influence his morality.\n\nSucker Punch began planning the game as early as 2010, when they began discussion with Sony to bring the \"Infamous\" series onto a new generation of hardware. They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions they would like to see on the PlayStation 4 system. Sucker Punch considers \"Second Son\" a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.\n\n\"Infamous Second Son\" was met with generally positive reviews; critics praised its gameplay, dynamic combat, visuals and design, while criticism was aimed at the game's morality system, which some found to be dated and binary, as well as the game's repetitive side missions. The story was met with a mixed response, with some critics finding the narrative and characters to be a step backwards from previous installments in the series, while others viewing the writing as an improvement over its predecessors. \"Infamous Second Son\" was a commercial success, and sold over a million copies within nine days, making it the fastest-selling entry within the \"Infamous\" franchise.\n\n\"Infamous Second Son\" is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. Players control the main character Delsin Rowe, who can parkour-style climb vertical surfaces like high-rise buildings. Delsin is a Conduit, which allows him to use superpower abilities by manipulating materials such as smoke, neon, video, and concrete. These materials can be weaponized (such that Delsin can perform melee attacks or fire projectiles from his fingertips) or used to deftly navigate the game world (such as using neon to dash up buildings). Using powers depletes a meter in the head-up display (HUD), which can be replenished by drawing from power sources such as smoke from exploded vehicles. Delsin earns new powers as he progresses through the story, which sees him fight against the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) during missions. Each time Delsin gains a new power set he must destroy D.U.P. Core Relays to learn the basic abilities that correspond to it. Delsin upgrades and acquires new abilities by spending Blast Shards that have been collected, they are scattered throughout Seattle. Players become more powerful in combat by expanding Delsin's suite of abilities.\n\nPlayers may choose to act in either a good or evil way. Examples including healing civilians, doing drug busts, and stopping suspect brutality for good, or killing innocent civilians and killing instead of apprehending enemies. Several times throughout the story, Delsin finds himself in a scenario where he must make a good or evil choice, such as whether to encourage Conduit vigilante Abigail \"Fetch\" Walker to stop slaying drug dealers, or to train her to become a more prolific killer. Player choices influence outcomes in some later missions. In combat, Delsin may use his abilities to incapacitate foes or obliterate them with headshots. He may choose to open fire on innocent civilians. Delsin's choices manifest in a logo displayed on his jacket and the HUD, which features a blue (good) and red (evil) bird. Performing actions that are villainous gradually change the logo so that the red bird dominates the other, with the opposite happening with heroism. This is a visual representation of Delsin's Karma level, that increases as good or evil depending on his choices. As his Karma level increases, Delsin can acquire new powers that correspond to his play-style (e.g. very destructive powers with high levels of evil Karma) and his jacket also changes. If you have good karma, the jacket completely changes white whereas if evil the jacket turns red. A continual streak of either good or evil actions fills up a bar in the HUD, which then lets Delsin perform a powerful finishing move called a Karma Bomb.\n\nWhen not completing story missions, players can explore the city and complete activities such as tagging graffiti spots or assassinating D.U.P. secret agents. The city is split into districts that are all initially controlled by the D.U.P., but Delsin gradually liberates each district by completing activities. When D.U.P. control of a district falls below 30 percent, Delsin can enter a District Showdown that requires him to eliminate a wave of D.U.P. forces, eradicating D.U.P. presence there.\n\n\"Second Son\" takes place in 2016, seven years after \"Infamous 2\"s Conduit protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifices himself to cure humanity of a plague and destroy The Beast. Cole uses the powerful Ray Field Inhibitor weapon, which kills him and most of the other Conduits. The United States government establishes the D.U.P. to hunt down and capture the world's remaining Conduits, dubbing Conduits with the pejorative \"Bio-Terrorists\". The protagonist is Delsin Rowe (Troy Baker), a 24 year old graffiti artist and the local delinquent of the Akomish reservation. Delsin has the unique Conduit ability of Power Absorption, allowing him to use other Conduits' powers. His brother, Reggie (Travis Willingham), is the local sheriff, and often arrests Delsin for his acts of vandalism. Both are Akomish Native Americans, whose territory lies at the shore of Salmon Bay, Washington. The antagonist is Brooke Augustine (Christine Dunford), the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit with power over Concrete. Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle, now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces. Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits: Henry \"Hank\" Daughtry (David Stanbra), a convict with control over Smoke; Abigail \"Fetch\" Walker (Laura Bailey), an ex-junkie who uses her Neon powers to hunt down the illegal drug dealers in Seattle; and Eugene Sims (Alex Walsh), a reclusive video gamer who uses his Video (digital materialization) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P.\n\nAfter Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their subsequent argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages to pull the third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank in an effort to figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.\n\nDelsin awakens a week later and discovers that Augustine has tortured the rest of the tribe in an unsuccessful bid to gain information. However, she has left them to gradually die from concrete shards buried into their bodies, including their leader Betty (Karen Austin). Reggie, who was spared from the torture, learns that the only way to remove the shards is to use Augustine's power on them. Delsin realizes that he can absorb Conduit powers and resolves to go to Seattle to take Augustine's powers and save the tribe. Reggie reluctantly accompanies Delsin to keep an eye on him. They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict martial law by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits. With Reggie's help, Delsin battles D.U.P. forces and tracks down core fragments to develop his powers. He eventually encounters the other two escaped Conduits, Fetch and Eugene, and absorbs their powers. After both confrontations, Delsin defends the Conduits from Reggie, who initially views them as \"freaks\", and can choose to either redeem or corrupt them.\n\nNow possessing three powers, Delsin encounters Hank, who has escaped again. Hank tells Delsin that Fetch and Eugene have been captured by the D.U.P., and are being held on an artificial concrete island in Puget Sound. However, the situation turns out to be a trap set by Augustine. Reggie appears and rescues Delsin with a rocket launcher. While the brothers free Fetch and Eugene, Augustine encases Reggie's feet in concrete and blasts them off the platform. As they dangle above the ocean, Reggie realizes that Delsin cannot save both of them, tells him that he is proud of him, and lets Delsin's hand go and falls to his death. Distraught and enraged, Delsin climbs back up onto the platform and battles Augustine, destroying the entire island.\n\nAugustine flees back to the D.U.P. headquarters. Delsin tracks Hank down to the docks, where he is fleeing from D.U.P. forces. Hank begs for forgiveness, saying that he only worked with Augustine because she threatened to hurt his daughter. Delsin can choose to either kill Hank, or let him escape Seattle with his daughter. Aided by Fetch and Eugene, Delsin rallies an assault on the D.U.P. headquarters. After breaking through the building's defenses, Delsin confronts Augustine and reveals to her that he has figured out she staged the Conduit escape at Akomish to instill fear in the population and give the D.U.P. a reason to continue their regime. Augustine lets Delsin absorb her powers, and tells him that she wants to save the Conduits by imprisoning and protecting them from the population. Delsin battles and eventually defeats Augustine with his new concrete powers.\n\nIf Delsin has good Karma, he spares Augustine and exposes her crimes to the world. She is arrested and the D.U.P. disbands. Delsin, Fetch and Eugene convince the humans that they can peacefully coexist with the Conduits. All of the imprisoned Conduits are freed. Delsin returns to the reservation and heals the tribe members, then paints a mural dedicated to Reggie.\n\nIf Delsin has evil Karma, he kills Augustine and, together with Fetch and Eugene, takes control of Seattle. He releases all of the imprisoned Conduits and absorbs their powers. Upon returning to the reservation, Delsin is met by a wheelchair-bound Betty who banishes him from the tribe for the killings in Seattle. Shocked and angered, Delsin destroys the entire reservation.\n\nSucker Punch Productions began to develop \"Second Son\" while the PlayStation 4 was still being designed. Having finished work on \"\", they began to plan a new entry in the \"Infamous\" series under the working title \"Infamous 3\". As early as 2010, they discussed with Sony their desire to bring \"Infamous\" to a new PlayStation platform.\n\nSucker Punch were in close connection with the PS4's lead system architect Mark Cerny, who visited the studio several times. They gave Cerny feedback about how much power a new PlayStation system would require to render their ideal open world, how fast it would be capable of doing so and to what degree of texture detail. \"We had some experience there that was useful for that team when they were planning some aspects of the hardware design\", producer Brian Fleming explained. He found that during the PS4's development, there was a great level of interactivity between the system's designers and game developers such as Sucker Punch.\n\nSucker Punch made suggested improvements they would like to see for the DualShock 4 gamepad. \"Second Son\"s designer Jaime Griesemer traveled to Sony's headquarters in Japan to discuss such improvements. The developers found they were able to adopt the DualShock 4's touchpad into \"Second Son\"s gameplay (for example, players emulate the in-game fingerprint scanner using the DualShock 4 touchpad).\n\nThe game was envisioned to take full advantage of the hardware, without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture so easy to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new.\n\nOver 110 developers worked on the game, a number that director Nate Fox considered small. He felt that working with a small team necessitated having a defined vision for the game from the outset, \"to answer those first questions about what you want your game to be\". Sometimes, ideas came about during development that would have to be thrown out for not fitting with the game's original vision. \"We kill our darlings at Sucker Punch. It's not easy; it's necessary\", Fox explained. \"Second Son\" displays a native resolution of 1080p at 30 frames per second.\n\nSucker Punch elected to set \"Second Son\" in their hometown of Seattle as they could draw from their personal experiences \nin the open world's design. During early development when team members debated where \"Second Son\" would be set, Seattle rated high on a list of possibilities. Fleming considered that the city had not been featured in many games prior to \"Second Son\" and so would not be \"overblown\", and felt that Seattle's weather and mixture of \"old and new\" architecture would make it an interesting setting. The team conducted fieldwork in Seattle's nearby forests with audio and video equipment, which was used to reproduce local flora and the chirping sounds of local American robins. Seattle landmarks such as Pioneer Square, the Space Needle and Elephant Car Washes feature in the game. The developers licensed logos and signs from local businesses. Griesemer called the game world an \"abstraction\" of Seattle rather than a re-creation since its layout did not suit \"Second Son\"s gameplay and required the team to make necessary changes. The team wanted to thematically explore Seattle's heritage of Pacific Northwest, Native American tribes in the game.\n\nThe designers used graphic sliders in the game engine to determine the amount of water covering the streets. Like Seattle, rain is frequent in the game. The lighting effects (such as neon light from Delsin's powers) coupled with reflections help bring color into Seattle's dark and rainy atmosphere. Because of the move to the PS4, Sucker Punch were able to render more open world than what was possible in previous \"Infamous\" games. \"You get a better feel of the city when you can see more of it\", said Griesemer.\n\nAfter deciding on Seattle for the setting, the developers began to think about the superpowers that Delsin would possess. They added neon lighting to the city to amplify the \"beautiful reflective streets\", and subsequently decided to make neon a source of power for Delsin because of its prevalence. Animation director Billy Harper considered Delsin's smoke powers challenging to design, as the team wanted to make powers feel more fluid than in previous \"Infamous\" games. They removed Cole's \"contorted hand poses\" to improve the connection between Delsin and his powers. Fox felt that smoke helps Delsin deftly navigate the game world by letting him zip up buildings and through enemies. Griesemer (who previously worked with Bungie on the \"Halo\" series) wanted to bring the fluidity of first-person shooters to \"Second Son\"s combat. The team reviewed the control scheme of previous \"Infamous\" games and \"removed some of the complexity that was preventing people from interacting with the game\".\n\nGriesemer said that a recurring theme throughout \"Infamous\" games that they wanted to continue with \"Second Son\" was the idea of \"modern elemental powers\", variations on commonplace powers drawn from the game world. Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses. \"This is a game about super powers, so for us, the way the effects look tells you a lot about how you're playing the game\", he explained. Fox considered that the game world's resemblance to Seattle helped the superpower elements feel authentic. \"Because we have that sweet foundation of plausibility, you buy into the super-powered element\", he explained.\n\n\"Second Son\"s premise is built from the ending of \"Infamous 2\" that sees protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifice himself to save humanity. They looked at Trophy data and found the majority (78%) of \"Infamous 2\" players chose this ending, and concurred with the popular choice. This allowed them to create the new protagonist, Delsin, from scratch. \"Moving forward onto [\"Second Son\"], we said 'Alright, Cole's dead. People have voted for this. Let's make a new hero'\", Fox explained. Griesemer felt that taking the \"Infamous\" series to the PS4 signified a new era, and that departing from the story of previous games would help them reach new audiences. \"We needed a new entry point, and Delsin was the first step for that\", he explained. The idea to move away from Cole's story came about during pre-production staff meetings, and was confirmed after discussions both internally and with Sony Computer Entertainment. Griesemer described the contemporaneous sentiment as \"It's going to be new hardware, a new platform and we're going to have a new audience\".\n\nDelsin's Native American heritage came from the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where four of the six team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: \"What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?\". Harper considered Delsin \"full of reckless abandon\", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin \"flawed in a way I think a lot of us can relate to\", trying to live up to his successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a \"hero's journey\".\n\nDigital Domain were brought on board for the motion capture work. Fox helped direct the actors' performances, but found that they did not need much guidance for their roles. \"You need to let them understand what you need from a scene, but the actors are so much better equipped to deliver that than me\", he explained. Fleming considered that using motion capture added authenticity to the characters. \"The ability to capture [Delsin's] facial reaction when he's like 'Oh, shit', but doesn't say 'Oh shit'—that's a big deal\", he explained.\n\nMost of the non-player characters (NPCs) that inhabit the open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked their friends and families if they would like to appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.\n\nOn February 20, 2013, Sony held a conference in New York that announced the PlayStation 4. Fox appeared on-stage during the conference and recounted participating in an anti-globalization protest in Seattle in 1999. He announced \"Second Son\", and a debut trailer was shown that introduced the game's premise and lead character. The game was privately demoed at E3 2013, and its March 21, 2014, North American release date was confirmed during a PS4 launch event on November 14, 2013. By February 25, 2014, \"Second Son\" went gold (finished development).\n\nOn March 8, it was announced that \"Second Son\"s pre-order sales had surpassed those of \"The Last of Us\" in the United Kingdom. Two special edition versions of the game were produced; pre-ordered and first-run copies of the game received the Limited Edition, which includes the \"Coles Legacy\" mission pack that explain story events between \"Infamous 2\" and \"Second Son\". The Collector's Edition includes a unique box cover, a replica of Delsin's beanie, eight pins from his vest, an exclusive in-game vest, and a D.U.P.-themed patch. All pre-ordered copies of the game included four in-game vests for Delsin.\n\n\"Paper Trail\" is a free downloadable content (DLC) with alternate reality game features. The story is split into six parts, with the first being available after reaching a certain point in the main story. Each subsequent part was made available each Friday from March 28, 2014 in North America and, concluding with the release of the final part on April 25, 2014.\n\nAt E3 2014, the DLC package \"Infamous First Light\" was announced and was released on August 26, 2014 in North America and August 27, 2014 in Europe. In \"First Light\", the player controls Fetch. It is a stand-alone expansion and \"Second Son\" is not required to play the game, but ownership of \"Second Son\" grants players access to exclusive content and music.The track \"Sanctus Immortale\" composed and produced by Menelik Eu'el Solomon also features on the exclusive content pack. \"Infamous First Light\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics.\n\n\"Infamous Second Son\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nVince Ingenito of IGN recalled being left \"staring slack-jawed\" at the visuals, and called the open world \"beautifully and diversely realized\" with impressive lighting effects. Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot called the visuals \"incredible\". Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised Seattle's art direction, and found the draw distances and frame rate consistent. David Meikleham of \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" (OPM) was very impressed with the graphics and 1080p definition, but cited occasional frame rate dips during intense combat. He enjoyed playing in Seattle and using his powers to level the destructible environments. Tamoor Hussain of \"Computer and Video Games\" (CVG) praised graphical details like the particle and lighting systems. \"[The game is] colorful, rich in detail and has some of the best effects we've seen on console\", he wrote.\n\nGameSpot's Mc Shea considered the combat well-balanced between \"Infamous\"'s slower pace and \"Infamous 2\"s frenetic action, and enjoyed Delsin's agility and power. Chris Carter of Destructoid considered the combat's simplicity its strength, finding Delsin easy to control and navigate the world. \"Edge\" were underwhelmed with the game's opening because of its \"skittish\" parkour, but noted that once Delsin gained powers and reached Seattle, the game became very fun. They felt that enemies were clever enough to make combat a fun challenge, and called the main missions \"for the most part well designed and generously proportioned\". IGN's Ingenito enjoyed using Delsin's powers in combat, and called each set \"strong enough to hang an entire game on\". He found upgrading Delsin's powers helped keep the combat fresh and made for good replay value. Philip Kollar of Polygon favored using neon power, but praised the balance and variety between all of them. He called the combat \"a hell of a lot of fun\". Eurogamer's Welsh found the combat imperfect yet fun, but did not think that upgrading Delsin's skills made enough of a difference to his power.\n\nDestructoid's Carter thought that Delsin was a more interesting protagonist than \"wooden\" Cole, which helped his investment into the story. IGN's Ingenito thought Delsin was an interesting lead character, especially because of the chemistry with Reggie. He found Troy Baker's performance of Delsin \"[imbued] with a charm and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling tropey or overwrought\". However, he found supporting characters like Fetch underdeveloped and the narrative too straightforward. Although calling the characters clichéd, \"Edge\" felt that they were written and acted well. GameSpot's Mc Shea called Delsin annoying and immature, and found the gameplay more interesting than the \"tired\" story. Eurogamer's Welsh considered the plot driven by \"inconsequential MacGuffins\" and thought the ending rushed, but praised the story for not stretching on too long. Polygon's Kollar felt that the story did not explore its themes of surveillance and security-over-freedom well enough, such that its impact was diminished. He was overall disappointed with the narrative, despite finding the main characters written better than in previous \"Infamous\" games. OPM's Meikleham was put off by Delsin's arrogance and was underwhelmed with the story, but he was impressed by the quality of the motion capture performances.\n\n\"Edge\" and Eurogamer's Welsh faulted the morality system because they did not think it had enough influence on the story. IGN's Ingenito called it \"woefully outdated\", and felt that making evil choices severely jarred with Delsin's character. He found the system redundant because Delsin became more powerful when he strictly adhered to either a good or evil play-style, rather than crossing in-between. GameSpot's Mc Shea felt that the morality system was too binary because there was no \"moral gray area\" between playing good and evil. Polygon's Kollar reflected Mc Shea's opinion that the morality choices were too binary, and had difficulty connecting to his choices because they were too polarized between good and evil. OPM's Meikleham felt that the morality system had \"little to no impact on gameplay\". Danny Cowan of Joystiq thought that the morality system was well-balanced, with equal incentive and drawback tied to Delsin's choices.\n\nGameSpot's Mc Shea found \"Second Son\"s open world beholden to a dated formula. He described Seattle as \"a playground for you to go nuts in\" instead of \"a living, breathing world\", with the Seattleites existing only as fodder for players. \"CVG\"s Hussain called Seattle \"hauntingly empty\", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately. He felt that the open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with \"Grand Theft Auto V\", \"Sleeping Dogs\" and \"\", which he felt featured better open worlds. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that \"Second Son\" did not innovate the open world genre as well as it could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes. Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as \"virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs\". \"Edge\" found the amount of content in the game thin, finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side-missions. \"Approach [\"Second Son\"] as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense\", they wrote. Destructoid's Carter found the amount of content ample, and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards.\n\n\"Infamous Second Son\" sold over one million copies in nine days after its launch, making it one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games as well as the fastest-selling installment in the series.\n\n"}
{"id": "285292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285292", "title": "International Energy Agency", "text": "International Energy Agency\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA; ) is a Paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organization established in the framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1974 in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. The IEA was initially dedicated to responding to physical disruptions in the supply of oil, as well as serving as an information source on statistics about the international oil market and other energy sectors.\n\nThe IEA acts as a policy adviser to its member states, but also works with non-member countries, especially China, India, and Russia. The Agency's mandate has broadened to focus on the \"3Es\" of effectual energy policy: energy security, economic development, and environmental protection. The latter has focused on mitigating climate change. The IEA has a broad role in promoting alternate energy sources (including renewable energy), rational energy policies, and multinational energy technology co-operation.\n\nIEA member countries are required to maintain total oil stock levels equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports. At the end of July 2009, IEA member countries held a combined stockpile of almost 4.3 billion barrels (680,000,000 m) of oil.\n\nOn 1 September 2015, Fatih Birol took office as the new Executive Director, succeeding in this position former Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Maria van der Hoeven.\n\nThe IEA was established to meet the industrial countries' energy organization needs in the wake of the 1973–1974 oil crisis. Although the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had structures such as the Council, the Executive Committee, the Oil Committee, and the Energy Committee that could potentially deal with energy questions, it could not respond effectively to the crisis. The OECD had adopted the Oil Apportionment Decision <nowiki>[C(72)201(Final)]</nowiki>, laying out procedures to be carried out in the event of an oil supply emergency in Europe, but these procedures were not implemented during the crisis. In addition, the OECD had adopted recommendations on oil stockpiling in Europe, but due to their limited scope, these measures could have only a limited role in an oil supply emergency.\n\nEstablishment of the new organization was proposed by United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in his address to the Pilgrims Society in London on 12 December 1973. Also in December 1973, at the summit of the European Communities in Copenhagen, Danish Prime Minister Anker Jørgensen, who chaired the summit, declared that the summit found it \"useful to study with other oil-consuming countries within the framework of the OECD ways of dealing with the common short and long term energy problems of consumer countries.\"\n\nAt the Washington Energy Conference on 11–13 February 1974, the ministers of thirteen principal oil consumer countries stated \"the need for a comprehensive action program to deal with all facets of the world energy situation by cooperative measures. In so doing they will build on the work of the OECD.\"\n\nWhile creating a new energy organization, it was decided to utilize the framework of the OECD, as it had experience in dealing with oil and other energy questions, had expertise in economic analysis and statistics, had established staff, physical facilities, legal status and privileges and immunities, and was the principal organization of the industrial countries. However, the OECD has a rule of unanimity, and not all member states were ready to participate. Therefore, instead of an integrated approach, an autonomous approach was chosen.\n\nThe IEA was created on 18 November 1974 by the Agreement on an International Energy Program (IEP Agreement).\n\nDuring its history, the IEA has intervened in oil markets three times by releasing oil stocks – in 1991 during the Gulf War, in 2005 by releasing for a month after Hurricane Katrina affected US production, and most recently in 2011 to offset continued disruption to oil supplies as a result of the 2011 Libyan civil war.\n\nIn April 2001, the IEA, in collaboration with five other international organisations (APEC, Eurostat, OLADE, OPEC, UNSD) launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI).\n\nAccording to the \"World Energy Outlook 2010\", conventional crude oil production peaked in 2006, with al all-time maximum of 70 millions of barrels per day.\n\nIn June 2014 in its \"World Energy Outlook\" report, the IEA warned US$48 trillion in investment and credible long term policy planning would be required between 2014 and 2035 to secure sufficient energy supplies for that period. \"The reliability and sustainability of our future energy system depends on investment. But this won't materialize unless there are credible policy frameworks in place as well as stable access to long-term sources of finance. Neither of these conditions should be taken for granted,\" van der Hoeven said in a statement accompanying the report.\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) Ministerial meeting was held in Paris, France on 7 and 8 November 2017.\n\nOnly the OECD member states can become members of the IEA. Except for Chile, Iceland, Israel, and Slovenia, all OECD member states are members of the IEA. In 2014, Estonia joined the IEA and became its 29th member. Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Singapore and Thailand are the associate members of IEA. In 2018, Mexico joined the IEA and became its 30th member.\n\nIn March 2017, after a series of intensive consultations with all the relevant ministries, India joined the IEA as an association country. This was a major milestone for global energy governance and another major step towards the IEA becoming a truly global energy organisation and strengthening ties with the key energy players. Since then, Indian delegations have actively participated in IEA committees, meetings and workshops. The IEA launches major publications in New Delhi to share our findings with Indian energy communities and policy-makers.\n\nThe IEA has been criticised for systematically underestimating the role of renewable energy sources in future energy systems such as photovoltaics and their cost reductions. \n\nAhead of the launch of the \"2009 World Energy Outlook\", the British daily newspaper \"The Guardian\", referring to an unidentified senior IEA official, alleged that the agency was deliberately downplaying the risk of peak oil under pressures from the USA. According to a second unidentified former senior IEA official it was \"imperative not to anger the Americans\" and that the world has already entered the \"peak oil zone\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" also referred to a team of scientists from Uppsala University in Sweden who studied the 2008 World Energy Outlook and concluded the forecasts of the IEA were unattainable. According to their peer-reviewed report, oil production in 2030 would not exceed while the IEA forecasts a production of . The lead author of the report, Dr. Kjell Aleklett, has claimed that IEA's reports are \"political documents\". Other research from the same group has thoroughly reviewed oil projections done by the IEA World Energy Outlook.\n\nThe anticorruption NGO Global Witness wrote in its report \"Heads in the Sand\" that \"Global Witness' analysis demonstrates that the Agency continues to retain an overly-optimistic, and therefore misleading, view about potential future oil production.\" According to Global Witness, \"the Agency's over-confidence, despite credible data, external analysis and underlying fundamentals all strongly suggesting a more precautionary approach, has had a disastrous global impact.\"\n\nIn the past, the IEA has been criticized by environmental groups for underplaying the role of renewable energy technologies in favor of nuclear and fossil fuels. In 2009, Guy Pearse stated that the IEA has consistently underestimated the potential for renewable energy alternatives.\n\nThe Energy Watch Group (EWG), a coalition of scientists and politicians which analyses official energy industry predictions, claims that the IEA has had an institutional bias towards traditional energy sources and has been using \"misleading data\" to undermine the case for renewable energy, such as wind and solar. A 2008 EWG report compares IEA projections about the growth of wind power capacity and finds that it has consistently underestimated the amount of energy the wind power industry can deliver.\n\nFor example, in 1998, the IEA predicted global wind electricity generation would total 47.4 GW by 2020, but EWG's report states that this level was reached by the end of 2004. The report also said that the IEA has not learned the lesson of previous underestimates, and last year net additions of wind power globally were four times greater than the average IEA estimate from its 1995-2004 predictions. This patterns seems to have continued through 2016.\n\nAmid discontent from across the renewables sector at the IEA's performance as a global energy watchdog, the International Renewable Energy Agency was formed on January 26, 2009. The aim is to have the agency fully operational by 2010 with an initial annual budget of €25m.\n\nEnvironmental groups have become critical of the IEA's 450 Scenario (created to align with the 2009 Copenhagen Accord), contending that it does not align with up-to-date climate science, nor is it consistent with the Paris climate agreement that aspires to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In March 2017, the IEA (along with IRENA) published a report that considers a safer climate scenario than their current 450S. This scenario offers improved chances of limiting global warming to less than two degrees, but – according to research organization Oil Change International – still falls short of adequately addressing climate science and the decarbonization required to reach agreed upon global climate limits.\n\nIn 2018 the IEA was criticized in Davos by Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Al-Falih, for overhyping the US shale oil industry amid forecasts of oversupply for the oil market in their January Oil Market Report. Al-Falih was exasperated with those claims, arguing that natural depletion, and strong demand growth meant that there was plenty of room for new supplies, while the shale drillers wouldn’t crash the market. He further said that the IEA is overstating the role of shale in a global market, and how the core job of the IEA, is not to take things out of context.\n\nThe IEA, arguably the most influential think tank widely used as source for policy makers around the world, is criticized for consistently underestimating the growth of solar PV in its yearly World Energy Outlook market forecasts. The solar power installed in 2016 is 4,813% more than what was predicted by IEA in 2006. In 2016 itself, the solar PV addition was 16 times more than what was predicted by IEA a year earlier. However, the IEA's current forecasts for solar power does not seem to catch up with the exponential growth in the sector. The misleading projections has perpetuated the false impression that the growth of solar power requires huge subsidies, and has the potential to discourage investment in solar energy market and consequently, hold back even faster growth.\n\nIEA Bioenergy was set up in 1978 by the International Energy Agency (IEA) with the aim of improving cooperation and information exchange between countries that have national programmes in bioenergy research, development and deployment.\n\nThe International Energy Agency acts as energy policy advisor to 29 Member Countries plus the European Commission, in their effort to ensure reliable, affordable, and clean energy for their citizens. The IEA’s initial role was to co-ordinate measures in times of oil supply emergencies. As energy markets have changed, so has the IEA. Current work focuses on climate change policies, market reform, energy technology collaboration and outreach to the rest of the world, especially major producers and consumers of energy like China, India, Russia and the OPEC countries.\n\nActivities are set up under Implementing Agreements. These are independent bodies operating in a framework provided by the IEA. There are 42 currently active Implementing Agreements, one of which is IEA Bioenergy.\n\nTwenty two countries plus the European Commission participate in IEA Bioenergy: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, European Commission, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and USA.\n\nThe work of IEA Bioenergy is structured in a number of Tasks, which have well defined objectives, budgets, and time frames. The collaboration which earlier was focused on Research, Development and Demonstration is now increasingly also emphasising Deployment on a large-scale and worldwide. Each participating country pays a modest financial contribution toward administrative requirements, shares the costs of managing the Tasks and provides in-kind contributions to fund participation of national personnel in the Tasks. The scope of the work undertaken within IEA Bioenergy is shown in the graphic.\n\nEach Task is led by one of the participating countries (Operating Agent) with technical effort co-ordinated by a Task Leader. The work is directed by the Executive Committee. For the period 2016-2018, there are 10 Tasks. All of the Tasks have a common duration of three years.\n\nCurrent Tasks:\n\n\nThe IEA Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (PVPS) is one of the collaborative R&D Agreements established within the IEA and, since its establishment in 1993, the PVPS participants have been conducting a variety of joint projects in the application of photovoltaic conversion of solar energy into electricity.\n\nIn 2011, IEA chief economist Fatih Birol said the current US$409 billion equivalent of fossil fuel subsidies are encouraging a wasteful use of energy, and that the cuts in subsidies is the biggest policy item that would help renewable energies get more market share and reduce CO emissions.\n\nIn November 2011, an IEA report entitled \"Deploying Renewables 2011\" said \"renewable energy technology is becoming increasingly cost competitive and growth rates are in line to meet levels required of a sustainable energy future\". The report also said \"subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits\". The renewable electricity sector has \"grown rapidly in the past five years and now provides nearly 20 percent of the world's power generation\", the IEA said. The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand. \"A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support,\" the IEA said, and added that \"cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue.\"\n\nIn 2011, the International Energy Agency said that:\n\nthe development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared\".\nFor the first time in 2012, an annual medium-term report which analyses the renewable energy sector will be published by the IEA. This publication on renewable energy – \"which is now the fastest growing sector of the energy mix and accounts for almost a fifth of all electricity produced worldwide – will join annual medium-term reports on oil, gas and coal, which the IEA already produces\". With this report, \"renewable energy takes its rightful seat at the table alongside the other major energy sources\".\n\nAs of 2015, there are 28 members, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United States, as well as EPIA, European Union, International Copper Association, SEIA and SEPA.\n\nThe IEA's \"Energy Conservation through Energy Storage (ECES) Programme\" has completed 20 developmental annexes covering seasonal thermal energy storage as sensible heat (or cold), as well as storage of thermal energy (sensible, latent, thermochemical) and electrical energy. Four other annexes are on-going.\n\nThe ECES programme has held triennial global energy conferences since 1981. The conferences originally focused exclusively on STES, but now that those technologies are mature and other kinds of energy storage technology are now also included. Since 1985 each conference has had \"stock\" (for storage) at the end of its name; e.g. Ecostock, Thermastock. They are held at various locations around the world. Most recent was Greenstock 2015 (the 13th International Conference on Thermal Energy Storage) in Beijing, China. Enerstock 2018 will be held in Adana, Turkey.\n\nIEA promotes reduction of CO emissions for both conventional fossil-fuel carbon capture and storage (CCS) and for bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) by working with member and partner nations on development of cost effective and efficient international and national energy policies including CCS, trading mechanisms and low-carbon technologies. The 2012 IEA report entitled \"A Policy Strategy for Carbon Capture and Storage\" argues for comprehensive policy mechanisms that include setting a market price on CO emissions as key to reduction of CO emissions. \"In contrast to renewable energy or applications of energy efficiency, CCS generates no revenue, nor other market benefits, so long as there is no price on CO emissions. It is both costly to install and, once in place, has increased operating costs. Effective, well-designed policy support is essential in overcoming these barriers and the subsequent deployment of CCS technology.\"\n\nAt the Heiligendamm Summit in June 2007, the G8 acknowledged an EU proposal for an international initiative on energy efficiency tabled in March 2007, and agreed to explore, together with the International Energy Agency, the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally. A year later, on 8 June 2008, the G8 countries, China, India, South Korea and the European Community decided to establish the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation, at the Energy Ministerial meeting hosted by Japan in the frame of the 2008 G8 Presidency, in Aomori.\n\n"}
{"id": "38849626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38849626", "title": "International Socialist Commission", "text": "International Socialist Commission\n\nThe International Socialist Commission, also known as the International Socialist Committee or the Berne International was a coordinating committee of socialists parties that adhered to the idea of the Zimmerwald Conference of 1915.\n\nThe Zimmerwald Conference elected Angelica Balabanoff, Odino Morgari and Charles Naine to the Commission, with the Swiss socialist Robert Grimm as chairman and Balabanoff as interpreter. The Committee was charged with setting up a temporary secretariat and publishing a bulletin. The ISCs initial purpose was to act as an intermediary between the affiliated groups in their struggle for peace. It was not to act as a replacement for the International Socialist Bureau and dissolve as soon as the ISB could begin functioning normally. Other adherents of the Zimmerwald movement, such as Vladimir Lenin, saw it as the beginning of a new International.\n\nThe Commissions activity in the first months of its existences consisted of translating the manifesto and resolutions of the conference and distributing them as widely as possible. To that end they first forwarded copies of the first number of their \"Bulletin\" to the socialist and trade union papers of the neutral countries. Within the belligerent countries the ISC was able to have the full documents published in \nItaly, Russia, France, England and Bulgaria but only summaries in Austria and Germany. They also sent a circular to all the parties adhering to the ISB announcing their existence and the objects of the group. Only the Danish party replied, officially disapproving of the Zimmerwald venture. However, at the Congress of the Swiss Socialist Democratic Party at Aarau November 20–21, the delegates declared their adherence to the ISC and granted the organization 300 francs.\n\nOn September 27, 1915, ISC sent out a confidential circular (which was nevertheless leaked to the unfriendly press) suggesting that the adhering groups appoint up to three extra delegates to join the Commissioners as part of an Enlarged Committee. The first session of this Enlarged Committee of the International Socialist Commission was held in Berne February 5–8, 1916. No official list of attendees was published and sources disagree about who was present. Fainsod lists the following: Robert Grimm and Fritz Platten from the Swiss Social Democratic Party; Lenin and Zinoviev from the Bolsheviks; Julius Martov and Pavel Axelrod from the Mensheviks; David Riazanov of the Mezhraiontsy (also known as the Inter-District Committee); Feliks Kon and Pawel Lewinson from the Polish Socialist Party - Left; Bertha Thalheimer, Adolf Hoffman and Georg Ledebour, dissidents from the German Social Democratic Party; Serrati, Modigliani and Angelica Balabanoff from the Italian Socialist Party; Christian Rakovsky from the Social Democratic Party of Romania and Edmondo Peluso from the Social Democratic Party of Portugal. However, the Hoover Institution adds Alexander Martynov, for the Mensheviks, Franz Koritschoner, a dissident member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria; Henri Guilbeaux, editor of the \"Demain\"; Karl Radek of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania; and Willi Münzenberg, secretary of the International Socialist Youth League. Furthermore, there was apparently a representative of the Dutch Zimmerwaldists present, or one of the above may have held the Dutch mandate. The identity of this person remains unclear.\n\nAfter some debate the meeting decided to issue a circular (though not a full manifesto as the Zimmerwald Lefts had advocated) on the basis of a draft written by Grimm and extensively rewritten by a commission consisting of Zinoviev, Rakovsky, Serrati, Martov, Grimm and two delegates representing Germany and the ISC whose identity is not apparent. The Lefts were still not entirely satisfied with the circular, but considered it an improvement over the Zimmerwald Manifesto. The meeting also decided to arrange a new conference, drew up conditions for participation in it and a provisional agenda.\n\nThe ISC set to work arranging for a new congress of Zimmerald adherents which met at Kienthal, Switzerland on April 24, 1916. Forty three delegates met at this conference, representing Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Poland, Switzerland, Serbia, Portugal and Great Britain. The ISC publicly announced that the Conference was going to be held in the Netherlands to avoid passport denial or secret police surveillance, but a number of delegates were prevented from attending anyway.\n\nThe Kienthal Conference adopted another manifesto and some important resolutions, but it declined to advocate a policy to be followed by its adherents toward the conference of Neutral Socialists scheduled to meet at the Hague that summer. This was deferred to the second meeting of the ISC Enlarged Committee on May 2. Each organization that participated in the Kienthal Conference was represented by one delegate. This meeting \"considered some administrative matters, authenticated the Kienthal resolutions, and discussed matters of parliamentary action\" as well as the Hague Conference. One group, headed by Martov, advocated participation, arguing that no opportunity should be missed to expose to the workers the \"cause of the failure\" of the International Socialist Bureau. Zinoviev argued against, claiming it would only confuse the workers. The meeting ultimately became deadlocked, with five votes for each proposition, so it was decided that each party should make up its own mind whether to attend, but they should uphold the Zimmerwald resolutions if they did.\n\nThe ISC Enlarged Committee attempted to meet again at Olten on February 1, 1917 to consider a proposed Paris conference of Entente socialist parties. The ISC called a meeting of the Enlarged Committee members of the Allied countries, but only those groups with a presence in Switzerland were able to attend. The meeting therefore, only issued a none binding declaration recommending its affiliates not to attend. An official list of delegates was, again, not published, but the official communique stated \"only those delegates of the three Russian socialist parties, who were in Switzerland - the representatives of the National Committee of the Polish Socialist Party (the Levitsa) \nand of the Bund, as well as a representative of \"La Vie Ouvriere\" in Paris, who resides in Switzerland - came to the conference.\" The editors of the Hoover Institutions \"The Bolsheviks and the World War\", however, state specifically that the organizations represented included the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks, and the Russian Social Revolutionaries, as well as Henri Guilbeaux and Willi Münzenberg.\n\nAfter the March Revolution in Russia the ISC decided to transfer its headquarters to Stockholm, to be closer to the center of revolutionary activity. Grimm left Switzerland on April 20, and arrived at Stockholm on April 24. Three days before he left, however, Grimm had agreed to an appeal of assistance from the Central Committee for the Return of Political Exiles to Russia to intervene on their behalf with the Russian Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet for their return to Russia in exchange for German civil prisoners in Russia. However, Grimm was denied entry into Russia for the moment on the suspicion that he was a German spy. In the meantime, Grimm and the ISC learned that several affiliated parties had declared themselves sympathetic to the movement for a general socialist congress at Stockholm and issued an appeal on May 10 to all the European Zimmerwaldist parties to meet in a third Zimmerwaldist conference in Stockholm for May 31 to decide the Zimmerwald movements attitude toward the proposed Stockholm Conference.\n\nA train full of Russia exiles arrived from Switzerland in mid-May, carrying fellow ISC member and interpreter Angelica Balabanoff, as well as Martov, Riazanov, Pavel Axelrod and a number of other Russian socialist luminaries. Grimm boarded this train and set off for the Russian frontier. Before he got to the Russian border he learned that the foreign minister who denied him a visa, Pavel Milyukov had resigned, and three more socialists had entered the Provisional Government. The new government issued him a visa but it did not get to him until \"after\" he had crossed the Russian border under the protection of the Helsingfors Soviet. Grimm and Balabanoff arrived in Petrograd in time to speak at the All-Russian Conference of the Menshevik party and convince that organization to approve attending the Third Zimmerwald Conference (they also voted to advocate participation at the proposed Stockholm Congress).\n\nOn May 28–29 they had an informal conference with members of Zimmerwaldist parties in the city. According to Balabanoff's notes this was attended by Lenin, Zinoviev and Kamenev of the Bolsheviks; Bobrov of the Social Revolutionaries; Grigorii Bienstock, Martov, Martynov, and Larin of the Mensheviks; Raphael Abramovitch of the Bund; Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Urinovich and Riazanov of the Inter-District Committee; Lapinski of the Polish Socialist Party - Left and Christian Rakovsky of the Romanian Social Democrats. According to her notes Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Riazanov and herself were opposed to participation in the purposed Stockholm conference, while Rakovsky, Grimm, Bobrov and Martynov were for attending. In any case, decision would have to wait until the next Zimmerwaldist Conference. The Bolshevik delegation also tried to prevail on the ISC to issue a condemnation of socialists serving as ministers in the Provisional Government. While most at the meeting who gave an opinion were against socialist participation in the Provisional Government, there was also a broad consensus that the ISC did not have the authority to make such a statement without first consulting its affiliates.\n\nWhile in Petrograd both Balabanoff and Grimm were vigorously criticized in the press as being German agents working for a separate peace between Germany and Allied countries. Balabanoff was accused of negotiating with the Germans on behalf the Italian Socialist Party, but the Party quickly cleared her. However, Robert Grimm faced a more substantial charge. On May 26/27 he sent a telegram to Swiss Federal Councilor Arthur Hoffmann stating that there was a general desire for peace in Russia and that the only thing that could hinder it was a German offensive. Hoffmann responded on June 3, stating that people he spoke to in the German government would not launch an offensive while there was still a possibility of peace, as well as comment on possible territorial exchanges involving Poland, Lithuania and Galicia. The Provisional Government published these exchanges on June 16 and ordered Grimm deported. The event caused a scandal and opponents of the Zimmerwaldist movement from many sides used it as evidence that Zimmerwald movement was part of a German conspiracy.\n\nOn June 20 Grimm resigned as Chairman of the International Socialist Commission. On the same day Carl Hoglund, acting on behalf of the Swedish Left Social Democratic Party and Youth League, appointed a commission of three to look after the affairs of the ISC -- Zeth Höglund, Ture Nerman and Carl Carlson. The first act of this new leadership was to recall Balabanoff from Russia. She would thenceforth be the secretary of the ISC. The ISC then appointed a commission of inquiry to look into the \"Grimm affair\". The membership of this commission consisted of Carl Lindhagen and Zeth Höglund of Sweden; Kirkov of Bulgaria; Karl Radek of Poland; Christian Rakovsky of Romania; Orlovsky of Russia; and Karl Moor of Switzerland\n\nThe commission found that Grimm had made the telegraphic exchange without the knowledge of Balabanoff or any of the other Zimmerwaldists in Petrograd, and, while condemning him for practicing a kind of secret diplomacy, absolved him of attempting to reach a separate peace with Germany. It also absolved the International Socialist Commission itself, as no other member besides Grimm knew about the telegraphs.\n\nThe \"affair\" also had repercussions in Switzerland. Councilor Hoffman resigned on June 19. When Grimm returned he faced another commission of inquiry, this time appointed by the presidium of the Swiss Social Democratic Party. On September 1, 1917 the presidium voted 18-15 to accept the majority report of the commission, which came to most of the same conclusions as the Stockholm commission and recommended Grimm be restored to his previous party posts. A minority report signed by Charles Naine, Grimms former ISC colleague, was more condemnatory and denied the right of the presidium to restore Grimm to his previous mandates.\n\nMeanwhile, the ISC in Stockholm held a meeting at the office of the \"Stormklocken\" newspaper on July 3, with representatives of the Soviets to attempt to clarify the situation. Present at this meeting were Linstrom, Lindhagen and Hoglund for Sweden; Olausen for Norway; Otto Lang for Switzerland; Karl Kautsky, Hugo Haase, Luise Zietz, and Oskar Cohn for Germany; Sirola for Finland; Orlovsky, Radek and Hanecki for the Bolsheviks; Boris Reinstein for the US Socialist Labor Party; Kirkov for Bulgaria and Balabanoff in her capacity as secretary of the ISC. The representatives of the Soviet were Goldenberg, Vladimir Rozanov and \"Smirnov\". At this meeting Balabanoff, Orlavsky and Reinstien stated their objections to the invitation of the majority Socialist parties to the proposed Stockholm conference. Goldberg replied that the proposed conference was open to socialist parties without conditions, and would include minorities as well as majorities. Radek re-emphasized the Bolshevik party's disapproval of the Stockholm Conference and the Party's determination to quit the Zimmerwald movement if the Third Zimmerwald Conference chose to participate. Haase, of the Independent Socialist Party of Germany, however, was for the Conference and stated that his party would attend. Again, Balabanoff reminded everybody that no single party could dictate the ISCs position, which would be decided by the third Zimmerwald Conference. On the next day the conclave resumed, this time without the Soviet delegates. A statement was adopted in the name of the \"Bureau of the International Socialist Commission\" to the effect that the Third Zimmerwald Conference would take place five days before the proposed general Stockholm Conference, but should the conference not meet by September 15, 1917 the commission was empowered to call a conference of affiliates anyway.\n\nOn July 9, once their meetings with the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee (the organization planning the Stockholm conference) were finished, the Soviet delegation tried once again to enlist the ISC in the preparation work for the Stockholm Conference. This meeting, held at the ISCs \"quarters\" was between Balabanoff, Hoglund and Carlson for the ISC and Hendrik Ehrlich and another representative The Soviet delegation did not get a formal answer until July 11, when the ISC sent them a formal letter stating that they would not be able to participate in the preparations because the Stockholm Conference invitations had been \"altered\" to include the pro-war socialist parties and that the breaking of the \"civil peace\" was not a requirement of the parties to the conference\n\nOn July 13, according to Fainsod, there was another meeting of the ISC with Zimmerwaldists in Stockholm. Participants reported included Radek, Alexandra Kollontai, Orowski, Martinov and Jermanski of Russia, \"Mohr of Switzerland\", Sirola of Finland, Storm and Kilborn of Sweden. Radek and Kollantai are supposed to have argued against going to the proposed Stockholm Conference while it was still reiterated that only the Third Zimmerwald Conference could decide that.\n\nOn July 18 Balabanoff did issue a revised invitation to the Third Zimmerwald Conference. The invitation gave the date as August 10, 1917 and included a provisional agenda, stated that the condition for participation were the same as those published in Bulletin #3 and also included an invitation to a socialist women's conference to be held in connection with the Zimmerwald conference\n\nOn August 1 another meeting of the ISC with Zimmerwald adherents in Stockholm decided to call the Third Zimmerwald Conference and meet in Stockholm on September 5 regardless of what happened to the movement for the proposed general Conference. The participants at this meeting included Lindhagen, Lindstorm, and Otto Strom of Sweden; Osip Arkadievich Ermanski of the Menshiviks; Yrjo Sirola of Finland; J. Eads How of the United States; Ledebour of Germany; and Radek and Hanecki \"representing both the Bolsheviks and the Social Democracy of Poland and Lithuania\"\n\nFinally, the Third Zimmerwald Conference met at Stockholm on September 5–12, 1917. It had a smaller number of participants than any of the previous Zimmerwaldist Conferences, with only about thirty delegates from Russia, Germany, Poland, Finland, Rumania, Switzerland, the United States, Sweden and Norway, as well as the members of the ISC itself. By this point the question of attending the proposed general Stockholm Conference had been rendered practically moot because of the inability of the organizers to realize the project. The question was discussed anyway because some delegates felt that the issues raised by the movement for the Stockholm Congress were of a \"fundamental\" nature and the proletarians needed to be educated as to why the proposal foundered. No resolution was passed on the issue, though the movement for the Stockholm Conference is condemned, in passing, in the Conferences manifesto.\n\nThe manifesto itself caused some trouble for the ISC. It was agreed that it would not be immediately released because it contained a call for co-ordinated mass action against the war by the proletarians of all countries. The Conference felt it would be best to postpone publication until all the Zimmerwaldist groups had consented to this. A messenger was to memorize the text in English and go to London where he would deliver the manifesto orally. There it would be translated into French, memorized by another messenger who would travel to Paris. Meanwhile, on September 28, Louise Zeitz of the German Independent Socialists arrived in Stockholm and the ISC met to discuss her request that the publication of the manifesto be postponed further. The ISP had been getting into trouble lately because of mutinies in the German navy led by alleged party members. The group's parliamentary leaders denied responsibility and pleaded that they were only for legal action. The publication of the manifesto at this time might lead to the dissolution of the party by the government. Karl Radek, on the other hand, argued for immediate publication. The Commission decided to postpone issuing the manifesto for the time being. The ISC would publish it only after personal or telegraphic communication with the ISP and, barring that, on its own discretion. Radek threatened to publish the manifesto himself—and he did so, in a Finnish newspaper that November.\n\nThe ISC held a meeting with a visiting Serb delegation on October 10. The Serbs were represented by Kaslerovic and Popvic. In addition to the Serbs, the following were present: Christian Rakovksy of Romania; Katerina Tinev of the Bulgarian Trade Union Federation and Kharlokov of the opposition with the \"Broad\" Bulgarian socialist party; Radek, Orlovsky and Haneki of the Bolsheviks; Yrjo Sirola of Finland and Fritz Rosen of the Socialist Propaganda League of America. No decisions or resolutions appear to have been made at this meeting. The Serb delegation were there to submit a memorandum to the Dutch-Scandinavian committee.\n\nThe ISC held two meetings on November 8, 1917, the day after the Bolshevik seizure of power in Petrograd. Present, beside the formal members of the Commission, were Radek, Racovsky, Tinev and Kharlakov. At the first it was moved that the ISC send a telegram of congratulations to the Petrograd Soviet in the name of all the affiliated parties. Racovsky protested against this, suggesting they wait until the situation in Russia was clear and all the parties were able to take a stand on what happened. He was overruled. Radek offered an already written appeal that he wanted issued jointly by the Bolsheviks and the ISC which urged workers around the world to strike and form soviets to defend the Russian revolution from counter-revolution and defend peace. It also asked all the parties which approved of the revolution to send delegates to Stockholm. This was approved. At a second meeting later that night the publication of the manifesto adopted at the Third Zimmerwald Conference was approved.\n\nThe ISC spent the remainder of its existence publishing its newsletter and other material supportive of the Bolshevik revolution. In March 1918 its published a special illustrated \"Zimmerwald Russia Review\", \"Frieden, Brot, Freiheit\" in twelve languages. It also published a pamphlet of Bukharin, \"Thesen über der sozialistische Revolution und die Aufgaben des Proletariats während seiner Diktatur in Russland\". The final issue of \"Nachrichten\" was published on September 1, 1918 and contained an appeal to the workers in German, French, Swedish, Italian and English. That month Balabanoff went on a tour of several countries to try to revive the influence of the ISC and fight off calls for its return to Switzerland. She was not especially successful, being expelled from Switzerland and denied reentry into Sweden. As secretary of the International Socialist Commission, she consented into its formal dissolution into the Communist International at its first congress in March 1919.\n\n\n\nTwo membership lists of organizations adhering to Zimmerwald were published in \"Bulletins\" #3 and #4. Not included in either lists were the opposition sections within the German and French socialist parties. Additionally, the Finnish Social Democrats adhered in the summer of 1917. There were also other groups whose allegiance to the ISC and Zimmerwald was ambiguous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35481037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35481037", "title": "Landesa", "text": "Landesa\n\nLandesa Rural Development Institute is a nonprofit organization that partners with governments and local organizations to secure legal land rights for world's poorest families. Since 1967, Landesa has helped more than 100 million poor families in 35 countries gain legal control over their land. When families have secure rights to land, they can invest in their land to sustainably increase their harvests and reap the benefits—improved nutrition, health, education, and dignity.\n\nLandesa partners with governments, world leaders, NGOs, foundations, donor agencies such as the World Bank, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and others to design and implement land laws, policies and programs that provide opportunity, further economic growth, and promote social justice through land rights.\n\nBased in Seattle, Landesa has program offices in Beijing, China; Bhubaneswar, Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow, and Patna, India; Yangon, Myanmar; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. \nLandesa currently works in China, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Myanmar, Rwanda, and Tanzania.\n\nLandesa was founded as the Rural Development Institute in 1967 by Professor Roy Prosterman, a Harvard Law School graduate who left his Wall Street career at Sullivan & Cromwell to teach at the University of Washington School of Law where he established the Law in Sustainable Development Program. Troubled by the escalating Vietnam War, Prosterman recognized that secure land rights could provide the rural poor a place to grow food to feed their family and a foundation to raise themselves out of poverty without being forced to join the Viet Cong. His \"land to the tiller\" program led to a 30% increase in rice production, and an 80% decrease in Viet Cong recruitment.\n\nSince its founding, Landesa has had one specific goal: securing land rights for the world's poorest people. This is because more than two billion people lives in extreme poverty, surviving on $2 a day or less. Of those, more than 75 percent live in rural areas and rely on agriculture for their sustenance. Most do not have secure rights to land and therefore, limited opportunity to build a better future for themselves and their family. True ownership of land in the developing world determines access to shelter, income, education, healthcare, and improves economic and nutritional security.\n\nLandesa attorneys and land tenure specialists craft a variety of land and law-related institutional reforms to help developing countries bring land rights to their poorest. Upon the invitation of the host government, Landesa's staff conducts field assessments, institutional assessments, legislative drafting and policy advice. Landesa then provide assistance with implementing the new land laws, and can help organize pilot programs. Landesa has been involved - on five continents - with land administration consulting, social impact studies, implementation planning, implementation monitoring, training, public education programs, and program design and management. There are typically five primary elements to this work.\n\nOne plan will not work for every country, so most of Landesa's time goes into tailoring its work for each specific location. For instance, Landesa's \"micro-land ownership\" program in India provides landless families with a micro-plot as small as 1/10 of an acre on which they can build shelter, grow food to supplement the family diet and income, and raise livestock or start a micro-enterprise. Like the idea that started the \"micro-credit\" movement, \"micro-land ownership\" has the potential to provide opportunity for millions of the world's poorest.\n\nLandesa's fee-for-service practice focuses on the legal, policy, institutional, and educational issues of land tenure, land access, land market development, land conflicts, land acquisition and resettlement, and land registration systems.\n\nLandesa employs a staff of more than 120 worldwide, including over 20 senior land tenure specialists with legal, economic, gender, and agricultural expertise, complemented by a professional staff with livelihood, natural resource management, economics, sociology, and other social science expertise. Landesa also employs a team of research assistants who provide legal research and writing support.\n\nLandesa's work focuses primarily on rural and peri-urban contexts in developing and transitional economies. Services include field assessments, institutional assessments, legislative drafting and policy advice, development of follow-on regulations, and procedures, technical support for legal assistance, social impact studies, implementation planning, implementation monitoring, training, public education programs, and program design and management.\n\nProviding secure land rights to women is essential to addressing poverty and hunger around the world. Today, Landesa works in China, India and post-conflict areas of Africa with a focus on women's land rights. Women comprise over 50% of the world's population, are responsible for 60-80% of the world's food production, yet, in many countries, they cannot inherit or own land. \nThe Landesa Center for Women's Land Rights works to help women and girls transform their communities. There is great potential for change: with secure rights to land, women and girls can improve food security, education, health, and economic development for themselves and their families. When women have secure rights to land, they can become investors in their family's future and ensure that their children's needs are met.\n\nStudies have found that when women have secure rights to land:\n\n\nIn short, investing in women's land rights creates an ripple effect that spreads to her family, village, and beyond. \nHowever, in much of the world, while women shoulder the burden of food production, they often don't have secure rights to the land they farm. Although they till the fields, they are often barred from inheriting or owning those fields, a prerogative usually left for their husbands and fathers.\n\nTo address these challenges and unite the global community in support of women's land rights, the Landesa Center for Women's Land Rights was launched in 2009. Landesa's Center provides resources and training on women's land rights and connects policymakers, researchers, and practitioners from around the world. Landesa's Center pilots solutions to women's lack of secure land rights. It educates development experts about the gap between customary and institutional law and ensures that this is addressed in Landesa's projects. Landesa's Center ensures that women remain a core focus of Landesa's work to help the world's poorest.\n\nLandesa's Global Fellowship Program provides training opportunities for qualified professionals seeking to pursue a career in helping to secure land and property rights for women and girls. The program is designed to provide a career path and specialized training opportunities for legal professionals in the U.S., experienced professionals in developing countries who could benefit from comparative experience, and experienced non-legal professionals from NGOs who seek comparative legal knowledge.\n\nLandesa's Global Center for Women's Land Rights is building a database of formal laws related to women's land rights from every country in the world. This \"e-library\" will also include research on customary law related to women's land rights where available. The e-Library on women's property rights will be an open-source platform, allowing users to share and post laws and related materials on how those laws are practiced thorough a discussion forum. The e-Library will be cross-referenced via topics (widows' rights, dowry, girls' inheritance, etc.) as well as by countries and regions in a variety of languages. This helps legal practitioners and women's advocates create more effective and suitable programming.\n\nDaughters do not traditionally inherit land, because they typically move away from the village to their husband's home after marriage. Most girls leave their family homes with no economic asset of their own (such as land), leaving them vulnerable and powerless in their new homes. To address this, Landesa is working in partnership with its partners to help girls gain a critical economic asset—land—to reduce their vulnerability to poverty, gender-based violence, HIV, early marriage, and trafficking, and to gain opportunities for a better future.\n\n\n\"Forty years ago, Roy Prosterman was struck by the non-apparent truth that what keeps the world's poorest people poor is their inability to own the land they work. Since then, he and [Landesa] (RDI at the time) have shown what wonders can be wrought from a piece of land when the people who till it, own it.\"\n- Bill Gates, Sr. • Co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\n\n\"The advice of the Rural Development Institute has been more valuable than any foreign technical advice I have received.\"\n- Bekbolot Talgarbekov • Former Minister of Agriculture, Republic of Kyrgyzstan\n\n\"RDI's valuable recommendations have aroused the attention of party and government leaders within China's central government. . . .

Among those captured was the hetaera Leaina, lover of Aristogeiton, or Harmodius, or both. Leaina was tortured to get information about the conspiracy.\n\nAccording to Pausanias, the Athenians later set up a statue of a bronze lioness on the Acropolis in her memory: \"When Hipparchus died, Hippias tortured Leaena to death, because he knew she was the mistress of Aristogeiton, and therefore could not possibly, he held, be in ignorance of the plot. As a recompense, when the tyranny of the Peisistratidae was at an end, the Athenians put up a bronze lioness in memory of the woman, which they say Callias dedicated and Calamis made.\"\n\nLeaina was commemorated on account of her stubborn resolve under the torture of the tyrant. Athenaeus (who believed Leaina's lover was Harmodius) says: \"There was also a courtesan named Leaena, whose name is very celebrated, and she was the mistress of Harmodius, who slew the tyrant. And she, being tortured by command of Hippias the tyrant, died under the torture without having said a word.\" \n\nAccording to Jerome, Leaina rose to the occasion even further; to preserve her silence, and to frustrate her torturers, she bit her tongue off, and so died: \"Harmodius and Aristogiton killed the tyrant Hipparchus, and the courtesan Leaena their friend, when compelled with torments, lest she betray her companions, she amputated her tongue with her teeth.\" \n\nTherefore, the brass lioness statue at the entrance to the Acropolis was without a tongue: \"And Leaena also has a splendid reward for her self-control. She was a courtesan belonging to the group led by Harmodius and Aristogeiton and shared in the conspiracy against the tyrants — with her hopes, all a woman could do; for she also had joined in the revels about that noble mixing-bowl of Eros and through the god had been initiated into the secrets which might not be revealed. When, therefore, the conspirators failed and were put to death, she was questioned and commanded to reveal those who still escaped detection; but she would not do so and continued steadfast, proving that those men had experienced a passion not unworthy of themselves in loving a woman like her. And the Athenians caused a bronze lioness without a tongue to be made and set up in the gates of the Acropolis, representing by the spirited courage of the animal Leaena's invincible character, and by its tonguelessness her power of silence in keeping a holy secret. \"\n\nThe statue was not made by Calamis but by the Athenian sculptor Amphicrates, according to Pliny.\n\n\n\n"}

It also manages the import of grain, seeds and construction materials.\n\nWhile Iraq is potentially a rich country with huge oil deposits, decades of wars and sanctions have led to the collapse of infrastructure and social services, – which has resulted in many people being left without sufficient food or nutrition. A 2008 survey estimated that 930,000 Iraqis were food insecure, with a further 6.4 million vulnerable to food security without the Public Distribution System (PDS).\n\nIraq's food rationing system was established in 1995 as part of the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Under the Public Distribution System (PDS) every Iraqi, irrespective of income level, is entitled to a monthly food ration for a nominal fee. Most of the Ministry's 3000 trucks and 400 warehouses are dedicated to the PDS. However, the programme has been plagued by mismanagement and corruption since the 2003 US-led invasion. With annual costs running at more than US$4 billion, the Iraqi government is looking at ways to reform the system to target only the most vulnerable people in need of such assistance.\n\nAnti-corruption officials and the Iraqi army went to the ministry's offices in central Baghdad on April 29, 2009 to detain nine people on corruption charges. Their attempted roundup triggered a 15-minute gunfight between the military and the minister's security team. Only the minister's spokesman, Mohammed Hanoun was detained. Two of Sudani's brothers, one who worked for the ministry and one who headed the Iraqi Grain Board, were arrested the following day.\n\nIn May 2009 Iraqi Trade Minister Abdel Falah al-Sudani resigned and was later arrested amid allegations of corruption and embezzlement linked to the nation's food assistance programme. Sudani, a member of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite Dawa faction, had been questioned by parliament over claims relating to imports for Iraq's food rationing programme. The minister was accused of importing expired commodities—sugar—and procuring illegal contracts as well as failing to fight corruption in his ministry.\n\nIn December 2009 the United Nations World Food Programme and Iraqi Ministry of Trade signed a 'Memorandum of Understanding' under which the two parties agreed to work together to improve the supply chain management of the Public Distribution System (PDS) which provides a monthly food ration to millions of Iraqis. The agreement was signed in Baghdad by Edward Kallon and the Iraqi Minister of Trade, Dr Safa Al-Deen Alsafi.\n\nThe official stated purpose of the Iraqi Ministry of Trade is to facilitate and promote trade and commerce in Iraq. It aims to encourage private sector development by removing regulations blocking trade and investment, eliminating import licensing rules, and embarking on wide-ranging projects to promote a new trading environment in Iraq: an anti-corruption drive, a consumer welfare and protection unit, a “Baghdad International Fair\" site and the leasing of Iraqi shopping centers to private developers.\n\nThe Iraqi Ministry of Trade has number of associated State Companies: Iraqi Fairs, Food Stuff Trading, Constructions Stuff Trading, Grains Production, Grains Trading, Central Markets and Vehicles and Machines Trading. In addition, there are also a number of 'directorates' for Private Sector Development, Planning and Purveying, Administrative and Financial Affairs, Economic and Foreign Affairs and the Registration of Companies Department.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17495180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17495180", "title": "Nile Basin Initiative", "text": "Nile Basin Initiative\n\nThe Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) is a partnership among the Nile riparian states that “seeks to develop the river in a cooperative manner, share substantial socioeconomic benefits, and promote regional peace and security”. The NBI began with a dialogue among the riparian states that resulted in a shared vision objective “to achieve sustainable socioeconomic development through the equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources.\" It was formally launched in February 1999 by the water ministers of nine countries that share the river: Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), as well as Eritrea as an observer. From its beginning the Nile Basin Initiative has been supported by the World Bank and by other external partners. The World Bank has a mandate to support the work of the NBI, as lead development partner and as administrator of the multi-donor Nile Basin Trust Fund. One of the partners is the \"Nile Basin Discourse\", which describes itself as \"a civil society network of organisations seeking to achieve positive influence over the development of projects and programmes under the Nile Basin Initiative\".\n\nIn May 2010, five upstream states signed a Cooperative Framework Agreement to seek more water from the River Nile — a move strongly opposed by Egypt and Sudan. Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania were original signatories with Burundi signing in February 2011. The DRC is also expected to sign, while Egypt and Sudan are not expected to do so. Representatives of upstream countries said they were \"tired of first getting permission from Egypt before using river Nile water for any development project like irrigation\", as required by a treaty signed during the colonial era between Egypt and Britain in 1929. The new agreement, once effective, is designed to replace the Nile Basin Initiative.\n\nThe NBI institutional framework consists of three key institutions:\n\n\nTwo subsidiary programs are managed by the Eastern Nile Regional Technical Office (ENTRO), which is based in Addis Ababa, and the NELSAP Coordinating Unit (NELSAP-CU), which is based in Kigali, Rwanda. In addition, various projects under the Share Vision Program have regional project management units located in Cairo (applied training), Addis Ababa (water resources planning), Dar es-Salaam (power trade) and Nairobi (agriculture).\n\nThe NBI consists of three main programs: The Shared Vision Program, the Eastern Nile Subsidiary Action Program and the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program.\n\nThe Shared Vision Program (SVP), “a Basin-wide program that focuses on building institutions, sharing data and information, providing training and creating avenues for dialogue and region-wide networks needed for joint problem-solving, collaborative development, and developing multi-sector and multi-country programs of investment to develop water resources in a sustainable way.” It is financed through grants and aims to foster trust to build an enabling environment for investment. In 2010 it included the following eight projects mainly focused on regional training:\n\n\nThe Eastern Nile Subsidiary Action Program (ENSAP) \"seeks to develop the water resources of the Eastern Nile Basin in a sustainable and equitable way to ensure prosperity, security and peace for all its peoples\". It is managed by the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO) based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is grouped into fast-track investments and more complex, longer-term multi-purpose track investments.\n\nThis track included four projects in early 2008:\n\nThe Regional Watershed Management Project aims to establish sustainable management of watersheds on the Tekeze, Atbara, Mareb, Abbay/Blue Nile and the Baro/Akobo/Sobat rivers in Ethiopia and Sudan. The initial project sites identified include Lake Nasser/Nubia in Egypt; Jamma, Reb, and Gumara sub-basins, as well as watershed management in Tana-Beles as part of the Tana-Beles Integrated Water Resources Development Project in Ethiopia; and the lower Atbara, Ingessena Mountains and areas around Dinder National Park in Sudan. \n\nThe Ethiopia Power Export Project (formerly called the Ethiopia-Sudan Internconnection Project) will connect the power grids of Ethiopia and Sudan to facilitate cross-border energy trade and optimize existing and planned generation capacity. It aims to overcome the severe electricity shortage in both countries. The World Bank is providing a US$ 41 million credit for investments in Ethiopia approved in 2007. The Government of Sudan is funding activities in Sudan. \n\nThe Regional Irrigation and Drainage Project aims to develop and expand irrigated agriculture and improve the productivity of existing agriculture through more efficient use of water. It consists of three national sub-projects: \n\nThe Flood Preparedness and Early Warning Project, a US$ 4 million project approved in 2007 with an expected duration of three years, will focus on building flood forecasting capabilities and flood emergency preparedness and response. This will include efforts to improve dissemination of flood warning information to communities at risk, strengthen existing institutions and mechanisms to alert communities; establish community-based plans to reduce flood damages and capture environmental benefits; deliver public education programs; and develop regional and local emergency preparedness and response plans.\n\nThe multi-purpose track includes a series of studies aimed at developing common analytical tools, as well as a tentative plan for coordinated investments called the Joint Multipurpose Program.\n\nSpecific common analytical tools will be developed for the power sector, watershed management and irrigation/drainage, integrated by an overall planning model.\n\nThe Joint Multipurpose Program (JMP) is a long-term program with a 25-30 year horizon that includes a coordinated set of investments to ensure the sustainable development and management of shared Eastern Nile waters, including the Abbay (Blue Nile), Tekeze (Setit)-Atbara, Baro-Akobo-Sobat, portions of the White Nile and the Main Nile. The first set of investments under the program is likely to include:\n\n\nThe Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program (NELSAP) “is an investment program under the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI). Its mission is to help reduce poverty, promote economic growth, and reverse environmental degradation.” NELSAP programs fall under two broad program areas: Natural Resources Management and Development, and Power Development and Trade.\n\nThis program area includes the following projects:\n\n\nThis program area focuses on investment planning and preparation of major investment projects such as a Transmission Interconnection project and the Regional Rusumo Falls Hydro-electric and Multi-purpose Project. This has involved carrying out preliminary feasibility studies and assessments.\n\nIn December 2005 the six NELSAP Ministers responsible for Electricity Affairs adopted an Indicative Power Master Plan for the region. The plan includes a set of “best evaluated” power generation options and transmission interconnection projects for the next 20 years, including social and environmental concerns.\n\nThe Regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric and Multipurpose Project on the Kagera River is expected to be a dam with an associated run-of-the river hydropower plant that is expected to benefit Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania. The project was identified as one of the best power options through the above-mentioned NELSAP Assessment of Power Development Options. The hydroelectric power component would have an installed capacity of approximately 60-80 megawatts. It is estimated that approximately 3,000 people would need to be resettled around the hydropower plant facility.\n\nThe NELSAP Transmission Interconnection feasibility studies include detailed design for four key transmission lines between Burundi, DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, supported directly by the African Development Bank. The total cost of the regional transmission lines are about US$160 Million.\n\nThe Nile Basin Initiative is supported by contributions from the NBI countries themselves and through the support of international financial institutions – such as the World Bank, the Global Environmental Facility and the African Development Bank – and other donors. In 2003 a World Bank-managed, multi-donor trust fund created to harmonize donor contributions. Donors that contributed through the Nile Basin Trust Fund until early 2008 include Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Other donors to the NBI include Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Estonia, the EU and various UN agencies such as UNDP and the FAO.\n\nUntil early 2008 donors have contributed over US$130 million of the original pledge of US$150 million. US$14.4 million has been contributed by the governments of the Nile Basin.\n\nIn May 2010 five upstream states signed an agreement to seek more water from the River Nile — a move strongly opposed by Egypt and Sudan. The Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA), which had been negotiated for years under the framework of the NBI, was to be open for signature for a period of one year. Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania signed the agreement; Ethiopia ratified it in 2013. The DR Congo is also expected to sign, while Egypt and Sudan are not expected to do so. An Egyptian government spokesman said in May 2010 that \"Egypt will not join or sign any agreement that affects its share.\"\n\nThe signing of the agreement had already been planned during a Ministerial meeting in 2007, but had been delayed at the request of Egypt. Upstream countries then decided at another Ministerial meeting in Kinshasa in May 2009 to sign the agreement without having all countries sign at the same time. However, the signing was delayed and at the next Council of Minister meeting in April 2010 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt again asked to defer the signing. The article on water security (Article 14b) has particularly drawn objections from Egypt and Sudan. The article says that member countries would work together to ensure \"not to \"significantly\" affect the water security of any other Nile Basin State.\" Egypt and Sudan want the article to read \"Not to adversely affect the water security and current uses and rights of any other Nile Basin States\" without the qualification \"significantly\". A former Egyptian minister of water resources and irrigation, Mahmoud Abu-Zeid, sees the framework agreement as a positive beginning, saying that \"everybody agreed to more than 95 percent of the articles\". An article on the protection and conservation of the basin and its ecosystem - such as the Sudd in Sudan - and an article requiring \"prior informed consent\" before building new dams had also been controversial during earlier negotiations. Representatives of upstream countries said they were \"tired of first getting permission from Egypt before using river Nile water for any development project like irrigation\", as required by a treaty signed during the colonial era between Egypt and Britain in 1929. \nThe agreement does not include fixed water shares for each riparian country. The agreement, once effective, will transform the NBI into a permanent Nile River Basin Commission.\n\n\n"}

Intended to counter generalizations about men’s behavior, the phrase has been criticized for deflecting conversations from uncomfortable topics, such as sexual assault.\n\nVox states that the phrase \"not all men are like that,\" as a general defense of men in gendered criticisms of their behavior, has been around for more than a decade. Before 2013, \"not all men\" was not seen as a derailment tactic; the most common strategies cited by feminist bloggers were \"'what about the men?' and 'patriarchy hurts men too'—pleas for inclusion, not for exemption\". Jasmine Bailey says the \"not all men\" argument \"seemingly began as a sincere way to counter feminist arguments\". #NotAllMen, however, is often impugned by feminists. The #NotAllMen Twitter hashtag was tweeted as early as 2011. The first viral tweet with this phrase, which was not yet a hashtag, was a satirical tweet by Shafiqah Hudson in February 2013: \"ME: Men and boys are socially instructed to not listen to us. They are taught to interrupt us when we- RANDOM MAN: Excuse me. Not ALL men.\" The stereotypical \"Not-All-Man\", barging into a conversation criticizing male behavior, was caricatured in a comic by artist Matt Lubchansky on April 14, 2014. Lubchansky’s comic was quickly retweeted and otherwise shared by several male celebrities including Wil Wheaton, Paul F. Tompkins, Matt Fraction, and John Scalzi.\n\n<nowiki>#</nowiki>NotAllMen was already a Twitter hashtag created by the Twitter user Sassycrass before the 2014 Isla Vista killings, but it gained additional traction after the event, because of the hatred against women expressed by the shooter, Elliot Rodger. In response to the hashtag #NotAllMen, an anonymous female Twitter user created the hashtag #YesAllWomen, to express that all women are affected by sexism and misogyny, even though not all men are sexist. This newly created hashtag quickly became used by women throughout social media to share their experiences of sexual discrimination and attacks. Following the killing spree, the attacker’s Internet activity was described as misogynistic, and hatred of women was cited as a factor in the killing spree. In the wake of the killings, some Twitter users pointed out the fact that \"not all men\" are like this, or would commit such crimes.\n\nAfter reports of a mass molestation occurring at India’s Bengaluru New Year’s Eve celebration, #NotAllMen began trending on Twitter. This drew an angry reaction from women, with many Indian feminists and women strongly criticizing the hashtag while responding with their own hashtag #YesAllWomen.\n\nAs Kelsey McKinney of Vox states, \"The phrase has been reappropriated by feminists and turned into a meme meant to parody its pervasiveness and bad faith.\" #NotAllMen-related memes include references to Aquaman, \"Adventure Time\", \"\", and the Kool Aid Man crashing through a wall to exclaim \"not all men\". An explanation of the NotAllMen hashtag came from Hillary Di Menna of \"This Magazine\", who claimed that: \"Saying 'not all men' is not helpful. We need to listen and we need to reflect.\" Slate Magazine writer Phil Plait wrote that the hashtag was In a differing opinion, India Times writer Sumeet Keswani writes that the statement \"does not serve to derail the feminism movement; it seeks to draw the line between feminism and misandry.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "793425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=793425", "title": "Podestà", "text": "Podestà\n\nPodestà () is the name given to certain high officials in many Italian cities beginning in the later Middle Ages. Mainly it meant the chief magistrate of a city state, the counterpart to similar positions in other cities that went by other names, e.g. \"rettori\" (\"rectors\"), but it could also mean the local administrator, who was the representative of the Holy Roman Emperor. Currently, \"Podestà\" is the title of mayors in Italian-speaking municipalities of Graubünden in Switzerland.\n\nThe term derives from the Latin word \"potestas\", meaning power. There is a similar derivation for the Arabic term \"Sultan\": originally meaning \"power\" or \"authority\", it eventually became the title of the person holding power.\n\nThe first documented usage of \"podestà\" was in Bologna in 1151, when it was applied to Guido di Ranieri di Sasso of Canossa, brought in from Faenza to be \"rettore e podestà\", noted in numerous documents. Leander Albertus gives the particulars:\n\"The citizens, seeing that there often arose among them quarrels and altercations, whether from favoritism or friendship, from envy or hatred that one had against another, by which their republic suffered great harm, loss and detriment; therefore, they decided, after much deliberation, to provide against these disorders. And thus they began to create a man of foreign birth their chief magistrate, giving him every power, authority and jurisdiction over the city, as well over criminal as over civil causes, and in times of war as well as in times of peace, calling him praetor as being above the others, or \"podestà\"., as having every authority and power over the city.\"\n\nPodestà were first more widely appointed by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa when he began to assert the rights that his Imperial position gave him over the cities of northern Italy; at the second imperial diet at Roncaglia, November 1158, Frederick appointed in several major cities imperial podestà \"as if having imperial power in that place\" The elected consuls, which Frederick had claimed the right to ratify, he began to designate directly. The business of the podestà was to enforce imperial rights. From the start, this was very unpopular, and their often arbitrary behaviour was a factor in bringing about the formation of the Lombard League and the uprising against Frederick in 1167.\n\nAlthough the Emperor's experiment was short-lived, the podestà soon became important and common in northern Italy, making their appearance in most communes around the year 1200, with an essential difference. These officials were now appointed by the citizens or by the citizens' representatives, rather like the older consuls (but not collegial). The podestà exercised the supreme power in the city, both in peace and war, and in foreign and domestic matters alike; but their term of office lasted only about a year.\n\nIn order to avoid the intense strife so common in Italian civic life, it soon became the custom to hire a stranger to fill this position. Venetians were in special demand for this purpose during the 12th and 13th centuries. This was probably due to their lesser concern (at the time) than other Italians in the affairs of the mainland. Afterwards, in a few cases, the term of office was extended to cover a period of years, or even a lifetime. They were confined in a luxury palace to keep them from being influenced by any of the local families. The architectural arrangement of the Palazzo Pubblico at Siena, built starting in 1297, evokes the uneasy relation of the commune with the \"podestà\", who in Siena's case was a disinterested nobleman at the head of the judiciary. It provided a self-contained lodging round its own interior court for the podestà, separate but housed within the Palazzo Pubblico where the councillors and their committee of nine habitually met.\n\nDuring the later part of the twelfth and the whole of the thirteenth century most Italian cities were governed by a podestà. Concerning Rome, with a history of civic violence, Gregorovius says that \"in 1205 the pope Innocent III changed the form of the civic government; the executive power lying henceforward in the hand of a single senator or podest, who, directly or indirectly, was appointed by the pope\". In Florence after 1180, the chief authority was transferred from the consuls to the podest, and Milan and other cities were also ruled by these officials. There were, moreover, podests in some of the cities of Provence (southeastern France, the former province Gallia Narbonensis).\n\nAn anonymous writer composed a short guide for the would-be \"podestà\" (although it would be unseemly to appear openly to run for the office), \"Oculus pastoralis\", of about 1222; in six simple and brief chapters it guides the novice through the requirements of the office, the salary, the address of welcome given by the retiring \"podestà\" to the new one, the choice of counsellors, the handling of money accounts. The fifth chapter offers some model speeches on public occasions, such as the death of prominent citizens. A final chapter touches upon making war (in a paragraph), and the training of urban officials.\n\nIn the thirteenth century in Florence, in Orvieto (1251) and some other cities a \"capitano del popolo\" (literally, \"captain of the people\") was chosen to look after the interests of the lower classes. (To this day, the heads of government of the little independent republic of San Marino are still called \"capitani\".) In other ways the power of the podests was reduced—they were confined more and more to judicial functions until they disappeared early in the sixteenth century.\n\nThe officials sent by the Italian republics to administer the affairs of dependent cities were also sometimes called podests. Into the 20th century the cities of Trento and Trieste gave the name of podest to their chief magistrate.\n\nThe example of Italy in the matter of podests was sometimes followed by cities and republics in northern Europe in the Middle Ages, notably by such as had trade relations with Italy. The officers elected sometimes bore the title of \"podesta\" or \"podestat\". Thus in East Frisia there were podests identical in name and functions with those of the Italian republics; sometimes each province had one, sometimes the federal diet elected a podest-general for the whole country, the term of office being for a limited period or for life.\n\nThe Fascist regime created its own version of the \"podestà\" figure. In February 1926, Mussolini's Senate issued a decree which abolished the autonomous powers and functions of \"comunes\" (municipalities), including elected town councils and mayors. Instead, all \"comunes\" except for Rome were to be headed by a \"podestà\", an authoritarian mayor with full executive and legislative powers. He was appointed by royal charter (in practice, by the National Fascist Party) for a renewable five-year term (which could be revoked at any time with immediate effect). In Rome, a governor was appointed to head the local government. In larger communes, the \"podestà\" was assisted by one or two \"vice-podestà\" nominated by the Ministry of Interior, in addition to a board of advisors (\"consulta municipale\") nominated either by the local prefect or, in the major cities, by the Ministry of Interior.\n\nThe decree was in effect from 21 April 1927 until 1945, when the entire system was abandoned with the return to democracy.\n\nLiterally this derived word means the office of a podestà or its term, but \"Podesteria\" can also designate a district administered by a \"podestà\" within a larger state.\nIn the \"domini di Terraferma\" that the dogal republic of Venice gradually established in the basin of the river Po, annexing various former principalities and self-governing cities, mostly in the fifteenth century, podesterias (ven. \"podestarie\") were one of the intermediate levels of the hierarchical administrative organization, the highest ('provincial') level being the \"territorio\" (roughly a modern administrative region).\n\nAfter the other dogal republic, Genoa, was in 1273 granted control of Pera and Galata, commercial suburbs of Constantinople, by the Byzantine emperor, it governed them jointly by a common \"podestà\" until 1453, when all Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nThe concept of a local man \"empowered\" to represent the Emperor was also a feature of medieval Frisia. From apocryphal beginnings, important rights were granted or confirmed under the code of law known as the \"Lex Frisionum\". According to later tradition, it was Charlemagne who granted the Frisians the title of freemen and permitted them to choose their own podestat or imperial governor from among the chieftains, to organize and lead the defense of two of the three districts of Frisia, in Middle Frisia, from the Flie to the Lauwers and in East Frisia from the Lauwers to the Weser, later the Countship of Ostfriesland.\n\nThe Frisians probably became aware of the Italian title of \"podestà\" (Dutch: \"potestaat\", German: \"Potestat\", English: \"potestate\") during the Sixth Crusade in 1228. According to privileges that were falsely ascribed to the Carolingian era, the \"potestate\" was chosen by council and he must be able to slay knights. Apocryphal historical writings mention the potestate as early as the Viking age.\n\nThe only \"potestates\" chosen to lead Friesland between the Vlie and Lauwers were Juw Juwinga (1396) and Juw Dekema (1494), both were chosen by the Schieringers. However, in 1399 the districts of Westergo and Oostergo elected potestates, Haring Harinxma and Sjoerd Wiarda respectively, in the struggle against the count of Holland. The title became well known outside of Friesland only with the installation of Albrecht of Saxony as \"hereditary potestate\" in 1498; the Frisians chose Jancko Douwama as their imperial stadtholder (1522).\n\n\n\n"}

The film had its theatrical release in New York City on November 7, 2008.\n\nThe film documents a peace movement called Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace. Organized by social worker Leymah Gbowee, the movement started with praying and singing in a fish market. Leymah Gbowee organized the Christian and Muslim women of Monrovia, Liberia to pray for peace and to organize nonviolent protests. Dressed in white to symbolize peace, and numbering in the thousands, the women became a political force against violence and against their government.\n\nTheir movement led to the election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in Liberia, the first African nation with a female president. The film has been used as an advocacy tool in post-conflict zones like Sudan, mobilizing African women to petition for peace and security.\n\nA group of ordinary women in Liberia, led by Leymah Gbowee, came together to pray for peace. Armed only with white T-shirts and the courage of their convictions, they demanded a resolution to the country’s civil war.\n\nUnder Leymah Gbowee's leadership, the women managed to force a meeting with President Charles Taylor and extract a promise from him to attend peace talks in Ghana. Gbowee then led a delegation of Liberian women to Ghana to continue to apply pressure on the warring factions during the peace process. They staged a silent protest outside of the Presidential Palace, Accra, bringing about an agreement during the stalled peace talks.\n\nAsatu Bah Kenneth is featured in the film. She is currently Assistant Minister for Administration and Public Safety of the Liberian Ministry of Justice. At the time, she was the president of the Liberia Female Law Enforcement Association. Inspired by the work of the Christian women's peace initiative, she formed the Liberian Muslim Women's Organization to work for peace.\n\nWorking together, over 3,000 Christian and Muslim women mobilized their efforts, and as a result, the women were able to achieve peace in Liberia after a 14-year civil war and helped bring to power the country's first female head of state.\n\nThe title of the film is drawn from Gbowee’s statement about Taylor and the rebels. Both sides were supposedly religious. The rebels frequented mosques, while Taylor claimed to be a devout Christian who, according to Gbowee, could “pray the devil out of Hell.” It was therefore the responsibility of the women in this inter-faith coalition to pray the devil (of war) right back to Hell.\n\nIn alphabetical order\n\n\nAs a result of the First Liberian Civil War from 1989 until 1996 and Second Liberian Civil War from 1999 until 2003, and during post-conflict periods, Liberian women were displaced and faced the death of family members, sexual violence, and challenging economic and social environments. The recovery effort has been led by Liberian women against sexual violence with an all-female United Nations peacekeeping force, trained in sophisticated combat tactics and weaponry, crowd and mob control, and counter-insurgency. In 2009, women made up 15 percent of Liberia’s national police force.\n\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

It was one of three paintings commissioned from Orpen to commemorate the Peace Conference at Versailles in 1919. The work is held by the Imperial War Museum in London.\n\nOrpen was one of the first people chosen as a war artist by the British Ministry of Information in 1917. Orpen was also official painter at the Versailles peace conference, and was commissioned to paint three canvases to record the roles of the politicians, diplomats and military at the conference, for a fee of £6,000. The other two works, \"A Peace Conference at the Quai d'Orsay\" and \"The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28th June 1919\", are both group portraits depicting the participants at the conference. \n\nOrpen was deeply affected by the suffering he witnessed in France during the war, and grew to dislike the politicians at the conference. \"To the Unknown British Soldier in France\" was originally intended to include a group of soldiers and statesmen in the Hall of Peace at the Palace of Versailles, including Admirals Beatty and Sturdee; Field Marshals Allenby, French, Haig and Plumer; Generals Cowans, Currie and Rawlinson; Lieutenant Arthur Rhys-Davids; David Lloyd George; Georges Clemenceau, and Marshals Pétain and Foch.

The coffin is located in the Hall of Peace at the Palace of Versailles, with the Hall of Mirrors behind leading to the Hall of War.\n\nIn place of the group portrait, in the original version of the revised painting, Orpen decided to accompany the coffin with an honour guard of two emaciated soldiers, bearing guns but clad only in loin-cloths of tattered blankets. Above, two cherubs held a floral garland that reached down to the floor.\n\nThe completed work was first exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1923. It was one of the more popular exhibits with the public, but it was attacked as in poor taste by critics. The Imperial War Museum declined to take the work on the grounds that it did not meet the terms of the commission.\n\nOrpen later painted out the soldiers and the cherubs with their flowers, and then donated the revised painting to the Imperial War Museum in 1928 as a tribute to the late Field Marshal Haig.\n\n"}

Because some verses abrogate others, and because some are thought to be general commands while other refer to specific enemies, how the verses are understood and how they relate to each other \"has been a central issue in Islamic thinking on war\" according to scholars such as Charles Matthews.\n\nWhile numerous scholars explain Quranic phrases on violence to be only in the context of a defensive response to oppression; violent groups have interpreted verses to endorse their violent actions and made the Quran's teachings on violence and war a topic of vigorous debate.\n\nCharles Matthews writes that there is a \"large debate about what the Quran commands as regards the \"sword verses\" and the \"peace verses\". According to Matthews, \"the question of the proper prioritization of these verses, and how they should be understood in relation to one another, has been a central issue for Islamic thinking about war.\"\n\nPrior to the Hijra travel, Muhammad struggled non-violently against his oppressors in Mecca. It wasn't until after the exile that the Quranic revelations began to adopt a more offensive perspective.\n\nAccording to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the \"sword verses\" over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances. For example, according to Diane Morgan, Ibn Kathir (1301–1372) asserted that the Sword Verse abrogated all peace treaties that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters.\n\nModernists reject the abrogating status of the sword verses, which would result in the abrogation (naskh) of numerous Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation.\n\nNumerous scholars and authors, both Muslim and non-Muslim have testified to the underlying rejection of violence, cruelty, coercion, and intolerance of the Quran and its embrace of justice and self-defence. \nAccording to Fawzy Abdelmalek, \"many Muslim scholars speak of Islam as a religion of peace and not of violence. They say that the non-Muslims misunderstand the Quran verses about Jihad and the conduct of war in Islam.\"\n\nNissim Rejwan asserts that \"violence and cruelty are not in the spirit of the Quran, nor are they found in the life of the Prophet, nor in the lives of saintly Muslims.\"\n\nAccording to Feisal Abdul Rauf, \"the Quran expressly and unambiguously prohibits the use of coercion in faith because coercion would violate a fundamental human right— the right to a free conscience. A different belief system is not deemed a legitimate cause for violence or war under Islamic law. The Quran is categorical on this: \"There shall be no compulsion in religion\" (2:256); \"Say to the disbelievers [that is, atheists, or polytheists, namely those who reject God] \"To you, your beliefs, to me, mine\" (109:1–6)\"\n\nCharles Matthews characterizes the peace verses as saying that, \"if others want peace, you can accept them as peaceful even if they are not Muslim.\" As an example, Matthews cites the second sura which commands believers not to transgress limits in warfare: \"fight in God's cause against those who fight you, but do not transgress limits [in aggression]; God does not love transgressors\" (2:190).\n\nChiba and Schoenbaum argue that Islam \"does not allow Muslims to fight against those who disagree with them regardless of belief system\", but instead \"urges its followers to treat such people kindly\". Yohanan Friedmann has argued that the Quran does not promote fighting for the purposes of religious coercion, although the war as described is \"religious\" in the sense that the enemies of the Muslims are described as \"enemies of God\" (8:57–62).\n\nSolomon A. Nigosian has argued that in \"duty to halt aggression or to strive for the preservation of Islamic principles\", fighting may be involved, where the Quran encourages them to \"fight courageously and steadfastly against recalcitrant states, be they Muslim or non-Muslim.\" He also argues that the \"Quranic statement is clear\" on the issue of fighting in defence of Islam as \"a duty that is to be carried out at all costs\", where \"God grants security to those Muslims who fight in order to halt or repel aggression\".\n\nAccording to Chandra Muzaffar, \"The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate. What this means is that one can use the Quran as the criterion for when violence is legitimate and when it is not.\"\n\nIn the Islamic telling of Cain and Abel, Abel tells his murderous brother that \"If thou dost stretch thy hand against me to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear Allah\". Some scholars, such as Jawdat Said, have identified this as an example of pacifism.\n\nVarious Ahmadis scholars like Muhammad Ali, Maulana Sadr-ud-Din, Basharat Ahmad and also the British orientalist Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.\n\nArvind Kumar writes:\n\nAccording to Khaled Abou El Fadl, \"there is not a single verse in the Quran that calls for an unmitigated, unqualified, or unreserved obligation to fight the unbelievers.\" According to Esposito and Mogahed, the Quran balances permission to fight the enemy with a strong mandate for making peace.\n\nAccording to Dipak kutha, \"much of the religious justification of violence against nonbelievers (Dar ul Kufr) by the promoters of jihad is based on the Quranic \"sword verses\" (traditionally Muslims speak of \"\"the\" sword verse\", singular, i.e. ).\nThe Quran contains passages that could be interpreted to endorse violence,\nsome include and 193, , and .\n\nQuran scholars claim that the textual context of this particular passage is defensive war after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was broken by the Qurayshi-affiliated Banu Bakr tribe when they attacked the Muslim-allied tribe of Banu Khaza'a. In response, the Prophet sent a letter requesting the Quraysh to either terminate their alliance with Banu Khaza'a or pay a ransom. The Quraysh rejected both of Mohammad's offers, thus, breaking the treaty. It is also agreed upon that the verse refers to only the ones who broke the treaty.\n\nThe previous verse says: \n\nThis has been used to argue that fighting is only permissible as a form of defence.\n\nThere are two points made in verse 2:191 that may cause some debate. The first is that the killing of others is authorized in the event of \"persecution;\" \n\nAbou El Fadl also notes verses giving a \"mandate in favor of peace\" and commanding Muslims not to \"turn away unbelievers who seek to make peace\".\n\n"}
{"id": "35765473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35765473", "title": "Water, energy and food security nexus", "text": "Water, energy and food security nexus\n\nThe water, energy and food security nexus means that water security, energy security and food security are inextricably linked and that actions in any one area usually have impacts in one or both of the others. As the world population approaches 8 billion, with increasing demands for basic services, and growing desires for higher living standards, the need for more conscious stewardship of the vital resources required to achieve those services and desires has become both more obvious and urgent.\n\nThe emphasis on access in these definitions also implies that security is not so much about average (e.g., annual) availability of resources; it has to encompass variability and extreme situations such as droughts or price shocks, and the psychological resilience of the poor.\n\nThe interactions among water, energy and food are numerous and substantial. Water is used for extraction, mining, processing, refining, and residue disposal of fossil fuels, as well as for growing feedstock for biofuels and for generating electricity. Water intensity varies in the energy sector, with oil and gas production requiring much less water than oil from tar sands or biofuels. Choosing biofuels for energy production should require a careful balancing of priorities, since water that has been used to grow feedstock for biofuels could also have been used to grow food.\n\nMany forms of energy production through fossil fuels are highly polluting in addition to being water intensive, especially extraction from tar sands and shale and extraction through hydraulic fracturing. Further, return flows from power plants to rivers are warmer than the water that was taken in and/or are highly polluted and can consequently compromise other downstream usage, including ecosystems. Conversely, energy is needed for extracting, transporting, distributing and treating water. Energy intensity for accessing a cubic meter of water varies: logically, accessing local surface water requires far less energy than pumping groundwater, reclaiming wastewater or desalinating seawater. Irrigation is more energy intensive than rain-fed agriculture, and drip irrigation is more intensive yet since the water must be pressurized.\n\nFood production is by far the largest consumer of global fresh water supplies. Globally, agriculture is responsible for an average of 70% of fresh water consumption by humans; in some countries that figure jumps to 80%-90%. Agriculture is therefore also responsible for much of fresh water over-exploitation. Food production further impacts the water sector through land degradation, changes in runoff, disruption of groundwater discharge, water quality and availability of water and land for other purposes such as natural habitat. The increased yields that have resulted from mechanization and other modern measures have come at a high energy price, as the full food and supply chain claims approximately 30% of total global energy demand. Energy fuels land preparation, fertilizer production, irrigation and the sowing, harvesting and transportation of crops. The links between food and energy have become quite apparent in recent years as increases in the price of oil lead very quickly to increases in the price of food. The energy sector can have other negative impacts on the food sector when mining for fossil fuels and deforestation for biofuels reduce land for agriculture, ecosystems and other uses.\n\nImproved water, energy and food security on a global level can be achieved through a nexus approach — an approach that integrates management and governance across sectors and scales. A nexus approach can support the transition to a Green Economy, which aims, among other things, at resource use efficiency and greater policy coherence. Given the increasing interconnectedness across sectors and in space and time, a reduction of negative economic, social and environmental externalities can increase overall resource use efficiency, provide additional benefits and secure the human rights to water and food. In a nexus-based approach, conventional policy- and decision-making in \"silos\" therefore would give way to an approach that reduces trade-offs and builds synergies across sectors. The European Union, working along with the German Federal Ministry for Economics Cooperation and Development and the International Food Policy Research Institute, the WWF and the World Economic Forum have developed an online resource on this concern. Nexus approach requires an integrated solution.\n\nA nexus perspective increases the understanding of the interdependencies across the water, energy and food sectors and influences policies in other areas of concern such as climate and biodiversity. The nexus perspective helps to move beyond silos and ivory towers that preclude interdisciplinary solutions, thus increasing opportunities for mutually beneficial responses and enhancing the potential for cooperation between and among all sectors. Everyone in all disciplines needs to think and act from the perspective of being interlinked in order to realize the full impact of both direct and indirect synergies that can result.\n\nA deep understanding of the nexus will provide the informed and transparent framework that is required to meet increasing global demands without compromising sustainability. The nexus approach will also allow decision-makers to develop appropriate policies, strategies and investments, to explore and exploit synergies, and to identify and mitigate trade-offs among the development goals related to water, energy and food security. Active participation by and among government agencies, the private sector and civil society is critical to avoiding unintended adverse consequences. A true nexus approach can only be achieved through close collaboration of all actors from all sectors.\n\nWhile the opportunities provided by the nexus perspective and the consequent social, environmental and economic benefits are real, implementation requires the right policies, incentives and encouragement, and institutions and leaders that are up to the task, as well as frameworks that encourage empowerment, research, information and education. Accelerating the involvement of the private sector through establishing and promoting the business case for both sustainability and the nexus is essential to driving change and getting to scale.\n\nNexus perspective can be an option for adaptation to climate change.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "247676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247676", "title": "Yellow Turban Rebellion", "text": "Yellow Turban Rebellion\n\nThe Yellow Turban Rebellion, also translated as the Yellow Scarves Rebellion, was a peasant revolt in China against the Eastern Han dynasty. The uprising broke out in 184 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling. Although the main rebellion was suppressed in a year by 185 AD, pockets of resistance continued and smaller new rebellions were started in later years. Thus, it took 21 years until the uprising was fully suppressed by 205 AD. The rebellion, which got its name from the colour of the cloths that the rebels wore on their heads, marked an important point in the history of Taoism due to the rebels' association with secret Taoist societies. The revolt was also used as the opening event in the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\".\n\nA major cause of the rebellion was an agrarian crisis, in which famine forced many farmers and former military settlers in the north to seek employment in the south, where large landowners exploited the labour surplus to amass large fortunes. The situation was further aggravated by smaller floods along the lower course of the Yellow River. The peasants were further oppressed by high taxes imposed in order to fund the construction of fortifications along the Silk Road and garrisons against foreign infiltration and invasion. In this situation, landowners, landless peasants and unemployed former soldiers formed armed bands (around 170) and eventually private armies, setting the stage for armed conflict.\n\nAt the same time, the Han central government was weakening internally. The power of the landowners had become a longstanding problem, but in the run-up to the rebellion, the court eunuchs in particular gained considerably in influence over the emperor, which they abused to enrich themselves. Ten of the most powerful eunuchs formed a group known as the Ten Attendants, and Emperor Ling referred to one of them (Zhang Rang) as his \"foster father\". The government was widely regarded as corrupt and incapable and the famines and floods were seen as an indication that a decadent emperor had lost his Mandate of Heaven.\n\nBecause of its plan for a new beginning, the Taoist sect of Zhang Jue proved to be the Han dynasty's most dangerous enemy. In preparation for his revolt, Zhang Jue sent disciples out to gain support and organise followers throughout north China. Political discontent, as well as droughts and plagues, fuelled public resentment against the Han government. The rebels even had allies in the imperial court, and they were able to make their preparations while government officials were either ignorant of their intentions or intimidated by their power.\n\nZhang Jue planned a rising throughout the Han Empire, but before the call to arms had been issued the plan was betrayed, the rebel sympathisers in Luoyang were arrested and executed, and the revolt in the provinces had to begin ahead of time, in the second month of 184. Despite the premature call and an inevitable lack of co-ordination, tens of thousands of men rose in rebellion, government offices were plundered and destroyed and the imperial armies were immediately forced onto the defensive.\n\nThe rebellion was led by Zhang Jue (also referred to as Zhang Jiao, known to his followers as the \"General of Heaven\") and his two younger brothers Zhang Bao (張寶) and Zhang Liang (張梁), who were born in Julu Commandery (present-day Pingxiang County, Hebei). The brothers had founded a Taoist religious sect in present-day Shandong. They were healers, usually accepting patients \"pro bono\" who could not afford to pay them. The brothers saw the harshness of the world through their work with the peasants who were often abused by the local government, overburdened and hungry due to the heavy taxes levied upon them.\n\nThe rebels were the first followers of the Way of Supreme Peace () and venerated the deity Huang–Lao, who according to Zhang Jue, had given him a sacred book called the \"Crucial Keys to the Way of Peace\" () based on the \"Taipingjing\". Zhang Jue, who was said to be a sorcerer, called himself the \"Great Teacher\" (大賢良師). When the rebellion was proclaimed, Zhang Jue created a 16-word slogan: Since all the three brothers were healers, they spread the slogan easily by telling their patients to spread it among the peasants.\n\nZhang Jue used a form of Taoism to cure the sick by confession of sins and by faith healing. The religion and the politics of the Zhang brothers were based on belief in an apocalyptic change in the order of the world. They told their followers that in the \"jiazi\" year, the beginning of the new sexagenary cycle, the sky would become yellow, and that under this new heaven the rule of the Han dynasty would end and a new era of government begin. The characters \"jiazi\" became a symbol of the coming change and, later, when the followers of Zhang Jue went to battle they wore a yellow cloth bound about their heads as a badge. From this came the term Yellow Turbans.\n\nNearly all of the religious practices of the sect were communal activities (e.g. collective trances, fasts). A typical worship service consisted largely of music and chanting, the burning of incense, and sermons or anecdotes that could be given by any member of the congregation including women and those perceived as barbarians. Several Xiongnu leaders such as Yufuluo are known to have at least lent their support to the sect and a number of scholars have theorised that Zhang Jue may have derived some of his teachings from shamanism as he appeared as a mystical healer with a direct link to the heavens.\n\nWhile many of the beliefs of the early Path of Supreme Peace have been lost, it is very likely that they had some relation to the Way of the Celestial Masters, considering Zhang Jue claimed to be a descendant of Zhang Daoling. Many of the writings found in the 52 surviving chapters of the \"Taiping Jing\" that are found in the \"Daozang\" have a direct relationship to the Way of the Celestial Masters. Regardless, it is quite likely that any discrepancies found within the Way were suppressed by later Taoist sects.\n\nBefore the rebellion started, Zhang Jue had sent Ma Yuanyi (馬元義) to recruit followers from Jing and Yang provinces and gather them in Ye. As Ma Yuanyi frequently travelled to Luoyang, the Han imperial capital, he managed to build connections with Feng Xu (封諝) and Xu Feng (徐奉), two members of the influential eunuch faction in the imperial court, and convince them to secretly collaborate with Zhang Jue. They set 3 April 184 as the date for the rebellion. However, before the plans were set in motion, Tang Zhou (唐周) betrayed Ma Yuanyi and reported him to the authorities. Ma Yuanyi was arrested and executed by dismemberment in Luoyang.\n\nAfter Emperor Ling learnt that Zhang Jue was plotting a revolt, he ordered Zhou Bin (周斌), Prefect of the Palace Parks (鉤盾令), to conduct an investigation and capture all the conspirators. Hundreds of people were arrested and executed during this time.\n\nWhen Zhang Jue heard that the Han government had caught wind about his plans to rebel, he quickly sent messengers to contact his allies throughout China and take action immediately. Sometime between 29 February and 29 March 184, Zhang Jue started the Yellow Turban Rebellion with some 360,000 followers under his command, all of whom wore yellow headscarves or turbans. He called himself \"Lord General of Heaven\" (天公將軍), while his brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang were respectively called \"Lord General of Earth\" (地公將軍) and \"Lord General of People\" (人公將軍). The rebels attacked government offices, pillaged counties and villages, and seized control of commanderies. Within 10 days, the rebellion had spread throughout China and caused much alarm to the Han imperial court in Luoyang.\n\nThe rebels were mostly concentrated in Ji, Jing, You and Yu provinces. The group led by Zhang Jue and his brothers gained their support in Ji Province, located just north of the Yellow River, near Zhang Jue's home territory of Julu Commandery (鉅鹿郡; around present-day Pingxiang County, Hebei) and Wei Commandery (魏郡; around present-day Handan, Hebei). A second major uprising took place in Guangyang Commandery (廣陽郡; around present-day Beijing) and Zhuo Commandery (涿郡; around present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei) in You Province. The third centre of the rebellion was in Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡; around present-day Xuchang, Henan) and Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day Xinyang, Henan) in Yu Province, and Nanyang Commandery (南陽郡; around present-day Nanyang, Henan) in northern Jing Province.\n\nOn 1 April 184, Emperor Ling appointed his brother-in-law He Jin, the Intendant of Henan (河南尹), as General-in-Chief (大將軍) and ordered him to supervise the imperial armies to suppress the rebellion. At the same time, Emperor Ling also appointed three generals – Lu Zhi, Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun – to lead three separate armies to deal with the rebels. Lu Zhi went for Zhang Jue's base in Ji Province, while Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun headed to Yingchuan Commandery. They had a total of about 40,000 troops.\n\nIn You Province, the rebels killed Guo Xun (郭勳), the provincial Inspector, and Liu Wei (劉衛), the Administrator of Guangyang Commandery (廣陽郡; around present-day Beijing).\n\nZou Jing, a colonel, led imperial forces to eliminate the rebels in You Province. Liu Bei led a group of volunteers to assist him.\n\nWhen the rebellion first broke out in Yu Province, the Han imperial court specially selected Wang Yun to be the inspector of the province to oversee the military operations.\n\nZhao Qian (趙謙), the administrator of Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day Xinyang, Henan), led his troops to attack the rebels before Zhu Jun arrived, but was defeated at Shaoling (邵陵; in present-day southeastern Henan). When Chen County (陳縣; present-day Huaiyang County, Henan) was under attack by the rebels, seven of Zhao Qian's subordinates, who were non-military personnel, armed themselves with swords and attempted to fight the rebels but were all killed. Later, after the rebellion was suppressed, Emperor Ling issued an edict to honour the seven as the \"Seven Virtuous\" (七賢).\n\nChen State (陳國; around present-day Zhoukou, Henan), one of the commanderies in Yu Province and the princedom of Liu Chong (劉寵), was rather peaceful during the rebellion. This was because the rebels feared Liu Chong, who was famous for his prowess in archery, and an elite archer unit under his command.\n\nThe rebels in Runan Commandery, led by Bo Cai (波才), initially defeated Zhu Jun in battle and drove him back. The imperial court then sent Cao Cao, a cavalry commandant, to lead reinforcements to assist Zhu Jun. Sometime between 28 May and 25 June, Zhu Jun, Huangfu Song and Cao Cao joined forces and defeated Bo Cai at Changshe (長社; east of present-day Changge, Henan). While Bo Cai attempted to flee, Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun pursued him to Yangzhai County (陽翟縣; present-day Yuzhou, Henan) and defeated him again there, causing the rebels to scatter.\n\nHuangfu Song and Zhu Jun then defeated the rebels in Runan Commandery, led by Peng Tuo (彭脫), at Xihua County (西華縣; south of present-day Xihua County, Henan). The imperial court then ordered them to split up: Huangfu Song would attack the rebels at Dong Commandery (東郡; around present-day Puyang County, Henan), while Zhu Jun would attack the rebels at Nanyang Commandery (南陽郡; around present-day Nanyang, Henan). During this time, Wang Yun, the Inspector of Yu Province, found evidence that the rebels had been secretly maintaining contact with Zhang Rang (張讓), the leader of the eunuch faction in Luoyang, so he reported it to Emperor Ling, who scolded Zhang Rang but did not punish him.\n\nBetween 7 November and 6 December, Bao Hong (鮑鴻), a colonel, led imperial forces to attack the rebels in Gebei (葛陂; northwest of present-day Xincai County, Henan) and defeated them.\n\nIn the meantime, Lu Zhi defeated Zhang Jue's rebel forces in Julu Commandery (鉅鹿郡; around present-day Pingxiang County, Hebei) and besieged the rebel leader in Guangzong County (廣宗縣; southeast of present-day Guangzong County, Hebei). However, after a eunuch falsely accused him of treason, Emperor Ling ordered Lu Zhi to be removed from his command and escorted back to Luoyang as a prisoner. The imperial court then ordered the general Dong Zhuo to take over Lu Zhi's position and attack Zhang Jue. However, Dong Zhuo failed and retreated.\n\nOn 23 or 24 September, Huangfu Song and Fu Xie (傅燮), a Major under him, defeated the rebels at Cangting (倉亭; north of present-day Yanggu County, Shandong), captured their leader Bu Ji (卜己), and killed over 7,000 rebels, including other minor leaders Zhang Bo (張伯) and Liang Zhongning (梁仲寧). On 25 September, the imperial court ordered him to replace Dong Zhuo and lead his troops north to Guangzong County and attack Zhang Jue.\n\nZhang Jue died of illness while under attack by Huangfu Song in Guangzong County. Between 21 November and 20 December, Huangfu Song kept attacking Zhang Liang, who had taken over command of his brother's followers at Guangzong County, but could not overcome the rebels because Zhang Liang probably had the best fighters among the Yellow Turbans with him. Huangfu Song then switched to a defensive approach to trick the rebels into lowering their guard, which they did. He then seized the opportunity to strike back at night and inflicted a devastating defeat on the rebels. Zhang Liang was killed in action along with some 30,000 rebels, while another 50,000 rebels who attempted to flee across the river ended up drowning. Huangfu Song also burnt over 30,000 carts containing supplies for the rebels and captured most of their family members. Huangfu Song then had Zhang Jue's body excavated and decapitated, and sent his head to the imperial court in Luoyang.\n\nIn recognition of Huangfu Song's achievements, Emperor Ling promoted him to Left General of Chariots and Cavalry (左車騎將軍). Between 21 December 184 and 18 January 185, Huangfu Song joined forces with Guo Dian (郭典), the Administrator of Julu Commandery, to attack the remaining rebels led by Zhang Jue's other brother, Zhang Bao. They defeated the rebels at Xiaquyang County (下曲陽縣; west of present-day Jinzhou, Hebei), killed Zhang Bao and received the surrender of over 100,000 rebels.\n\nOn 24 March 184, the rebels led by Zhang Mancheng (張曼成) killed Chu Gong (褚貢), the Administrator of Nanyang Commandery (南陽郡; around present-day Nanyang, Henan), and occupied the commandery's capital, Wancheng (宛城; present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan). Chu Gong's successor, Qin Jie (秦頡), rallied local forces in Nanyang Commandery to attack Zhang Mancheng and defeated and killed him between 26 June and 25 July, before reinforcements led by Zhu Jun showed up.\n\nAfter Zhang Mancheng's death, Zhao Hong (趙弘) became the new rebel leader in Wancheng. Around October 184 or after, Qin Jie and Zhu Jun combined forces with Xu Qiu (徐璆), the Inspector of Jing Province, to attack Wancheng with an army of about 18,000. They defeated and killed Zhao Hong.\n\nFollowing Zhao Hong's death, Han Zhong (韓忠) and the remaining rebels seized control of Wancheng and continued to resist imperial forces. Zhu Jun ordered his troops to pretend to attack from the southwest, while he secretly led 5,000 elite soldiers to infiltrate Wancheng from the northeast. Han Zhong retreated into the citadel and wanted to surrender. Qin Jie, Xu Qiu and Zhang Chao (張超), a Major under Zhu Jun, all urged Zhu Jun to accept Han Zhong's surrender but he refused. Later, Zhu Jun pretended to lift the siege to lure Han Zhong to come out and attack. Han Zhong fell for the ruse, lost the battle and tried to flee north while some 10,000 of his men were slaughtered by imperial forces. In desperation, Han Zhong surrendered to Zhu Jun, but Qin Jie, who hated him, had him executed.\n\nOn 11 January 185, Zhu Jun defeated another rebel force led by Sun Xia (孫夏), who then fled towards Xi'e County (西鄂縣; north of present-day Nanyang, Henan). Zhu Jun pursued him there, defeated him and caused the remaining rebels to disperse.\n\nIn Xu Province, the provincial Inspector Tao Qian, with the aid of Zang Ba and others, managed to defeat the rebels and restore peace in the region.\n\nSun Jian, then a minor official serving in Xiapi County (下邳縣; south of present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu) in Xu Province, came to join Zhu Jun's army as a Major. He brought along with him several young men from Xiapi County and other soldiers he recruited from the Huai River region.\n\nIn Yang Province, the rebels attacked Shu County (舒縣; in present-day central Anhui), a county in Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡; around present-day Lu'an, Anhui), and set fire to buildings. Yang Xu (羊續), the Administrator of Lujiang Commandery, managed to rally thousands of able-bodied men aged 19 or above to help him in fighting the rebels and putting out the fires. He succeeded, restoring peace and stability in the region.\n\nBy the beginning of 185, the rebellion had mostly been suppressed following Zhu Jun's recapture of Wancheng in Nanyang Commandery and Huangfu Song's victories over the Zhang brothers in Ji Province. The remaining, scattered rebels were pursued by government forces in various mopping-up operations, and in mid-February 185, Emperor Ling issued a proclamation of celebration by changing his era name from Guanghe (光和) to Zhongping (中平; \"pacification achieved\").\n\nAlthough the Yellow Turban Rebellion ended by February 185, smaller rebellions by Yellow Turban remnants continued to break out throughout China over the following decades, even in provinces which were previously largely unaffected.\n\nBetween 16 March and 13 April 188, Guo Tai (郭太) led some 100,000 Yellow Turban remnants to start a rebellion in Xihe Commandery (西河郡; around present-day Fenyang, Shanxi). As they originated from Baibo Valley (白波谷; \"White Wave Valley\") in Xihe Commandery, they later became known as the \"White Wave Bandits\" (白波賊). They allied with the Xiongnu leader Yufuluo and attacked Taiyuan Commandery (太原郡; around present-day Taiyuan, Shanxi) and Hedong Commandery (河東郡; around present-day Yuncheng, Shanxi). Between 27 October and 25 November 189, when the bandits attacked Hedong Commandery, the warlord Dong Zhuo sent his son-in-law Niu Fu to lead troops to attack them, but Niu Fu failed to defeat them.\n\nAround mid-195, Emperor Xian fled from the imperial capital Chang'an, where he had been held hostage by Dong Zhuo's followers, led by Li Jue and Guo Si, since Dong Zhuo's death in 192. He returned to the ruins of the old imperial capital Luoyang, which Dong Zhuo burnt down in 191 while forcefully relocating its residents to Chang'an. Dong Cheng (a former subordinate of Niu Fu) and Yang Feng (a former White Wave bandit) protected Emperor Xian in Luoyang when Li Jue and Guo Si tried to pursue and bring the emperor back to Chang'an. Dong Cheng and Yang Feng summoned the White Wave Bandits, led by Li Le (李樂), Han Xian, Hu Cai (胡才) and others, to come to Emperor Xian's aid. Xiongnu forces led by Qubei (去卑) also responded to the call and came to help Emperor Xian resist Li Jue and Guo Si's forces. Between 195 and 196, the warlord Cao Cao led his forces into Luoyang and escorted Emperor Xian to his own base in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) and established the new imperial capital there.\n\nBetween 12 July and 10 August 185, Ma Xiang (馬相) and Zhao Zhi (趙祗) led Yellow Turban remnants to start a rebellion in Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). They killed Li Sheng (李升; Prefect of Mianzhu County 緜竹縣), Zhao Bu (趙部; Administrator of Ba Commandery 巴郡) and Xi Jian (郗儉; Inspector of Yi Province). Ma Xiang even declared himself emperor. The rebellion was suppressed by local forces led by Jia Long (賈龍), a former subordinate of Xi Jian.\n\nAround 189, Zhang Rao (張饒) led some 200,000 Yellow Turban remnants to ravage Qing Province. He defeated imperial forces under Kong Rong, the Han-appointed Chancellor of Beihai State (北海國; around present-day Weifang, Shandong) in Qing Province. Later, Kong Rong was besieged in Duchang County (都昌縣; present-day Changyi, Shandong) by thousands of Yellow Turban rebels led by Guan Hai (管亥). Taishi Ci, then a military officer under Kong Rong, managed to break out of the siege and seek help from Liu Bei, who was then the Chancellor of the nearby Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan County, Shandong). Liu Bei brought along 3,000 troops to attack Guan Hai and succeeded in saving Kong Rong.\n\nIn the 200s, Xu He (徐和) and Sima Ju (司馬俱) led Yellow Turban remnants from Jinan Commandery (濟南郡; around present-day Zhangqiu, Shandong) and Le'an Commandery (樂安郡; around present-day Zibo, Shandong) respectively to ravage Qing Province. They were defeated and killed by Xiahou Yuan, Zang Ba and Lü Qian sometime between 206 and 209.\n\nAround May 192, some hundreds of thousands of Yellow Turban remnants from Qing Province swarmed into Yan Province and killed Zheng Sui (鄭遂), the Chancellor of Rencheng State (任城國; around present-day Zoucheng, Shandong), before moving into Dongping Commandery (東平郡; around present-day Dongping County, Shandong). Liu Dai, the Inspector of Yan Province, wanted to lead his troops to attack the rebels but the general Bao Xin advised him against it. Liu Dai ignored Bao Xin's advice, attacked the rebels, and met his end. Bao Xin and another official, Wan Qian (萬潛), went to Dong Commandery (東郡; around present-day Puyang, Henan) to invite Cao Cao to be the new Governor of Yan Province. Bao Xin then led government forces to attack the rebels at the east of Shouzhang County (壽張縣; south of present-day Dongping County, Shandong) but was killed in action. Later, despite having fewer troops, Cao Cao managed to defeat the rebels in Jibei State (濟北國; around present-day Feicheng, Shandong). The rebels, numbering over 300,000, surrendered to Cao Cao along with their families. Cao Cao then recruited their best warriors and organised them to form an elite military unit, the Qingzhou Army (青州兵; also translated as \"Qingzhou Corps\").\n\nIn Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day Xinyang, Henan) and Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡; around present-day Xuchang, Henan), thousands of Yellow Turban remnants remained active under the leadership of He Yi (何儀), Liu Pi (劉辟), Huang Shao (黃邵), He Man (何曼) and others. They were initially allied with the warlords Yuan Shu and Sun Jian, but became an independent force in the 190s. Between 17 March and 15 April 196, the warlord Cao Cao led his forces to attack them and killed Liu Pi, Huang Shao and He Man. He Yi and the others surrendered to Cao Cao.\n\nThere were other Yellow Turban remnant forces led by Gong Du (共都/龔都) and Wu Ba (吳霸) in Runan Commandery. Wu Ba was defeated and captured by the general Li Tong. Gong Du posed a threat to Cao Cao when he allied with Cao Cao's rival, Liu Bei, and seized control of Runan Commandery in 201. Cao Cao first sent Cai Yang (蔡揚) to eliminate them, but after Cai Yang was killed, he personally led his troops to attack them and defeated them. Liu Bei fled south to join Liu Biao, while Gong Du and the remaining rebels dispersed.\n\nAnother Yellow Turban remnant force led by Wu Huan (吳桓) was active in Kuaiji Commandery (會稽郡; around present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang) until Liu Zan defeated and killed Wu Huan.\n\nIn the 200s, Chen Bai (陳敗) and Wan Cheng (萬秉) started a rebellion in Jiuzhen Commandery (九真郡; present-day Thanh Hóa Province, Vietnam) in Jiao Province. In 202, they were defeated and captured by Zhu Zhi, the commandery's Administrator.\n\nThe Han armies gained victory at high cost. Over wide areas, government offices had been destroyed, officials had been killed, and whole districts were cut off from the writ of the central government. Rebel deaths numbered in the hundreds of thousands, while many non-combatants had been left homeless or destitute by the wars, and the economy and society over great parts of this most populous region of the empire were left in ruins and without resources. Unrest remained and bandits appeared in every district; the Han government, in no position to put down all the lesser disturbances, was forced to patch up the situation as best it could. A long period of consolidation was needed to restore some measure of peace and prosperity, but that breathing space was not given.\n\nWhile the rebellion was eventually defeated, the military leaders and local administrators gained self-governing powers in the process. This hastened the collapse of the Han dynasty in 220. After Emperor Ling died in 189, a power struggle between He Jin and the eunuchs ensued in which He Jin was assassinated on 22 September 189. He Jin's chief ally, Yuan Shao, retaliated by setting the palace on fire and slaughtering the eunuchs. Finally, the warlord Dong Zhuo was able to gain control over the underage heir to the throne which he used as a legitimation for occupying the capital, which was ransacked on the occasion. Because of his cruelty, Dong Zhuo was murdered in 192, setting the stage for Cao Cao's rise to power.\n\nDespite the negative manner in which the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" describes the Yellow Turban Rebellion, many subsequent peasant uprisings in China drew inspiration from the Yellow Turban Rebellion and even claimed to be its spiritual successors.\n\n\n\nThe rebellion is portrayed in the opening chapters of the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", which portrays the Zhang brothers as sorcerers, having been provided the \"Taiping Jing\" from the \"old immortal spirit from the southern lands\" (sometimes identified as Zhuangzi).\n\nMany fictional Yellow Turban figures were created for the novel, including:\n\nThough not a fictional character, Liao Hua was presented in the novel as having been a Yellow Turban rebel in his earlier days; this is historically unlikely, given his date of death and predicted lifespan.\n\nThe rebellion also appears as an early stage in each iteration of Koei's \"Dynasty Warriors\" video game franchise, remaining largely unchanged throughout the series.\n\n"}
