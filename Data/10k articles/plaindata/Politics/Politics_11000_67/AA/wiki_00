The digits in the campaign’s name are a reference to the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the 50th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, and the 10th anniversary of the persecution of Falun Gong.\n\nThe 6521 Project was initiated as a top-level committee by the Communist Party, and was reportedly headed by Xi Jinping, current General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.\n\nUnder the campaign, all provinces and municipalities were required to establish temporary 6521 taskforces under the local Communist Party and Public Security leadership. Authorities at the township and county levels were also required to implement the 6521 project, reporting on their progress to municipal or provincial taskforces above them.\n\nIn parallel to the 6521 Project, a top-level coordinating body was created under the direction of Zhou Yongkang, called the \"Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Social Order.\" The committee identified a series of potential threats to social order, and prescribed measures to suppress them. The threats named included ethnic separatism in Tibet, Falun Gong, protests triggered by unemployment, land grabs, tainted products and labor disputes, crime, and the illicit installation of satellite receivers and illegal publishing. The Committee set out 33 measures to ensure social stability. It also revived a network of volunteer informants in schools and neighborhoods, and established a joint responsibility system that holds heads of households, work units, and local governments accountable in the event of protests or other destabilizing events.\n\n"}

{"id": "4102941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4102941", "title": "Alliance (Sweden)", "text": "Alliance (Sweden)\n\nThe Alliance (), formerly the Alliance for Sweden (\"Allians för Sverige\"), is a centre-right liberal conservative political alliance in Sweden.\n\nThe Alliance consists of the four centre-right political parties in the Riksdag. The Alliance was formed while in opposition, and later achieved a majority government in the 2006 general election and a minority government in the 2010 general election, governing Sweden from 2006 to 2014 with Fredrik Reinfeldt of the Moderate Party serving as Prime Minister of Sweden until the 2014 general election. The Alliance is co-chaired by every component party's individual leaders.\n\nAfter defeat in 2014, the Moderate Party's parliamentary group leader Anna Kinberg Batra announced to the Riksdag that the political alliance now \"will operate in opposition\".\n\nAs a result of the 2018 general election, the future of the Alliance is uncertain. In November, the Centre Party and the Liberals opposed Ulf Kristersson's proposed government coalition composed of the Moderates and the Christian Democrats. Kristersson was supported by three parties; his own Moderate Party, the Christian Democrats and the Sweden Democrats. The Centre Party and Liberals opposed the idea of such a coalition, as they are against any government that depends on the Sweden Democrats.\n\nThe Alliance consists of the four centre-right (, lit. \"bourgeois\") parties in the Riksdag (Sweden's parliament). The members are:\n\nSwedish politics had been dominated by the Social Democratic Party for over 70 years. They had been in government for all but nine years (summer of 1936, 1976–1982, 1991–1994) since 1932. The opposition parties decided that this was partly because they did not present a clear and viable alternative government. At a meeting held in the Centre Party leader Maud Olofsson's home in the village of Högfors, the four party leaders decided to form an alliance. The meeting ended on 31 August 2004 with the presentation of a joint declaration outlining the principles under which the four parties intended to fight the election. A year later a similar meeting was held at Christian Democrat leader Göran Hägglund's home in Bankeryd, resulting in the affirmation of the alliance and another declaration.\n\nThe Centre-right Alliance for Sweden aimed to win a majority of seats in the 2006 Riksdag elections and form a coalition government.\n\nIn order to do this, the member parties decided to issue common policy statements and to have a joint election manifesto. Each individual party still had its own manifesto and policies, but these will build up from common proposals in the Alliance's joint proposals. The Alliance has policy working groups for six areas: economic policy, education policy, foreign policy, the welfare state, employment and business policy, and policing. These were not set according to party size, but with one senior politician (often MP) and one staff per party, and following the idea that \"everybody contributes and everybody gains\".\n\nAn example of this policy cooperation was the budget proposal that the Alliance parties put forward on 2 October 2005. The core proposal was a tax cut of 49 billion Swedish kronor, which is 1.9% of GDP and 3.3% of the total income of the public sector in 2005. Each individual party also proposed its own policies in addition. For example, the Liberals want to spend 1bn kronor extra on tertiary education and the Christian Democrats want to have more benefits and tax deductions for families.\n\nOn 14 June 2006 Alliance for Sweden agreed on a common energy policy. It will apply over the next parliamentary term (2006–2010), and includes a promise not to shut down any more nuclear reactors during that period (Barsebäck 2 was shut down in 2005). The proposal is that no more reactors are to be built, that the nuclear phase-out law will be repealed and that all forms of energy research will be legal and able to receive state grants (research on nuclear power is currently forbidden in Sweden). An Alliance government would also grant any applications to increase the output of the existing plants, provided that it would be safe to do so. This has been hailed as a historic step, as disagreement over nuclear power has long plagued the centre-right in Sweden: the Centre Party opposes nuclear power, the Moderates and Christian Democrats support its continuing operation while the Liberals want to build more reactors. Some doubts have been raised about the long-term survival of this compromise, as neither the Centre Party nor the Liberals have changed their fundamental positions on nuclear power.\n\nOn 5 July 2006, during the politics week at Almedalen on Gotland, the Alliance parties announced a plan to abolish property tax. Their agreement promises to freeze taxable values at the current level (so that the revaluation that is being carried out will not apply), and to reduce the rate of tax on apartments from 0.5% to 0.4% of their taxable value. A ceiling of 5000 kronor will also be imposed on the taxation of the value of a house's plot. The parties are also agreed on the abolition of the tax and its replacement with a municipal charge independent of the value of the property; this reform is planned to be carried out in 2008. Property tax is estimated to bring in 28.1 billion kronor in 2006, rising to 30.2bn in 2007 and 32.2bn in 2008 (as taxable values rise). The first stage of the Alliance's plan (freezing property values, capping the tax on land value and reducing the rate for apartments) is estimated to cost around 4-5 billion kronor. The financing of this is to be revealed in the Alliance's manifesto in August 2006.\n\nAlliance for Sweden released its election manifesto, entitled \"More people at work - more to share\" (), on 23 August 2006.\n\nThe result of the election was clear enough on election night for Moderate Party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt to declare himself the victor and for Göran Persson to announce his resignation as Prime Minister and as leader of the Social Democratic Party. The four centre-right parties of Alliance for Sweden formed a government with Fredrik Reinfeldt as Prime Minister, which was presented to the Riksdag on 6 October.\n\nMinister for Finance Anders Borg presented the government's first budget on 16 October 2006. The budget contains many of the proposals that were prominent in the Alliance's election campaign: both the job deduction in the income tax, which will also be larger for old people to encourage them to remain in the labour market, and the \"fresh start jobs\" with reduced payroll tax for companies employing people who have been unemployed for more than a year will come into effect from 1 January 2007. Tax reductions for companies hiring young people and for domestic services are to come into effect on 1 July. The tax reductions announced in the budget total 42 billion Swedish kronor, of which the income tax deduction is 38.7 billion. Other changes include the ending of employers' co-financing of sickness benefit after the second week, reduction of unemployment benefits and considerably raised fees to unemployment funds, resulting in a substantial decline in union density and density of unemployment funds. Unemployment benefit would remain 80% of previous pay for 200 days then drop to 70%. Benefit would be payable for a maximum of 300 days, or 450 if the recipient has children.\n\nIn 1991, the Alliance was called the Centre-Right Parties. They formed the centre-right minority coalition government in 1991 with the support of right-wing populist party After the coalition had been lost in 1994, the Centre-Right Parties was dissolved but the centre-right opposition parties continued to work together. In 2004, the four parties Moderate Party, Centre Party, Liberal People's Party and the Christian Democrats wanted to collaborate again. So they started the Alliance. Alliance is a revival of the Centre-Right Parties.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42277", "title": "Aryan race", "text": "Aryan race\n\nThe Aryan race is a racial grouping that emerged in the period of the late 19th century and mid-20th century to describe people of Indo-European heritage.\n\nIt derives from the idea that the original speakers of the Indo-European languages and their descendants up to the present day constitute a distinctive race or subrace of the Caucasian race.\n\nThe term \"Aryan\" has generally been used to describe the Proto-Indo-Iranian language root *arya which was the ethnonym the Indo-Iranians adopted to describe Aryans. Its cognate in Sanskrit is the word \"ārya\" (Devanāgarī: आर्य), in origin an ethnic self-designation, in Classical Sanskrit meaning \"honourable, respectable, noble\". The Old Persian cognate \"ariya-\" (Old Persian cuneiform: 𐎠𐎼𐎡𐎹) is the ancestor of the modern name of Iran and ethnonym for the Iranian people.\n\nIn the 18th century, the most ancient known Indo-European languages were those of the ancient Indo-Iranians. The word \"Aryan\" was therefore adopted to refer not only to the Indo-Iranian peoples, but also to native Indo-European speakers as a whole, including the Romans, Greeks, and the Germans. It was soon recognised that Balts, Celts, and Slavs also belonged to the same group. It was argued that all of these languages originated from a common root – now known as Proto-Indo-European – spoken by an ancient people who were thought of as ancestors of the European, Iranian, and Indo-Aryan peoples.\n\nThis usage was common among knowledgeable authors writing in the late 19th and early 20th century. An example of this usage appears in \"The Outline of History\", a bestselling 1920 work by H. G. Wells. In that influential volume, Wells used the term in the plural (\"the Aryan peoples\"), but he was a staunch opponent of the racist and politically motivated exploitation of the singular term (\"the Aryan people\") by earlier authors like Houston Stewart Chamberlain (see below) and was careful either to avoid the generic singular, though he did refer now and again in the singular to some specific \"Aryan people\" (e.g., the Scythians). In 1922, in \"A Short History of the World\", Wells depicted a highly diverse group of various \"Aryan peoples\" learning \"methods of civilization\" and then, by means of different uncoordinated movements that Wells believed were part of a larger dialectical rhythm of conflict between settled civilizations and nomadic invaders that also encompassed Aegean and Mongol peoples \"inter alia\", \"subjugat[ing]\" – \"in form\" but not in \"ideas and methods\" – \"the whole ancient world, Semitic, Aegean and Egyptian alike\".\n\nHowever, in a climate of burgeoning racism it proved difficult to maintain such nuanced distinctions. Even Max Mueller, a linguist who wrote in 1888 that \"an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar\", was on occasion guilty of using the term \"Aryan race\".\n\nIn the 1944 edition of Rand McNally's \"World Atlas\", the Aryan race is depicted as one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind. The science fiction author Poul Anderson, an anti-racist libertarian of Scandinavian ancestry, in his many works, consistently used the term \"Aryan\" as a synonym for \"Indo-Europeans\".\n\nThe use of \"Aryan\" as a synonym for Indo -European may occasionally appear in material that is based on historic scholarship. Thus, a 1989 article in \"Scientific American\", Colin Renfrew uses the term \"Aryan\" as a synonym for \"Indo-European\".\n\nThe term Indo-Aryan is still commonly used to describe the Indic half of the Indo-Iranian languages, i.e., the family that includes Sanskrit and modern languages such as Hindi-Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati, Romani, Kashmiri, Sinhalese and Marathi.\n\nIn the context of 19th-century physical anthropology and scientific racism, the term \"Aryan race\" has been misapplied to all people descended from the Proto-Indo-Europeans – a subgroup of the Europidor \"Caucasian\" race, in addition to the Indo-Iranians (who are the only people known to have used \"Arya\" as an endonym in ancient times). This usage was considered to include most modern inhabitants of Australasia, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Siberia, South Asia, Southern Africa, and West Asia. Such claims became increasingly common during the early 19th century, when it was commonly believed that the Aryans originated in the south-west Eurasian steppes (present-day Russia and Ukraine).\n\nMax Müller is often identified as the first writer to mention an \"Aryan race\" in English. In his \"Lectures on the Science of Language\" (1861), Muller referred to Aryans as a \"race of people\". At the time, the term race had the meaning of \"a group of tribes or peoples, an ethnic group\". Müller's concept of Aryan was later construed to imply a biologically distinct sub-group of humanity, by writers such as Arthur de Gobineau, who argued that the Aryans represented a superior branch of humanity. Müller objected to the mixing of linguistics and anthropology. \"The Science of Language and the Science of Man cannot be kept too much asunder ... I must repeat what I have said many times before, it would be wrong to speak of Aryan blood as of dolichocephalic grammar\". He restated his opposition to this method in 1888 in his essay \"Biographies of words and the home of the Aryas\".\nBy the late 19th century the steppe theory of Indo-European origins was challenged by a view that the Indo-Europeans originated in ancient Germany or Scandinavia – or at least that in those countries the original Indo-European ethnicity had been preserved. The word Aryan was consequently used even more restrictively – and even less in keeping with its Indo-Iranian origins – to mean \"Germanic\", \"Nordic\" or Northern Europeans. This implied division of Caucasoids into Aryans, Semites and Hamites was also based on linguistics, rather than based on physical anthropology; it paralleled an archaic tripartite division in anthropology between \"Nordic\", \"Alpine\" and \"Mediterranean\" races.\n\nA number of later writers, such as the French anthropologist Vacher de Lapouge in his book \"L'Aryen\", argued that this superior branch could be identified biologically by using the cephalic index (a measure of head shape) and other indicators. He argued that the long-headed \"dolichocephalic-blond\" Europeans, characteristically found in northern Europe, were natural leaders, destined to rule over more \"brachiocephalic\" (short headed) peoples.\n\nThe German origin of the Aryans was especially promoted by the archaeologist Gustaf Kossinna, who claimed that the Proto-Indo-European peoples were identical to the Corded Ware culture of Neolithic Germany. This idea was widely circulated in both intellectual and popular culture by the early twentieth century, and is reflected in the concept of \"Corded-Nordics\" in Carleton S. Coon's 1939 \"The Races of Europe\".\n\nOther anthropologists contested such claims. In Germany, Rudolf Virchow launched a study of craniometry, which prompted him to denounce \"Nordic mysticism\" in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in Karlsruhe, while Josef Kollmann, a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be they English, German, French, and Spaniard belonged to a \"mixture of various races,\" furthermore declaring that the \"results of craniology...[are] against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race\" to others.\n\nVirchow's contribution to the debate sparked a controversy. Houston Stewart Chamberlain, a strong supporter of the theory of a superior Aryan race or Germanic race, attacked Josef Kollmann arguments in detail. While the \"Aryan race\" theory remained popular, particularly in Germany, some authors defended Virchow's perspective, in particular Otto Schrader, Rudolph von Jhering and the ethnologist Robert Hartmann (1831–1893), who proposed to ban the notion of \"Aryan\" from anthropology.\n\nThe Theosophical movement, founded by Helena Blavatsky and Henry Olcott at the end of the nineteenth century, took inspiration from Indian culture, in this case, perhaps, from the Hindu reform movement the Arya Samaj founded by Swami Dayananda.\nBlavatsky argued that humanity had descended from a series of \"root races\", naming the fifth root race (out of seven) the Aryan race. She thought that the Aryans originally came from Atlantis and described the Aryan races with the following words:\n\nBlavatsky used \"Root Race\" as a technical term to describe human evolution over the large time periods in her cosmology. However, she also claimed that there were modern non-Aryan peoples who were inferior to Aryans. She regularly contrasts \"Aryan\" with \"Semitic\" culture, to the detriment of the latter, asserting that Semitic peoples are an offshoot of Aryans who have become \"degenerate in spirituality and perfected in materiality.\" She also states that some peoples are \"semi-animal creatures\". These latter include \"the Tasmanians, a portion of the Australians and a mountain tribe in China\". There are also \"considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi-human stocks – e.g., the wild men of Borneo, the Veddhas of Ceylon, most of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos, Andaman Islanders, etc.\"\n\nDespite this, Blavatsky's admirers claim that her thinking was not connected to fascist or racialist ideas, asserting that she believed in a Universal Brotherhood of humanity and wrote that \"all men have spiritually and physically the same origin\" and that \"mankind is essentially of one and the same essence\". On the other hand, in \"The Secret Doctrine\", Blavatsky states: \"Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence.\"\n\nBlavatsky connects physical race with spiritual attributes constantly throughout her works:\nThe intellectual difference between the Aryan and other civilized nations and such savages as the South Sea Islanders, is inexplicable on any other grounds. No amount of culture, nor generations of training amid civilization, could raise such human specimens as the Bushmen, the Veddhas of Ceylon, and some African tribes, to the same intellectual level as the Aryans, the Semites, and the Turanians so called. The 'sacred spark' is missing in them and it is they who are the only inferior races on the globe, now happily – owing to the wise adjustment of nature which ever works in that direction – fast dying out. Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence. We are the hot-house, artificially quickened plants in nature, having in us a spark, which in them is latent.\" ... Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (Chinamen, African Negroes, &c.) gradually brought the worship back. The Vedas countenance no idols; all the modern Hindu writings do.\n\nAccording to Blavatsky, \"the MONADS of the lowest specimens of humanity (the \"narrow-brained\" savage South-Sea Islander, the African, the Australian) had no Karma to work out when first born as men, as their more favoured brethren in intelligence had\".\n\nShe also prophesies of the destruction of the racial \"failures of nature\" as the future \"higher race\" ascends:\nThus will mankind, race after race, perform its appointed cycle-pilgrimage. Climates will, and have already begun, to change, each tropical year after the other dropping one sub-race, but only to beget another higher race on the ascending cycle; while a series of other less favoured groups – the failures of nature – will, like some individual men, vanish from the human family without even leaving a trace behind.\n\nThe second subrace of the Fifth or Aryan root race, the Arabian, is regarded by Theosophists as one of the Aryan subraces. It is believed by Theosophists that the Arabians, although asserted in traditional Theosophy to be of Aryan (i.e., Indo-European) ancestry, adopted the Semitic language of the people around them who had migrated earlier from Atlantis (the fifth or (original) Semite subrace of the Atlantean root race). Theosophists assert that the Jews originated as an offshoot of the Arabian subrace in what is now Yemen about 30,000 BC. They migrated first to Somalia and then later to Egypt, where they lived until the time of Moses. Thus, according to the teachings of Theosophy, the Jews are part of the Aryan race.\n\nGuido von List (and his followers such as Lanz von Liebenfels) later took up some of Blavatsky's ideas, mixing her ideology with nationalistic and fascist ideas; this system of thought became known as Ariosophy. It was believed in Ariosophy that the Teutonics were superior to all other peoples because according to Theosophy the Teutonics or Nordics were the most recent subrace of the Aryan root race to have evolved. Such views also fed into the development of Nazi ideology. Theosophical publications such as \"The Aryan Path\" were strongly opposed to the Nazi usage, attacking racialism.\n\nThe ideology of Nazism was based upon the conception of the ancient Aryan race being a superior race, holding the highest position in the racial hierarchy and that the Germanic peoples were the most racially pure existing peoples of Aryan stock. The Nazi conception of the Aryan race arose from earlier proponents of a supremacist conception of the race as described by racial theorist figures such as Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain.\n\nNazi racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther identified the European race as having five subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine, and East Baltic. Günther applied a Nordicist conception that Nordics were the highest in the racial hierarchy amongst these five European subtype races. In his book \"Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes\" (1922) (\"Racial Science of the German People\"), Günther recognized Germans as being composed of all five European subtypes, but emphasized the strong Nordic heritage amongst Germans. Günther believed Slavic people to be of \"Eastern race\", one that was separate from Germans and Nordics, and warned about mixing \"German blood\" with Slavic one. He defined each racial subtype according to general physical appearance and their psychological qualities including their \"racial soul\" - referring to their emotional traits and religious beliefs, and provided detailed information on their hair, eye, and skin colours, facial structure. He provided photographs of Germans identified as Nordic in places like Baden, Stuttgart, Salzburg, and Schwaben; and provided photographs of Germans he identified as Alpine and Mediterranean types, especially in Vorarlberg, Bavaria, and the Black Forest region of Baden. Adolf Hitler read \"Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes,\" which influenced his racial policy and resulted in Günther's Nazi-backed attainment of a position in the anthropology department at the University of Jena in 1932 where Hitler attended Günther's inaugural lecture.\n\nGünther distinguished Aryans from Jews, and identified Jews as descending from non-European races, particularly from what he classified as the Near Asian race (\"Vorderasiatische\") more commonly known as the Armenoid race, and said that such origins rendered Jews fundamentally different from and incompatible with Germans and most Europeans. This association of Jews with the Armenoid type had been utilized by Zionist Jews who claimed that Jews were a group within that type. He claimed that the Near Eastern race descended from the Caucasus in the fifth and fourth millennia BC, and that it had expanded into Asia Minor and Mesopotamia and eventually to the west coast of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Aside from ascribing Armenians and Jews as having Near Eastern characteristics, he ascribed them to several other contemporary peoples, including: Greeks, Turks, Syrians, and Iranians. In his work \"Racial Characteristics of the Jewish People\", he defined the racial soul of the Near Eastern race as emphasizing a \"commercial spirit\" (\"Handelgeist\"), and described them as \"artful traders\" - a term that Gunther ascribed as being used by Jewish racial theorist Samuel Weissenberg to describe contemporary Armenians, Greeks, and Jews. Günther added to that description of the Near Eastern type as being composed primarily of commercially spirited and artful traders, by claiming that the type held strong psychological manipulation skills that aided them in trade. He claimed that the Near Eastern race had been \"bred not so much for the conquest and exploitation of nature as it was for the conquest and exploitation of people\".\n\nHitler's conception of the Aryan \"Herrenvolk\" (\"master race\") explicitly excluded the vast majority of Slavs, regarding the Slavs as having dangerous Jewish and Asiatic influences. Because of this, the Nazis declared Slavs to be \"Untermenschen\" (subhumans). Exceptions were made for a small percentage of Slavs who were seen by the Nazis to be descended from German settlers and therefore fit to be Germanised to be considered part of the Aryan folk or nation. Hitler described Slavs as \"a mass of born slaves who feel the need of a master\". Hitler declared that because Slavs were subhumans that the Geneva Conventions were not applicable to them, and German soldiers in World War II were thus permitted to ignore the Geneva Conventions in regards to Slavs. Hitler called Slavs \"a rabbit family\" meaning they were intrinsically idle and disorganized. Nazi Germany's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels had media speak of Slavs as primitive animals who were from the Siberian tundra who were like a \"dark wave of filth\". The Nazi notion of Slavs being inferior non-Aryans was part of the agenda for creating Lebensraum (\"living space\") for Germans and other Germanic people in eastern Europe that was initiated during World War II under \"Generalplan Ost\": millions of Germans and other Germanic settlers would be moved into conquered territories of Eastern Europe, while the original Slavic inhabitants were to be annihilated, removed, or enslaved. Nazi Germany's ally the Independent State of Croatia rejected the common conception that Croats were primarily a Slavic people and claimed that Croats were primarily the descendants of the Germanic Goths. However the Nazi regime continued to classify Croats as a \"subhuman\" in spite of the alliance. Nazi Germany's policy changed towards Slavs in response to military manpower shortages, in which it accepted Slavs to serve in its armed forces within occupied territories, in spite of them being considered subhuman, as a pragmatic means to resolve such manpower shortages.\n\nShortly after the Nazis came to power in 1933 they passed the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service law which required all civil servants to provide proof of their Aryan ancestry and defined \"non-Aryan\" as a person with one Jewish grandparent. In 1933, the German Interior Ministry official Albert Gorter drafted an official definition of the \"Aryan race\" for the new law which included all non-Jewish Europeans, this definition was unacceptable by the Nazis. However, Achim Gerke revised Gorter's draft of the Civil Service Law classifying Aryans as people \"tribally\" related to \"German blood\". The Nuremberg race laws of 1935 classified as \"racially acceptable\" people with \"German or related blood\".\n\nHitler often doubted whether Czechs were Aryan or not, he said in his table talk \"It is enough for a Czech to grow a moustache for anyone to see, from the way the thing droops, that his origin is Mongolian.\" The question of whether Italians were Aryan enough was questioned by the Nazi racial theorists. Hitler viewed northern Italians as strongly Aryan, but not southern Italians. The Nazis viewed the downfall of the Roman Empire as being the result of the pollution of blood from racial intermixing, claiming that Italians were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Hitler even mentioned his view of the presence of Negroid blood in the Mediterranean peoples during his first meeting with Mussolini in 1934. The definition of \"Aryan\" remained in constant flux to such an extent that the Nazis questioned whether European ethnic groups such as Finns or Hungarians were to be classified as \"Aryans\". Hungarians were classified as \"tribally alien\" but not necessarily \"blood alien\", in 1934 the Nazis published a pamphlet which declared Magyars (which it did not define) as Aryans. The following year, an article published by the Nazis admitted that there were disputes over the racial status of Hungarians. As late as 1943, there were disputes over whether Hungarians were to be classified as Aryan.\nIn 1942, Hitler declared that the Finns were \"racially related Germanic neighboring peoples\", although there is no evidence to suggest that this was based on anything racial.\n\nThe idea of the Northern origins of the Aryans was particularly influential in Germany. It was widely believed that the \"Vedic Aryans\" were ethnically identical to the Goths, Vandals and other ancient Germanic peoples of the \"Völkerwanderung\". This idea was often intertwined with antisemitic ideas. The distinctions between the \"Aryan\" and \"Semitic\" peoples were based on the aforementioned linguistic and ethnic history. A complete, highly speculative theory of Aryan and anti-Semitic history can be found in Alfred Rosenberg's major work, \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\".\nSemitic peoples came to be seen as a foreign presence within Aryan societies, and the Semitic peoples were often pointed to as the cause of conversion and destruction of social order and values leading to culture and civilization's downfall by proto-Nazi theorists such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain.\n\nThese and other ideas evolved into the Nazi use of the term \"Aryan race\" to refer to what they saw as being a superior race, which was narrowly defined by the Nazis as being identical with the Nordic race, followed by other sub-races of the Aryan race and excluding Slavs as non-Aryan. They worked to maintain the purity of this race through eugenics programs (including anti-miscegenation legislation, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and the mentally deficient, the execution of the institutionalized mentally ill as part of a euthanasia program).\n\nHeinrich Himmler (the \"Reichsführer\" of the SS), the person ordered by Adolf Hitler to implement the Final Solution, or the Holocaust, told his personal masseur Felix Kersten that he always carried with him a copy of the ancient Aryan scripture, the Bhagavad Gita because it relieved him of guilt about what he was doing – he felt that like the warrior Arjuna, he was simply doing his duty without attachment to his actions.\n\nIn a 1921 speech in Bologna, Mussolini stated that \"Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our Aryan and Mediterranean race\". In this speech Mussolini was referring to Italians as being the Mediterranean branch of the Aryan race, Aryan in the meaning of people of an Indo-European language and culture. Italian Fascism emphasized that race was bound by spiritual and cultural foundations, and identified a racial hierarchy based on spiritual and cultural factors. While Italian Fascism based its conception of race on spiritual and cultural factors, Mussolini explicitly rejected notions that biologically \"pure\" races existed though biology was still considered a relevant factor in race.\n\nItalian Fascism strongly rejected the common Nordicist conception of the Aryan race that idealized \"pure\" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes. The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of what they viewed as the Mediterranean inferiority complex that they claimed had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus in their view inferior. Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex, initially rejecting Nordicism. However traditional Nordicist claims of Mediterraneans being degenerate due to having a darker colour of skin than Nordics had long been rebuked in anthropology through the depigmentation theory that claimed that lighter-skinned peoples had been depigmented from a darker skin, this theory has since become a widely accepted view in anthropology. Anthropologist Carleton S. Coon in his work \"The races of Europe\" (1939) subscribed to depigmentation theory that claimed that the Nordic race's light-coloured skin was the result of depigmentation from their ancestors of the Mediterranean race.\n\nIn the early 1930s, with the rise to power of the Nazi Party in Germany with \"Führer\" Adolf Hitler's emphasis on a Nordicist conception of the Aryan race, strong tensions arose between the Fascists and the Nazis over racial issues. In 1934, in the aftermath of Austrian Nazis killing Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, an ally of Italy, Mussolini became enraged and responded by angrily denouncing Nazism. Mussolini rebuked Nazism's Nordicism, claiming that the Nazis' emphasizing of a common Nordic \"Germanic race\" was absurd, saying \"a Germanic race does not exist. ... We repeat. Does not exist. Scientists say so. Hitler says so.\" The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was indeed acknowledged by prominent Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther in his book \"Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes\" (1922) (\"Racial Science of the German People\"), where Günther recognized Germans as being composed of five Aryan subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine, and East Baltic while asserting that the Nordics were the highest in a racial hierarchy of the five subtypes.\n\nBy 1936, the tensions between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany reduced and relations became more amicable. In 1936, Mussolini decided to launch a racial programme in Italy, and was interested in the racial studies being conducted by Giulio Cogni. Cogni was a Nordicist but did not equate Nordic identity with Germanic identity as was commonly done by German Nordicists. Cogni had travelled to Germany where he had become impressed by Nazi racial theory and sought to create his own version of racial theory. On 11 September 1936, Cogni sent Mussolini a copy of his newly published book \"Il Razzismo\" (1936). Cogni declared the racial affinity of the Mediterranean and Nordic racial subtypes of the Aryan race and claimed that the intermixing of Nordic Aryans and Mediterranean Aryans in Italy produced a superior synthesis of Aryan Italians. Cogni addressed the issue of racial differences between northern and southern Italians, declaring southern Italians were mixed between Aryan and non-Aryan races, that he claimed was most likely due to infiltration by Asiatic peoples in Roman times and later Arab invasions. As such, Cogni viewed Southern Italian Mediterraneans as being polluted with orientalizing tendencies. He would later change his idea and claim that Nordics and Southern Italians were closely related groups both racially and spiritually. His opinion was that they were generally responsible for what is the best in European civilization. Initially Mussolini was not impressed with Cogni's work, however Cogni's ideas entered into the official Fascist racial policy several years later.\n\nIn 1938 Mussolini was concerned that if Italian Fascism did not recognize Nordic heritage within Italians, that the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to Italian society. Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognized Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent and in a meeting with PNF members, and in June 1938 in a meeting with PNF members, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was to be replaced by a focus on Aryanism.\n\nThe Fascist regime began publication of the racialist magazine \"La Difesa della Razza\" in 1938. The Nordicist racial theorist Guido Landra took a major role in the early work of \"La Difesa\", and published the \"Manifesto of Racial Scientists\" in the magazine in 1938. The \"Manifesto\" received substantial criticism, including its assertion of Italians being a \"pure race\", as it was viewed as absurd. \"La Difesa\" published other theories that described long-term Nordic Aryan amongst Italians, such as the theory that in the Eneolithic age Nordic Aryans arrived to Italy. Many of the writers took up the traditional Nordicist claim that the decline and fall of the Roman Empire was due to the arrival of Semitic immigrants. \"La Difesa\"'s writers were divided on their claims that described how Italians extricated themselves from Semitic influence.\n\nThe Nordicist direction of Fascist racial policy was challenged in 1938 by a resurgence of the Mediterraneanist faction in the PNF. By 1939, the Mediterraneanists' advocacy of a nativist racial theory that rejected ascribing the achievements of the Italian people to Nordic peoples. This nativist racial policy was prominently promoted by Ugo Rellini. Rellini rejected the notion of large-scale invasions of Italy by Nordic Aryans in the Eneolithic age, and claimed that Italians were an indigenous people descended from the Cro-Magnons. Rellini claimed that Mediterranean and Nordic peoples arrived later and peacefully intermixed in small numbers with the indigenous Italian population.\n\nIn 1941 the PNF's Mediterraneanists through the influence of Giacomo Acerbo put forward a comprehensive definition of the Italian race. However these efforts were challenged by Mussolini's endorsement of Nordicist figures with the appointment of staunch spiritual Nordicist Alberto Luchini as head of Italy's Racial Office in May 1941, as well as with Mussolini becoming interested in Julius Evola's spiritual Nordicism in late 1941. Acerbo and the Mediterraneanists in his High Council on Demography and Race sought to bring the regime back to supporting Mediterraneanism by thoroughly denouncing the pro-Nordicist \"Manifesto of the Racial Scientists\". The Council recognized Aryans as being a linguistic-based group, and condemned the \"Manifesto\" for denying the influence of pre-Aryan civilization on modern Italy, saying that the \"Manifesto\" \"constitutes an unjustifiable and undemonstrable negation of the anthropological, ethnological, and archaeological discoveries that have occurred and are occurring in our country\". Furthermore, the Council denounced the \"Manifesto\" for \"implicitly\" crediting Germanic invaders of Italy in the guise of the Lombards for having \"a formative influence on the Italian race in a disproportional degree to the number of invaders and to their biological predominance\". The Council claimed that the obvious superiority of the ancient Greeks and Romans in comparison with the ancient Germanic tribes made it inconceivable that Italian culture owed a debt to ancient Aryan Germans. The Council denounced the \"Manifesto\"'s Nordicist attitude towards Mediterraneans that it claimed was \"considering them as slaves\" and was \"a repudiation of the entire Italian civilization\".\n\nSince the military defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies in 1945, some neo-Nazis have developed a more inclusive definition of \"Aryan\", claiming that the peoples of Western Europe are the closest descendants of the ancient Aryans, with Nordic and Germanic peoples being the most \"racially pure.\"\n\nAccording to Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, many neo-Nazis want to establish an autocratic state modeled after Nazi Germany to be called the \"Western Imperium\". It is believed that this proposed state would be able to attain world domination by combining the nuclear arsenals of the four major Aryan world powers, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia under a single military command.\n\nThis proposed state would be led by a \"Führer\"-like figure called the \"Vindex\", and would include all areas inhabited by the \"Aryan race\", as conceived by Neo-Nazis. Only those of the Aryan race would be full citizens of the state. The \"Western Imperium\" would embark on a vigorous and dynamic program of space exploration, followed by the creation by genetic engineering of a super race called Homo Galactica. The concept of the \"Western Imperium\" as outlined in the previous three sentences is based on the original concept of the \"Imperium\" as outlined in the 1947 book \"Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics\" by Francis Parker Yockey as further updated, extended and refined in the early 1990s in pamphlets published by David Myatt.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Many had ties to conservative organizations. In recent years, more liberal Asian-American groups such as newer Chinese and Indian immigrants have greatly changed the Asian-American political demographics, as well as a larger proportion of younger Asian Americans, many of whom have completed college degrees.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, Asian American voting behavior shifted from moderate support for the Republican Party to stronger support for the Democratic Party. In the 1992 presidential election Republican George H. W. Bush received 55% of the Asian-American vote compared to 31% for Democrat Bill Clinton. Asian Americans voted Republican and were the only racial group more conservative than whites in the 1990s, according to surveys. By the 2004 election, Democrat John Kerry won 56% of the Asian American vote, with Chinese and Indian Americans tending to support Kerry, and Vietnamese and Filipino Americans tending to support George Bush. Japanese-Americans leaned towards Kerry, while Korean-Americans leaned towards Bush. Democrat Barack Obama won 62% of the Asian American vote in the 2008 presidential election, with the margin increasing during the 2012 presidential election, where Asian Americans voted to re-elect Obama by 73%. In the 2014 midterm elections, based on exit polls, 50% of Asian Americans voted Republican, while 49% voted Democrat; this swing towards voting for Republicans was a shift from the strong Democratic vote in 2012, and had not reached 50% since 1996. The 2016 National Asian American Survey, conducted before the 2016 presidential election, found that 55% of Asian American registered voters supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and only 14% supported Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nDespite their growing trend of voting for Democrats in national elections, Asian Americans have tended to identify as independents and have not developed strong ties to political parties as a group. Due to the smaller size of the groups population, in comparison to the population as a whole, it has been difficult to get an adequate sampling to forecast voter outcomes for Asian Americans. In 2008, polls indicated that 35% considered themselves non-partisan, 32% Democrats, 19% independents, and 14% Republicans. The 2012 National Asian American Survey found that 51% considered themselves non-partisan, 33% Democrats, 14% Republicans, and 2% Other; Hmong, Indian, and Korean Americans strongly identified as Democrats, and Filipino and Vietnamese Americans most strongly identified as Republicans. In 2013, according to the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Chinese Americans were the least likely Asian American ethnicity to have a party affiliation, with only one third belonging to a party. The 2016 National Asian American Survey found that 41% of Asian Americans identified as non-partisan, 41% as Democrats (a modest increase from 2008 and 2012), and 16% as Republicans.\n\nNeither the Republican nor Democratic parties have financed significant efforts to the registration of Asian Americans, however much more attention has been focused on contributions from Asian Americans, having once been referred to as potential \"Republican Jews\". As recently as 2006, the outreach efforts of America's two major political parties have been unbalanced, with the Democratic Party devoting more resources in attracting Asian Americans. In 2016, a majority of Asian-Americans possessed the same political views on racial profiling, education, social security, and immigration reform as the Democratic Party; the efforts to attract Asian-Americans has produced a proportionally significant growth in Democratic affiliation by Asian-Americans from 2012 to 2016 by 12 percent. Political affiliation aside, Asian Americans have trended to become more politically active as a whole, with 2008 seeing an increase of voter participation by 4% to a 49% voting rate.\n\nThis is a timeline of significant events in Asian history which have shaped the conservative movement in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The alphabet was based on the Latin alphabet used in English. Franklin modified the standard English alphabet by omitting the letters c, j, q, w, x, and y, and adding new letters to explicitly represent the open-mid back rounded and unrounded vowels, and the consonants sh, ng, voiced th, and voiceless th. It was one of the earlier proposed spelling reforms to the English language. The alphabet consisted of 26 letters in the following order:\nOther English phonemes are represented as follows:\n\nFranklin's proposed alphabet included seven letters to represent vowels. This set consisted of two new letters, in addition to five letters from the existing English alphabet: a, e, i, o, u. The first new letter was a formed as a ligature of the letters o and a, and used to represent the sound (as written in IPA). The second, ɥ, was used for .\n\nFranklin proposed the use of doubled letters to represent what he called long vowels, represented by modern phonemes thus: as the long-vowel variant for (or, in his notation, \"cɩcɩ\" versus \"cɩ\"), for (\"ee\" versus \"e\"), and for (\"ii\" versus \"i\"). However, these distinctions appear not perfectly identical to the distinctions today; for example, the only word shown to use \"cɩcɩ\" is the word \"all\", but not other words that in modern notation would use . This discrepancy may reflect Franklin's own inconsistencies, but, even more likely, it reflects legitimate differences in the English phonology of his particular time and place.\n\nIn his examples of writing in the proposed alphabet, Franklin contrasts long and short uses of his letter e, with the words \"mend\" and \"remain,\" respectively spelled in Franklin's system as \"mend\" and \"remeen.\" In this system, the doubled \"ee\" is used to represent the sound in \"late\" and \"pale.\" Likewise, \"ii\" is used to represent the sound in \"degrees\", \"pleased\", and \"serene.\" One of Franklin's correspondences written in the new alphabet is inconsistent in this regard, representing the sound in \"great\" and \"compared\" with the accented letter \"ê\" instead of \"ee\".\n\nFranklin does not appear to make a distinction between the modern and phonemes, which likely reveals another difference between eighteenth-century English pronunciation versus modern pronunciation.\n\nFranklin's proposed alphabet included nineteen letters to represent consonants. This set consisted of four new letters, in addition to fifteen letters from the existing English alphabet: b, d, f, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, z. New letters were proposed to replace the English digraphs ng, sh, voiced th, and voiceless th. New consonant digraphs based on these new letters were used to represent the affricate sounds of ch in cherry and j in January.\n\nThe most influential of Franklin's six new characters appears to have been the letter eng, , for \"ng\". It was later incorporated into the IPA. Alexander Gill the Elder had used this letter in 1619.\n\n"}

On May 13, 2012, \"The Guardian\", BBC News and other sources reported that Change.org would launch a UK-specific platform for petitions, placing Change.org in competition with 38 Degrees, a British not-for-profit political-activism organization.\n\nAn August 2013 \"Fast Company's\" article reported that Change.org would soon begin featuring petition recipients, saying, \"For the first time, companies will be able to post a public response to any given petition (currently, they can only respond to the person who started the campaign). They will also be able to create their own Decision Maker page, which will show all petitions against them, the number of signatures gathered, and their statuses.\" In summer 2017, a petition on change.org called for /r/incels (incel named after an abbreviation for \"involuntary celibate\") to be banned for inciting violence against women.\n\nOn November 12th, 2018, a petition entitled “Contra o aumento de salário aos ministros do STF” exceed the record of signatures with 2,6 million. Much more than \"Aprovem o Pedido de Impeachment da Presidente Dilma\" with 2,23 million.\n\nOn March 8, 2012, a petition entitled \"Prosecute the killer of our son, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin\" was posted on Change.org. The petition received over 2.2 million signatures – at that time the largest number of signatures for any campaign in Change.org's history. The petition called for the prosecution of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, who, on February 26, 2012, shot and killed Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, a suburb of Orlando. Zimmerman said he was acting in self-defense, and was set free without being charged. On April 11, 2012, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He stood trial in the months of June and July and was acquitted of all charges on July 13, 2013.\n\nOn October 1, 2011, Molly Katchpole, a \"22 year old nanny with two jobs\" in Washington D.C., started a petition on Change.org \"asking Bank of America and their CEO Bryan Moynihan to drop its unexpected new $5/month banking fee\" for debit card customers. Less than one month later, 300,000 signatures were collected. The petition was widely cited as a contributing cause for the bank formally announcing to drop the new banking fee. U.S. President Barack Obama signed the petition; U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois, responded to Bank of America and the petition on Twitter. It may have contributed to the U.S. Congress deciding to \"look at legislation for out-of-control banking fees\".\n\nIn December 2011, a fourth-grade class in Brookline, Massachusetts, launched the \"Lorax Petition Project\" through Change.org requesting Universal Studios to include more of an environmental message on its website and trailer for its upcoming film, \"The Lorax\", a classic Dr. Seuss children's story. The website and trailer lacked the important message from the book, \"to help the environment\". The petition collected over 57,000 signatures, and on January 26, 2012, the studio updated the website \"with the environmental message the kids had requested\".\n\nOn the morning of February 2, 2012, Stef Gray, a 23-year-old graduate in New York, held a news conference at the Washington offices of Sallie Mae where she presented the results of her Change.org, Sallie Mae, the \"nation's largest private student-loan provider\" petition, which had received about 77,000 signers. That afternoon the company changed its forbearance fee policy.\n\nIn November 2013, someone calling himself \"John Doe\" of Arlington, Texas launched a petition against changes made to the YouTube commenting system by Google. The changes force YouTube users to create an account on Google+ and also removes the \"reply\" mechanism on comments unless they were posted on Google+. This petition received over 100,000 signatures in less than a week, and over 200,000 within two weeks. The petition garnered more than 241,000 signatures, but failed to change Google's stance on the matter. However, the changes to YouTube did not have the intended effect – namely, increasing spam instead of curbing it – and in mid-2015, the commenting system was altered to allow users to post comments without signing into Google+.\n\nIn November 2013, Aaron Thompson from Tuscaloosa, Alabama started a petition, directed at Seth MacFarlane to bring back Brian Griffin on the TV series \"Family Guy\", after he was briefly killed off in the Season 12 episode \"Life Of Brian\". Thompson's petition gained 30,000 signatures within 36 hours. The character was brought back to the show a few episodes later.\n\nIn September 2014, Karol Wilcox of Hayti, Missouri started a petition against the planned execution of Beau, a two-and-a-half-year-old dog in Dyersburg, Tennessee, for allegedly killing a duck on his owner's property. By November, this petition had gained over 540,000 signatures. The petition worked and the dog was spared.\n\nAfter the 2016 United States presidential election, in which Donald Trump was declared President-elect of the United States, there were mass protests. As part of these protests, one California man started a change.org petition on November 10, 2016, which called for electors in states that Trump won to become faithless electors and cast their vote for Hillary Clinton instead at state Electoral College meetings. The petition acquired over 4 million signatures by November 14, 2016, only 4 days after it started. By November 23, 2016, it had gotten 4.5 million signatures. The petition ultimately failed as, on December 19, 2016, Trump officially gained the presidency with 304 electors. The petition closed with 4.9 million signatures, the highest in change.org history to date.\n\nOn November 3, 2017, following sexual assault claims made against actor Kevin Spacey, Netflix fired the actor from, and stalled the production of, the sixth and final season of the television series in which Spacey had starred in on the network, \"House of Cards\". Following Spacey's dismissal, a petition created on November 2, 2017, calling for Spacey to be replaced by actor Kevin James as a post-plastic surgery Frank Underwood began gaining a rapid number of supporters; this petition has gained media notability since its inception, gaining 50,000 supporters within eight days.\n\nIn wake of the Logan Paul suicide video controversy, user \"... - .- -.-- .- .-.. .. ...- .\" (\"stayalive\" in Morse code) created a petition entitled “Delete Logan Paul’s YouTube Channel\", having received more than 520,000 signatures as of 15 January 2018. While numerous other petitions have been created for the same purpose, none have received as much attention.\n\nOn 10 March 2015, the political blogger Guido Fawkes, whose real name is Paul Staines, started a petition to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson, BBC co-host of TV series \"Top Gear\". This followed the BBC's decision to suspend him over a \"fracas\" involving a producer on the show. The petition gained over 500,000 signatures within 24 hours, making it the fastest growing petition to date for the site, while having the servers at Change.org in the UK regularly become unresponsive due to the high demand. It had gained over 1,000,000 signatures by 20 March 2015 and it was delivered to the BBC.\n\nIn August 2014, Erica Perry from Vancouver, BC, started a petition asking Centerplate, a large food and beverage corporation serving entertainment venues in North America and the UK, to fire its then-CEO Desmond \"Des\" Hague after the public release of security camera footage allegedly showing Hague abusing a young Doberman Pinscher in an elevator. In response to Centerplate not taking action after the incident other than releasing a statement of apology from Hague, and an agreement by Hague to commit to perform certain charitable acts, the petition called for Centerplate to fire Hague. On September 2, 2014, after the petition had received over 190,000 signatures, Hague resigned from his position as CEO of Centerplate.\n\nIn February 2016, 50 petitions have exceeded 100,000 signatories. A petition against the \"Loi El Khomri\", a labor law project by the French Labor Minister Myriam El Khomri has over 1 million signatures, a record for change.org in France.\n\nIn 2012, Philip Matesanz, a 21-year-old German university student, started a petition to allow third-party recording tools for YouTube. The petition garnered more than 4.3 million signatures. This was the largest number of signatures in the history of Change.org until the record was beaten in November 2016.\n\nIn February 2013, over one million people, around two percent of the total population of Spain, had signed the petition calling for the entire Spanish government to resign. The call was motivated by an unprecedented corruption scandal involving the majority of key leaders of the People's Party.\n\nThe petition to have death row convict Mary Jane Veloso released was the fastest ever growing petition from the Philippines with over 250,000 signatories from over 125 countries.\n\nThe petition of \"Affordable internet for all\" was started by an Indian blogger, YouTuber Amit Bhavani. To raise the voice against increasing prices of internet. The petition reached 75,000+ sign ups within 48 hours.\n\nThe petition of \"Justice for Asifa: 8yr old girl raped and murdered in Kathua, J&K \" got 2 million supporters with over 1.5 million signatures.\n\nThe petition of Kumar Ajitabh's kidnapping case has got 7K supporters (#FindAjitabh)\n\nThe petition of banning, TV show, Pehredaar Piya Ki received support in the form of 1 lakh people due to promoting child marriage.\n\nThe petition against \"Australian Citizenship Eligibility Changes April 2017\" is ongoing with over 75,000 signatures.\n\nIn 2018 an anonymous creator of a Facebook community built on hatred for people riding bikes started a change.org anti-cycling petition that has grown in a short time to reach over 100,000 signatures. Allegedly, there is evidence many of the names on the petition are fake. Change.org advised they were not able to provide any information to substantiate any such claims of fake names being used.\n\nAfter Snapchat released their new update in February 2018, Nic Rumsey from Australia created a petition to remove this update after a huge number of people provided feedback to the effect that they were not enjoying the update. The petition has over 1,100,000 signatures as of February 16, 2018.\n\nA petition commenced in October 2018, gaining over 300,000 signatures, to prevent a proposal to use the Sydney Opera House as a promotional billboard. Racing NSW proposed using the sails of the Sydney Opera House to promote the Everest horse race at Sydney's Royal Randwick on 13 October 2018.\n\nAfter two earthquakes hit Central Mexico on September 7th and September 19th, 2017, there were different petitions to force the \"Instituto Nacional Electoral\" (\"National Electoral Institute\"), the Mexican Senate, and President Enrique Peña Nieto to donate most or all of the money destined for the upcoming 2018 general elections be redirected to victims of the natural disaster in Mexico City and neighbor states of Morelos, Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Puebla. All petitions together sum the number of more than 3 million signatures. The petition of Alfredo Aguirre from Monterrey,Mèxico reached 1,000,000+ sign ups within 24 hours. It was a new world record of Changeorg's history.\n\nChange.org makes revenue through a subscription membership model, people promoting petitions on the site, and crowdfunding.\n\nChange.org members contribute monthly to sustain the technology and the small teams of campaigners who coach and support petition starters. The majority of the company's revenue is advertising - individuals and organisations who start or sign petitions then chip in to promote those petitions to other site visitors.\n\nTo date, Change.org has raised $50 million to fuel its growth from mission-aligned investors in business, technology and the media. In 2017 an investment round driven by Reid Hoffman helped drive the shift to the current business model.\n\nThe website previously made revenue by running advertisements called sponsored campaigns for advocacy organizations such as Amnesty International \nand list-building services to partner organizations.\nIn May 2013 the website started \"crowd-promoted petitions\" that allowed a signatory to promote the petition by paying $5 to $1000 at the final stage of petition signing.\n\nMassive Australian based anti-cycling petition is full of false names, claims Bicycle Queensland CEO. Anne Savage said the body had received information that many of the names were created by electronic “bots”. “We have evidence that the majority of names on that petition are false names,” she said.\n\nUnder certain conditions, signatures and other private information including email addresses can be found by search engines. Change.org operates a system for signature hiding, which works only if the user has an account on Change.org. Conversely, the platform has been criticized for not providing enough information on who has signed a petition; for instance a means of verifying that a petition protesting a politician has been signed by his or her constituents or that the signatures are genuine at all.\n\nThere has been debate and criticism around the fact that Change.org is a for-profit business despite using the .org domain suffix rather than the commercial .com. The site has been accused of fooling its users and hiding the fact that it is \"a for-profit entity that has an economic incentive to get people to sign petitions\".\n\nChange.org spokesperson Charlotte Hill countered this criticism in a September 2013 article in \"Wired\", saying, \"We are a mission-driven social enterprise, and while we bring in revenue, we reinvest 100% of that revenue back into our mission of empowering ordinary people. It's not just that we're not yet making a profit – it's that we are decidedly not for-profit.\" \n\nIn 2012, the site dropped most of the restrictions it previously placed on paid content. Internal documents began referring to \"clients\" and \"partners\" as \"advertisers\" and stated that \"only advertisers strictly identified as 'hate groups' are to be barred.\" As a result, Change.org was accused of encouraging astroturfing and abandoning the progressive user base from which it initially gained traction. Additional controversy arose when the employee who initially leaked the documents was fired. Of the users who lost interest in the site after this change, a number of them expressed difficulty in being removed from Change.org mailing lists.\n\nChange.org has also been accused of selling the personal data provided by the users to third-party companies that hire its services, gaining money at the expense of the users.\n\nTopics for Change.org petitions have grown to include disagreement with the Academy Awards and removing milk from certain types of coffee. The authors of these petitions have been criticized for focusing on first world problems. Further debate over the content of petitions came in November 2014 when Martin Daubney called some of them \"bizarre\" and stated that the site was being used to promote censorship. In response, the Change.org communication director John Coventry defended the wide range of petitions, saying that \"people make an informed choice in what they want to support.\" The following week saw criticism alleging that petitions about the media receive more attention than petitions about \"saving 'actual' lives.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "35891118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35891118", "title": "Corruption in Italy", "text": "Corruption in Italy\n\nCorruption in Italy is a major problem. In Transparency International's annual surveys, Italy has consistently been regarded as one of the most corrupt countries in the Eurozone. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 54th place out of 180 countries. Corruption costs Italy a reported €60 billion a year, which amount to four percent of its GDP. On the 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index, Italy took 61st place out of 174 countries, scoring on a par with Senegal, Montenegro, and South Africa. Political corruption remains a major problem particularly in Southern Italy including Calabria, parts of Campania and Sicily where corruption perception is at a high level. Political parties are ranked the most corrupt institution in Italy, closely followed by public officials and Parliament, according to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013.\n\nRegarding business and corruption, foreign investments and economic growth are hindered by organized crime and corruption. Business executives from World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report 2013–2014 consider corruption one of the problems for doing business in Italy. Procurement process, mainly in water, roads and railway projects, in Italy is affected by corruption.\n\nAccording to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, 89% of surveyed households consider political parties to be corrupt or extremely corrupt—ranking as the most corrupt institution in Italy. Furthermore, 64% of the surveyed households believe that the level of corruption has increased and 61% of surveyed households find government efforts in the fight against corruption to be ineffective\n\nItalian culture has been described as being characterized by “an ambiguous attitude to graft.” A 2015 \"Al Jazeera\" report noted that clientelism and graft have long been cornerstones of the country's political establishment, and a \"Forbes\" contributor wrote in 2016 about “the deep-seated nature of unsavoury elements in both private and public sectors” in Italy. “Many Italians,” maintained a 2010 report, have accepted corruption and poor governance as part of their lives. However, a 2015 report challenged this generally accepted view, arguing that “corruption in Italy does not seem to be a cultural issue” and that Italians consistently believe corrupt practices are less acceptable than other European nations.\n\nThe Mafia plays a key role in both public and private corruption. Arising “out of business deals,” as \"Forbes\" put it, the Mafia historically “acted as a guarantor for contracts, when the judiciary was viewed as weak. Until relatively recent history, almost every deal in the country was enforced by a ‘man of honor.’”\n\nOne source has described the web of corruption involving politics, business, and the Mafia as “an unholy triangle,” adding that it could alternatively be seen as a rectangle, with the Roman Catholic Church being a fourth major participant in the web of corruption, owing to links between the Mafia and Vatican Bank and to “complex money laundering systems” involving banks that manage church funds.\n\nAfter a 1968 earthquake in Sicily, most of the funds appropriated to replace housing went to “needless construction projects,” a fact that underscored the scale of Italian corruption and the influence of the Mafia. Similarly, the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, in which over 300 people died, was described as a “stark reminder to Italians of the risks they take by tolerating a corrupt political system.” Franco Barberi, head of an Italian committee assessing earthquake risks, alleged that anywhere where corruption had not undermined safety measures, a similar earthquake would have resulted in no fatalities.\n\nA 1992–94 corruption scandal called Tangentopoli (Bribe City), uncovered by the so-called Mani pulite (Clean Hands) investigation, “rocked Italy to its core” and brought down the First Republic. But the probes “fizzled out” and afterwards the bribery just got worse.\n\nThe political impact of Mani Pulite remains the worst scandal of all modern Italy. The public outrage over the corruption led to “the sudden extinction\" of five different political factions that had controlled Italy's government since 1946. A new political establishment took their place, but corruption resumed.\n\nOne target of the 1992 through 1994 corruption probes was Gianstefano Frigerio, then a Christian Democrat MP. During 1992–94, he was the defendant in four trials; one case fell afoul of the statute of limitations, but in the remaining three cases he was found guilty. He managed to have his six-year prison sentence reduced, then turned into a community service sentence, wherein his public service in the Parliament had been deemed acceptable community service. He was then re-elected to parliament in 2001, and arrested again in 2014 for participation in the massive corruption scheme surrounding the Expo in Milan.\n\nIt is widely believed that two judges, Paolo Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone, were murdered in 1992 because of their efforts to punish corrupt ties between Mafia and politicians.\n\nIn 2012, 65% of Italians told Transparency International (TI) that they thought corruption had intensified during the previous three years. In April 2016, Italian Supreme Court judge Piercamillo Davigo, who had prosecuted widespread political corruption in the 1990s, also expressed the view that corruption had grown worse since then. “The politicians haven’t stopped stealing, they’ve stopped being ashamed of it,” he said. “Now they blatantly claim a right to do what they used to do secretly.”\n\nNicola Gratteri, an anti-mafia prosecutor, shared Davigo's view that the level of political corruption had heightened. Gratteri noted that twenty years prior, it was common practice for mob bosses to ask politicians for favors, but in recent years the politicians have sought the aid of mob bosses in return for public contracts.\n\nA 2013 report in \"The Guardian\" identified “Organised crime and corruption” as one of six problems currently facing Italy. The Mafia, once confined largely to the south, now operated nationwide, and had spread beyond drug trafficking and prostitution to transport, public health, and other industries.'\n\nSince 2000, Italy has experienced perceived corruption levels on par with Post-Soviet, Eastern European transition nations.\n\nItalian public officials routinely have close ties to organized crime and to businesses. Italian citizens consider political parties and parliament itself to be the nation's two most corrupt institutions.\n\nCorruption is common in Italy's public services sector. Doing business in Italy is complicated by inefficient government bureaucracies and burdensome rules, and almost half of Italians believe that the issuance of business permits involves bribes and abuse of power. Because of corruption, it takes almost six years to complete a major public-works project in Italy, and such projects cost four times as much as elsewhere in Europe.\n\nIn 2002, Berlusconi’s government “virtually abolished the crime of false accounting,” a move that caused a growth in corruption and Mafia crime.\n\nAs of 2012, Filippo Penati, a PD politician, was being investigated for corruption, specifically bribery. So was PdL party member Marco Milanese, whose fellow party members in parliament managed to prevent his arrest.\n\nIndustry Minister Federica Guidi resigned in March 2016 when evidence emerged that she sought to help her boyfriend's business by helping to pass a certain budget amendment. Her boyfriend, Gianluca Gemelli, faced charges of corruption and influence peddling in the so-called Basilicata case.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi, billionaire, media mogul, and prime minister of Italy for three periods (1994-5, 2001–6, and 2008–11), was frequently accused of corruption. His firms have been charged with such crimes as bribery and false invoicing, and Berlusconi himself has widely been rumored to have Mafia ties. In 2011, the U.S. State Department named Berlusconi as participating in the “commercial sexual exploitation of a Moroccan child.” Convicted of tax fraud in 2012, he was removed from the Italian Senate after the Supreme Court confirmed the verdict the next year, but not imprisoned. In June 2013 he was found guilty of paying a teenage girl for sex, and of abusing his political power, but the verdict was overturned in 2014.\n\nThe government procurement system is characterized by a high level of corruption. This is particularly true where infrastructure contracts are concerned. In such cases, the Mafia is very likely to be involved and favoritism will almost inevitably play a part in the awarding of contracts. In recent years, most of the high-profile corruption cases in Italy have involved government procurement. In 2015, one in three public contracts involved irregularities.\n\nContracts for Expo 2015, a fair in Milan, became the subject of a major anti-corruption investigation in which seven officials were arrested as of April 2015. Venice's mayor and over 30 other public officials were arrested in 2015 for accepting bribes in exchange for building contracts. In the same year, several businessmen were taken into custody on charges of belonging to “a gang involved in kickbacks and dodgy contracts” for high-speed rail lines, Expo 2015, a flood barrier in Venice, and other large-scale projects. Among those who had received kickbacks was Infrastructure and Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi, who was forced to resign.\n\nThe Italian courts are slow and inefficient. Almost half of citizens surveyed view the system as corrupt, and many think that bribes and abuse of power are common.\n\nExperts view the Italian police as being relatively free of corruption and respectful of the law. About a third of Italians, however, consider the police to be corrupt.\n\nThere is a degree of corruption in Italian land administration. Over half of citizens think that officials issuing building permits commit bribery and abuse of power.\n\nThe tax system lacks transparency and involves considerable bribery. Most firms view the tax rates as problematic.\n\nThere is a degree of corruption in the customs system.\n\nThe Bancopoli scandal of 2005–6 involved stock manipulation and insider trading. Antonio Fazio, head of Italy's central bank, gave unfair advantage to Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI) in its struggle against the Dutch bank ABN AMRO for control of Banca Antonveneta. Fazio and other figures in the banking community were ultimately forced to resign, while the managing director of BPI was arrested and the bank's entire board of directors came under investigation.\n\nIn 2006, police investigators revealed that the managers of major Italian soccer teams had been colluding with friendly referees to rig games.\n\nBeginning in December 2014, ties between Roman politicians and the Mafia were made public by the municipal judiciary, which provided evidence of the widespread siphoning of public funds from projects involving “the managing of green areas, recycling, social housing and refugee reception centers.” Leading officials were shown to have received bribes in exchange for government contracts; former mayor Gianni Alemanno was among those investigated.\n\nIn what has come to be called the Mafia Capitale investigation, officials were accused of rigging contracts for the management of migrant centers in Rome. The scheme involved stealing millions of euros from the civic coffers. The city has continued to suffer because of this crime. In mid 2015, several leading government and business figures were arrested in connection with the scandal.\n\nA June 2016 report in \"The Guardian\" noted that Rome mayoral candidate Virginia Raggi of the Five Star Movement (M5S) was doing well in polls because of her focus on “the corruption and cronyism of Italy’s mainstream parties.” In Rome, noted the newspaper, “establishment politicians and officials” were currently “on trial alongside alleged mobsters, charged with conspiring to pocket millions of euros from rigged public contracts.” Raggi has accused the political elite of creating “a pit of waste” and of “robb[ing] Rome” with their corruption.\n\n“The level of corruption we are witnessing in Rome,” wrote one observer in 2015, “suggests that Italy needs a major change in mentality, a cultural revolution.”\n\nIn 2001, British author and physician Theodore Dalrymple argued that corruption is actually the “one saving grace” of Italian public administration. Dalrymple explained his view that Italy's government was overburdened with an inefficient bureaucracy that slows down any progress but that corruption and bribery to bypass roadblocks allows for some progress to be made.\n\nDalrymple further maintained that the open display of corruption on the part of government officials causes Italian citizens to view the government as the 'enemy', an attitude that Dalrymple considered sensible and healthy, as compared with the misguided British belief that the state is purely good. This belief, Dalrymple charged, “has completely eroded the proud and sturdy independence of the British population.”\n\nIn a May 2015 article for Open Democracy, Andrea Capussela and Vito Intini noted that Italy's anti-corruption efforts are inadequate and are not pursued with any enthusiasm. Since 1994, they explained, Italy has seen a series of laws passed that weakened the government's ability to combat corruption. For example, the statute of limitations was cut in half, procedural rules were made more complicated, and some corruption-related acts were decriminalized. A new anti-corruption law passed in 2012 did not reverse these laws, and is widely considered weak. Capussela and Intini asked explicitly: “why were such laws adopted and never reversed and how could the political élite get away with it?” This state of affairs was especially puzzling, they pointed out, since the struggle against corruption had often been high on the agenda of any rising politician for two decades.\n\nThe Italian Anti-Corruption Law of 2012 expanded the definition of corruption and enhanced transparency and disclosure requirements for public-sector workers. It also introduced “white lists” of suppliers, service providers, and construction firms that comply with anti-Mafia laws. In addition, it established the National Anti-Corruption Authority, which has the power to investigate corruption cases, and the National Anti-Corruption Plan. The law banned persons convicted of corruption from running for public office, increased prison sentences for officials convicted of abuse of office or demanding bribes, increased penalties for private-sector corruption, and called for the institution of local anti-corruption plans and for greater transparency in hiring and budgets. The law criminalized influence-trading in both the public and private sectors, protected whistleblowers, and prohibited corrupt officials from holding certain administrative positions. But proper enforcement of the law continues to be complicated by a slow, overburdened judiciary.\n\nThere are effective means of investigating police abuse and corruption, but the process is hampered by slow courts. The Code of Conduct of Public Officials includes detailed prescriptions involving transparency, conflicts of interest, and gifts. There are also Rules on Protocol Gifts that forbid gifts to public officials, who are required to report their assets.\n\nItaly is a signatory to the Council of Europe’s Civil and Criminal Law Conventions against Corruption , the UNCAC, and the OECD's Anti-Bribery Convention.\n\nMario Monti, prime minister from 2011 to 2013, sponsored a 2012 anti-corruption law that was described by TI as an insufficient “first step.” In 2012, 64% of Italians described government anti-corruption efforts as ineffective. Only 19 percent think such efforts are effective.\n\nThe Italian National Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC) is an independent regulatory body set up in 2009. It is empowered to inspect offices and confiscate documents. In 2016, the ANAC and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) announced a partnership to fight corruption throughout the EU.\n\n\n"}

These groups, identified in terms of their relationship to structure, are united by kinship, community, religion or other affinities. The functional purposes of this economy of affection involves survival, social maintenance, and development.\n\nThe kind of personal relationships and dependencies which form the basis for a subsistence economy in East Africa have been superseded by commercial or government services in the developed world. But in such sub-Saharan African villages, as studied by Hyden, their economies have not yet been 'captured' by capitalism and their peasantry remains unproletarianised. The key issue here for Hyden is that the \"social values\" of the market are still underdeveloped. The East African peasantry still is able to 'choose' to operate at least partially in the traditional morality-based economy and the true market system. This then explains why a rational response to market incentives might strengthen his position in the economy of affection.\n\nTony Waters believes that Hyden's model of the uncaptured peasantry can be used to describe other peasant situations such as North America's European frontier in the early 19th century, and Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries. The concept was popularised at China Agricultural University by Evans Tekuro Muki, Deborah Nakirijja, Victoria Harding, Tymon Mphaka and Lesego Khunuou\n"}
{"id": "25506930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25506930", "title": "Empire of Liberty", "text": "Empire of Liberty\n\nThe Empire of Liberty is a theme developed first by Thomas Jefferson to identify the responsibility of the United States to spread freedom across the world. Jefferson saw the mission of the U.S. in terms of setting an example, expansion into western North America, and by intervention abroad. Major exponents of the theme have been Abraham Lincoln (in the Gettysburg Address), Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson (and \"Wilsonianism\"), Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.\n\nIn the history of U.S. foreign policy, the Empire of Liberty has provided motivation to fight the Spanish–American War (1898), World War I (1917), the later part of World War II (1941), the Cold War (1947–91) and the War on Terror (2001–present).\n\nJefferson used this phrase \"Empire of Liberty\" in 1780, while the American revolution was still being fought. His goal was an empire dedicated to liberty that could stop the growth of the British Empire, which he hated and feared: \n\nJefferson envisaged this \"Empire\" extending Westwards over the American continent, expansion into which he saw as crucial to the American future. During his Presidency, this was in part achieved by his 1803 purchase of the Louisiana Territory from the French, almost doubling the area of the Republic and removing the main barrier to Westward expansion, stating that \"I confess I look to this duplication of area for the extending of a government so free and economical as ours, as a great achievement to the mass of happiness which is to ensue\".\n\nHowever, this was not necessarily a politically unified Empire. \"Whether we remain in one confederacy, or form Atlantic and Mississippi confederacies, I believe not very important to the happiness of either part.\" Despite this, Jefferson on other occasions seemed to stress the territorial inviolability of the Union.\n\nIn 1809 Jefferson wrote his successor James Madison:\n\nEven in his later years, Jefferson saw no limit to the expansion of this Empire, writing \"where this progress will stop no-one can say. Barbarism has, in the meantime, been receding before the steady step of amelioration; and will in time, I trust, disappear from the earth\".\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine, a U.S. foreign policy initiative introduced in 1823, states that efforts by European countries to colonize or interfere with states in the Americas will be viewed as acts of aggression requiring U.S. intervention. Its justification was to make the New World safe for liberty and American-style republicanism, as well as prevent the further growth of European empires in the New World. The Monroe Doctrine was invoked against the takeover of Mexico by France (1860s) and Imperial Germany (see Zimmermann Telegram) in 1917. After 1960 the Monroe Doctrine was invoked to roll back Communism from its new base in Castro's Cuba. Ronald Reagan emphasized the need to roll back Communism in Nicaragua and Grenada.\n\nAmerican Protestant and Catholic religious activists began missionary work in \"pagan\" areas from the 1820s, and expanded operations worldwide in the late 19th century.\n\nEuropean nations (especially Britain, France and Germany) also had missionary programs. The Europeans focused mostly on their own empires. Americans went anywhere it was possible, and had no government funding. The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) and Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) were among the many groups involved in missionary work. Others included the student volunteer movement and the King's Daughters. Among Catholics, the three Maryknoll organizations were especially active in China, Africa, and Latin America.\n\nReligious reform organizations joined in attempts to spread modernity and worked to fight the corrupting effects of ignorance, disease, opium and alcohol. For example, the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WWCTU), a spinoff of the WCTU, had both strong religious convictions and a commitment to international efforts to shut down the liquor trade. By the 1930s the more evangelical Protestant groups redoubled their efforts, but the more liberal Protestants had second thoughts about their advocacy, especially after the failure of prohibition at home cast doubt on how easy it might be to reform the world.\n\nEconomic dimensions of the Empire of Liberty involved dissemination of American management methods (such as Taylorization, Fordism, and the assembly line), technology, and popular culture such as film.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Congress passed the Neutrality Acts, which attempted to avoid entering in conflicts with other nations. The United States became involved in World War II two years after its start.\n\nWriters on the Left often capitalized on anti-imperialism by using the label \"American Empire\" in a negative sense. Noam Chomsky and Chalmers Johnson are prominent spokesmen for this position. Their argument is that an America empire represents an evil, and indeed the very thing that the \"Empire of Liberty\" was conceived to counter, imperialism. They recommend dismantling the empire. Puerto Rican poet and novelist Giannina Braschi proclaims the collapse of the World Trade Center as the end of the American Empire and its colonial hold on Puerto Rico in her post 9-11 work \"United States of Banana\" (2011).\n\n\n"}

Following the subsequent September legislative election, Tsipras was re-appointed as Prime Minister on 21 September and appointed a second cabinet that was sworn in on 23 September.\n\nThe cabinet is composed of 35 members, alongside 6 deputy ministers. Including the deputy ministers the cabinet comprises 6 females and 35 males. It reflects the majority coalition in Parliament. It is composed of the winning Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) with the support of the right-wing anti-austerity party, Independent Greeks (ANEL).

Great Timor () refers to the irredentist concept of a united and independent island of Timor, covering formerly Portuguese East Timor and formerly Dutch (now Indonesian) West Timor.\n\nHistorically, the idea of uniting Timor Island had been expressed by several Timorese groups. The earliest reference point is the pre-colonial Empire of Wehali, whose center was in today's West Timor, but the ruling group was the Tetun speaking Belunese associated with the inhabitants of the Eastern Timor.\n\nDuring the Japanese Occupation of the Island (1942–45), there were some Japanese and Timorese efforts to unite West and East Timor through match-making between the traditional authorities of Dutch and Portuguese Timor. Especially, (a Japanese intelligence agent, later poet, who served in Viqueque and Atambua) was instrumental in a matchmaking between the family of Don. Joaquim da Costa of Ossu and the Nai-Buti clan in Atambua.\n\nDuring 1974–75, APODETI, an East Timorese party expressed its will to integrate East Timor and West Timor through an integration into the Republic of Indonesia. This idea was reflected in the original Portuguese version of so-called Balibo Declaration in which the signatories lamented the separation with the \"Indonesian people of Timor\" through demarcation of the colonial borders.\n\nEast Timor was invaded and occupied by Indonesia in 1975, which annexed the territory as its \"27th Province\" in 1976, but in a referendum held in 1999, the people of East Timor voted to end Indonesian occupation and become an independent state. This caused widespread anger among many Indonesian nationalists, particularly in the military.\n\nIn 2001 and 2002, before East Timor's independence, there were claims by the Indonesian military and some commentators, that this would inspire the secession of West Timor from Indonesia.\n\nFRETILIN's independence movement never laid claim to West Timor at any time, before the Indonesian invasion or thereafter. After the Recovery of Independence in 2001, the government of East Timor fully recognises Indonesia's existing boundaries as inherited from the Netherlands East Indies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1055072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1055072", "title": "Guernica (Picasso)", "text": "Guernica (Picasso)\n\nGuernica () is a large oil painting on canvas by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso completed in June 1937, at his home on Rue des Grands Augustins, in Paris. The painting, now in the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid, was done with a palette of gray, black, and white, and is regarded by many art critics as one of the most moving and powerful anti-war paintings in history. Standing at tall and wide, the painting shows the suffering of people and animals wrenched by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, and flames.\n\nThe painting was created in response to the bombing of Guernica, a Basque Country town in northern Spain, by Nazi Germany and Italian warplanes at the request of the Spanish Nationalists. Upon completion, \"Guernica\" was exhibited at the Spanish display at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (Paris International Exposition) in the 1937 World's Fair in Paris and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief. The painting became famous and widely acclaimed, and it helped bring worldwide attention to the Spanish Civil War.\n\nIn January 1937, the Spanish Republican government commissioned Picasso to create a large mural for the Spanish display at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris. At the time, Picasso was living in Paris, where he had been named Honorary Director-in-Exile of the Prado Museum. He had last visited Spain in 1934 and never returned. His initial sketches for the project, on which he worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April, depicted his perennial theme of the artist's studio. Immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, the poet Juan Larrea visited Picasso and urged him to make the bombing his subject. However, it was only on 1 May, having read George Steer's eyewitness account of the bombing (originally published in both \"The Times\" and \"The New York Times\" on 28 April), that he abandoned his initial project and started sketching a series of preliminary drawings for \"Guernica\".\n\nGuernica is a town in the province of Biscay in Basque Country. During the Spanish Civil War, it was regarded as the northern bastion of the Republican resistance movement and the center of Basque culture, adding to its significance as a target.\n\nThe Republican forces were made up of assorted factions (Communists, Socialists, Anarchists and others) with differing goals, but united in their opposition to the Nationalists. The Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco, sought a return to pre-Republican Spain, based on law, order, and traditional Catholic values.\n\nAt about 16:30 on Monday, 26 April 1937, warplanes of the German Condor Legion, commanded by Colonel Wolfram von Richthofen, bombed Guernica for about two hours. Germany, at this time led by Hitler, had lent material support to the Nationalists. Later, intense aerial bombardment became a crucial preliminary step in the Blitzkrieg tactic.\n\nIn his journal for 30 April 1937, von Richthofen wrote:\nOther accounts state that the town's inhabitants were in fact congregated in the center of town, as it was market day, and when the bombardment commenced, were unable to escape because the roads were full of debris and the bridges leading out of town had been destroyed.\n\nGuernica's location was at a major crossroads 10 kilometers from the front lines and between the front lines and Bilbao, the capital of Bizkaia (Biscay). Any Republican retreat towards Bilbao and any Nationalist advance towards Bilbao had to pass through Guernica. \"During 25 April, many of the demoralized (Republican) troops from Marquina fell back on Guernica, which lay 10 kilometers behind the lines.\" Wolfram von Richthofen's war diary entry for 26 April 1937 states, \"K/88 [the Condor Legion bomber force] was targeted at Guernica in order to halt and disrupt the Red withdrawal which has to pass through here.\" Under the German concept of tactical bombing, areas that were routes of transportation and troop movement were considered to be legitimate military targets, and tactical aircraft tended to operate just outside the range of friendly artillery; in the German mindset, Guernica was thus a major target in support of the Republican offensive. The following day, Richthofen wrote in his war diary, \"Guernica burning.\" The Republican retreat towards Bilbao did pass through Guernica, before and after the bombing, and, as Beevor points out, \"At Guernica the communist Rosa Luxemburg Battalion under Major Cristobal held back the nationalists for a time\".\n\nGuernica was a quiet village. The nearest military target of any consequence was a factory on the outskirts of the town, which manufactured various war products. The factory went through the attack unscathed. Thus, the motivation of the bombing was one of intimidation.\n\nBecause a majority of the town's men were away, engaged in fighting on behalf of the Republicans, the town at the time of the bombing was populated mostly by women and children. These demographics are reflected in the painting because, as Rudolf Arnheim writes, for Picasso: \"The women and children make \"Guernica\" the image of innocent, defenseless humanity victimized. Also, women and children have often been presented by Picasso as the very perfection of mankind. An assault on women and children is, in Picasso's view, directed at the core of mankind.\" Clearly, the Nationalists sought to demoralize the Republicans and the civilian population as a whole by demonstrating their military might on a town that stood for traditional Basque culture and innocent civilians.\n\nAfter the bombing, the work of the Basque and Republican sympathizer and \"The Times\" journalist George Steer propelled this event onto the international scene and brought it to Pablo Picasso's attention. Steer's eyewitness account was published on 28 April in both \"The Times\" and \"The New York Times\", and on the 29th appeared in \"L'Humanité\", a French Communist daily. Steer wrote:\n\nWhile Picasso was living in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War II, one German officer allegedly asked him, upon seeing a photo of \"Guernica\" in his apartment, \"Did you do that?\" Picasso responded, \"No, you did.\"\n\nThe photographer Dora Maar—who had worked with Picasso since mid-1936, photographing his studio and teaching him the technique of cameraless photography— documented the stages \"Guernica\" went through on its way to completion. Apart from their documentary and publicity value, Maar's photographs \"helped Picasso to eschew color and give the work the black-and-white immediacy of a photograph\", according to John Richardson. The work was painted using a matte house paint specially formulated at Picasso's request to have the least possible gloss, and the American artist John Ferren assisted him in stretching the monumental canvas. Previously, Picasso had rarely allowed strangers into his studio to watch him work, but he admitted influential visitors to his studio to observe the progress of the painting, believing that the publicity to be gained would help the antifascist cause.\n\nAs he worked on the mural, Picasso said: \"The Spanish struggle is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody think for a moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call \"Guernica\", and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death.\"\n\nAfter 35 days of work, he finished the painting on 4 June 1937.\n\nThe scene is within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a grieving woman who holds a dead child in her arms. The center of the painting is occupied by a horse falling in agony, as if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. There is a large gaping wound in the horse's side.\n\nUnder the horse is a dead, dismembered, soldier. The hand of his severed right arm still grasps a shattered sword, from which a flower grows. The palm of the soldier's open left hand contains a stigmata, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the stigmata of Christ. A bare light bulb blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head.\n\nTo the upper right of the horse, a frightened female figure, who seems to be witnessing the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. She carries a flame-lit lamp which is positioned close to the bare bulb.\n\nFrom the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming have replaced the tongues of the bull, the grieving woman, and the horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light can be seen.\n\nOn the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.\n\nTwo \"hidden\" images formed by the horse appear in \"Guernica\":\n\nInterpretations of \"Guernica\" vary widely and contradict one another. This extends, for example, to the mural's two dominant elements: the bull and the horse. Art historian Patricia Failing said, \"The bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture. Picasso himself certainly used these characters to play many different roles over time. This has made the task of interpreting the specific meaning of the bull and the horse very tough. Their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conceived in a variety of ways throughout Picasso's career.\"\n\nWhen pressed to explain the elements in \"Guernica\", Picasso said,\n\nIn \"The Dream and Lie of Franco\", a series of narrative sketches Picasso also created for the World's Fair, Franco is depicted as a monster that first devours his own horse and later does battle with an angry bull. Work on these illustrations began before the bombing of Guernica, and four additional panels were added, three of which relate directly to the Guernica mural.\n\nAccording to scholar Beverly Ray, the following list of interpretations reflects the general consensus of historians: \"The shape and posture of the bodies express protest\"; \"Picasso uses black, white, and grey paint to set a somber mood and express pain and chaos\"; \"flaming buildings and crumbling walls not only express the destruction of Guernica, but reflect the destructive power of civil war\"; \"the newspaper print used in the painting reflects how Picasso learned of the massacre\"; \"The light bulb in the painting represents the sun\"; and \"The broken sword near the bottom of the painting symbolizes the defeat of the people at the hand of their tormentors\".\n\nAlejandro Escalona said, \"The chaos unfolding seems to happen in closed quarters provoking an intense feeling of oppression. There is no way out of the nightmarish cityscape. The absence of color makes the violent scene developing right before your eyes even more horrifying. The blacks, whites, and grays startle you—especially because you are used to see war images broadcast live and in high-definition right to your living room.\"\n\nIn drawing attention to a number of preliminary studies, the so-called primary project, that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of \"Guernica\", Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as \"Las Meninas\" by Diego Velázquez. In his \"chef d'oeuvre\", Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, \"Guernica\" should be seen as Picasso's comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.\n\n\"Guernica\" was initially exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition. The Pavilion, which was financed by the Spanish Republican government at the time of civil war, was built to exhibit the Spanish government's struggle for existence contrary to the Exposition's technology theme. The Pavilion's entrance presented an enormous photographic mural of Republican soldiers accompanied by the slogan:\n\nThe display of \"Guernica\" was accompanied by a poem by Paul Éluard, and the pavilion displayed \"The Reaper\" by Joan Miró and \"Mercury Fountain\" by Alexander Calder, both of whom were sympathetic to the Republican cause.\n\nAt its unveiling at the Paris Exhibition it garnered little attention. The public's reaction to \"Guernica\" was mixed. Max Aub, one of the officials in charge of the Spanish pavilion, was compelled to defend the work against a group of Spanish officials who objected to the mural's modernist style and sought to replace it with a more traditional painting that was also commissioned for the exhibition, \"Madrid 1937 (Black Aeroplanes)\" by Horacio Ferrer de Morgado. Some Marxist groups criticized Picasso's painting as lacking in political commitment and faulted it for not offering a vision of a better future. In contrast, Morgado's painting was a great success with Spanish Communists and with the public. The art critic Clement Greenberg was also critical of \"Guernica\", but for different reasons. In a later essay, Greenberg termed \"Guernica\" \"jerky\" and \"too compressed for its size\", and compared it unfavorably to the \"magnificently lyrical\" \"The Charnel House\" (1944–48), a later antiwar painting by Picasso.\n\nAmong the painting's admirers were the art critic Jean Cassou and the poet José Bergamín, both of whom praised the painting as quintessentially Spanish. Michel Leiris perceived in the painting a foreshadowing: \"On a black and white canvas that depicts ancient tragedy ... Picasso also writes our letter of doom: all that we love is going to be lost...\"\n\n\"Guernica\", for which Picasso was paid 200,000 francs for his costs by the Spanish Republican government, was one of the few major paintings that were not sold directly from artist to his exclusive contracted art dealer and friend, Paul Rosenberg.\n\nHowever, after its exhibition Rosenberg organised a four-man extravaganza Scandinavian tour of 118 works by Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Henri Laurens. The main attraction was \"Guernica\", and from January to April 1938 the tour visited Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Göteborg. In September 1938 the painting travelled to England, exhibited in London's Whitechapel Art Gallery organized by Roland Penrose with Clement Attlee, where it arrived on 30 September 1938, the same day the Munich Agreement was signed by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. It then travelled onwards to Leeds, Liverpool and in early 1939 Manchester. There, Manchester Foodship For Spain, a group of artists and activists engaged in sending aid to the people of Spain, exhibited the painting in the HE Nunn & Co Ford automobile showroom for two weeks. It then returned briefly to France.\n\nAfter the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. The San Francisco Museum of Art (later SFMOMA) gave the work its first public, free appearance in the United States from 27 August to 19 September 1939. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City then mounted a Picasso exhibition on 15 November 1939 that remained on view until 7 January 1940, entitled: \"Picasso: 40 Years of His Art\", that was organized by Alfred H. Barr in collaboration with the Art Institute of Chicago. The exhibition contained 344 works, including \"Guernica\" and its studies.\n\nAt Picasso's request the safekeeping of the piece was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso's expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country. Between 1939 and 1952, the painting traveled extensively in the United States; between 1953 and 1956 it was shown in Brazil, at the first-ever Picasso retrospective in Milan, Italy, and then in numerous other major European cities, before returning to MoMA for a retrospective celebrating Picasso's 75th birthday. It then went on to Chicago and Philadelphia. By this time, concern for the state of the painting resulted in a decision to keep it in one place: a room on MoMA's third floor, where it was accompanied by several of Picasso's preliminary studies and some of Dora Maar's photographs of the work in progress. The studies and photos were often loaned for other exhibitions, but until 1981, \"Guernica\" itself remained at MoMA.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the room containing the painting became the site of occasional anti-war vigils. These were usually peaceful and uneventful, but on 28 February 1974, Tony Shafrazi—ostensibly protesting Second Lieutenant William Calley's petition for habeas corpus following his indictment and sentencing for the murder of 109 Vietnamese civilians during the My Lai massacre—defaced the painting with red spray paint, painting the words \"KILL LIES ALL\"; the paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.\n\nAs early as 1968, Franco had expressed an interest in having \"Guernica\" come to Spain. However, Picasso refused to allow this until the Spanish people again enjoyed a republic. He later added other conditions, such as the restoration of \"public liberties and democratic institutions\". Picasso died in 1973. Franco, ten years Picasso's junior, died two years later, in 1975. After Franco's death, Spain was transformed into a democratic constitutional monarchy, ratified by a new constitution in 1978. However, MoMA was reluctant to give up one of its greatest treasures and argued that a monarchy did not represent the republic that had been stipulated in Picasso's will as a condition for the painting's delivery. Under great pressure from a number of observers, MoMA finally ceded the painting to Spain in 1981. The Spanish historian Javier Tusell was one of the negotiators.\n\nUpon its arrival in Spain in September 1981, it was first displayed behind bomb-and bullet-proof glass screens at the Casón del Buen Retiro in Madrid in time to celebrate the centenary of Picasso's birth, 25 October. The exhibition was visited by almost a million people in the first year. Since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat to the painting.\n\nIn 1992, the painting was moved from the Museo del Prado to a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, both in Madrid, along with about two dozen preparatory works. This action was controversial in Spain, since Picasso's will stated that the painting should be displayed at the Prado. However, the move was part of a transfer of all of the Prado's collections of art after the early 19th century to other nearby buildings in the city for reasons of space; the Reina Sofía, which houses the capital's national collection of 20th-century art, was the natural place to move it to.\nAt the Reina Sofía, the painting has roughly the same protection as any other work.\n\nBasque nationalists have advocated that the picture should be brought to the Basque country, especially after the building of the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum. Officials at the Reina Sofía claim that the canvas is now thought to be too fragile to move. Even the staff of the Guggenheim do not see a permanent transfer of the painting as possible, although the Basque government continues to support the possibility of a temporary exhibition in Bilbao.\n\nA full-size tapestry copy of Picasso's \"Guernica\", by , is hung at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City at the entrance to the Security Council room. It was displayed first from 1985 to 2009, and returned in 2015. It was commissioned in 1955 by Nelson Rockefeller, since Picasso refused to sell him the original. The tapestry was placed on loan to the United Nations by the Rockefeller estate in 1985. The tapestry is less monochromatic than the original and uses several shades of brown.\n\nOn 5 February 2003 a large blue curtain was placed to cover this work at the UN, so that it would not be visible in the background when Colin Powell and John Negroponte gave press conferences at the United Nations. On the following day, it was claimed that the curtain was placed there at the request of television news crews, who had complained that the wild lines and screaming figures made for a bad backdrop, and that a horse's hindquarters appeared just above the faces of any speakers. Some diplomats, however, in talks with journalists claimed that the Bush Administration pressured UN officials to cover the tapestry, rather than have it in the background while Powell or other US diplomats argued for war on Iraq. In a critique of the covering, columnist Alejandro Escalona hypothesized that \"Guernica\"s \"unappealing ménage of mutilated bodies and distorted faces proved to be too strong for articulating to the world why the US was going to war in Iraq\", while referring to the work as \"an inconvenient masterpiece.\"\n\nOn 17 March 2009, Deputy Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Marie Okabe announced that the \"Guernica\" tapestry had been moved to a gallery in London in advance of extensive renovations at UN Headquarters. The \"Guernica\" tapestry was the showcase piece for the grand reopening of the Whitechapel Gallery. It was located in the 'Guernica room' which was originally part of the old Whitechapel Library. In 2012 the tapestry was on temporary loan to the San Antonio Museum of Art in San Antonio, Texas from the Rockefeller family.\nIt was returned to the UN by March 2015.\n\nDuring the 1970s, it was a symbol for Spaniards of both the end of the Franco regime and of Basque nationalism. The Basque left has repeatedly used imagery from the picture. An example is the organization Etxerat which uses a reversed image of the lamp as its symbol.\n\nWorks inspired by \"Guernica\" include Goshka Macuga's \"The Nature of the Beast\" (2009–2010), which used the Whitechapel-hosted United Nations Guernica tapestry; \"The Keiskamma Guernicas\" (2010–2017); and Erica Luckert's theatrical production of \"Guernica\" (2011–2012). Art and design historian Dr Nicola Ashmore curated an exhibition, \"Guernica Remakings\", at the University of Brighton galleries from 29 July 2017 to 23 August 2017.\n\n\"Guernica\" has become a universal and powerful symbol warning humanity against the suffering and devastation of war. Moreover, the fact that there are no obvious references to the specific attack has contributed to making its message universal and timeless.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was based in Manchester, England.In 2018 the office has been transferred from Manchester to Berlin.\n\nICBUW campaigns for a ban on the use, transport, manufacture, sale and export of all conventional weapon systems containing uranium (usually called depleted uranium weapons). It also seeks health monitoring and compensation for communities affected by the use of uranium weapons and the environmental remediation of such sites.\n\nIn advocating for a treaty ban on uranium weapons, ICBUW states that it is following the example of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and the Cluster Munition Coalition. ICBUW’s grassroots member organisations lobby at a national level, while ICBUW itself lobbies supranational bodies such as the European Parliament and the United Nations.\n\nICBUW has prepared a draft Convention for a ban on depleted uranium weapons. ICBUW's Draft Convention contains a general and comprehensive prohibition of the development, production, transport, storage, possession, transfer and use of uranium ammunition, uranium armour-plate and of any other military use of uranium. The Convention also outlines obligations concerning the abolition of uranium weapons and the destruction of uranium weapons construction facilities. In addition it obliges states to ensure a rapid decontamination of radioactive battlefields and test ranges, emphasising the protection of, and assistance to, civilians living in these areas and obliges states to compensate the victims.\n\nIn 2011, ICBUW released an animated short film developed in cooperation with Dutch non-governmental organization (NGO) 'IKV Pax Christi'. \"When the Dust Settles\" outlines ICBUW's position and calls for a precautionary approach to the weapons. In 2012, ICBUW and Dutch NGO IKV Pax Christi launched the Toxic Remnants of War Project which aims to consider and quantify the detrimental impact of war, military operations and munitions on the environment and human health, with particular focus on the release of toxic materials during military activities.\n\n\n"}

With a net worth of around $1.9 billion, he is the wealthiest person in West Virginia. He inherited a coal mining business from his father and successfully built a massive business empire with over 50 companies, including The Greenbrier, a luxury resort. Justice is one of the few billionaires from the State of West Virginia.\n\nIn 2015, Justice switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party and announced his candidacy for Governor in the 2016 election. He ran as a Democrat and defeated the Republican nominee, Bill Cole. Less than seven months after taking office, Justice switched back to the Republican Party the day after announcing his plans at a President Trump rally in the state.\n\nJames Conley Justice II was born in Charleston, the son of James Conley Justice and Edna Ruth (née Perry) Justice. Justice grew up in Raleigh County, West Virginia. He enrolled at the University of Tennessee on an athletic scholarship for golf, but transferred to Marshall University. At Marshall, he was a two-year captain on the Thundering Herd golf team. He earned his bachelor's degree and Master in Business Administration from Marshall.\n\nAfter college, Justice went into the family agriculture business. Justice founded Bluestone Farms in 1977, which now operates of farmland, and is the leading producer of grain on the East Coast of the United States. During that time, he also developed Stoney Brook Plantation, a 15,000-acre hunting and fishing preserve in Monroe County. Justice is a seven time national corn growing champion.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1993, Justice inherited ownership of Bluestone Industries and Bluestone Coal Corporation.\n\nIn 2009, he sold some of his coal business to the Russian company Mechel for $568 million. In 2015, after a huge drop in the price of coal which led Mechel to close some of the mines, he bought the business back for just $5 million. Since buying back the mine from Mechel, Justice re-opened several of the mines and hired over 200 coal miners.\n\nJustice's mining companies have a history of safety violation and unpaid taxes; in 2016, \"NPR\" called him the \"top mine safety delinquent\" in the United States.\n\nJustice owes millions of dollars to the government in back taxes, and unpaid coal mining fees and fines: \"His mining companies owe $15 million in six states, including property and minerals taxes, state coal severance and withholding taxes, and federal income, excise and unemployment taxes, as well as mine safety penalties, according to county, state and federal records.\"\n\nJustice serves as the owner or chief executive officer of over 50 companies, including The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, which he bought for $20.5 million in 2009, preventing its bankruptcy. When Justice first took control he immediately brought back all 650 laid-off employees. He added vacation and health benefits to their contracts and offered a 10 percent raise if the hotel regained its fifth star.\n\nJustice is in the process of building a new mountain top golf course with golfers Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Lee Trevino. Arnold Palmer was involved before his 2016 death.\n\nForbes estimates Justice's net worth at $1.6 billion, making him the richest man in West Virginia.\n\nAs of 2014, he owned 70 active mines in 5 states. His charitable activities have included $25 million for the James C. Justice National Scout Camp at The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve, $5 million for Marshall University, and $10 million to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nJustice gives away more than $1 million in Christmas gifts annually through the Dream Tree for Kids campaign.\n\nBefore taking office as governor, Justice resigned from all the executive positions he held at his business. He placed his daughter Jill in charge of The Greenbrier and his son Jay in charge of his mining and agriculture businesses. He has said he will place all his assets in a blind trust, but that the process will take time because of their complexity.\n\nIn 2015, Justice declared his candidacy for Governor of West Virginia in the 2016 election as a member of the Democratic Party. He had been a registered member of the Republican Party until changing his registration in February 2015. This was his first time running for political office. In May 2016, Justice won the Democratic nomination for governor and ran against Republican nominee Bill Cole in the general election. On November 8, Justice won the election.\n\nJustice was endorsed by the United Mine Workers.\n\nJustice took office as governor on January 16, 2017. He is known for using colorful metaphors and digs at political opponents.\n\nTo improve West Virginia's budget situation, he has proposed raising the state's revenue by $450 million, primarily by increasing the consumer sales tax, reinstituting the business and occupation (B & O) tax, and establishing a \"rich man's\" tax. He also opposed plans to cut health and education spending. On April 13, 2017, while vetoing a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled West Virginia Legislature, Justice said the bill was \"nothing more than a bunch of political you-know-what\" and showed a prop featuring bull feces on a print copy of the bill.\n\nOn August 3, 2017, Justice announced that he had rejoined the Republican Party. He made the announcement at a Donald Trump rally in Huntington and also confirmed his support for the sitting President. Justice said that he was returning to the GOP because he could not help Trump as a Democrat. The announcement came as a surprise to his own staff. This also made Justice the first Republican governor of West Virginia since Cecil Underwood in 2001.\n\nEven after switching to the Republican Party, Justice endorsed incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin for reelection in the 2018 Senate election in West Virginia.\n\nGovernor Jim Justice began his gubernatorial campaign and career as a conservative Democrat. \"Time\" magazine identified him as a moderate Democrat. However, as noted above, he switched to the Republican Party a few months after taking office and declared his support for President Donald Trump.\n\nJustice campaigned and has governed with support for the coal industry. He does not support raising taxes, but has supported increasing teachers' salaries arguing that increased state revenue will pay for the increased budget spending. In 2017, Justice said that he opposed budget cuts and supported raising sales taxes. The fiscally conservative CATO Institute, gave Justice an 'F' grade based on their positions, but Justice voiced his disagreement with the rating.\n\nOn abortion, Justice had said that he does not support abortion, but that the Supreme Court had decided the issue. Later, Justice attended an anti-abortion, or pro-life, rally supporting Amendment 1, a state constitutional amendment intended to ban abortion if \"Roe v. Wade\" is overturned. He is considered pro-life and signed two anti-abortion bills into law. Justice supports gun ownership and loosened gun laws. In 2016, Justice had a 0% rating from the National Rife Association (NRA). In 2018, however, Justice signed into a law a bill allowing gun owners to keep their guns locked in vehicles on their employers' property, and this was a bill supported by the NRA. He also signed a bill legalizing hunting on Sundays on private land. On healthcare, Justice does not support repealing the Medicaid expansion that resulted from the Affordable Care Act. Regarding LGBT issues and same-sex marriage, Justice has taken a nuanced position. He did not say whether he supports or opposes same-sex marriage, and, instead, stated that he respects the Supreme Court decision, \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. In 2016, Justice opposed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBT customers.\n\nAccording to the \"Charleston Gazette–Mail\", Justice has equivocated on the scientific consensus on global warming. In an interview with the paper, he said: \"There's documentation that would give one concern, and I don't think you should ignore that,\" he said. \"At the same time, I think there's an awful lot of research that still should be done. [...] I surely wouldn't sit here and say I am a believer in global warming, but I wouldn't sit here and say that I am not concerned.\"\n\nJustice lives in Lewisburg, West Virginia. He met his wife, Cathy (\"née\" Comer) in high school. They have two children, Jay and Jill. He stands at 6 feet and 7 inches.\n\nJustice is a lifelong fan of the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL), and spent $30 million to develop a training facility for the team to use in 2014 at The Greenbrier. He hosts the Greenbrier Classic, a PGA Tour event, at The Greenbrier annually.\n\nSince 1992 Justice has been President of Beckley Little League. His participation has helped the program expand to over 1,000 children playing on 80 teams.\n\nHaving lived in Lewisburg since 2001, he has been the girls basketball coach at Greenbrier East High School since 2003, having won the state championship in 2012. In 2011, he also became the head coach for the boys basketball teams, a position from which he stepped down in September 2017. He was the only coach at the AAA level (the state's largest classification) who coached both the girls and boys basketball teams. Justice stated that though he will place his business interests in a blind trust upon becoming governor, he will still coach basketball while serving. In discussing the coaching position, Justice said, \"There are three things I know that I can do, and that's shoot a shotgun, make a deal and coach basketball. I'm excited about it.\"\n\nHe has been director of the Mountain State Coal Classic since 1995. The basketball classic has enjoyed tremendous success awarding hundreds of thousands in scholarships and direct support to participating schools.\n\n\n"}

In this context a land agent was a relatively privileged position and was a senior member of the estate's staff.

Its work covers aspects such as landscape, soil and water conservation and climate change.\n\nThe Macaulay Institute for Soil Research was founded in 1930. A benefaction of £10,000 from one of Canada's Scottish sons, Thomas Bassett Macaulay, of the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada was used to purchase 50 acres and buildings at Craigiebuckler in Aberdeen. Macaulay's aim was to improve the productivity of Scottish agriculture. Thomas Bassett Macaulay was a descendant of Macaulay family of Lewis, who were centred on the Hebridean island of Lewis. He was true to his Hebridean roots throughout his life, often giving large donations to Lewis, which funded various projects including a new library and a new wing at Lewis hospital.\n\nThe new Macaulay Institute opened on a site near Bucksburn in April 1987. It was formed by the merger of the Macaulay Institute for Soil Research and the Hill Farm Research Organisation. The proposed merger was announced in December 1985 with the government anticipating that it would result in cost savings. It was established to carry out research in support of the agricultural industry, taking account of the interaction between the industry and other land users, and set in the context of the environmental objectives of the UK Government and the European Union.\n\nIn April 2011, the Macaulay Institute merged with SCRI (Scottish Crop Research Institute) in Dundee to form the James Hutton Institute. The chief executive of the new institute is Professor Iain Gordon.\n\nIt is an international centre for research and consultancy on the environmental and social consequences of rural land uses.

He is recognized as a leading figure in the history of Carlism, serving as its political leader for over 20 years (1934–1955) and heading the movement during one of its most turbulent periods. Initially he led the belligerent faction pressing anti-Republican insurgency; during the Spanish Civil War he joined the Nationalists; later on he championed anti-Francoist strategy.\n\nManuel Lorenzo José Fal Conde descended from a petty bourgeoisie family originating from Asturias; it is not clear when the family settled in Higuera de la Sierra, a small town in the Andalusian province of Huelva. Although many of his ancestors were connected with medicine, his father, Domingo Fal Sánchez (1857-1926), was referred to as \"agricultor y industrial\", who owned a small workshop producing cork utilities and served as alcalde of Higuera between 1900 and 1905; also later on Domingo Fal exercised influence on Higuera's life. He married a local girl, María Josefa Conde; the couple lived in a building housing also the workshop. They had 4 children, Manuel was the youngest and his mother died 13 days after giving birth. The widowed sister of Domingo helped to look after the children, brought up in fervently Catholic ambience.\n\nManuel commenced his education in the Extremaduran town of Villafranca de los Barros. He entered the local Jesuit college and joined his two older brothers already being educated there. The Jesuit education proved crucial in Manuel's formative years. It was Gabino Márquez, the Villafranca scholar of biblical studies, papal teaching and pedagogy, who paid particular attention to the student, who he considered promising. Following bachillerato obtained in 1911 the young Fal entered the Jesuit novitiate, but he changed his mind some time afterwards, and considered studying medicine. His father dissuaded him as his older brother, Domingo, was already pursuing that path; eventually Manuel commenced law studies in Seville.\n\nAt Universidad Hispalense Fal was drawn to a circle of Manuel Sanchez de Castro, a Carlist, catedratic of natural law and moving spirit behind the emergence of militant Catholicism in Seville. He graduated as licenciado in 1916; following a year in Madrid he obtained the grade of a doctor. In 1917 he served as soldado and in 1918 he entered Colegio de Abogados de Sevilla. Following brief internship Fal opened his own office at calle José Gestoso. In parallel to his law practice Fal commenced also his brief teaching and academic career. He taught history and law and ethics at the Jesuit college of Villasis in Seville. At Universidad Hispalense he worked at department of derecho procesal, at the same time pursuing research in history of Spanish political law. He also briefly managed a car dealership.\n\nIn 1922 Fal married María de los Reyes Macias Aguilar (1904-1975), a native of nearby Sanlucar. The newlyweds initially settled in Seville at calle Miguel del Cid. The couple had 7 children, born between 1923 and 1938. Some were active as Traditionalist militants during the Francoist period and afterwards, in the 1970s opposing the socialist bid of Don Carlos Hugo; José Maria, Alfonso and Domingo Fal-Conde Macias were present as supporters of Don Sixto during the Montejurra incidents of 1976. In the 1980s Domingo Fal-Conde Macias served as head of , a new united Carlist organization. Javier became known as .\n\nIt is not clear whether there were any Carlist antecedents among the ancestors of Fal; some authors claim there were none, while others quote his family as exemplary case of Carlism having been transmitted from generation to generation as sort of a genetic code. It is known that Fal's father was a devout Catholic, but none of the sources consulted provides clear information what exactly his political outlook was. It is possible that Traditionalist views were if not reinforced then implanted in the young Fal during his education. At the turn of the centuries the Jesuits were clearly sympathizing with Ramón Nocedal and his Integrist vision of religion and Traditionalism; it is likely that his Villafranca years affected Fal accordingly. He admitted juvenile fascination with address delivered to the college audience by Manuel Senante, at that time one of key Integrist politicians. Militant Catholicism of Manuel Sanchez de Castro is likely to have contributed further on, forming the young Fal as an energetic Catholic activist, possibly along the intransigent and ultra-reactionary Integrist lines.\n\nFal commenced his public assignments already during the academic years in Seville; he joined Asociación Escolar Sevillana and soon grew to be its president; the organization remained a fairly typical student grouping, though politically it tended towards \"catolicismo político y social\", flavored by Traditionalism in general and by pro-German World War I stand in particular. Following his return from Madrid he started contributing to local Catholic periodicals. In the 1920s he excelled, however, in various Catholic organizations, ranging from educational associations to charity groupings to trade unions to penitentiary circles, like Congregación de los Luises, Conferencias de San Vicente de Paulo, various Hermandades de Penitencia, the Jesuit-sponsored Patronato para Obreros, the Franciscan-sponsored Compaña de las Hermanas de la Cruz and a number of others. He also launched some initiatives himself, like the 1924-inaugurated Romería de la Peña de la Reina de los Angeles. Exposure to a variety of structures provided Fal with experience and confirmed his enormous capacity as organizer.\n\nIt is not clear whether during late Restoration or during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship Fal was active in the Integrist ranks. When discussing his post-1931 activity, present-day scholars almost unanimously refer to him as to a former Integrist or even more explicitly as to \"antiguo militante del Partido Integrista\", though none provides detailed information on his engagement in any party initiatives of the 1920s. When reporting on Fal's activities in 1930, the Integrist daily \"El Siglo Futuro\" referred to him as \"queridisimo amigo nuestro de Sevilla\", which suggests that he might have indeed co-operated with Integrism in general and the newspaper in particular also earlier on, especially that he displayed a particular knack for journalism: he is known to have contributed to various press titles before 1923, launched his own daily later and was correspondent of \"El Siglo Futuro\" in the early 1930s.\n\nFal, who later confessed to approaching politics as Christian responsibility and a call from God, was first recorded as engaged in a political enterprise in the spring of 1930. He was among members of Junta Organizadora of Partido Tradicionalista-Integrista, a new post-dictatorial incarnation of Integrism, and emerged as leader of the Seville branch of the party. In late 1930 he was also busy co-organizing local branches of Juventud Integrista. Fal witnessed emergence of militantly secular Republic with horror; he personally led local Juventud organization trying to protect the Seville churches against . In June 1931 he ran for Cortes from Cadiz; the bid proved unsuccessful. According to a homage publication Fal gained enough votes to be voted in, but it was behind-the-stage manipulations which relegated him to non-electable position; embittered, he has never run for the Cortes again. Instead, he focused on a newly acquired daily, \"El Observador\", re-launched as an ultraconservative Catholic title in Seville, apart from contributing to other local periodicals.\n\nIn early 1932 the Integrists re-united with Carlism in . Fal was entrusted the West-Andalusian jefatura and together with provincial leaders achieved remarkable success implanting Traditionalism where it was hardly popular. Characteristic feature of his leadership was – even in comparison to other Carlist leaders - unveiled hostility towards the Republic. Fal remained enthusiastic about co-operation with Sanjurjo; Andalusia was where the coup was most welcomed by local Carlists. In the aftermath Fal was arrested for 3 months, which did not discourage him from sounding other military on leading a potential Carlist rising. Also his \"El Observador\" kept making references to violence. Two other specific features of Andalusian Carlism were impact on Catholic youth and initiatives targeting the urban working-class. In many Andalusian districts Carlism emerged as an exclusively youth movement, which in the spring of 1933 pushed Fal to create a federation of local Juventud circles. Acute social problems in turn induced Fal to set up fairly successful Workers Section in early 1933.\n\nFal gained nationwide attention following the Zumarraga act; in recognition of his excellent organization skills in November 1933 Alfonso Carlos nominated Fal Jefe Regional for all Andalusia, but the most impressive coup was yet to come: in April 1934 regional Carlism organized a massive gathering at Quintillo estate near Seville. This demonstration of local prowess climaxed in parade of 650 uniformed and well-trained Requetés, which made a stunning impact on guests from other regions. When national leadership of Conde Rodezno was called into question due to rapprochement with the Alfonsists and his gradualist strategy, Fal became one of top contenders for the job. Alfonso Carlos, himself sympathetic to Integrism and personally familiar with Fal since late Restoration, seemed well-disposed. In May 1934, despite his relatively young age and unenthusiastic welcome from Carlist stronghold, Navarre, Fal was nominated Secretary General of the Communión. \"El Siglo Futuro\" hailed him as \"Sevillian Zumalacarregui\" and Carlist youth welcomed him as the man who \"brought Montejurra to Andalusia\".\n\nFal embarked on massive reorganization of Carlist structures. He created 5 central Delegaciones; Council of Culture and Grand Council. Launch of official Carlist gazette enhanced communication. Most importantly, he detached affiliated organizations from local circulos and joined them in nationwide, parallel, centrally commanded structures. The first remodeled were Requeté and Juventud Tradicionalista, with and Margaritas (Carlist feminine organization) somewhat less successful. New affiliated formations were created: urban proletariat was lured to Agrupación Gremial, a Carlist red cross organization emerged as Socorro Blanco and a grouping for younger boys was established as Pelayos. Internal taxation was introduced. Carlist periodicals were co-ordinated within modern propaganda machinery, brought under more discipline in return for financial help.\n\nThe change meant vast improvement in terms of steerability, provided critical mass and enhanced homogeneity, though also enforced discipline and laid command of all structures in hands of Fal and his entourage, removing dependence on local juntas and especially on the Vasco-Navarros. The latter complained about \"fascistization\" of the Comunión, especially that Fal's trusted collaborators were appointed to key positions. Nevertheless, remodeled Comunión was fully able to bear the weight of rapidly expanding ranks; instead of inefficient isolated circulos where zeal of new converts was evaporating, new structures channeled and reinforced enthusiasm. Organization question aside, the change started even to affect the way of life. Comunión began to expand into unlikely areas both geographically and socially; structures were emerging in such regions as Extremadura or the Canaries, while following the example of Western Andalusia, representatives of urban proletariat started to appear in local bodies also elsewhere.\n\nUnlike the Northerners who conceived Traditionalism as rooted in family and regional values, Fal was focused on structures. As alliances were likely to get them dominated by other groupings, victorious campaign – maybe unfeasible as exclusively Carlist affair - should be launched and controlled by Carlists. In line with this vision, under Fal Carlism steered clear of alliances, its strategy dubbed \"isolationism\" or \"exclusiveness\". Though he felt compelled to join Renovación Española in National Bloc (the Spanish Right-wing political alliance of the 1930s) late 1934, he made sure the access was as non-committal as possible. In 1935 he grew increasingly skeptical and later that year let Rodezno mix with the Alfonsinos on the private business basis before definitely abandoning the alliance in the spring of 1936. From the onset highly suspicious about CEDA he was more than happy to see it decompose in 1935-6.\n\nAnother shift in Carlist strategy under Fal was de-emphasizing of politics and focusing on organizational buildup, with special attention paid to paramilitary. His vision was already set on violent overthrow of the Republic; starting 1935 openly belligerent language became increasingly common at Carlist rallies, with references to sacrifice, blood, arms, violence and power. Permitting taking part in 1936 elections, Fal did not pay much attention to the campaign. Though Rodeznistas viewed him as a uninspiring, colorless, mediocre bureaucrat, Fal gained recognition bordering devotion among Requeté and the youth. Also Alfonso Carlos seemed perfectly satisfied; in December 1935 he raised Fal from Secretary General to Jefe Delegado.\n\nConvinced that in the battle against democracy Carlists must strike first, Fal threw himself into wartime preparations; his initial plan was abandoned in April 1936. He envisaged a purely Carlist insurrection with conditional assistance of the army. Fal placed his bets on Sanjurjo, who agreed to lead the rising. Talks with Mola proved unsuccessful. The general refused to accept Fal's conditions, which aimed at toppling the Republic and installing Traditionalist monarchy. However, Mola opened parallel negotiations with the Navarrese. Led by Rodezno, the latter bypassed Fal and were keen to commit local Requeté to a joint insurgency with almost no strings attached. Though at that point Fal considered dismissing the entire Navarrese junta, he decided not to risk open confrontation; Rodezno and his entourage outmaneuvered him and elicited hesitant approval from the royal envoy, Don Javier.\n\nUpon the outbreak of hostilities Fal headed the new Carlist wartime executive, Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra, and had to acknowledge that instead of being equal partner, Carlism was getting reduced to a junior role. His position was already precarious. Death of Sanjurjo deprived him of a key ally among the generals. Death of Alfonso Carlos left the movement with no king and made dissent easier. The Navarrese set up their own Junta Central Carlista de Guerra de Navarra, which emerged as a competitive, though theoretically only regional body, and kept bypassing Fal; Carlist executive was decomposing. As Requeté units, the key Carlist argument, unconditionally left at generals’ disposal were dispersed among various fronts, Carlism – in line with Fal's worst nightmares – was indeed getting dominated by its alliance partners. During the outbreak of the Nationalist uprising in Navarre, a mass killing was conducted by the insurgents against all civilian dissidence in the Navarre rearguard, taking a death toll of circa 3,000. Fal's attitude towards the Republicans is subject to conflicting accounts. Some maintain that he was the instigator of bloody repressions, also directed against the clergy with Basque nationalist sympathies, while others claim exactly the opposite, namely that he did his best to prevent executions. Discussion related to the Carlist - and, due to his political leadership, also Fal's personal responsibility for nationalist atrocities committed in the rearguard is not conclusive.\n\nTo enhance Carlist position versus the military Fal launched two new projects in November. The first one was Obra Nacional Corporativa, general labor organization, another one was Military Academy, intended to train Carlist command cadres. Uncomfortable with Fal's independent stance, Franco summoned him to Burgos in early December and presented with the choice between exile and firing squad. Rodezno-dominated Junta Nacional advocated compliance and Fal left Spain for Lisbon, remaining official though increasingly theoretical Carlist leader.\n\nFaced with unification pressure Fal did not dismiss such a perspective, but talking to fellow Traditionalists in Insua he insisted it should be completed on Carlist terms, reiterating this position also during February talks with Falangists. At meetings in Burgos (March) and Pamplona (April), unattended by Fal, the balance tilted towards Rodeznistas, ready to accept Franco's terms of amalgamation. They presented Don Javier with an ultimatum and ensured that he at least did not object. Following Fal was passed over as leader of a technically non-existent movement. Initially he did not protest and even advised to comply. Despite olive branch offered by Franco – including a ministerial job or seat in – he politely refused to join. His exile was lifted in October 1937. He eventually abandoned quiet in favor of direct counter-action, suggesting to Don Javier that all those accepting seats in the FET executive be expelled; the regent acted on his advice. Unification turned into Falangist absorption of Carlist offshoots.\n\nUpon return from exile and under security surveillance, Fal tried to avert takeover of Comunión assets by FET; many years later he admitted that these efforts had been largely fruitless. Communicating by correspondence with loyal regional leaders he ordered re-engineering of party structures, but did not prevent Carlism from falling into political confusion and fragmentation. To gain platform for legal action, in 1939 he co-founded Hermandad de los Caballeros Voluntarios de la Cruz, intended as substitute for official Carlist network. As long as the war continued, he focused on maintaining Carlist identity and refrained from open opposition. Though violent confrontations between Requetés and Falangists were recorded all over Spain, almost all were spontaneous and none of the authors consulted claims they were planned or engineered by Fal.\n\nIn March 1939 Fal addressed Franco with a memorandum, titled \"Manifestación de ideales\". Written with all due respect, the document claimed that the emerging regime was not sustainable and argued in favor of traditionalist monarchy; as transitory means it suggested a regency, either this of Don Javier or a collective one, alluding to Franco as its member. Though sounding more like an offer, the document, together with other texts disseminated around that time, is viewed by some scholars as a milestone marking total breakup with the regime and adoption of a decisive opposition strategy. Caudillo did not respond. He reacted, however, to mayhem which erupted in Pamplona following Fal's appearance on the ayunatamiento balcony during re-burial of Sanjurjo on October 21, 1939: Fal was ordered house arrest in Seville.\n\nFrom his confinement Fal presided over most vehement Carlist opposition, comparable only to hostility of the early 1970s. No collaboration with the regime was acceptable. The strategy was to ignore all officialdom and go public styling Traditionalist initiatives as religious or combatant activities, though conspiracy hand in hand with the communists has been rejected. Corresponding with regional leaders, in 1940-41 Fal went on reconstructing Comunión structures either in traditional shape or in a new format; official party executive existed only in a makeshift mode. He launched veiled Carlist educational network of Academia Vazquez de Mella. Fal banned Carlists from enlisting to División Azul and advocated strictly neutral stand in European conflict, considering the British and German wars equally unjust; this did not spare him charges of entanglement in a British plot, resulting in 4-month-long Ferreries exile in 1941.\n\nBack in Seville Fal was occasionally allowed to travel and was present during the massive Montserrat gatherings in 1942 and 1945. In 1943 he co-engineered \"Reclamación del poder\", another memorandum signed by many Carlists and left unanswered by Franco. According to an unsure source, in 1944 he supported an aborted monarchist plot to depose the dictator. In August 1945 Fal addressed Franco with a conciliatory personal letter; sort of acknowledging Falangist regime, but presenting Traditionalism as the unique long-term solution, he asked for release from confinement. The house arrest was indeed lifted in November 1945; during the 6-year long period of detention Fal went on practicing as a lawyer.\n\nIn December 1945 Valencia and Pamplona were rocked by Carlist riots; some speculate that they were pre-planned as a revolt against Franco. Fal's presence is unsure; 3 weeks later he met Don Javier in San Sebastián; he also wrote to Don Juan, inviting him to recognize the regency. Soon Fal commenced visiting provincial party structures; the exercise climaxed in monthly tour across the North in September 1946. Considering re-organization complete, in 1947 he assembled 48 local jefes in Madrid, the first such meeting since Insua. The gathering re-established Carlist executive, Consejo Nacional. \"La única solución\", a document released afterwards, confirmed non-collaborative stance versus Francoism, Juanismo and Carloctavismo. Addressing a massively attended Montserrat aplec of 1947 seemed to demonstrate that Carlism was getting back in shape.\n\nLeadership of Fal was coming under fire from two groups. The Sivattistas suspected that by supporting overdue regency Fal intended to ensure the crown for Borbón-Parmas by appeasing Franco. They were enraged by Fal's recommendation to support in referendum, considering it unacceptable backing of the regime, and demanded that a new Carlist king is declared. On the other hand, the possibilists were getting tired of what they perceived as ineffective intransigency and lack of legal outposts, recommending more flexible attitude. Though in 1948 Consejo de la Tradicion confirmed non-collaborationist strategy, in 1949 some voices called for a more active stance, especially following news of Franco's negotiations with Don Juan.\n\nFal's reaction was multifold. On the one hand, he fought back militant dissenters like Sivatte. On the other, he tried to address questions raised. Intending to broaden the party's room for maneuvering, he permitted individual Carlists to run in local elections, especially that in some provinces the movement effectively competed for power with Falange. In 1951 he launched a campaign to buy a national daily, \"\"; the title later served as an unofficial Carlist tribune. Student and worker groupings, AET and MOT, recorded increased activity. Though in 1951 Fal tried to keep low profile of Don Javier's tour across Levante, all this changed in 1952: during Eucharistic Congress in Barcelona Don Javier claimed his rights as a king before having been promptly expulsed from Spain.\n\nAs Don Javier soon backtracked on the so-called Acto de Barcelona and Franco's regime showed no signs of cracking, the non-collaborative policy of the Falcondistas was increasingly looking like a dead end street. The so-called \"duros\" advocated a decisive anti-Francoist course, the so-called \"unionistas\" opted for rapprochement towards the regime and possibly a dynastical accord with Alfonsinos, some in the party called for a \"tercera vía\" and many complained about Fal's \"estilo autoritario\". Fal himself has run out of steam; in his July 1955 letter to Franco he seemed settled for the perspective of mere survival of Carlism. Though he remained in perfect understanding with Don Javier and until that moment the terms \"Falcondistas\" and \"Javieristas\" were used interchangeably, also the Carlist king felt that Carlism needed a new leader. In August 1955 Fal resigned as Jefe Delegado.\n\nFollowing his resignation Fal took a step back from daily politics and functioned as honorary member, sporadically invited to sittings of Carlist executive as late as 1964. He remained loyal to the new Communion leader, Valiente, even given the latter embarked on new, collaborationist strategy. Though continuously anti-Francoist, he avoided uncompromising radicalism. On the one hand, in 1956 he opposed backtracking on Acto de Barcelona, demanded by the Francoist authorities. On the other, when consulted about planned appearance of Carlos Hugo at Montejurra in 1957, he spoke to the negative, warning about a violent reaction from Franco. Though his advice was ignored, he maintained good relations with Carlos Hugo and was consulted on his 1958 Montejurra address. Upon first signs of breakup between Progressists and Traditionalists Fal praised Carlos Hugo for ousting Zamanillo in 1962. He attended some Montejurra aplecs, turning into the prince's promotional stage, himself; in 1963 he needed assistance when climbing the summit. In the mid-1960s he recommended publication of a \"libro blanco\", advancing the Borbón-Parma claim.\n\nIn 1967 Don Javier made Fal Duque de Quintillo, Grandee of Spain, an exceptional honor as it was the only case of Don Javier granting a noble title to anyone beyond the royal family. Despite the elevation, cordial relations between Fal and his king were deteriorating. Quoting health reasons, Fal did not attend the ducado ceremony in Fatima. Though Don Javier and Carlos Hugo urged him to recommend supporting in the , Fal agreed to recommend participation, but clinging to his anti-Francoism he refused to endorse the law. When in 1968 the Borbón-Parmas were expulsed from Spain, Fal resisted their repeated requests to meet Franco seeking reversal of the decision and responded that he had no reason to pay a penitent visit to the dictator. In wide correspondence he expressed concern about the socialist stand of Carlos Hugo of the late 1960s. Despite mounting doubts, he did not join those turned against the dynasty, like Zamanillo or Elias de Tejada; when in 1970 the prince ordered termination of collaboration with \"\", re-claimed by orthodox Traditionalists, Fal complied. He was particularly embittered by cancellation of annual Quintillo remembrance act in 1972. In 1973 he considered himself dynastically loyal to Don Javier, but in disagreement with his political line. In 1974 Fal lost any illusions as to the Leftist turn of the Borbón-Parmas. \n\nThroughout all his life Fal was a fervent Catholic, receiving communion every day even when visiting frontlines during the Civil War. When released from political duties he was dedicating even more time to religious issues. He co-founded religious associations, accepted posts in others and was active in Andalusian initiatives of various orders. He headed Editorial Católica Española and launched Premio Vedruna, though remained perplexed by new course of the Vatican. In the early 1970s \"Don Manuel\" enjoyed patriarch status in the realm of Andalusian Catholicism and among Traditionalist Carlists nationwide. He remained emotionally attached to Don Javier. Fal died one month after his abidcation.\n\nAs political event the death of Fal was soon eclipsed by the just commencing Spanish transition to democracy. In the late 1970s and the 1980s his memory was subject to competition on part of the socialist Partido Carlista and various breeds of Traditionalism, especially as they engaged in bitter political struggle. Followers of Don Carlos Hugo presented Fal focusing on his loyalty to Borbón-Parmas and on his anti-Francoism, attempting to mount him in their overall vision of Carlism as a popular class struggle. Traditionalists, including Fal's sons, reclaimed him as fervent Catholic and a conservative who guarded genuine Carlist orthodoxy against Francoism but has also never approved of the socialist turn of the hugocarlistas. These two visions, offered by militants of both groupings, keep contending until today.\n\nFal started to figure prominently in historiography in the 1990s, and until today there have been numerous articles published in specialized reviews, dedicated either to particular episodes or to certain dimensions of his activity. However, he gained no full-blown scholarly monograph so far. Two books dedicated to Fal and published in 1978 and 1998 are formatted as homage rather than as scientific historical works. He is usually presented as an intransigent opponent of Franco. He is generally recognized for excellent organizational skills, especially during early years of his leadership, though there are exceptions. Fal is usually not acclaimed as a theorist; some students tend to view him as an inflexible doctrinaire, those who do not underline his Integrist, holistic vision of politics and religion.\n\nIn popular discourse Fal, unlike most Carlist political leaders, has generally evaded usual lambasting as \"fascista\" or \"reaccionario\". Newspaper pieces claim that he \"revived popular character of Carlism\" and even maintain that his vision contained threads which could have contributed to \"reencuentro de España\", but were lost in \"tiempos de intolerancia\". Nevertheless, naming of a major throughway street honoring Fal in Sevilla was contested; some historians indicated that while in Germany and Italy apology of fascism was illegal, in Spain historical memory suffered a lobotomia and street names commemorating Fal proved that it was \"sólo memoria histórica de la derecha\". As a result, in 2009 the street was renamed with Fal's name retained only in a short adjacent drive.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33636820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33636820", "title": "Mayoral control of schools", "text": "Mayoral control of schools\n\nMayoral control of schools is governance over American schools based on the business model, in which the mayor of a city replaces an elected board of education (school board) with an appointed board. The mayor may also directly appoint the head of the school system, called the CEO, superintendent or chancellor. Also known as integrated governance, mayoral control of schools is in contrast to the structure it replaces: an elected board that governs schools independently from the formal influence of the mayor.\n\nMayors governs the school districts in two of the United States' three largest cities: Chicago (since 1995) and New York City (since 2002). Mayors also control various other medium-to-large districts as well, including District of Columbia Public Schools. According to a survey of school board members compiled for the National School Board Association, 96 percent of respondents report that membership on their board is determined by election. As of October 2011, evidence of existing or attempted mayoral control was found in about 20 major districts around the United States. Perhaps the most high-profile case of mayoral control is New York City where Michael Bloomberg won the right to appoint the head of schools in June 2002.\n\nDespite limited reach, there are a plethora of mayoral controlled governance structures. In Chicago, the mayor appoints the CEO (superintendent) as well as the entire school board. In Washington, DC, the mayor has power to directly select the chancellor, who must be confirmed by the city council. All D.C. state board of education members are elected but the state board of education acts in a largely advisory capacity to the state education agency. New York’s mayor also has the power to select the head of schools, in addition to appointing eight of thirteen school board members. In Boston, the mayor’s powers extend only to appointing a committee from a list of nominees. It is this appointed board that is entrusted with the job of selecting a superintendent of schools.\n\nAccording to scholar Deborah Land of Johns Hopkins University, the origins of a system in which lay individuals were given the authority to govern their local schools dates back more than 200 years. From the inception of school boards, there was skepticism about the ability of distant politicians to see and meet the needs of local neighborhoods when it came to education. As a result, boards of education were morphed over time to ensure maximum local control of schools. It was believed that separating governance of schools from state and local elected officials was the best way to realize the Progressive Era vision of schools protected from politics. The trend toward mayoral control represents a reversal of this trend, with arguments for and against discussed in a later section.\n\nWhile mayoral control in some cities such as Jackson, Mississippi, has existed since the mid-20th century, most shifts from elected to appointed school boards took place after 1990. Starting in the 1990s, mayoral control was viewed by its supporters as a way to address the chronic underperformance and jumpstart reforms in medium to large urban districts. The first major urban district to move toward mayoral control of schools was Boston, where, in 1991, the Massachusetts governor and legislature approved a petition allowing the mayor to appoint a seven-member board, which then appointed a superintendent of schools. The latest high-profile urban district to move under mayoral control was Washington, DC, where Mayor Adrian Fenty won the right to select the chancellor of schools in 2007.\nThe table below shows the school districts that are now under the governance of mayor-appointed boards and, in some cases, mayor-appointed heads of schools.\n\nOther locations have varying degrees of mayoral control over schools: in Oakland, California, three of the 10 members of the Oakland Unified School District board members are appointed by the mayor, and the other seven are elected. Mayoral control proposals have also been made in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Seattle.\nNotably, not all attempts at achieving mayoral control have been successful. Mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa sought to bring the Los Angeles Unified School District under his management, but before the plan could be brought into effect in 2007, a court ruled that it violated the California Constitution. In Detroit in the late 1990s, a reform board appointed by the mayor and governor replaced the elected board of education in response to allegations of mismanagement. This reform was reversed in city referendum in 2005 which reinstated an elected school board.\n\nProponents of mayoral control point to two major reasons for shifting from an elected to appointed governance structure: the benefits of a single point of accountability and the power of sustained, aligned leadership. On the point of accountability, supporters of mayoral control point to the extremely low turnout for often off-cycle school board elections as evidence of the lack of school board accountability and relevance. Expounding on this point, Finn and Keegan point out that in districts under mayoral control, \"there is now a single, publicly accountable official in charge, rather than nine wannabe mayors immobilizing the school system with their petty squabbles, power grabs, and turf protecting. If citizens are unhappy with the schools, they can now vote the mayor out of office. This does not eliminate democratic control over the schools; it rechannels—and strengthens—it\". Former appointed CEO of the mayoral controlled Chicago Public Schools and U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan has made his support for mayoral control of schools clear, offering his help to mayors who push to gain sole leadership of the schools within their cities. His support is also rooted in a belief that one point of accountability—the mayor—is far more effective than accountability spread across an elected board of education model.\n\nThe second major rationale used to support mayoral control is the power of sustained, aligned leadership. The average tenure of urban superintendents is less than four years—an unfortunate consequence of the frequent turnover in board membership and the shifting winds of local interests. In cities where the mayors provide job stability for superintendents and focus the energy of the public and private sectors of a city on designated education priorities, the theory goes that more will be accomplished in areas ranging from improving student achievement to ensuring sound fiscal management. In Boston, for instance, it is reported that mayoral control \"engendered continuity in leadership and a new focus on learning\".\n\nOpponents of mayoral control typically cite two major issues with the shift. Most importantly, mayoral control represents an affront to democratic, public participation in school governance. Many worry that taking popular elections of school board members out of the school governance formula prevents local neighborhoods from having any say in how their interests are represented. As Hess admits, \"some voices are likely to be silenced or marginalized under an appointed board\". A related complaint focuses on the lack of transparency that accompanies appointed school boards. Comparing appointed school boards to the board malfeasance in private sector companies such as Enron points to the danger of having a single-minded board take control of any entity.\n\nOverall, the question of whether to elect or appoint boards of education requires a thoughtful consideration of the \"appropriate balance\" between responsiveness and responsibility.\n\nPerhaps the most important piece of evidence in the debate between the proponents and opponents of mayoral control is whether mayoral control has measurable impacts on student achievement. After collecting and analyzing the research on school board effectiveness produced over the past twenty-five years, scholar Deborah Land concluded that there is \"not yet convincing evidence that appointment of school board members produces…greater academic achievement.\" Similarly, while unwilling to dismiss the connection between strong mayoral involvement and student achievement outright, researchers at the Institute on Education Law and Policy at Rutgers University— Newark \"were unable to establish conclusively that the change in governance had any causal relationship to improved performance, or that, using nationally normed test data, our [mayoral controlled] cities had greater improvements than anywhere else\". Additionally, an analysis of top-down market-based reform efforts in three mayoral controlled cities, Chicago, New York City and Washington DC, indicate the efforts \"deliver few benefits, often harm the students they purport to help, and divert attention from a set of other, less visible policies with more promise to weaken the link between poverty and low educational attainment.\"\n\nAlternatively, a 2013 study by researchers at the Center for American Progress found that, of the eleven districts governed by some degree of mayoral leadership, five made substantial improvement in narrowing the student achievement gap, and four others showed progress on some measures. That same study found that mayoral control in New York City had improved the performance of African American and Latino students in fourth and eighth grade by between 1 and 3 percent annually.\n\n"}

However, its principal electorate are also the Pomaks (Muslim Bulgarians) and the party relies on the biggest share of all the Romani voters, nevertheless 9 out of its 36 deputies are not of Muslim background. At the 2014 parliamentary elections, 3% of Bulgarian voters, 83% of Turkish voters and 44% of Romani voters voted for the movement, a record high share of Romani voters. The party won in completely Christian Romani villages and thus was alleged for trading with their vote.\n\nThe party was officially established in 1990, but the official website of the party traces the roots of the foundation to 1983 when an illegal terrorist group \"Turkish National Freedom Movement\" was established, which committed over 50 fire-raisings, bomb attempts and murders on regular citizens until 1989 as a rebellion against the assimilation policies of Todor Zhivkov's communist regime. After he had been set free out of the jail in 1989, Ahmed Dogan, a former member of the Bulgarian communist secret service (the Committee for State Security), established the party. He headed it from its official establishment on 4 January 1990 until 19 January 2013, when a disgruntled Bulgarian Turk attacked him with a gas pistol. Ahmed Dogan has been openly recorded promoting changes of the international boundaries in accordance with the ethnic borders, clarifying that there are either peaceful and political means for this or military and aggressive. The ethnic or religious minority parties are not allowed according to Article 11, Paragraph 4 of the Constitution of Bulgaria, but the Constitutional Court denied to ban the party in 1992.\n\nOn 19 January 2013, Lyutfi Mestan was elected as the second chairman of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. Mestan was removed from power by the insistence of the founder Dogan because he had declared support for Turkey for the shot Russian airplane, then Erdoğan blacklisted Ahmed Dogan banning him from entering Turkey. Mestan formed his own party, named Democrats for Responsibility, Solidarity and Tolerance.\n\nStarting in 1990 as the first political party of the Muslim minority participating in the parliamentary elections, in the first elections in 1990 after the end of the communist regime, which the Muslims had boycotted, the party won 6.0% of the popular vote and 24 out of 400 seats and became the fourth largest party in the parliament. In the parliamentary elections in 1991 it won 7.6% of the vote and remained with 24 seats in а 240-seater parliament. In the elections in 1994 it won 5.4% of the vote and its seats decreased to 15. In the elections in 1997 it won 7.6% of the vote and 19 out of 240 seats. From 2001 to 2009, the party was part of the government, first in a coalition with the National Movement Simeon II (NDSV) party and then with the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). The party had ministers in the Sakskoburggotski Government, Stanishev Government and Oresharski Government (2013-2014).\n\nIt won in the elections in 2001 7.5% of the vote and 21 out of 240 seats. Subsequently, for the first time the party joined a coalition government, which was led by the winner of the elections (NDSV). Under the control of the party were two out of the 17 Bulgarian ministries – the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests and the Minister without portfolio, the other 15 remained under the control of senior coalition partner NDSV. At the 2005 elections it increased to 12.8% of vote and 34 out of 240 seats and was kept in power as a part of the coalition led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and National Movement Simeon II (NDSV) party. The ministries under the control of the Movement of Rights and Freedoms increased to three out of 18.\n\nAt the 2009 elections it increased to 14.0% of vote and 37 out of 240 seats. Following the election, the government was totally occupied by the decisive winner, the Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms was еxcluded from the government and remained in opposition after having been part of coalition governments for the two consecutive preceding terms between 2001 and 2009. At the 2009 European Parliament elections the party won 14.1% of the vote and three MEPs out of Bulgaria's total representation of 18. Two of the MEPs are ethnic Turks (Filiz Husmenova and Metin Kazak) and one (Vladko Panayotov) is ethnic Bulgarian.\n\nIn the Bulgarian parliamentary election in 2013, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms decreased to 11.3% of the vote; it took 36 seats and remained the third biggest party. The DPS won the elections abroad with 41.3% and the most polling stations and voters in a foreign country were in Turkey.\n\nThe DPS won four MEPs in the 2014 European Parliament elections.\n\nOn 8 October 1991, ninety-three members of Bulgaria's National Assembly — virtually all of them affiliated with the former Communist Party — asked the constitutional court to declare the DPS unconstitutional citing article 11.4 of the constitution which explicitly bans political parties \"formed on ethnic, racial, and religious basis\". On 21 April 1992, the court rejected the petition and affirmed the constitutionality of the DPS.\n\nEven though the DPS has been legally a part of Bulgarian political life since then, some Bulgarian nationalists, particularly the far-right National Union Attack, continue to assert that it is anti-constitutional because it consists mainly of ethnic Turks.\n\nHowever, the statute of the DPS states quite clearly that it \"is an independent public and political organization, founded with the purpose of contributing to the unity of all Bulgarian citizens\".\n\nAdditionally, supporters of DPS argue that banning parties on the basis of their ethnic composition constitutes an instance of ethnic discrimination and is in contravention to European law, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in particular to which Bulgaria is a signatory. Furthermore, despite a similar constitutional ban, religious parties, such as the Bulgarian Christian Coalition have competed for parliamentary elections since 1997, and again in 2005, without any political upheaval.\n\nMore recently, Antonina Zheliazkova, head of the Centre for Interethnic Relations in Sofia, praised Ahmed Dogan by stating that \"He has been working hard to open up the party to all citizens and has encouraged the DPS's supporters to be free to vote for non-ethnic parties\".\n\nAt present there are three other tiny Turkish political factions that oppose the DPS’s politics. These groups — which united to form the Balkan Democratic League — are the Movement of the Democratic Wing (DDK), led by Osman Oktay; the Party for Democracy and Justice (PDS), led by Nedim Gencev; and the Union of the Bulgarian Turks (SBT), led by Seyhan Türkkan.\n\nHowever, these movements, as well as the National Movement for Rights and Freedoms, member of a Social-Democratic coalition ('Rose coalition') failed to secure any elected representative in the parliament. A party founded in 2011 by members who left the party and headed by Korman Ismailov—People's Party Freedom and Dignity, gained 1.5% of the vote in a coalition with National Movement Simeon II (NDSV) and therefore did not cross the 4% threshold to enter the parliament. This party was part of the Reformist Bloc and crossed the threshold and entered the parliament and the government in 2014, but only with one Deputy Minister that was removed. Another political fraction DOST founded by the former leader Mestan, had 17,000 registered members in 2016, which were obtained only for about one year. If so, the members of the Movement of Rights and Freedoms must have dropped in numbers.\n\nThe DPS was severely criticized by the Bulgarian ultra-nationalist party Attack as well as mainstream right-wing political parties such as Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB) and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) and even by DPS coalition partners of the National Movement Simeon II for allegedly manipulating the vote in the June 2005 elections in some places by bringing Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin living in Turkey to vote in the elections. However, allegations of ethnic Turks coming to vote in Bulgaria at their permanent address and then returning to Turkey to vote with their passports, could not be \"verified or confirmed\" by international observers, whose assessment on the election was that it was free and fair.\n\nIn February 2005, the DPS opposed the privatisation of Bulgaria's largest tobacco company, Bulgartabac, which was backed by the government and the European Union, on the grounds that the industry traditionally employs ethnic Turks. The resulting crisis led to the resignation of vice premier Lidia Shuleva.\n\nDelyan Peevski Is \"a highly controversial figure in Bulgarian politics, business and media.\" He has served several terms of office in Bulgaria's Parliament as a DPS MP. He even served as head of the Bulgarian FBI equivalent (the State Agency for National Security) for one day, \"but after mass protests broke out in the streets was forced to hand in his resignation.\"\n\nAs of 2016, he had served as a member of Parliament in three National Assemblies.\n\nHe has a number of stakes in businesses, particularly in the media. According to Bulgarian National Television, \"In 2015, he officially acquired shares in Balkan Media Group, which includes the newspapers “Telegraph”, “Minitor”, “Politika”, \"Meridian Match” and others. He has shares in Technomarket and in a factory for cigarette packaging. He declared he had stakes in 4 foreign companies. He was a minority shareholder in Bulgartabak, from where he withdrew at the beginning of 2016.\"\n\nIn April 2017, 240 MPs were sworn in at the opening session of Bulgaria's 44th National Assembly. Peevski was among them, serving a fourth term, although, as \"Balkan Insight\" reported, \"his nomination as chief of the national security service in 2013 sparked Bulgaria’s largest street protests in nearly a decade.\"\n\nPlamen Oresharski announced in June 2013 that \"controversial figure and MRF MP Delyan Peevski was being nominated to head the State Agency for National Security.\"\n\nThe Bulgarian Parliament voted to make him the head of the agency. \"This almost brought down the then two-week old government of Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski, who leads a minority coalition between the Socialists and the DPS. The situation also embarrassed Sergei Stanishev, the leader of the Bulgaria Socialist Party (BSP), who is also leader of the Party of European Socialists (PES).\" Peevski said that he didn't understand why he was being blamed for trying to take the helm of the agency. He complained that Bulgaria's law enforcement institutions were \"submerged by false signals\" against him.\n\nAccording to the \"Sophia Globe\", \"The widely supported public protests unleashed by that move and the May 2014 thrashing of the BSP ( Movement for Rights and Freedoms) in European Parliament elections ultimately led to the government having to resign.\"\n\nHis appointment \"sparked the largest protests since the fall of communism, with tens of thousands of citizens heading to the streets.\"\n\nIn October 2013, the constitutional court reinstated Peevski as an MP. This led to thousands of students to occupy Sofia University, the largest university in Bulgaria. The occupation temporarily shut down the university.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, Peevski announced that he would withdraw from doing any business projects in Bulgaria. He said that the reason was undue political pressure and the \"ongoing media campaign against him.\" He blamed the media campaign for having a negative effect on the companies that he owned.\n\nIn early March 2016, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov suspended public procurement procedures. He gave, as one of his reasons, that there was public opinion that companies allegedly linked to Peevski were involved.\n\nPeevski likes to call himself \"a young and successful man\" in Bulgaria. However, most of Bulgaria's society views Peevski as the symbol of corruption in politics. According to \"Balkan Insight\" in 2016, \"Over 15 years, Delyan Peevski, who is still only 35, has scaled the dizzy heights of Bulgarian politics and business life.\"\n\nIn February 2016, he came \"under unprecedented attack. His very future in politics now looks in doubt.\"\n\n“Peevski has become the personification of the mafia-oligarchic way in which Bulgaria is governed,” Ognyan Minchev, director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies, said.\n\nAccording to \"Standart\", \"Peevski is considered a symbol of the shady power brokerage that has impoverished Bulgarians, and ruined the country's reputation. Officially, Peevski has no property, but it is widely assumed that he controls vast economic interests, and a powerful media group, which is waging a dirty war against his political opponents.\"\n\nFreedom House reported, \"Corruption is a serious concern in Bulgaria. Both the EU interventions and the KTB collapse in 2014 were seen as consequences of illicit collusion among the political and economic elite. Peevski’s New Bulgarian Media Group (NBMG) consistently supports the party in power.\"\n\nAccording to the 2016 book \"The Kremlin Playbook: Understanding Russian Influence in Central and Eastern Europe\", Peevski \"controls a business empire spanning at least five economic sectors including media and telecommunications, energy, construction, tobacco, and defense, making him one of the most powerful individuals in the country.\"\n\nAccording to \"EUObserver\" in April 2014, \"The recent appointment of controversial media mogul Delyan Peevski to head the candidates' list in three areas for the Turkish party Movements for Rights and Freedoms has triggered new protests in Sofia.\"\n\nDPS defended its nomination, saying Peevski was nominated because he has a good reputation and is a successful businessman who could help the country get European Union funds.\n\nSociologist Andrey Raichev of Gallup International said Peevski's candidacy was more about removing him from the national political scene and \"rewarding him as he is close to the previous political leader of the party, Ahmed Dogan, one of the most influential and powerful politicians in the country.\"\n\n\"EUObserver\" wrote, \"Bulgarians were outraged that Peevski, who along with his mother Irena Krasteva, manages a growing media empire that backs whichever government is in power, is set to be elected to the European Parliament in next month's [2014] vote.\"\n\nSince the protests in June 2013, he has not once been seen at the Bulgarian Parliament.\n\nThe Socialist Party supported his candidacy, believing that it would mobilize voters to go to the polls, resulting in a higher turnout and thus \"thwarting Peevski’s shot at the EU parliament, which would also draw a line under the political unrest that marked 2013.\" Many believe that if Peevski were to be elected to the EU parliament, he would continue to manage his businesses from Brussels rather than doing a good job in the parliament position.\n\n\"Much to the relief of the European liberal family\", Peevski abruptly announced on election night that he would not take up his seat in Bulgaria's Parliament, despite being elected. He ceded his seat to Iskra Mihailova, then-minister of ecology.\n\n"}
{"id": "3126755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3126755", "title": "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington", "text": "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\n\n\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" is the second episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> third season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 1991. In the episode, Lisa enters in an essay contest to write an essay about America's greatness. When she wins it, she and the family travel to Washington, D.C. where the finals are to be held. Lisa is dismayed after witnessing a bribery scandal in the House. In her final essay, she disdains and condemns the government system, which leads to the arrest of the corrupt congressman who accepted the bribe. While Lisa fails to win the contest, her faith in government is restored.\n\nThe episode was written by George Meyer and directed by Wes Archer, and it was the first episode for which Al Jean and Mike Reiss served as show runners. It features multiple references to the 1939 film \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Washington Monument.\n\nThe episode acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.9, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. It received mostly positive reviews from television critics, who praised the episode for its satire on American politics. However, the timber industry criticized the scene in which Lisa witnesses a timber industry lobbyist offering a bribe to the congressman in order to demolish the Springfield Forest. The scene was described as \"an easy shot at hard-working people whose only crime is to have been born in a timber town.\"\n\nHomer takes an interest in the \"Reading Digest\" magazine after a copy is sent to the Simpson family's residence. In the magazine, he notices an advertisement for a children's contest in which an essay must be written about what makes America great. Lisa chooses to enter, takes a trip to Springfield Forest, and is inspired to write her essay when she sees the forest's natural beauty and when an eagle lands right by the branch she is sitting under. Lisa's article is approved for entry in the national finals in Washington, D.C. after the contest judge observes Homer's poor vocabulary and realizes that he could not have written Lisa's essay for her.\n\nWhile Homer and Bart enjoy the all-expenses-paid perks of their trip, Lisa visits famous monuments for inspiration. At one particular monument, she overhears a corrupt congressman, Bob Arnold, taking a bribe from a representative of the logging industry to demolish Springfield Forest. Heartbroken and disillusioned by the dishonesty of government officials, Lisa tears up her essay and writes a more painful yet truthful essay to show the patriotic judges. The new essay, entitled \"Cesspool on the Potomac\", disdains and condemns the government system of corruption and greed, and mentions the names of those involved in the bribery. Lisa's essay causes a ruckus and elicits a hostile reaction from the judges and audience. Messages are quickly sent around the capital regarding Lisa's speech and Arnold is expelled from his job, arrested and sent to prison. Lisa's essay does not win because of its content, but with the news of the congressman's arrest and his having become a born-again Christian while in prison, her faith in government is restored, while the contest winner commends Lisa for her courage and honesty. The episode ends with Bart slingshotting the annoying pianist that performed at the contest and he tells Lisa that she was the one who inspired him to stand up for what he believes in.\n\nThe episode was written by George Meyer. It is one of \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening's favorite episodes of the earlier seasons because he thought it took the show to another level. Meyer said he has a \"deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general,\" which affected the way he wrote the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for \"The Simpsons\" since the start of the show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show. Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier. Jean said \"one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough',\" and Reiss added that \"we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this.\"\n\nWes Archer directed \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\", which was one of the first episodes to feature the Simpson family traveling to a real-life location. Because much of the episode takes place outside of Springfield, new background and character designs had to be animated. The Simpson family visits several real-life landmarks in Washington, which the animators were able to draw with the help of photographs from the animation studio's library. \"The Simpsons\" director David Silverman grew up in the Washington area so he was able to help out with the designs. Marge's voice actor, Julie Kavner, said she loved the charm of the family \"just being on a trip and experiencing the hotel room they're staying at, and the integrity of Bart's character. You know, you just want to kill him for doing all those tricks and pranks.\" Jean believes this is one of the secrets of the show's success, the fact that it is about a family and the writers can use experiences from their own or their family's life as an inspiration in their writing. He thought \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" was a perfectly constructed episode in that sense.\n\nThe title and plot of the episode is a parody of the 1939 film \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", in which the character Jefferson Smith comes to Washington with patriotic enthusiasm, but is instead shocked to see evidence of corruption in the government. \"The Tampa Tribune\"s Curtis Ross called this reference one of the best film references in \"The Simpsons\" history. Lisa's visit to the Lincoln Memorial is a direct reference to \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", in which Smith appeals to Lincoln's statue for inspiration like Lisa did in the episode. In his book \"Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era\", Barry Schwartz writes that the scene with Lisa at the crowded monument shows how \"thoroughly Lincoln's moral and emotional significance has waned.\" Mark Reinhart writes in the book \"Abraham Lincoln on Screen\" that the scene sums up \"with brilliant wit\" the American society's \"annoying and ultimately useless tendency to ask [themselves] 'What would Lincoln have done?' whenever [they] face a political or social dilemma.\" \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" was once again referenced on \"The Simpsons\" in the season fourteen episode \"Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington\".\nIn addition to the Lincoln Memorial, other Washington, D.C. landmarks visited include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel (where the family stays), the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Washington Monument. When the family visits the White House, they encounter then-First Lady Barbara Bush in the bathtub of one of the many bathrooms. Another American landmark mentioned in the episode is Mount Rushmore. In addition, Lisa proposes that the family attend the memorial of the fictional Winifred Beecher Howe, an early crusader for women's rights who later appeared on the unpopular 75-cent coins according to Lisa. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, which was only minted for three years and never became popular.\n\nThe episode makes references to several real-life persons. The piano-playing satirist who annoys Bart is a reference to Mark Russell and/or Tom Lehrer. Bob Arnold, the corrupt congressman, tells Lisa that there are quite a few women senators, but Lisa asserts that there are only two. At the time of airing there were indeed only two female senators: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Then-President George H. W. Bush is featured briefly in the episode. Shortly after it aired, Bush disparaged \"The Simpsons\" in a speech during his re-election campaign on January 27, 1992. At that point family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, so he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington: \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" As a result, Bush appeared in future episodes in a more negative light.\n\n\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" has been labeled as a satire on American politics. Michael Bitzer, in an edited book by Joseph Foy and Stanley Schultz entitled \"Homer Simpson Goes to Washington\", said this episode \"espouses the virtues, vices, and varieties of American political culture, public opinion, and ultimately the American Dream.\" Bitzer also wrote that \"The Simpsons\", through \"skillful\" use of satire, demonstrates with this episode \"insights into the underlying political culture and public opinion of the United States' governing system (and, more broadly, society at large).\" In his book \"Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization\", Paul Arthur Cantor said he was amazed by how far the episode \"willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics.\" He said it \"attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions.\" When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims \"The system works!\" Benedict Anderson wrote in the book \"The Spectre of Comparisons\" that series creator Matt Groening \"assumes that his tickled audience is confident that the system barely works [...] So why does he need to show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head? Probably because he, too, wishes to be seen as giving America another chance. Mr. Lisa guarantees his good intentions.\"\n\nGünter Beck, a lecturer for the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) at the Haifa Center for German and European Studies at the University of Haifa in Israel, compared Lisa's role in the episode to the nineteenth-century American poet and philosopher Henry David Thoreau. He writes that Lisa stands up against the public's indifference towards the political system that Thoreau criticized, and comments that the emphasis should be \"on the brave moral decision to stand up for principles and against the broad public. By this courageous act, 'to do what is right', an individual could save the well-being of the whole community. And indeed, Lisa’s bravery is the impulse for the state’s representatives to carry out their democratic obligations, so she can gladly notice 'The system works!' — her trust in democracy and its institutions is restored. Thoreau on the other hand, had no lasting trust in the system but only in the people themselves and in the individual’s capacity to realize development and democracy.\"\n\n\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 1991. The episode finished 36th in the ratings for the week of September 23–29, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 12.9, equivalent to approximately 11.9 million viewing households. \"The Simpsons\" was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"Married... with Children\" and \"In Living Color\". \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" and the episode \"When Flanders Failed\" were released on videocassette in 1999, entitled \"The Best of the Simpsons\". The episode was later included on the \"Simpsons\" season three DVD set that was released on August 26, 2003. Wes Archer, David Silverman, Matt Groening, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, and Julie Kavner participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It was named the third best episode of \"The Simpsons\" by Sarah Culp of \"The Quindecim\", and one of the ten best episodes by Jim Schembri of \"The Age\". The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised the episode for being one of the best Lisa-centric episodes, and called Lisa's talk with Thomas Jefferson and her nightmare vision of politicians as pigs \"especially worthy of note.\" Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 4.5 rating and said it is one of the best episodes featuring Lisa, \"complete with poignant observations about politics.\" He particularly enjoyed the appearance of Barbara Bush at the White House. The \"Austin American-Statesman\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Steven Stein said this was the first episode of \"The Simpsons\" he saw. Even though he did not understand half of the pop culture references, by the end of the episode he was a \"\"Simpsons\" convert.\" He thought there was \"something exotic about an issue as serious as political corruption being dealt with in a cartoon and being interrupted by jokes about beer and, yes, doughnuts.\"\n\nThe episode was praised for its political satire. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called the episode a \"biting political satire in the guise of a children's oratory contest\", that \"signifies that this season of the series will be all over the map, both emotionally and logically.\" Gibron added: \"Everything, from the \"Reader's Digest\" rants to the formulaic speeches of the youths, has a resounding ring of truth. And once the story moves to Washington D.C, our nation's capital is in for a royal reaming as well.\" Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it \"bitch slapped the Bush administration\" that would later badmouth \"The Simpsons\". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it \"has its moments but never seems like one of the series’ better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer’s obsession with \"Reading Digest\". After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall.\"\nAccording to \"The Plain Dealer\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Rodney Ferguson, the timber industry was insulted by the scene in which a timber industry lobbyist offers a bribe to the corrupt congressman so that he can demolish Springfield Forest. The Oregon Lands Coalition, a pro-timber group in Salem, Oregon, \"bombarded\" the producers of the show with phone calls and mail protesting the episode. The coalition said it portrayed loggers unfairly and is \"allowing itself to be used by environmental extremists.\" In an open letter to \"The Simpsons\" executive producer James L. Brooks, the coalition wrote: \"Rather than approach this issue with genuine concern for Mother Earth, you took an easy shot at hard-working people whose only crime is to have been born in a timber town.\" Karen Clark, a payroll clerk for a timber company in Stayton, Oregon, said: \"\"The Simpsons\" portrayed us as greedy, bribery-type people. It didn't portray us as the everyday people—mothers, fathers, good members of society—that we are.\" Luke Popovich, vice president of the American Forest Council, wrote a letter to the show's producer to protest \"the fuzzy-headed characterizations that pass for political correctness, the thinking in Hollywood where people are not very serious about these issues, but interested in pushing the right hot buttons, scoring the right points with audiences.\"\n\n\"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening responded to the criticism in an interview with \"TV Guide\", in which he said he did \"research on the ecological damage caused by clear-cutting and over-logging [and] it's really appalling.\" Jackie Lang, a timber industry activist in Salem who helped lead the protest against the Fox network and Groening, said she was appalled by Groening's response, and \"he will be sorry he ever made it.\" Jake Hogan, supervising producer of the show, defended Groening: \"[The episodes] are just little stories, little comedies—stories that make people laugh.\" On October 15, 1991, Groening issued another statement the public, in which he said: \"So now a few lumber companies have joined the nuclear power industry, right-wing preachers and high-ranking Republicans in attacking \"The Simpsons\". We must be doing something right. I must point out \"The Simpsons\" is a cartoon show—not \"60 Minutes\". Later in the show, the same lobbyist proposed drilling for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head at Mount Rushmore. Please don't tell the oil companies about this.\"\n\nDavid Reinhard of \"The Oregonian\" commented on the criticism: \"Hollywood sharpsters can always make a group from the great American hinterland look ridiculous when it zeroes in on one show, particularly if that show is a cartoon. And the Oregon Lands Coalition's protest was a bit of an overreaction. But the environmental sloganeering of \"The Simpsons\" as well as Groening's cartoon commentary are symptomatic of a Hollywood and a popular culture that are hostile to the concerns and values of most Americans.\" After the episode aired, media researchers Robert Lichter and Linda S. Lichter found in a study of prime-time television that when shows dealt with business themes, 89 percent portrayed businessmen as swindlers or liars.\n\nThe same day Groening released his second statement, \"The Simpsons\" publicist Antonia Coffman was invited by Wayne Giesy, sales manager of Hull-Oakes Lumber Co. in Bellfountain, Oregon, to visit Oregon and see \"responsible timber management.\" Giesy said they wanted to show the producers \"how we log, how we manufacture, what goods we produce for everyone and how we replant for future generations. What most timber companies are interested in is a balanced program.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "30625013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30625013", "title": "Palmolein Oil Import Scam", "text": "Palmolein Oil Import Scam\n\nThe Palm Olein Import Scam (Palm Olein Case, Palm Olein Corruption Case, 1991–92) refers to the alleged irregularities in the import of palm olein by the K. Karunakaran-led United Democratic Front government of the state of Kerala, India through the Power and Energy Limited Company. The Kerala government selected Power and Energy Limited arbitrarily without inviting tenders, allegedly at an inflated price and at an excessive service charge and in violation of central and state government procedure.\n\nThe Palmolein import scam was first brought to light officially by a report of the Accountant-General of Kerala in July 1993, a Comptroller and Auditor General report in February 1994, and subsequently by a report of the Public Undertakings Committee of the Kerala Legislative Assembly in March 1996. After a Left government came to power in May 1996, a vigilance case was registered against Karunakaran and six others on 21 March 1997. Following an inquiry, a charge sheet was submitted to the Court of the Inquiry Commissioner and Special Judge, Trivandrum, on 23 March 2001. The case dragged on, with Karunakaran filing writ petitions and appeals before the Kerala High Court and the Supreme Court of India, raising the plea of bad faiths (mala fides) and eventually obtaining a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in August 2007. The appeal remained pending before the Supreme Court of India until Karunakaran's death in December 2010.\n\nThe government of Kerala decided to import 15,000 tonnes of palm oil from Power and Energy Ltd, a Malaysian company in Singapore, at a price higher than on the open market. The price of import was fixed to USD405 per tonne, while the international market price was USD392.25 per tonne. The import order was signed by P. J. Thomas, who was then Kerala's Food Secretary. The investigation agency's charge sheet says that this order caused a loss of more than 2.32 crores to the public finances.\n\nThe opposition cried foul in the import. A vigilance case was filed against K. Karunakaran and seven others, including Thomas.A Special Leave Petition by Karunakaran made the Supreme Court of India stay the proceedings against him. The court closed the proceedings entirely against Karunakaran after his death in December 2010. Thomas was bailed in 2003. \n\nThe case was reopened in March 2011. In August 2011, Oommen Chandy, as the then Finance Minister in Karunakaran's Cabinet and the Chief Minister of Kerala, was also added to the new investigation. The court asked the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau to submit its investigation report by 10 November 2011. Chandy was the 23rd witness in the case and had been well known as the leader of the inner-party campaign launched by the A. K. Antony group within the State Congress against Karunakaran, especially on the palmolein issue during the early 1990s, when the import deal first became a controversy.\n\n\nA debate raged against Thomas heading the position as CVC and being accused in the case. On 3 February 2011, he was finally asked to quit by the Supreme Court on the grounds that he had a corruption case pending against him.\n\nOn 25 June 2013, the Kerala High Court exonerated Chandy. The verdict was in response to a petition, filed by CPI-M veteran V. S. Achuthanandan and former bureaucrat and legislator K.J. Alphonse, contesting a vigilance probe clean chit to Chandy in the 1999 case. The court dismissed a petition filed by CPI-M veteran V.S. Achuthanandan and former bureaucrat and legislator K.J. Alphonse.\n\nOn 16 February 2016, the Supreme Court rejected Achuthanandan's plea and said that he was just dragging the case to get political mileage. The judges said \"It seems you (Achuthanandan) want to keep the matter pending to score points against each other. Are you trying to fish in troubled waters? We will not allow this gameplan to continue.\"\n"}

Recent media attention has focused on efforts related to terrorists and their own attempts to conduct an online or electronic intifada - cyberterrorism. Patriot hacking is illegal in countries such as the United States yet is on the rise elsewhere. \"The FBI said that recent experience showed that an increase in international tension was mirrored in the online world with a rise in cyber activity such as web defacements and denial of service attacks,\" according to the BBC.\n\nAt the onset of the War in Iraq in 2003, the FBI was concerned about the increase in hack attacks as the intensity of the conflict grew. Since then, it has been becoming increasingly popular in the North America, Western Europe and Israel. These are the countries which have the greatest threat to Islamic terrorism and its aforementioned digital version.\n\nAround the time of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay, which was marred by unrest in Tibet, Chinese hackers claim to have hacked the websites of CNN (accused of selective reporting on the 2008 Lhasa riots) and Carrefour (a French shopping chain, allegedly supporting Tibetan independence), while websites and forums gave tutorials on how to launch a DDoS attack specifically on the CNN website.\n\nIndian hackers in 2015 took down thousands of Pakistani websites including pakistan.gov.pk and Right To Information Pakistan under the attack named as #OPvijaya under the leadership of In73ct0r d3vil. This attack is considered to be a patriotic move by Indian hackers. Government of India and India's NSA Ajit Dhoval showed support to the attack on his Twitter account.\n\n"}

As a movement, it was initiated by upper and middle class group of individuals based on the experiences gained from the rural reconstruction and development done in China during the beginning of the 1900s. After World War II, among its tasks had been the establishment of cooperatives in rural communities. It was the inspiration of the founding of the Federation of Free Farmers in 1953, as well as the birthing of organizations similar to PRRM in other countries such as Thailand, Colombia, India, and Guatemala Its main office is currently based in Quezon City., which became possible through Dr. Yen's establishment of another related organization during the 1960s, namely the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction (IIRR).\n\nIn the 1900s, the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement was founded and inspired by its then leader Dr. Y.C. James \"Jimmy\" Yen (also known as Yan Yangchu), a national of China. It was brought the Philippines, specifically in Nueva Ecija and then also in Rizal province, by Filipinos such as Conrado Benitez, a person connected to the University of the Philippines, with the vision to empowering and developing rural communities and the aim of providing training on self-government and on how such communities can sustain itself globally, nationally, and locally.\n\nApart from Conrado Benitez, original members of PRRM's Board of Trustees also included Salvador Araneta, Cornelio Balmaceda, Cecilio Putong, Juan Salcedo, Jr., Asuncion A. Perez, Gil Puyat, Paul R. Parrette, and Albino Z. Sycip. Apart from Benitez, Sycip, Putong and Salcedo, Jr., PRRM's original incorporators also included Esteban E. Abada, Eulogio Rodriguez, Jr., Roland Renne, Juan Cojuangco, Oscar B. Arellano, and Jose S. Camus.\n\nIn 1970, former Philippine Secretary of Health and Senator Dr. Juan Flavier, conveyed his experiences while working with and for PRRM by writing his book entitled \"Doctor to the Barrios\".\n\nIn 2009, PRRM became a partner of the Ayala Foundation USA, with the task of building potable water facilities within chosen Philippine barangays.\n\nAmong its present-day roles is the promotion of sustainable agriculture, technologies in the fishing business and farming, agroforestry, planning and implementation of managing resources in communities, the fight against ignorance through education, the fight against proverty through livelihood training, the fight against diseases through health education, improvement in access to justice, restoration of cohesion and connection among and between communities, creation of livelihood, environmental stewardship, awareness of public policies, and the dissemination of information to other Philippine and Asian non-governmental organizations.\n\nA core objective of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement is to build up the Conrado Benitez Institute for Sustainability (CBIS), which functions as the educational, research and technical troubleshooting wing of the PRRM. By focusing on education for sustainability through providing educational courses which cover topics such as sustainable local economy, agriculture, coastal resource management, new and renewable energy, and gender issues, CBIS aims to inculcate sustainability into the future generation.\n\nIn addition, the PRRM intends to advocate issues related to environment and sustainable development, economic development, social development and the rights of women, children and youth, and governance and citizen’s participation.\n\nOther long-term goals also include: the creation of an organization information database and the implementation of a “report card” system. The former acts as the basis for monitoring the ongoing projects and operations and the aim is to boost the efficiency of the different operations by at least 25%. While for the latter allows progress and accomplishments of ongoing projects to be recorded and reported. The PRRM aims to achieve workflow streamlining, publication exposure and quality, improved staff training and management accountability.\n\n"}

The law came into effect on 22 January 2003 when it was published in the Government Gazette of South Africa number 28075. \n\nRICA regulates the interception of communications, the monitoring of radio signals and radio frequency spectrums and the provision of communication-related information – information relating to indirect communication in the records of telecommunication service providers. \nIt also regulates applications for interception of communications and provision of communication-related information under certain circumstances. It regulates law enforcement where interception of communications is involved and prohibits the provision of telecommunication services which do not have the capability to be intercepted and requires telecommunication service providers to store communication-related information (CRI). The law specifies costs to be borne by telecommunication service providers related to these requirements and compensation to services providers. It provides for the establishment of interception centres an Office for Interception Centres and an Internet Service Providers Assistance Fund. Lastly it prohibits the manufacturing, assembling, possessing, selling, purchasing or advertising of interception equipment without a certificate of exemption issued by the relevant Minister.\n\nRICA is not limited to the provisions contained in the Act itself, but is supplemented by a directive, a notice, a schedule and four proclamations. The directive prescribed the technical and security requirements related to the interception and routing of communications and the recordal and storage of CRI. Schedule A of the Directive applies to fixed line telecommunications operators and Schedule B and C applies to mobile cellular providers and Internet service providers respectively. The various types of listed equipment is detailed in the notice while the Schedule lists serious crimes that justify interception. Finally the four proclamations deal with the enforcement dates of the Act. Since its promulgation RICA has been amended four times. Two of these amendments are already in force and two are pending. \n\nSection 14 of the Bill of Rights in the South African Constitution of 1996 expressly provide that \"everyone has a right to privacy, which includes the right not to have (...) (d) the privacy of their communications infringed\". The rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited, section 36 of the Constitution. However, various other provisions in the Bill of Rights indirectly imply a right to safety and security. If citizens have a right to security, it creates a corresponding duty on the State. Chapter 11 of the Constitution governs this duty and authorise the Police, Defence Force and Intelligence Agencies to assist the State in its security obligations. Parliament therefore attempted to balance these two conflicting rights by providing for judicial oversight and limiting interception only to those cases where a serious crime is involved.\n\nRICA provides for three main types of provisions - duties, prohibitions and procedures. The duties are directed at enabling interception, while the prohibitions are aimed at enforcing the individuals privacy right. \n\nIt is, however, neither privacy nor security that raise the most objections against RICA, but equality concerns. A recent proposed amendment to section 40 provides for preferential treatment of mobile providers by extending the enforcement of cell phone registration indefinitely.\n\nDifferent communications tools and technologies are also not subject to equal treatment in RICA. An email, for example is not subject to the onerous duty that related data (like the time, date, sender and recipient of the email) s\n\n\n"}

A Super PAC, Right to Rise is permitted to raise and spend unlimited amounts of corporate, union, and individual campaign contributions under the terms of the \"Citizens United\" Supreme Court decision. \n\nThe creation of the Super PAC was announced on January 6, 2015 by Bush. According to Bush, the name was inspired by Congressman Paul Ryan and 1996 Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp. Bush's campaign strategy would \"commence with six months of fundraising for the Right to Rise super PAC and enough muscle to push aside Mitt Romney\". Bush personally raised money for the Super PAC prior to the official announcement of his candidacy.\n\nBush officially announced his candidacy in June 2015, at which point Mike Murphy took over leadership of Right to Rise. The Bush campaign planned to leave Right to Rise in charge of television and digital advertising efforts, while the Bush campaign would take charge of voter outreach. \n\nThrough July 2015, Bush's campaign and Super PAC had raised over $114 million, which gave \"Bush a sizable financial advantage over more than a dozen GOP rivals and over Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton\". Bush rewarded top donors by inviting them to a donor retreat in Kennebunkport, hosted at his parents' estate in Walker's Point. By August 2015, Right to Rise had raised over $100 million.\n\nIn spring of 2015, donors were concerned \"that focusing so much on filling the super PAC’s coffers might leave the campaign cash-poor\"; yet the Bush campaign initially built \"out a massive campaign with ballot-access teams working every state and senior staffers earning more than $200,000 annual salaries\" and \"hired scores of policy aides\". Once Danny Diaz became the Bush campaign manager in June 2015, \"he went on a cost-cutting spree — implementing painful across-the-board cuts that affected staffers at nearly every corner of the campaign\".\n\nThe \"tens of millions of dollars in ad buys\" from Right to Rise failed to raise Bush's standing in polls, while Trump managed to generate tremendous free media exposure. Eleven of 16 major donors were also unhappy with Right to Rise's spending on the Bush campaign, including \"stays at boutique hotels featuring rooftop pools, private soirees at members-only, jacket-and-tie clubs and fundraisers at the Four Seasons, the St. Regis and the Mandarin Oriental\", private planes, and \"big spending on staff\". By contrast rival Ted Cruz resorted to cheaper options like Holiday Inn and budget airlines.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, Mike Murphy explained his strategy: \"If other campaigns wish that we’re going to uncork money on Donald Trump, they’ll be disappointed...Trump is, frankly, other people’s problem\". Later in 2015, Murphy further explained that the PAC's strategy was based on the assumption that Trump's campaign would inevitably fail, and so the PAC would instead concentrate on defeating other GOP candidates, \"candidates in our lane that we can overcome.\" However, Murphy's decision to target GOP establishment candidates Marco Rubio and Ohio Governor John Kasich, instead of Donald Trump, created dissatisfaction among some major donors to the PAC. Kasich's strategist was quoted as saying \"Their super PAC ran a tough campaign, they ran a lot of negative ads. We had to disavow some of the things that our super PAC ran, so I'm sure that Jeb Bush -- I wouldn't speak for him, clearly -- might do things differently if he was in control of his super PAC. I have no idea.\" In addition, the Super PAC's \"decision to emphasize Bush's government experience in a year when voters clearly were looking for outsider cred and a candidate who could channel anger at the establishment\" was seen as a wrong strategy.\n\nStephen F. Hayes of \"The Weekly Standard\" offered this assessment of Right to Rise in January 2016:\nTrump has had few better allies than Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting Bush's candidacy. There will be plenty of blame to go around if Trump ends up as the Republican nominee, but Right to Rise will have earned a prominent chapter in those histories...Right to Rise, like an all-pro right guard, helped clear a path for Trump by blocking several of his would-be tacklers, in particular Marco Rubio. This was no accident. It was the plan.\n\nBush ultimately suspended his run on February 20, 2016, shortly after the South Carolina primary.\n\nThis was Murphy's second time that he had managed an expensive campaign loss. Murphy's first failure was Meg Whitman's $177 million campaign where she was defeated in the 2010 California gubernatorial election by Democrat Jerry Brown who spent $36 million.\n\nThe following contributors donated over $1 million to Right to Rise.\n"}

It first appeared in Turkey in 1553.\n\nThe work was essentially a comprehensive analysis of sixty-four different persecutions that the Jewish people had suffered since antiquity. Hardly an insular text, it made use of Latin sources as well. It also had a certain anthropological value, as Ibn Verga discussed the customs and practices of Jews in various lands. Ibn Verga also sought to highlight what he felt were the faults of his people, and as such, much of his criticisms of the Jews are exaggerated for effect.\n\nIn many ways the \"Scepter of Judah\" was the first and most significant work of Jewish historiography; it was essentially the first time that such a comprehensive interest had been expressed by the Jews in their past. Ibn Verga sought to clarify the problem of anti-Jewish sentiment, which had manifested itself in the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. According to the author, the expulsion from Spain and Jewish exile in general were natural phenomena that were subject to historical forces of causation and explanation. They were not simply \"punishment\" for the sins of the Jewish people, as had been the time-honored way of explaining such misfortunes.\n\nThe text posited the view that the hatred of the Jews is a popular inheritance which is passed from generation to generation. It is occasioned by religious fanaticism (as had been the case in Spain) and is compounded by envy and jealousy; it also stems from a lack of education. Ibn Verga also suggested that there was perhaps too much flaunting of opulence amongst the Sephardim; certain festivities had been too extravagant, which had raised antagonism and jealousy amongst Catholics. Whether this was actually the case is debatable.\n\nThe \"Scepter of Judah\" was one of the most popular Jewish history books of all time, perhaps the most popular until the 19th century.\n\n"}

Hole municipality was chosen due to its massive mountain range, ideal for an underground shelter, and because of its relative proximity to the governmental offices and the Royal Palace in Oslo. The end of the Cold war marked a change in the threats against Norway, as the neighboring Soviet Union no longer existed. Seen in the light of the modern world, this facility is now in many terms outdated. Nevertheless, it is still operative and can be used if the situation should prove it necessary. During the 80s the Norwegian government built a new, smaller and more modern war headquarter in a bunker under the governmental offices in Oslo. This, though, can not accommodate a larger number of persons for a longer time.\n\nSentralanlegget has two main entrances located some three hundred meters apart. From these, tunnels lead to the facility inside the mountain. \nThe facility can accommodate 600 persons for months, and includes a hospital, restaurant/bar, communication central, conference rooms, situation room, private rooms for members of the government and the royal family and storage rooms for supplies. The facility is self-contained with power, water, air and food. It is the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning that is responsible for the daily operation of Sentralanlegget.

{"id": "4835857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4835857", "title": "Singulari Nos", "text": "Singulari Nos\n\nSingulari Nos (subtitled \"On The Errors Of Lammenais\") was an encyclical issued on June 25, 1834 by Pope Gregory XVI. Essentially a follow-up to the better-known \"Mirari Vos\" of 1832, \"Singulari Nos\" focused strongly on the views of French priest Hughes Felicité Robert de Lamennais, who did not see any contradiction between Catholicism and then-modern ideals of liberalism and the separation of Church and State.\n\nIn October 1830 Lamennais, Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire, and Charles Forbes René de Montalembert founded the newspaper, \"L'Avenir\", which advocated an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, universal freedom of conscience, instruction, assembly, and the press, views were opposed by the French bishops. Despite being warned by Archbishop Quelen of Paris that their expectations were unrealistic, they sought support from Pope Gregory XVI.\n\nAlthough pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, Pope Gregory XVI would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter. John Henry Newman described the situation in Rome at that time:The French Revolution in July, 1830, had been followed in no long time by insurrection within the papal territories; Austria intervened to reduce the revolting cities; and France took possession of Ancona to keep Austria in check. These events placed the Sovereign Pontiff between two opposite dangers; his fears from France are intelligible enough; Austria, on the other hand, had always been supposed to covet the portion of the pontifical states on the north of the Apennines; and the suspicion had been so strong in Rome, in 1821, that the government had not allowed the Austrian forces to pass through the city on their way to Naples. Whilst then the Pope was in this unpleasant dilemma, Russia, according to M. de la Mennais, stepped in and offered her aid. She alleged that she could not possibly have any interested views as regards the Italian peninsula, either revolutionary or ambitious, and she offered to place a force at the Pope's disposal to defend him against all emergencies. In return she did but ask, that the Pope would take the part of the Autocrat against Poland, and instruct the Polish Roman bishops accordingly. The offer was accepted on the specified condition.\n\nNewman noted, \"Nothing can be more discordant, less capable of a common measure, than a question of abstract religious truth, and a question of practice and matter of fact, in relation to the measures to be pursued by one secular power towards another; as discordant was the position of the Pope with that of the conductors of the Avenir.\" Circulation of Lamannais's later account (1837) of his trip to Rome, \"Affaires de Rome\", was prohibited in Prussia.\n\nIn August 1832 Gregory issued the encyclical \"Mirari vos\". General in scope, it upheld clerical celibacy, and raised concerns over too close alliances between the clergy and government. It denounced those who advocated divorce, and secret societies that sought overturn the legitimate governments of the Italian states It also denounced the views of Lemannais without specifically naming him. The encyclical satisfied neither Lamennais's supporters nor detractors.\n\nWhile Lemannais agreed to submit to the Pope in matters of faith and morals, he noticeably did not retract any of his political views. Although he ceased publication of \"L'Avenir\", Lamennais continued to be attacked by French conservatives. In 1834 he responded with a short, biting book, \"Paroles d'un croyant\" (Words of a Believer), in which he denounced all authority, civil as well as ecclesiastical. The book was a sensation. Franz Liszt dedicated the piano piece \"Lyon\" (S156 1) to Lamennais. Fyodor Dostoyevsky encouraged Alexander Milyukov to translate \"Words of a Believer\" into Church Slavonic.\n\nIn early April 1834 when the French government attempted to suppress trade union activities, silk-weavers in Lyon rose in revolt. The government responded by arresting republican sympathizers in Paris and sending the army to put down the rising.\n\nThe experience of the popes during the recent revolutions, being expelled from Rome, widespread unrest in the Papal States and temporal power to anti-Catholic forces, and the erosion of even spiritual allegiance, predisposed the reaction of the Papacy. Gregory issued Singulari Nos on June 25. \"We have learned of the pamphlet written in French under the title Paroles d'un croyant, for it has been printed by this man and disseminated everywhere. ... Though small in size, it is enormous in wickedness. ... Once the torch of treason is ignited everywhere, it ruins public order, fosters contempt of government, and stimulates lawlessness.\"We have studied the book entitled Paroles d'un croyant. By Our apostolic power, We condemn the book: ... It corrupts the people by a wicked abuse of the word of God, to dissolve the bonds of all public order and to weaken all authority. It arouses, fosters, and strengthens seditions, riots, and rebellions in the empires. We condemn the book because it contains false, calumnious, and rash propositions which lead to anarchy; which are contrary to the word of God; which are impious, scandalous, and erroneous; and which the Church already condemned...\n\nThe encyclical ends with plea for the author to recognize his errors.\n\nLamennais's brother Jean-Marie, by that time Superior General of the Mission Priests of the Immaculate Conception, repudiated \"Paroles\" and the two never met again.\n\n\"Paroles\" and Gregory's response effectively allowed no middle ground between the two positions. Few of Lamennais's associates were willing to follow him out of the Church.\n\nJ.P.T. Bury finds it ironic that the most lasting effect of Lamennais's polemics was a strengthening of Ultramontanism. He notes that Dom Prosper Guéranger, who was an early Lemannais follower, became the principal agent of a liturgical revival and a uniform Roman Liturgy. Lacordaire was instrumental in reestablishing the Dominican Order in France.\n\n"}
{"id": "47826238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47826238", "title": "Spread of Islam", "text": "Spread of Islam\n\nMuslim conquests following Muhammad's death led to the creation of the caliphates, occupying a vast geographical area; conversion to Islam was boosted by missionary activities, particularly those of Imams, who intermingled with local populations to propagate the religious teachings. These early caliphates, coupled with Muslim economics and trading and the later expansion of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in Islam's spread outwards from Mecca towards both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the creation of the Muslim world. Trading played an important role in the spread of Islam in several parts of the world, notably southeast Asia.\n\nMuslim dynasties were soon established and subsequent empires such as those of the Abbasids, Fatimids, Almoravids, Seljukids, Ajuran, Adal and Warsangali in Somalia, Mughals in India and Safavids in Persia and Ottomans in Anatolia were among the largest and most powerful in the world. The people of the Islamic world created numerous sophisticated centers of culture and science with far-reaching mercantile networks, travelers, scientists, hunters, mathematicians, doctors and philosophers, all contributing to the Golden Age of Islam. Islamic expansion in South and East Asia fostered cosmopolitan and eclectic Muslim cultures in the Indian subcontinent, Malaysia, Indonesia and China.\n\nAs of 2015, there were 2 billion Muslims, with one out of four people in the world being Muslim, making Islam the second-largest religion in the world. Out of children born from 2010 to 2015, 31% were Muslim. Babies born to Muslims are expected to outnumber those to Christians by 2035.\n\nThe expansion of the Arab Empire in the first centuries after Muhammad's death soon established Muslim dynasties in North Africa, West Africa, to the Middle East, and Somalia.\n\nWithin the century of the establishment of Islam upon the Arabian peninsula and the subsequent rapid expansion of the Arab Empire during the Muslim conquests, one of the most significant empires in world history was formed. For the subjects of this new empire, formerly subjects of the greatly reduced Byzantine, and obliterated Sassanid Empires, not much changed in practice. The objective of the conquests was mostly of a practical nature, as fertile land and water were scarce in the Arabian peninsula. A real Islamization therefore only came about in the subsequent centuries.\n\nIra Lapidus distinguishes between two separate strands of converts of the time: one is animists and polytheists of tribal societies of the Arabian peninsula and the Fertile crescent; the other one is the native Christians and Jews who existed peacefully before the Muslim invaders arrived.\n\nIslam was introduced in Somalia in the 7th century when the Muslim Arabs fled from the persecution of the Pagan Quraysh tribe. When the Muslims defeated the Pagans, some returned to Arabia, but many decided to stay there and established Muslim communities along the Somali coastline. The local Somalis adopted the Islamic faith well before the faith even took root in its place of origin.\n\nFor the polytheistic and pagan societies, apart from the religious and spiritual reasons each individual may have had, conversion to Islam \"represented the response of a tribal, pastoral population to the need for a larger framework for political and economic integration, a more stable state, and a more imaginative and encompassing moral vision to cope with the problems of a tumultuous society.\" In contrast, for sedentary and often already monotheistic societies, \"Islam was substituted for a Byzantine or Sassanian political identity and for a Christian, Jewish or Zoroastrian religious affiliation.\" Conversion initially was neither required nor necessarily wished for: \"(The Arab conquerors) did not require the conversion as much as the subordination of non-Muslim peoples. At the outset, they were hostile to conversions because new Muslims diluted the economic and status advantages of the Arabs.\"\n\nOnly in subsequent centuries, with the development of the religious doctrine of Islam and with that the understanding of the Muslim ummah, did mass conversion take place. The new understanding by the religious and political leadership in many cases led to a weakening or breakdown of the social and religious structures of parallel religious communities such as Christians and Jews.\n\nThe caliphs of the Arab dynasty established the first schools inside the empire which taught Arabic language and Islamic studies. They furthermore began the ambitious project of building mosques across the empire, many of which remain today as the most magnificent mosques in the Islamic world, such as the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. At the end of the Umayyad period, less than 10% of the people in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia and Spain were Muslim. Only on the Arabian peninsula was the proportion of Muslims among the population higher than this.\n\nExpansion ceased and the central disciplines of Islamic philosophy, theology, law and mysticism became more widespread and the gradual conversions of the populations within the empire occurred. Significant conversions also occurred beyond the extents of the empire such as that of the Turkic tribes in Central Asia and peoples living in regions south of the Sahara in Africa through contact with Muslim traders active in the area and Sufi orders. In Africa it spread along three routes, across the Sahara via trading towns such as Timbuktu, up the Nile Valley through the Sudan up to Uganda and across the Red Sea and down East Africa through settlements such as Mombasa and Zanzibar. These initial conversions were of a flexible nature.\n\nThe reasons why, by the end of the 10th century, a large part of the population had converted to Islam are diverse. According to British-Lebanese historian Albert Hourani, one of the reasons may be that\n\"Islam had become more clearly defined, and the line between Muslims and non-Muslims more sharply drawn. Muslims now lived within an elaborated system of ritual, doctrine and law clearly different from those of non-Muslims. (...) The status of Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians was more precisely defined, and in some ways it was inferior. They were regarded as the 'People of the Book', those who possessed a revealed scripture, or 'People of the Covenant', with whom compacts of protection had been made. In general they were not forced to convert, but they suffered from restrictions. They paid a special tax; they were not supposed to wear certain colors; they could not marry Muslim women;.\" \nIt should be pointed out that most of these laws were elaborations of basic laws concerning non-Muslims (\"dhimmis\") in the Quran. The Quran does not give much detail about the right conduct with non-Muslims, in principle recognizing the religion of \"People of the book\" (Jews, Christians, and sometimes others as well) and securing a separate tax from them inlieu of the zakat imposed upon Muslim subjects.\n\nIra Lapidus points towards \"interwoven terms of political and economic benefits and of a sophisticated culture and religion\" as appealing to the masses. He writes that :\n\n\"The question of why people convert to Islam has always generated intense feeling. Earlier generations of European scholars believed that conversions to Islam were made at the point of the sword, and that conquered peoples were given the choice of conversion or death. It is now apparent that conversion by force, while not unknown in Muslim countries, was, in fact, rare. Muslim conquerors ordinarily wished to dominate rather than convert, and most conversions to Islam were voluntary. (...) In most cases worldly and spiritual motives for conversion blended together. Moreover, conversion to Islam did not necessarily imply a complete turning from an old to a totally new life. While it entailed the acceptance of new religious beliefs and membership in a new religious community, most converts retained a deep attachment to the cultures and communities from which they came.\"\n\nThe result of this, he points out, can be seen in the diversity of Muslim societies today, with varying manifestations and practices of Islam.\n\nConversion to Islam also came about as a result of the breakdown of historically religiously organized societies: with the weakening of many churches, for example, and the favoring of Islam and the migration of substantial Muslim Turkish populations into the areas of Anatolia and the Balkans, the \"social and cultural relevance of Islam\" were enhanced and a large number of peoples were converted. This worked better in some areas (Anatolia) and less in others (e.g. the Balkans, where \"the spread of Islam was limited by the vitality of the Christian churches.\")\n\nAlong with the religion of Islam, the Arabic language, number system and Arab customs spread throughout the empire. A sense of unity grew among many though not all provinces, gradually forming the consciousness of a broadly Arab-Islamic population: something which was recognizably an Islamic world had emerged by the end of the 10th century. Throughout this period, as well as in the following centuries, divisions occurred between Persians and Arabs, and Sunnis and Shiites, and unrest in provinces empowered local rulers at times.\n\nThere are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as responsible for setting up the \"dhimmah\" to increase taxes from the \"dhimmis\" to benefit the Arab Muslim community financially and to discourage conversion. Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arabs and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of \"mawali\". Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues from the tax on non-Muslims.\n\nDuring the following Abbasid period an enfranchisement was experienced by the \"mawali\" and a shift was made in the political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empire and c. 930 a law was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire to be Muslims. Both periods were also marked by significant migrations of Arab tribes outwards from the Arabian Peninsula into the new territories.\n\nRichard Bulliet's \"conversion curve\" shows a relatively low rate of conversion of non-Arab subjects during the Arab centric Umayyad period of 10%, in contrast with estimates for the more politically multicultural Abbasid period which saw the Muslim population grow from approx. 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century. This theory does not explain the continuing existence of large minorities of Christians in the Abbasid Period. Other estimates suggest that Muslims were not a majority in Egypt until the mid-10th century and in the Fertile Crescent until 1100. Syria may have had a Christian majority within its modern borders until the Mongol Invasions of the 13th century.\n\nThe expansion of Islam continued in the wake of Turkic conquests of Asia Minor, the Balkans, and the Indian subcontinent. The earlier period also saw the acceleration in the rate of conversions in the Muslim heartland while in the wake of the conquests the newly conquered regions retained significant non-Muslim populations in contrast to the regions where the boundaries of the Muslim world contracted, such as Sicily and Al Andalus, where Muslim populations were expelled or forced to Christianize in short order. The latter period of this phase was marked by the Mongol invasion (particularly the siege of Baghdad in 1258) and after an initial period of persecution, the conversion of these conquerors to Islam.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire defended its frontiers initially against threats from several sides: the Safavids on the Eastern side, the Byzantine Empire in the North which vanished with the Conquest of Constantinople in 1453, and the great Catholic powers from the Mediterranean Sea: Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and Venice with its eastern Mediterranean colonies.\n\nLater, the Ottoman Empire set on to conquer territories from these rivals: Cyprus and other Greek islands (except Crete) were lost by Venice to the Ottomans, and the latter conquered territory up to the Danube basin as far as Hungary. Crete was conquered during the 17th century, but the Ottomans lost Hungary to the Holy Roman Empire, and other parts of Eastern Europe, ending with the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699.\n\nIslam has continued to spread through commerce and migrations; especially in Southeast Asia, America and Europe.\n\nAt Mecca, Muhammad is said to have received repeated embassies from Christian tribes.\n\nLike their Byzantine and late Sasanian predecessors, the Marwanid caliphs nominally ruled the various religious communities but allowed the communities' own appointed or elected officials to administer most internal affairs. Yet the Marwanids also depended heavily on the help of non-Arab administrative personnel and on administrative practices (e.g., a set of government bureaus). As the conquests slowed and the isolation of the fighters (\"muqatilah\") became less necessary, it became more and more difficult to keep Arabs garrisoned. As the tribal links that had so dominated Umayyad politics began to break down, the meaningfulness of tying non-Arab converts to Arab tribes as clients was diluted; moreover, the number of non-Muslims who wished to join the ummah was already becoming too large for this process to work effectively.\n\nThe Great Muslim army siege Jerusalem, held by the Byzantine Romans, in November, 636 CE. For four months, the siege continued. Ultimately, the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Sophronius, an ethnic Arab, agreed to surrender Jerusalem to caliph Omar in person. The caliph, then at Medina, agreed to these terms and travelled to Jerusalem to sign the capitulation in the spring of 637. Sophronius also negotiated a pact with Omar, known as the Umariyya Covenant or Covenant of Omar, allowing for religious freedom for Christians in exchange for \"jizya\", a tax to be paid by conquered non-Muslims, called \"dhimmis\". Under Muslim Rule, the Christian and Jewish population of Jerusalem in this period enjoyed the usual tolerance given to non-Muslim theists.\n\nHaving accepted the surrender, Omar then entered Jerusalem with Sophronius \"and courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious antiquities\". When the hour for his prayer came, Omar was in the Anastasis church, but refused to pray there, lest in the future Muslims should use that as an excuse to break the treaty and confiscate the church. The Mosque of Omar, opposite the doors of the Anastasis, with the tall minaret, is known as the place to which he retired for his prayer.\n\nBishop Arculf, whose account of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the 7th century, De Locis Sanctis, written down by the monk Adamnan, described reasonably pleasant living conditions of Christians in Palestine in the first period of Muslim rule. The caliphs of Damascus (661-750) were tolerant princes who were on generally good terms with their Christian subjects. Many Christians (e.g. St. John Damascene) held important offices at their court. The Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad (753-1242), as long as they ruled Syria, were also tolerant to Christians. Harun Abu-Ja-'afar (786-809), sent the keys of the Holy Sepulchre to Charlemagne, who built a hospice for Latin pilgrims near the shrine.\n\nRival dynasties and revolutions led to the eventual disunion of the Muslim world. In the 9th century, Palestine was conquered by the Shia Fatimid dynasty of North Africa. Palestine once again became a battleground as the various enemies of the Fatimids attacked. At the same time, the Byzantine Greeks continued to attempt to regain their lost territories, including Jerusalem. Christians in Jerusalem who sided with the Byzantines were put to death for high treason by the ruling shiite Muslims. In 969, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, John VII, was put to death for treasonous correspondence with the Byzantines. As Jerusalem grew in importance to Muslims and pilgrimages increased, tolerance for other religions declined. Christians were persecuted and churches destroyed. The sixth shia Fatimid caliph, Caliph Al-Hakim, 996-1021, who was believed to be \"God made manifest\" by the Druze, destroyed the Holy Sepulchre in 1009. This powerful provocation helped ignite the flame of fury that led to the First Crusade.\n\nIt used to be argued that Zoroastrianism quickly collapsed in the wake of the Islamic conquest of Persia due to its intimate ties to the Sassanid state structure. Now however, more complex processes are considered, in light of the more protracted time frame attributed to the progression of the ancient Persian religion to a minority; a progression that is more contiguous with the trends of the late antiquity period. These trends are the conversions from the state religion that had already plagued the Zoroastrian authorities that continued after the Arab conquest, coupled with the migration of Arab tribes into the region during an extended period of time that stretched well into the Abbassid reign.\n\nWhile there were cases such as the Sassanid army division at Hamra, that converted \"en masse\" before pivotal battles such as the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, conversion was fastest in the urban areas where Arab forces were garrisoned slowly leading to Zoroastrianism becoming associated with rural areas. Still at the end of the Umayyad period, the Muslim community was only a minority in the region.\n\nThrough the Muslim conquest of Persia, in the 7th century, Islam spread as far as the North Caucasus, which parts of it (notably Dagestan) were part of the Sasanid domains. In the coming centuries, relatively large parts of the Caucasus became Muslim, while the larger swaths of it would still remain pagan (paganism branches such as the Circassian \"Habze\") as well as Christian (notably Armenia and Georgia), for centuries. By the 16th century, most of the people of what are nowadays Iran and Azerbaijan had adopted the Shia branch of Islam through the conversion policies of the Safavids.\n\nIslam was readily accepted by Zoroastrians who were employed in industrial and artisan positions because, according to Zoroastrian dogma, such occupations that involved defiling fire made them impure. Moreover, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenets to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis. At times, Muslim leaders in their effort to win converts encouraged attendance at Muslim prayer with promises of money and allowed the Quran to be recited in Persian instead of Arabic so that it would be intelligible to all.\n\nA number of the inhabitants of Afghanistan accepted Islam through Umayyad missionary efforts, particularly under the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik and Umar ibn AbdulAziz. Later, starting from the 9th century, the Samanids, whose roots stemmed from Zoroastrian theocratic nobility, propagated Sunni Islam and Islamo-Persian culture deep into the heart of Central Asia. The population within its areas began firmly accepting Islam in significant numbers, notably in Taraz, now in modern-day Kazakhstan. The first complete translation of the Qur'an into Persian occurred during the reign of Samanids in the 9th century. According to historians, through the zealous missionary work of Samanid rulers, as many as 30,000 tents of Turks came to profess Islam and later under the Ghaznavids higher than 55,000 under the Hanafi school of thought. After the Saffarids and Samanids, the Ghaznavids re-conquered Transoxania, and invaded the Indian subcontinent in the 11th century. This was followed by the Ghurids and Timurids who further expanded the culture of Islam.\n\nMain articles: Arab-Byzantine Wars, Byzantine-Seljuq wars, Byzantine-Ottoman Wars.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Islam came to South Asia prior to the Muslim invasions of India. Islamic influence first came to be felt in the Indian subcontinent during the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders. Arab traders used to visit the Malabar region, which was a link between them and the ports of South East Asia to trade even before Islam had been established in Arabia. According to Historians Elliot and Dowson in their book \"The History of India as told by its own Historians\", the first ship bearing Muslim travelers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630 CE. The first Indian mosque is thought to have been built in 629 CE, purportedly at the behest of an unknown Chera dynasty ruler, during the lifetime of Muhammad (c. 571–632) in Kodungallur, in district of Thrissur, Kerala by Malik Bin Deenar. In Malabar, Muslims are called Mappila.\n\nIn Bengal, Arab merchants helped found the port of Chittagong. Sufi missionaries settled in the region as early as the 8th century.\n\nH. G. Rawlinson, in his book \"Ancient and Medieval History of India\" (), claims the first Arab Muslims settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century. This fact is corroborated, by J. Sturrock in his \"South Kanara and Madras Districts Manuals\", and also by Haridas Bhattacharya in \"Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV\".\n\nThe Arab merchants and traders became the carriers of the new religion and they propagated it wherever they went. It was however the subsequent expansion of the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent over the next millennia that established Islam in the region.\n\nEmbedded within these lies the concept of Islam as a foreign imposition and Hinduism being a natural condition of the natives who resisted, resulting the failure of the project to Islamicize the Indian subcontinent and is highly embroiled with the politics of the partition and communalism in India. These are typically represented by the following schools of thought:\n\nMuslim missionaries played a key role in the spread of Islam in India with some missionaries even assuming roles as merchants or traders. For example, in the 9th century, the Ismailis sent missionaries across Asia in all directions under various guises, often as traders, Sufis and merchants. Ismailis were instructed to speak potential converts in their own language. Some Ismaili missionaries traveled to India and employed effort to make their religion acceptable to the Hindus. For instance, they represented Ali as the tenth avatar of Vishnu and wrote hymns as well as a mahdi purana in their effort to win converts. At other times, converts were won in conjunction with the propagation efforts of rulers. According to Ibn Batuta, the Khaljis encouraged conversion to Islam by making it a custom to have the convert presented to the Sultan who would place a robe on the convert and award him with bracelets of gold. During Ikhtiyar Uddin Bakhtiyar Khilji's control of the Bengal, Muslim missionaries in India achieved their greatest success, in terms of number of converts to Islam.\n\nEven before Islam was established amongst Indonesian communities, Muslim sailors and traders had often visited the shores of modern Indonesia, most of these early sailors and merchants arrived from the Abbasid Caliphate's newly established ports of Basra and Debal, many of the earliest Muslim accounts of the region note the presence of animals such as Orang-utans, Rhinos and valuable Spice trade commodities such as Cloves, Nutmeg, Galangal and Coconut.\n\nIslam came to the Southeast Asia, first by the way of Muslim traders along the main trade-route between Asia and the Far East, then was further spread by Sufi orders and finally consolidated by the expansion of the territories of converted rulers and their communities. The first communities arose in Northern Sumatra (Aceh) and the Malacca's remained a stronghold of Islam from where it was propagated along the trade routes in the region. There is no clear indication of when Islam first came to the region, the first Muslim gravestone markings date to 1082.\n\nWhen Marco Polo visited the area in 1292 he noted that the urban port state of Perlak was Muslim, Chinese sources record the presence of a Muslim delegation to the emperor from the Kingdom of Samudra (Pasai) in 1282, other accounts provide instances of Muslim communities present in the Melayu Kingdom for the same time period while others record the presence of Muslim Chinese traders from provinces such as Fujian. The spread of Islam generally followed the trade routes east through the primarily Buddhist region and a half century later in the Malacca's we see the first dynasty arise in the form of the Sultanate of Malacca at the far end of the Archipelago form by the conversion of one Parameswara Dewa Shah into a Muslim and the adoption of the name Muhammad Iskandar Shah after his marriage to a daughter of the ruler of Pasai.\n\nIn 1380, Sufi orders carried Islam from here on to Mindanao. Java was the seat of the primary kingdom of the region, the Majapahit Empire, which was ruled by a Hindu dynasty. As commerce grew in the region with the rest of the Muslim world, Islamic influence extended to the court even as the empires political power waned and so by the time Raja Kertawijaya converted in 1475 at the hands of Sufi Sheikh Rahmat, the Sultanate was already of a Muslim character.\n\nAnother driving force for the change of the ruling class in the region was the concept among the increasing Muslim communities of the region when ruling dynasties to attempt to forge such ties of kinship by marriage. By the time the colonial powers and their missionaries arrived in the 17th century the region up to New Guinea was overwhelmingly Muslim with animist minorities.\n\nIn the mid 7th century AD, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into areas that would later become part of European Russia. A centuries later example that can be counted amongst the earliest introductions of Islam into Eastern Europe came about through the work of an early 11th-century Muslim prisoner whom the Byzantines captured during one of their wars against Muslims. The Muslim prisoner was brought into the territory of the Pechenegs, where he taught and converted individuals to Islam. Little is known about the timeline of the Islamization of Inner Asia and of the Turkic peoples who lay beyond the bounds of the caliphate. Around the 7th and 8th centuries some states of Turkic peoples existed - like the Turkic Khazar Khaganate (see \"Khazar-Arab Wars\") and the Turkic Turgesh Khaganate, which fought against the caliphate in order to stop Arabization and Islamization in Asia. From the 9th century onwards, the Turks (at least individually, if not yet through adoption by their states) began to convert to Islam. Histories merely note the fact of pre-Mongol Central Asia's Islamization. The Bulgars of the Volga (to whom the modern Volga Tatars trace their Islamic roots) adopted Islam by the 10th century. under Almış. When the Franciscan friar William of Rubruck visited the encampment of Batu Khan of the Golden Horde, who had recently (in the 1240s) completed the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria, he noted \"I wonder what devil carried the law of Machomet there\".\n\nAnother contemporary institution identified as Muslim, the Qarakhanid dynasty of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, operated much further east, established by Karluks who became Islamized after converting under Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan in the mid-10th century. However, the modern-day history of the Islamization of the region - or rather a conscious affiliation with Islam - dates to the reign of the \"ulus\" of the son of Genghis Khan, Jochi, who founded the Golden Horde, which operated from the 1240s to 1502. Kazakhs, Uzbeks and some Muslim populations of the Russian Federation trace their Islamic roots to the Golden Horde and while Berke Khan became the first Mongol monarch to officially adopt Islam and even to oppose his kinsman Hulagu Khan in the defense of Jerusalem at the Battle of Ain Jalut (1263), only much later did the change became pivotal when the Mongols converted \"en masse\" when a century later Uzbeg Khan (lived 1282-1341) converted - reportedly at the hands of the Sufi Saint Baba Tukles.\n\nSome of the Mongolian tribes became Islamized. Following the brutal Mongol invasion of Central Asia under Hulagu Khan and after the Battle of Baghdad (1258), Mongol rule extended across the breadth of almost all Muslim lands in Asia. The Mongols destroyed the caliphate and persecuted Islam, replacing it with Buddhism as the official state religion. In 1295 however, the new Khan of the Ilkhanate, Ghazan, converted to Islam, and two decades later the Golden Horde under Uzbeg Khan (reigned 1313-1341) followed suit. The Mongols had been religiously and culturally conquered; this absorption ushered in a new age of Mongol-Islamic synthesis that shaped the further spread of Islam in central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn the 1330s, the Mongol ruler of the Chagatai Khanate (in Central Asia) converted to Islam, causing the eastern part of his realm (called Moghulistan) to rebel. However, during the next three centuries these Buddhist, Shamanistic and Christian Turkic and Mongol nomads of the Kazakh Steppe and Xinjiang would also convert at the hands of competing Sufi orders from both east and west of the Pamirs. The Naqshbandis are the most prominent of these orders, especially in Kashgaria, where the western Chagatai Khan was also a disciple of the order.\n\nIn Egypt, the victorious Muslims granted religious freedom to the Christian community in Alexandria, for example, and the Alexandrians quickly recalled their exiled Monophysite patriarch to rule over them, subject only to the ultimate political authority of the conquerors. In such a fashion the city persisted as a religious community under an Arab Muslim domination more welcome and more tolerant than that of Byzantium.\n\nByzantine rule was ended by the Arabs, who invaded Tunisia from 647-648 and Morocco in 682 in the course of their drive to expand the power of Islam. In 670, the Arab general and conqueror Uqba Ibn Nafi established the city of Kairouan (in Tunisia) and its Great Mosque also known as the Mosque of Uqba; the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the ancestor of all the mosques in the western Islamic world. Berber troops were used extensively by the Arabs in their conquest of Spain, which began in 711.\n\nNo previous conqueror had tried to assimilate the Berbers, but the Arabs quickly converted them and enlisted their aid in further conquests. Without their help, for example, Andalusia could never have been incorporated into the Islamic state. At first only Berbers nearer the coast were involved, but by the 11th century Muslim affiliation had begun to spread far into the Sahara.\n\nThe conventional historical view is that the conquest of North Africa by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate between CE 647–709 effectively ended Catholicism in Africa for several centuries. However, new scholarship has appeared that provides more nuance and details of the conversion of the Christian inhabitants to Islam. A Christian community is recorded in 1114 in Qal'a in central Algeria. There is also evidence of religious pilgrimages after 850 CE to tombs of Catholic saints outside of the city of Carthage, and evidence of religious contacts with Christians of Arab Spain. In addition, calendar reforms adopted in Europe at this time were disseminated amongst the indigenous Christians of Tunis, which would have not been possible had there been an absence of contact with Rome. During the reign of Umar II, the then governor of Africa, Ismail ibn Abdullah, was said to have won the Berbers to Islam by his just administration, and other early notable missionaries include Abdallah ibn Yasin who started a movement which caused thousands of Berbers to accept Islam.\n\nThe history of commercial and intellectual contact between the inhabitants of the Somali coast and the Arabian Peninsula may help explain the Somali people's connection with Muhammad. The early Muslims fled to the port city of Zeila in modern-day northern Somalia to seek protection from the Quraysh at the court of the Aksumite Emperor in present-day Ethiopia. Some of the Muslims that were granted protection are said to have then settled in several parts of the Horn region to promote the religion. The victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had then all adopted Islam, and the major trading routes in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea came under the sway of the Muslim Caliphs. Through commerce, Islam spread amongst the Somali population in the coastal cities. Instability in the Arabian peninsula saw further migrations of early Muslim families to the Somali seaboard. These clans came to serve as catalysts, forwarding the faith to large parts of the Horn region.\n\nOn the east coast of Africa, where Arab mariners had for many years journeyed to trade, mainly in slaves, Arabs founded permanent colonies on the offshore islands, especially on Zanzibar, in the 9th and 10th century. From there Arab trade routes into the interior of Africa helped the slow acceptance of Islam.\n\nBy the 10th century, the Kilwa Sultanate was founded by Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi (was one of seven sons of a ruler of Shiraz, Persia, his mother an Abyssinian slave girl. Upon his father's death, Ali was driven out of his inheritance by his brothers). His successors would rule the most powerful of Sultanates in the Swahili coast, during the peak of its expansion the Kilwa Sultanate stretched from Inhambane in the south to Malindi in the north. The 13th-century Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta noted that the great mosque of Kilwa Kisiwani was made of coral stone (the only one of its kind in the world).\n\nIn the 20th century, Islam grew in Africa both by birth and by conversion. The number of Muslims in Africa grew from 34.5 million in 1900 to 315 million in 2000, going from roughly 20% to 40% of the total population of Africa. However, in the same time period, the number of Christians also grew in Africa, from 8.7 million in 1900 to 346 million in 2000, surpassing both the total population as well as the growth rate of Islam on the continent.\n\nThe spread of Islam in Africa began in the 7th to 9th century, brought to North Africa initially under the Umayyad Dynasty. Extensive trade networks throughout North and West Africa created a medium through which Islam spread peacefully, initially through the merchant class. By sharing a common religion and a common transliteralization (Arabic), traders showed greater willingness to trust, and therefore invest, in one another. Moreover, toward the 18th century, the Nigeria based Sokoto Caliphate led by Usman dan Fodio exerted considerable effort in spreading Islam.\n\nTariq ibn Ziyad was a Muslim general who led the Islamic conquest of Visigothic Hispania in 711-718 A.D. He is considered to be one of the most important military commanders in Iberian history. The name \"Gibraltar\" is the Spanish derivation of the Arabic name \"Jabal Tāriq\" () (meaning \"mountain of Tariq\"), named after him.\n\nThere are accounts of the trade connections between the Muslims and the Rus, apparently Vikings who made their way towards the Black Sea through Central Russia. On his way to Volga Bulgaria, Ibn Fadlan brought detailed reports of the Rus, claiming that some had converted to Islam.\n\nAccording to the historian Yaqut al-Hamawi, the Böszörmény (\"Izmaelita or \"IsmailiNizari\") denomination of the Muslims who lived in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 10th to 13th centuries, were employed as mercenaries by the kings of Hungary.\n\nThe history of Arab and Islamic rule in the Iberian peninsula is probably one of the most studied periods of European history. For centuries after the Arab conquest, European accounts of Arab rule in Iberia were negative. European points of view started changing with the Protestant Reformation, which resulted in new descriptions of the period of Islamic rule in Spain as a \"golden age\" (mostly as a reaction against Spain's militant Roman Catholicism after 1500).\n\nThe tide of Arab expansion after 630 rolled through North Africa up to Ceuta in present-day Morocco. Their arrival coincided with a period of political weakness in the three centuries old kingdom established in the Iberian peninsula by the Germanic Visigoths, who had taken over the region after seven centuries of Roman rule. Seizing the opportunity, an Arab-led (but mostly Berber) army invaded in 711, and by 720 had conquered the southern and central regions of the peninsula. The Arab expansion pushed over the mountains into southern France, and for a short period Arabs controlled the old Visigothic province of Septimania (centered on present-day Narbonne). The Arab Caliphate was pushed back by Charles Martel (King of the Franks or French) at Poitiers, and Christian armies started pushing southwards over the mountains, until Charlemagne established in 801 the Spanish March (which stretched from Barcelona to present day Navarre).\n\nA major development in the history of Muslim Spain was the dynastic change in 750 in the Arab Caliphate, when an Umayyad Prince escaped the slaughter of his family in Damascus, fled to Cordoba in Spain, and created a new Islamic state in the area. This was the start of a distinctly Spanish Muslim society, where large Christian and Jewish populations coexisted with an increasing percentage of Muslims. There are many stories of descendants of Visigothic chieftains and Roman counts whose families converted to Islam during this period. The at-first small Muslim elite continued to grow with converts, and with a few exceptions, rulers in Islamic Spain allowed Christians and Jews the right specified in the Koran to practice their own religions, though non-Muslims suffered from political and taxation inequities. The net result was, in those areas of Spain where Muslim rule lasted the longest, the creation of a society that was mostly Arabic-speaking because of the assimilation of native inhabitants, a process in some ways similar to the assimilation many years later of millions of immigrants to the United States into English-speaking culture. At the descendants of Visigoths and Hispano-Romans concentrated in the north of the peninsula, in the kingdoms of Asturias/Leon, Navarre and Aragon and started a long campaign known as the 'Reconquista' which started with the victory of the Christian armies in Covadonga in 722. Military campaigns continued without pause. In 1085 Alfonso VI of Castille took back Toledo. In 1212 the crucial Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa meant the recovery of the bulk of the peninsula for the Christian kingdoms. In 1238 James I of Aragon took Valencia. In 1236 the ancient Roman city of Cordoba was re-conquered by Ferdinand III of Castille and in 1248 the city of Seville. The famous medieval epic poem 'Cantar de Mio Cid' narrates the life and deeds of this hero during the Reconquista.\n\nThe Islamic state centered in Cordoba had ended up splintering into many smaller kingdoms (the so-called taifas). While Muslim Spain was fragmenting, the Christian kingdoms grew larger and stronger, and the balance of power shifted against the 'Taifa' kingdoms. The last Muslim kingdom of Granada in the south was finally taken in 1492 by Queen Isabelle of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon. In 1499, the remaining Muslim inhabitants were ordered to convert or leave (at the same time the Jews were expelled). Poorer Muslims (Moriscos) who could not afford to leave ended up converting to Catholic Christianity and hiding their Muslim practices, hiding from the Spanish Inquisition, until their presence was finally extinguished.\n\nIn Balkan history, historical writing on the topic of conversion to Islam was, and still is, a highly charged political issue. It is intrinsically linked to the issues of formation of national identities and rival territorial claims of the Balkan states. The generally accepted nationalist discourse of the current Balkan historiography defines all forms of Islamization as results of the Ottoman government's centrally organized policy of conversion or \"dawah\". The truth is that Islamization in each Balkan country took place in the course of many centuries, and its nature and phase was determined not by the Ottoman government but by the specific conditions of each locality. Ottoman conquests were initially military and economic enterprises, and religious conversions were not their primary objective. True, the statements surrounding victories all celebrated the incorporation of territory into Muslim domains, but the actual Ottoman focus was on taxation and making the realms productive, and a religious campaign would have disrupted that economic objective.\n\nOttoman Islamic standards of toleration allowed for autonomous \"nations\" (\"millets\") in the Empire, under their own personal law and under the rule of their own religious leaders. As a result, vast areas of the Balkans remained mostly Christian during the period of Ottoman domination. In fact, the Eastern Orthodox Churches had a higher position in the Ottoman Empire, mainly because the Patriarch resided in Istanbul and was an officer of the Ottoman Empire. In contrast, Roman Catholics, while tolerated, were suspected of loyalty to a foreign power (the Papacy). It is no surprise that the Roman Catholic areas of Bosnia, Kosovo and northern Albania, ended up with more substantial conversions to Islam. The defeat of the Ottomans in 1699 by the Austrians resulted in their loss of Hungary and present-day Croatia. The remaining Muslim converts in both elected to leave \"lands of unbelief\" and moved to territory still under the Ottomans. Around this point in time, new European ideas of romantic nationalism started to seep into the Empire, and provided the intellectual foundation for new nationalistic ideologies and the reinforcement of the self-image of many Christian groups as subjugated peoples.\nAs a rule, the Ottomans did not require followers of Greek Orthodoxy to become Muslims, although many did so in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule \nOne by one, the Balkan nationalities asserted their independence from the Empire, and frequently the presence of members of the same ethnicity who had converted to Islam presented a problem from the point of view of the now dominant new national ideology, which narrowly defined the nation as members of the local dominant Orthodox Christian denomination. Some Muslims in the Balkans chose to leave, while many others were forcefully expelled to what was left of the Ottoman Empire. This demographic transition can be illustrated by the decrease in the number of mosques in Belgrade, from over 70 in 1750 (before Serbian independence in 1815), to only three in 1850.\n\nSince the 1960s, many Muslims have migrated to Western Europe. They have come as immigrants, guest workers, asylum seekers or as part of family reunification. As a result, Muslim population in Europe has steadily risen.\n\nThe writer Bat Ye'or stated in her book \"Eurabia\" that Muslims may become a majority within a few generations due to continued immigration and high birth rates. This theory has been criticized, however. Many suggest the claims are built on unreliable claims and that fertility rates of Muslims will eventually decrease and that immigration to European nations could be limited.\nA Pew Forum study, published in January 2011, forecast an increase of proportion of Muslims in European population from 6% in 2010 to 8% in 2030.\n\n\n"}

Structural inequality occurs when the fabric of organizations, institutions, governments or social networks contains an embedded bias which provides advantages for some members and marginalizes or produces disadvantages for other members. This can involve property rights, status, or unequal access to health care, housing, education and other physical or financial resources or opportunities. Structural inequality is believed to be an embedded part of the culture of the United States due to the history of slavery and the subsequent suppression of equal civil rights of minority races. Structural inequality has been encouraged and maintained in the society of the United States through structured institutions such as the public school system with the goal of maintaining the existing structure of wealth, employment opportunities, and social standing of the races by keeping minority students from high academic achievement in high school and college as well as in the workforce of the country. In the attempt to equalize allocation of state funding, policymakers evaluate the elements of disparity to determine an equalization of funding throughout school districts.p.(14) Policymakers have to determine a formula based of per-pupil revenue and the student need.p.(8) Critical race theory is part of the ongoing oppression of minorities in the public school system and the corporate workforce that limits academic and career success. The public school system maintains structural inequality through such practices as tracking of students, standardized assessment tests, and a teaching force that does not represent the diversity of the student body. Also see social inequality, racism, discrimination, and oppression. Social inequality occurs when certain groups in a society do not have equal social status. Aspects of social status involve property rights, voting rights, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, access to health care, and education as well as many other social commodities.\n\nEducation is the base for equality. Specifically in the structuring of schools, the concept of tracking is believed by some scholars to create a social disparity in providing students an equal education. Schools have been found to have a unique acculturative process that helps to pattern self-perceptions and world views. Schools not only provide education but also a setting for students to develop into adults, form future social status and roles, and maintain social and organizational structures of society. Tracking is an educational term that indicates where students will be placed during their secondary school years. \"Depending on how early students are separated into these tracks, determines the difficulty in changing from one track to another\" (Grob, 2003, p. 202).\n\nTracking or sorting categorizes students into different groups based on standardized test scores. These groups or tracks are vocational, general, and academic. Students are sorted into groups that will determine educational and vocational outcomes for the future. The sorting that occurs in the educational system parallels the hierarchical social and economic structures in society. Thus, students are viewed and treated differently according to their individual track. Each track has a designed curriculum that is meant to fit the unique educational and social needs of each sorted group. Consequently, the information taught as well as the expectations of the teachers differ based on the track resulting in the creation of dissimilar classroom cultures.\n\nNot only the classes that students take, but the school they are enrolled in has been shown to have an effect on their educational success and social mobility, especially ability to graduate from college. Simply being enrolled in a school with less access to resources, or in an area with a high concentration of racial minorities, makes one much less likely to gain access to prestigious four-year colleges. For example, there are far fewer first time freshmen within the University of California (UC) system who graduate from schools where the majority population is an underrepresented racial minority group. Students from these schools comprise only 22.1% of the first time freshmen within the UC system, whereas students from majority white schools make up 65.3% of the first time freshman population. At more prestigious schools, like UC Berkeley, the division is even more pronounced. Only 15.2% of first time freshmen who attend the university came from schools with a high percentage of underrepresented minorities.\n\nIssues of structural inequality are probably also at fault for the low numbers of students from underserved backgrounds graduating from college. Out of the entire population of low-income youth in the US, only 13% receive a bachelor's degree by the time they are 28. Students from racial minorities are similarly disadvantaged. Hispanic students are half as likely to attend college than white students and black students are 25% less likely. Despite increased attention and educational reform, this gap has increased in the past 30 years.\n\nThe costs required to attend college also contribute to the structural inequality in education. The higher educational system in the United States relies on public funding to support the universities. However, even with the public funding, policymakers have voiced their desire to have universities become less dependent on government funding and to compete for other sources of funding. The result of this could sway many students from low-income backgrounds from attending higher institutions due to the inability of paying to attend. In a 2013 study by the National Center for Educational Statistics, only 49% of students from low-income families that graduated from high school immediately enrolled into college. In comparison, students from high-income families had an 80%immediate college enrollment rate. Furthermore, in another 2013 report, over 58% of low-income families were minorities. In the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supported survey, researchers discovered that 6 in 10 students that dropped out was due to the inability to pay for the cost of attending themselves and without help from their families.\n\nGaps in the availability of technology, the digital divide, are gradually decreasing as more people purchase home computers and the ratio of students to computers within schools continues to decreases. However, inequities in access to technology still exist due to the lack of teacher training and, subsequently, confidence in use of technologic tools; the diverse needs of students; and administrative pressures to increase test scores. These inequities are noticeably different between high need (HN) and low need (LN) populations. In a survey of teachers participating in an e-Learning for Educators online professional development workshop, Chapman finds that HN schools need increased access and teacher training in technology resources. Though results vary in their level of significance, teachers of non-HN schools report more confidence in having adequate technical abilities to simply participate in the workshop; later surveys showed that teachers of HN schools report that \"they use, or will use, technology in the classroom more after the workshop\" less likely that that of teachers of non-HN schools. Additionally, teachers from HN schools report less access to technology as well as lower technical skills and abilities (p. 246). Even when teachers in low-SES schools had confidence in their technical skills, other they faced other obstacles, including larger numbers of English language learners and at-risk students, larger numbers of students with limited computer experience, and greater pressure to increase test scores and adhere to policy mandates.\n\nOther structural inequalities in access to technology exist in differences in the ratio of students to computers within public schools. Correlations show that as the number of minorities enrolled in a school increase so, too, does the ratio of students to computers, 4.0:1 in schools with 50% or more minority enrollment versus 3.1 in schools with 6% or less minority enrollment (as cited in Warschauer, 2010, p. 188-189). Within school structures, low-socioeconomic status (SES) schools tended to have less stable teaching staff, administrative staff, and IT support staff, which contributed to teachers being less likely to incorporate technology in their curriculum for lack of support.\n\nThe challenge of the new millennium will include a realignment in focus to include \"the curriculum as disabled, rather than students, their insights in translating principles of universal design, which originated in architecture, to education commensurate with advances characterized as a major paradigm shift.\"\n\nAccording to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), children with disabilities have the right to a free appropriate public education in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). The LRE means that children with disabilities must be educated in regular classrooms with their non-disabled peers with the appropriate supports and services.\n\nAn individual with a disability is also protected under American with Disabilities Act (ADA) which is defined as any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Assistive technology which supports individuals with disabilities covering a wide range of areas from cognitive to physical limitations, plays an important role.\n\nSchool finance is another area where social injustice and inequality might exist. Districts in wealthier areas typically receive more Average Daily Attendance (ADA) funds for total (e.g. restricted and unrestricted) expenditures per pupil than socio-economically disadvantaged districts, therefore, a wealthier school district will receive more funding than a socio-economically disadvantaged school district. \"Most U.S. schools are underfunded. Schools in low wealth states and districts are especially hard hit, with inadequate instructional materials, little technology, unsafe buildings, and less-qualified teachers\" (p. 31) The method in which funds are distributed or allocated within a school district can also be of concern. De facto segregation can occur in districts or educational organizations that passively promote racial segregation. Epstein (2006) stated the \"Two years after the victorious Supreme Court decision against segregation, Oakland's\"... \"school board increased Oakland's segregation by spending $40 million from a bond election to build...\" a \"... High School, and then establishing a ten-mile long, two-mile wide attendance boundary, which effectively excluded almost every black and Latino student in the city\" (p. 28).\n\nSince the early 19th Century policymakers have developed a puta of educational program, each which its own particular structural inequality. The mechanisms involved in the allocation of state funding have changed significantly over time. In the past, public schools were primarily funded by property taxes. Funding was supplemented by other state sources. In the early 19th century, policymakers recognized districts relying on property tax could lead to significant disparities in the amount of funding per student.\n\nThus, policymakers began to analyze the elements of disparity and sought means to address it, numbers of teachers, quality of facilities and materials. To address disparity some states implemented Flat Grants, which typically allocate funding based on the number of teachers. However, this often magnified the disparity, since wealthy communities would have fewer students per teacher.\n\nIn their attempt to reduce disparity policymakers in 1920 designed what they call the Foundation Program. The stated purpose was to equalize per-pupil revenue across districts. The goal was achieved by setting a target per-pupil revenue level, and the state supplying funding to equalize revenue in underserved districts. Some analyst characterized the program as a hoax because its structure allowed wealthier districts to exceed the target per-pupil revenue level.\n\nAlso in order to aid persons with categories of issues, policymakers designed Categorical Programs. The purpose of these programs are to target disparity in poor districts, which do not take into account district wealth. Overtime, policymakers began to allocate funding that takes into consideration pupil needs along with the wealth of the district.\n\nAn identified inequality that negatively affects health and wellness among minority races is highly correlated with income, wealth, social capital, and, indirectly, education. Researchers have been able to identify significant gaps that exist in mortality rates of African Americans and Caucasian Americans. There has not been significant changes in the major factors of income, wealth, social capital/psycho-social environment, and socioeconomic status, that positively impact the existing inequality. Studies have noted significant correlations between these factors and major health issues. For example, poor socioeconomic status is strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhen discussing the issue of structural inequality we must also consider how hegemonic social structures can support institutional and technological inequalities. In the realm of education studies have suggested that the level of educational attainment for a parent will influence the levels of educational attainment for said parents child. The level of education which one receives also tends to be correlated with social capital, income, and criminal activity as well. These findings suggest that by simply being the child of someone who is well educated places the child in an advantageous position. This in turn means that the children of new migrants and other groups who have historically been less educated and have significantly less resources at their disposal will be less likely to achieve higher levels of education. Because education plays a role in income, social capital, criminal activity and even the educational attainment of others it becomes possible that a positive feedback loop where the lack of education will perpetuate itself throughout a social class or group.\n\nThe outcomes can be highly problematic at the K-12 level as well. Looking back to school funding we see that when the majority of funding has to come from local school districts and this leads to poorer districts being less adequately funded than wealthier districts. This means that the children who attend these schools which will struggle to provide a quality education with fewer students per teacher, less access to technology and tend to be unable to prepare students for selecting and attending college or university. When these students who were unprepared to attend higher education fail to do so they are less likely to encourage their own children to pursue higher education and more likely to be poorer. Then these individuals will live in traditionally poorer neighborhoods, thus sending their children to underfunded schools ill prepared to gear students towards higher education and further perpetuate a cycle of poor districts and disadvantaged social groups.\n\nThe structural inequality of tracking in the educational system is the foundation of the inequalities instituted in other social and organizational structures. Tracking is a term in the educational vernacular that determines where students will be placed during their secondary school years. Traditionally, the most tracked subjects are math and English. Students are categorized into different groups based on their standardized test scores. Tracking is justified by the following four assumptions:\n\n\nRace, ethnicity, and socio-economic class limits exposure to advanced academic knowledge thus limiting advanced educational opportunities. A disproportionate number of minority students are placed in low track courses. The content of low track courses are markedly different. Low and average track students typically have limited exposure to \"high-status\" academic material, thus, the possibility of academic achievement and subsequent success is significantly limited. The tracking phenomenon in schools tends to perpetuate prejudices, misconceptions, and inequalities of the poor and minority people in society. Schools provide both an education and a setting for students to develop into adults, form future societal roles, and maintain social and organizational structures of society. Tracking in the public educational system parallels the hierarchical social and economic structures in society. Schools have a unique acculturative process that helps to pattern self-perceptions and world views. The expectations of the teachers and information taught differ based on tracks. Thus, dissimilar classroom cultures, different dissemination of knowledge, and unequal education opportunities are created.\n\nThe cycle of academic tracking and oppression of minority races is dependent on the use of standardized testing. IQ tests are frequently the foundation that determines an individual's group placement. However, accuracy of IQ tests has been found by research to be flawed. Tests, by design, only indicate a student's placement along a high to low continuum and not their actual achievement. The tests have also been found to be culturally biased, therefore, language and experience differences affects test outcomes with lower-class and minority children consistently having lower scores. This leads to inaccurate judgements of students' abilities.\n\nStandardized tests were developed by eugenicists to determine who would best fill societal roles and professions. Tests were originally designed to verify the intellectuals of British society. This original intent unconsciously began the sorting dynamic. Tests were used to assist societies to fill important roles. In America, standardized tests were designed to sort students based on responses to test questions that were and are racially biased. These tests do not factor in the experiential and cultural knowledge or general ability of the students. Students are placed in vocational, general, or academic tracks based on test scores. Students' futures are determined by tracks and they are viewed and treated differently according to their individual track. Tracks are hierarchical in nature and create, consciously for some and unconsciously for others, the damaging effects of labeling students as fast or slow; bright or special education; average or below average.\n\nCorporate America has an interest in maintaining the use of standardized tests in public school systems thus protecting their potential future workforce that will be derived from the high-tracked, successful high income students by eliminating, through poor academic achievement, a disproportionate number of minority students. Also, standardized testing is big business. Although it is often argued that standardized testing is an economical method to evaluate students, the real cost is staggering, estimated at $20 billion annually in indirect and direct costs, an amount that does not factor in the social and emotional costs.\n\nStandardized tests remain a frequently used and expected evaluative method for a variety of reasons. The American culture is interested in intelligence and potential. Standardized testing also provides an economic advantage to some stakeholders, such as prestigious universities, that use standardized test numbers as part of their marketing plan. Finally, standardized testing maintains the status quo of the established social system.\n\nTeacher and counselor judgements have been shown to be just as inaccurate as standardized tests. Teachers and counselors may have a large number of students for which they are responsible for analyzing and making recommendations. Research has found that factors such as appearance, language, behavior, grooming, as well as academic potential, are all considered in the analysis and decision on group placement. This leads to a disproportionate number of lower and minority children placed unfairly into lower track groups.\n\nTeacher diversity is limited by policies that create often-unattainable requirements for bilingual instructors. For example, bilingual instructors may be unable to pass basic educational skills tests because of the inability to write rapidly enough to complete the essay portions of the tests. Limiting resources, in the form of providing primarily English speaking teachers, for bilingual or English as a second language student, limits the learning simply by restricting dissemination of knowledge. Restructuring the educational system, as well as, encouraging prospective bilingual teachers are two of the ways to ensure diversity among the teaching workforce, increase the distribution of knowledge, and increase the potential and continued academic success of minority students.\n\nPossible solutions to tracking and standardized testing:\n\n"}
{"id": "34564244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34564244", "title": "Theory of fundamental causes", "text": "Theory of fundamental causes\n\nIn 1995, Jo C. Phelan and Bruce G. Link developed the theory of fundamental causes. This theory seeks to outline why the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and health disparities has persisted over time, particularly when diseases and conditions previously thought to cause morbidity and mortality among low SES individuals have resolved. The theory states that an ongoing association exists between SES and health status because SES \"embodies an array of resources, such as money, knowledge, prestige, power, and beneficial social connections that protect health no matter what mechanisms are relevant at any given time.\" In other words, despite advances in screening techniques, vaccinations, or any other piece of health technology or knowledge, the underlying fact is that those from low SES communities lack resources to protect and/or improve their health.\n\nAccording to Link and Phelan, a fundamental social cause of health inequalities has four key components:\n\nBy these criteria, SES is a fundamental cause for healthcare disparities.\n\nIn the 19th century, the major causes of mortality were typically infectious diseases, as well as diseases that resulted from poor sanitation and crowded living conditions. In 1900, the top three causes of death were pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrhea. These conditions have been largely eradicated thanks to the development of antibiotics, vaccinations, sewage management systems, and improved education regarding sanitation and food handling. Because lower SES individuals were more likely to live in crowded, unsanitary conditions, it was thought that the improvement of these conditions would lead to an improvement in health. However, disparities in healthcare and health outcomes have persisted.\n\nHealth has been linked to social class dating back to the early 19th century, when the French tracked mortality in connection with areas of poverty. Similarly, the English began documenting mortality by occupation in the mid-1800s. In the United States, more attention was paid to racial connections to health disparities up until 1973, when Evelyn M. Kitagawa and Philip Hauser published a report connecting SES to increased morbidity and mortality.\n\nLink and Phelan state that the key resources that lower SES individuals lack include knowledge, money, power, prestige, and beneficial social connections. At a given SES level, this lack of resources persists despite what other factors, beneficial or not so, are at play.\n\nKnowledge primarily includes health literacy, but may also involve the knowledge that is gained via access to physicians and the medical establishment. Health literacy can be defined as \"the knowledge and competencies of persons to meet the complex demands of health in society.\" While previously health literacy was defined as the ability to read materials in a medical context, the definition has evolved to include more than simply the ability to read. It now encompasses a broad range of skills and activities that decrease the asymmetry of information in the health care marketplace.\n\nThe relationship between money and health is linear with a positive slope; that is, the more money a person has, the better their health, with some exceptions. At a basic level, income enables people to access and pay for health care when it is necessary or to purchase health insurance. Beyond this, money also provides the ability to fund healthy choices, including purchasing nutritious food, a gym membership, and medications. On an even larger scale, it provides the ability to make adaptations to the work or residential environment, e.g., changing jobs, relocating to a safer neighborhood, or retiring from work at the time of one's choosing. Each of these factors demonstrate that finances play a key role in health decisions and overall health.\n\nIn the context of health care and access, power is the ability to exert one's influence to effect change on the behalf of oneself or others. Prestige is the \"reputation or influence arising from success, achievement, rank, or other favorable attributes.\" Power and prestige are factors in determining a person's place in the social hierarchy, and they manifest themselves in multiple ways. One is power and prestige in the workplace. Those with power in their jobs are able to take days off of work for leisure or to access medical care. According to the Whitehall Studies, a gradient was observed across all levels of employment, with those wielding the greatest amount of power in their jobs having the lowest mortality levels.\nAnother example of the use of power and prestige is the ability to exert political power. Specifically, \"electoral engagement is positively correlated with income at the individual level.\" This demonstrates that those who are of lower socio-economic status are at a disadvantage in terms of the political clout that they possess. Because lower-income individuals are less likely to vote for representatives and for other ballot measures, the policies and laws put into place may not serve their interests.\n\nSocial connections can be conceptualized in two ways: one, connections between unrelated social worlds, and, two, social relations within relatively closed worlds. Those of lower SES may lack the first type more than the second, which places them at a more significant disadvantage in terms of their health status. Someone from a higher-SES group may have friends or colleagues who are health care providers, attorneys, or politicians. Through these social connections, broader networks can be accessed that may provide health benefits.\n\nConversely, some lower-SES individuals, specifically Latinos, benefit from strong community relationships. This has been referred to as the Barrio Effect, which states that Mexican-Americans living in areas with high densities of Mexicans experience \"sociocultural advantages\" that \"outweigh the disadvantages conferred by the high poverty of those neighborhoods.\"\n\nA final key part of the theory is the persistence of resource disparities that perpetuate unequal health outcomes, despite intervening mechanisms that may otherwise appear to improve health status. An example of this is the Pap smear for cervical cancer screening. Since the development of the Pap smear in the 1940s, a disparity has existed in utilization of this screening test given differences in resources mentioned above. Another example is the polio vaccine. Prior to the vaccine, polio could afflict people of all socioeconomic classes. Once the vaccine became available, it was primarily accessible by those who possessed the resources to obtain it. We also see an example of this in colorectal cancer, in which the variable diffusion has role in the theory; in which diffusion has reduced mortality, but not enough to eliminiate SES inequalities as seen in Wang et al. 2012.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how intervening mechanisms, e.g., the Pap smear and the polio vaccine, did not decrease health disparities given that certain groups possessed resources to access them and others did not.\n"}

The pre-Civil War events can be roughly divided into a period encompassing the long-term build-up over many decades and a period encompassing the five-month build-up to war immediately after the election of Abraham Lincoln as President in the Election of 1860, which culminated in the Fall of Fort Sumter (April 1861).\n\nSince the early colonial period in Virginia, slavery had been a part of the socioeconomic system of British North America and was recognized in the Thirteen Colonies at the time of the United States' Declaration of Independence (1776). Since then, events and statements by politicians and others brought forth differences, tensions and divisions between the people of the slave states of the Southern United States and the people of the free states of the Northern United States (including Western states) over the topics of slavery. The large underlying issue from which other issues developed was whether slavery should be retained and even expanded to other areas or whether it should be contained and eventually abolished. Over many decades, these issues and divisions became increasingly irreconcilable and contentious.\n\nEvents in the 1850s culminated with the election of the anti-slavery-expansion Republican Abraham Lincoln as President on November 6, 1860. This provoked the first round of state secessions as leaders of the Deep South cotton states were unwilling to remain in a second class political status with their way of life threatened by the President himself. Initially, the seven Deep South states seceded, with economies based on cotton (then in heavy European demand with rising prices). They were Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. After the Confederates attacked and captured Fort Sumter, President Lincoln called for volunteers to march south and suppress the rebellion. This pushed the four other Upper South States (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) also to secede. These states completed the formation of the Confederate States of America. Their addition to the Confederacy ensured a war would be prolonged and bloody because they contributed territory and soldiers.\n\n\nSeveral small skirmishes and battles as well as bloody riots in St. Louis and Baltimore took place in the early months of the war. The Battle of First Bull Run or Battle of First Manassas, the first major battle of the war, occurred on July 21, 1861. After that, it became clear that there could be no compromise between the Union and the seceding states and that a long and bloody war could not be avoided. All hope of a settlement short of a catastrophic war was lost.\n\n\n"}
