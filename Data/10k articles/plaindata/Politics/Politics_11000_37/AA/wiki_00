It was named for al-Qaeda, and states it is subordinate to that group and its now-deceased leader Osama bin Laden, a Saudi citizen of Yemeni heritage. It is considered the most active of al-Qaeda's branches, or \"franchises,\" that emerged due to weakening central leadership. The U.S government believes AQAP to be the most dangerous al-Qaeda branch. The group established an emirate during the 2011 Yemeni Revolution.\n\nThe group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations and several countries and international organizations. Since 2015, hundreds of AQAP members were recruited by militias backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the war against the Houthis.\n\nLike al-Qaeda Central, AQAP opposes the monarchy of the House of Saud. AQAP was formed in January 2009 from a merger of al-Qaeda's Yemeni and Saudi branches. The Saudi group had been effectively suppressed by the Saudi government, forcing its members to seek sanctuary in Yemen. In 2010, it was believed to have several hundred members. The group also seeks for the destruction of the Israeli state and the liberation of the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe percentage of terrorist in the West that originated from Pakistan declined considerably from most of them (at the outset), to 75% in 2007, and to 50% in 2010, as al-Qaeda shifted to Somalia and Yemen.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton formally designated al-Qaeda in Yemen a terrorist organization on December 14, 2009. On August 24, 2010, The Washington Post journalist Greg Miller wrote that the CIA believed Yemen's branch of al-Qaeda had surpassed its parent organization, Osama bin Laden's core group, as al-Qaeda's most dangerous threat to the U.S. homeland.\n\nOn August 26, 2010, Yemen claimed that U.S. officials had exaggerated the size and danger of al-Qaeda in Yemen, insisting also that fighting the jihadist network's local branch remained Sanaa's job. A former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden warned of an escalation in fighting between al-Qaeda and Yemeni authorities, and predicted the government would need outside intervention to stay in power.\n\nHowever, Ahmed al-Bahri told the Associated Press that attacks by al-Qaeda in southern Yemen was an indication of its increasing strength.\n\nal-Qaeda was responsible for the USS \"Cole\" bombing in October 2000 in the southern port of Aden, killing 17 U.S. sailors. In 2002, an al-Qaeda attack damaged a French supertanker in the Gulf of Aden.\n\nThe Global Terrorism Database attributes the 2004 Khobar massacre to the group. In this guise, it is also known as \"The Jerusalem Squadron.\"\n\nIn addition to a number of attacks in Saudi Arabia, and the kidnap and murder of Paul Marshall Johnson Jr. in Riyadh in 2004, the group is suspected in connection with a bombing in Doha, Qatar, in March 2005. For a chronology of recent Islamist militant attacks in Saudi Arabia, \"see\" terrorism in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn the 2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, formerly known as Carlos Leon Bledsoe, a Muslim convert who had spent time in Yemen, on June 1, 2009 opened fire with an SKS Rifle in a drive-by shooting on soldiers in front of a United States military recruiting office in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a \"jihad\" attack. He killed Private William Long, and wounded Private Quinton Ezeagwula. He said that he was affiliated with and had been sent by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAQAP said it was responsible for Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's attempted Christmas Day bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit on December 25, 2009. In that incident, Abdulmutallab reportedly tried to set off plastic explosives sewn to his underwear, but failed to detonate them properly.\n\nOn February 8, 2010, deputy leader Said Ali al-Shihri called for a regional holy war and blockade of the Red Sea to prevent shipments to Israel. In an audiotape he called upon Somalia's al-Shabaab militant group for assistance in the blockade.\n\nThe 2010 cargo planes bomb plot was discovered on October 29, 2010, when two packages containing bombs found on cargo aircraft, based on intelligence received from government intelligence agencies, in the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The packages originated from Yemen, and were addressed to outdated addresses of two Jewish institutions in Chicago, Illinois, one of which was the Congregation Or Chadash, a LGBT synagogue. On October 30, 2010, On November 5, 2010, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took responsibility for the plot. It posted its acceptance of responsibility on a number of radical Islamist websites monitored by the SITE Intelligence Group and the Nine Eleven Finding Answers Foundation, and wrote: \n\nIt also claimed responsibility for the crash of a UPS Boeing 747-400 cargo plane in Dubai on September 3. The statement continued: \n\nAmerican authorities had said they believed that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the plot. Officials in the United Kingdom and the United States believe that it is most likely that the bombs were designed to destroy the planes carrying them.\n\nIn November 2010, the group announced a strategy, called \"Operation Hemorrhage\", which it said was designed to capitalize on the \"security phobia that is sweeping America.\" The program would call for a large number of inexpensive, small-scale attacks against United States interests, with the intent of weakening the U.S. economy.\n\nOn 21 May 2012, a soldier wearing a belt of explosives carried out a suicide attack on military personnel preparing for a parade rehearsal for Yemen's Unity Day. With over 120 people dead and 200 more injured, the attack was the deadliest in Yemeni history. AQAP claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDuring the June 2012 al Qaeda retreat from key southern Yemen stronghold, the organization planted land mines, which killed 73 civilians. According to the governor's office in Abyan province, 3,000 mines were removed from around Zinjibar and Jaar.\n\nOn 5 December 2013, an attack on the Yemeni Defense Ministry in Sana'a involving a series of bomb and gun attacks killed at least 56 people. After footage of the attack was aired on Yemeni television, showing an attack on a hospital within the ministry compound and the killing of medical personnel and patients, the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a video message apologizing. Qasim al-Raymi claimed that the team of attackers were directed not to assault the hospital in the attack, but that one had gone ahead and done so.\n\nOn 9 May 2014, several soldiers from Yemen were killed after a skirmish sparked when a vehicle attacked a palace gate.\n\nThe group also publishes the online magazines \"Voice of Jihad\" and \"Inspire\".\n\nIn New Zealand it is listed as a terror group.\n\nIn December 2014, the group released a video depicting Luke Somers, a journalist whom they were holding hostage. On 26 November, U.S. Navy SEALs and Yemeni special forces attempted a hostage rescue where eight hostages, none American, were freed, but Luke Somers and four others had been moved to another location by AQAP prior to the raid. The nationalities of the eight hostages rescued were six Yemenis, one Saudi, and one Ethiopian. On 6 December, 40 SEALs used V-22 Ospreys to land a distance from the compound where Somers and Korkie were kept at about 1 a.m. local time, according to a senior defense official. An AQAP fighter apparently spotted them while relieving himself outside, a counter-terrorism official with knowledge of the operation told ABC News, beginning a firefight that lasted about 10 minutes. According to CBS News, dog barking could have alerted the hostage takers of the operation. When the American soldiers finally entered the building where Somers and Korkie were kept, they found both men alive, but gravely wounded. Korkie and Somers died some minutes later despite attempts to save them.\n\nOn 7 January 2015, Saïd Kouachi and Chérif Kouachi attacked French satirical newspaper \"Charlie Hebdo\", resulting in 11 French citizens killed and another 11 injured. The French-born brothers of Algerian descent stated they were members of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, to an eyewitness. On 9 January, AQAP confirmed responsibility for the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting in a speech from top Shariah cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari. The reason given was to gain \"revenge for the honor\" of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.\n\nOn 2 April 2015, AQAP fighters stormed the coastal city of Mukalla, capturing it on the 16th of April after the two-week Battle of Mukalla. They seized government buildings and used trucks to cart off more than $120 million from the central bank, according to the bank’s director. AQAP forces soon passed control to a civilian council, giving it a budget of more than $4 million to provide services to residents of the city. AQAP maintained a police station in the city to mediate Sharia disputes, but avoided imposing its rule across the city. AQAP refrained from using its name, instead using the name the 'Sons of Hadhramaut' to emphasize its ties to the surrounding province. Mukalla was recaptured by the Saudi-led coalition on 25 April 2016.\n\nRemarks of Algeria atrocities by France acknowledged by Emmanuel Macron was mentioned in an article in the publication Al-Masra by the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The French colonial rule in Algeria was mentioned.\n\nIn August 2018, \"Al Jazeera\" reported that a Saudi Arabian-led coalition \"battling Houthi rebels secured secret deals with al-Qaeda in Yemen and recruited hundreds of the group's fighters. ... Key figures in the deal-making said the United States was aware of the arrangements and held off on drone attacks against the armed group, which was created by Osama bin Laden in 1988.\"\n\nOn 2 December 2015, the provincial capital of Abyan Governorate, Zinjibar, and the town of Jaʿār were captured by AQAP fighters. Like Al Mukala, AQAP forces soon passed control to a civilian council, police patrols and other public services.\n\nOn 20 February 2016, AQAP seized the southern Abyan governorate, linking them with their headquarters in Mukalla.\n\nIn the wake of the 2011 Yemeni Revolution and the Battle of Zinjibar, an Islamist insurgent organisation called Ansar al-Sharia (Yemen) (Supporters of Islamic Law), emerged in Yemen and seized control of areas in the Abyan Governorate and surrounding governorates in southern Yemen and declared them an Islamist Al-Qaeda Emirate in Yemen. There was heavy fighting with the Yemeni security forces over the control of these territories, with Ansar al-Sharia driven out of most of their territory over 2012.\n\nIn April 2011, Shaykh Abu Zubayr Adil bin Abdullah al-Abab, AQAP's chief religious figure, explained the name change as a re-branding exercise: \"the name Ansar al-Sharia is what we use to introduce ourselves in areas where we work to tell people about our work and goals.\"\n\nOn 4 October 2012, the United Nations 1267/1989 Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee and the United States Department of State designated Ansar al-Sharia as an alias for Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The State Department described the establishment of Ansar al-Sharia as an attempt to attract followers in areas of Yemen where AQAP had been able to establish territorial control and implement its interpretation of Sharia.\n\nIn 2010 the White House was reported to be considering using the CIA's armed MQ-1 \"Predator\" drones to fight Al-Qaeda in Yemen.\n\nA CIA targeted killing drone strike killed Kamal Derwish, an American citizen, and a group of al-Qaida operatives (including Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi) in Yemen in November 2002. Drones became shorthand in Yemen for a weak government allowing foreign forces to have their way.\n\nOn September 30, 2011, a US drone attack in Yemen resulted in the death of Anwar al-Awlaki, one of the group's leaders, and Samir Khan, the editor of \"Inspire\", its English-language magazine. Both were US citizens.\n\nThe pace of US drone attacks quickened significantly in 2012, with over 20 strikes in the first five months of the year, compared to 10 strikes during the course of 2011.\n\nOver the period 19–21 April 2014, a series of drone attacks on AQAP killed dozens of militants, and at least 3 civilians. A spokesperson for the Yemeni Supreme Security Committee described the attacks, which included elements of the Yemeni army as well as US drones, as \"massive and unprecedented\". The attacks were alleged to have targeted AQAP leadership, with a major AQAP base in Wadi al-Khayala reported to have been destroyed.\n\nFrom March 1 through March 8, 2017, the US conducted 45 airstrikes against AQAP, a record amount of airstrikes conducted against the group by the US in recent history. The airstrikes were reported to have killed hundreds of AQAP militants. The US continued its airstrikes afterward. Around 1–2 April 2017, the US carried out another 20 airstrikes, increasing the total number of airstrikes against AQAP in 2017 to 75, nearly double previously yearly record of 41 airstrikes in 2009.\n\nThe group has taken advantage of Yemen's \"slow collapse into near-anarchy. Widespread corruption, growing poverty and internal fragmentation have helped make Yemen a breeding ground for terror.\" More than two years later, on April 25, 2012, a suspected US drone strike killed Mohammed Said al-Umdah, a senior AQAP member cited as the number four in the organization and one of the 2006 escapees. He had been convicted of the 2002 tanker bombing and for providing logistical and material support.\n\nYemeni analyst, Barak Barfi, discounted claims that marriage between the militant group and Yemeni tribes is a widespread practice, though he states that the bulk of AQAP members hail from the tribes.\n\nAQAP is a popular choice for radicalized Americans seeking to join Islamist terror organizations overseas. In 2013 alone, at least three American citizens or permanent residents — Marcos Alonso Zea, Justin Kaliebe, and Shelton Thomas Bell — have attempted to join AQAP. They count among over 50 Americans who have attempted to join terrorist groups overseas, including AQAP, since 2007.\n\nReportedly, as many as 20 Islamist British nationals traveled to Yemen in 2009 to be trained by AQAP.\nIn February 2012, up to 500 Internationalistas from Somalia's Al Shabaab, after getting cornered by a Kenyan offensive and conflict with Al Shabaab national legions, fled to Yemen. It is likely that a number of this group merged with AQAP.\nThe following is a list of people who have been purported to be AQAP members. Most, but not all, are or were Saudi nationals. Roughly half have appeared on Saudi \"most wanted\" lists. In the left column is the rank of each member in the original 2003 list of the 26 most wanted.\n\n\n"}

Some of its members are influenced by the theory of triple oppression, and all of its members claim to oppose sexism, racism, and classism. The point of the organization is to exchange information and to coordinate activities between local groups.\n\nThe groups' activities have included handing out flyers, organizing demonstrations, direct action, and property destruction. In line with their ideology, and as a consequence of being constantly monitored by the police, the group has no central authority. This means it has a flat organization consisting of many independent groupings, without a board or leader. AFA works with other anti-racist groups all over Europe. The groups' origins are in the heterogeneous anti-fascist groups of the late 1930s and early 1940s, mostly made up of social democrats, communists, and progressive Christians. Their ideology is libertarian socialism.\n\nThe name \"Antifaschistische Aktion\" (Anti-Fascist Action) was used from the early 1930s in Germany. The name was subsequently used by anti-fascist groups in several other countries.\n\nAntifascistisk Aktion (AFA) was founded in Sweden in 1993. AFA is a part of the \"autonomous\" (autonoma in Swedish, from autonomist marxism) subculture, which revolves around many forms of leftist activism like antifascism, environmentalism and animal rights activism. This subculture includes people of many different ideologies, but the ideologies of the movement is always some form of radical leftism. In staunch contrast to the American Antifa, is Swedish AFA not open for more moderate forms of leftism, and there is even occasions where relative moderates have been assaulted by them.\n\nTheir \"Activity Guide\" advocates direct action against neo-Nazis. AFA members have admitted to arson by timed firebombs, and have pleaded guilty to burning the Tråvad spinnery in 2005. In January 2006, Swedish AFA members attacked the Norrköping immigration office and threatened officials. In June 2006, AFA members broke windows of an estate of the Christian Democrats in Kalmar. In October 2006, AFA members threatened to block a municipal council meeting in Gothenburg, because the Sweden Democrats had been elected to the council.\n\nIn July 2007, AFA members threatened and attacked an immigration judge in Gothenburg. The judge's front door was hit with an axe, and the house was vandalized with red spraypaint. Personal information about the judge and other judges was posted on the Internet. On 7 March 2008, Säpo, the Swedish security police agency, reported that AFA or people using its symbols constantly threaten municipal and provincial elected council members. In August 2008, AFA members spread announcements in Uppsala with the name and image of an opponent, encouraging people to attack him. For this, AFA promised to pay 500 Swedish kronor and a free \"knogjärn\" (knuckle duster). In February 2009, AFA members attacked the National Democrats politician Vávra Suk.\n\nAn editorial in the tabloid newspaper \"Expressen\" argued that the label 'anti-fascist' was misleading, because the organization's methods, such as stealing the subscriber list of the National Democrats newspaper, and threatening the subscribers are counterproductive and similar to methods used by fascists.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3666556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3666556", "title": "Association of American Physicians and Surgeons", "text": "Association of American Physicians and Surgeons\n\nThe Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) is a politically conservative non-profit association founded in 1943 to \"fight socialized medicine and to fight the government takeover of medicine.\" The group was reported to have about 4,000 members in 2005, and 5,000 in 2014. The executive director is Jane Orient, an internist and a member of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. AAPS also publishes the \"Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons\" (formerly known as the \"Medical Sentinel\").\n\nThe association is generally recognized as politically conservative or ultra-conservative, and its publication advocates a range of scientifically discredited hypotheses, including the belief that HIV does not cause AIDS, that being gay reduces life expectancy, that there is a link between abortion and breast cancer, and that there is a causal relationship between vaccines and autism.\n\nDuring the winter of 1943, the Lake County (Indiana) Medical Committee opposed the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill, proposed legislation that would provide government health care for most U.S. citizens. Also opposed to the bill was the conservative National Physicians Committee. The committee began a membership drive in February 1944. By May 1944, the AAPS claimed members from all 48 states. In 1944, \"Time\" reported that the group's aim was the \"defeat of any Government group medicine.\" In 1966, \"The New York Times\" described AAPS as an \"ultra-right-wing... political-economic rather than a medical group,\" and noted that some of its leaders were members of the John Birch Society.\n\nIn 2002, AAPS said that its members included Ron Paul and John Cooksey. Ron Paul's son, Rand Paul, was a member for over two decades until his election to the U.S. Senate.\n\nWhile AAPS describes itself as \"non-partisan\", the organization is generally recognized as politically conservative or ultra-conservative. The AAPS opposed the Social Security Act of 1965 which established Medicare and Medicaid, arguing that \"the effect of the law is evil and participation in carrying out its provisions is, in our opinion, immoral\", and encouraged member physicians to boycott Medicare and Medicaid. AAPS argues that individuals should purchase medical care directly from doctors, and that there is no right to medical care. The organization requires its members to sign a \"declaration of independence\" pledging that they will not work with Medicare, Medicaid, or even private insurance companies.\n\nAAPS opposes mandated evidence-based medicine and practice guidelines, criticizing them as a usurpation of physician autonomy and a fascist merger of state and corporate power driven by the pharmaceutical industry. AAPS also opposes abortion and over-the-counter access to emergency contraception. AAPS also opposes electronic medical records as well as any \"direct or de facto supervision or control over the practice of medicine by federal officers or employees.\"\n\nOn October 25, 2008 the AAPS website published an editorial implying that Barack Obama was using Neuro-linguistic Programming, \"a covert form of hypnosis\", to coerce people to vote for him in his 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nAAPS's position is that there is no evidence, from a medical stand point, to support gun control.\n\nIn 1975, AAPS went to court to block enforcement of a new Social Security amendment that would monitor the treatment given to Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n\nWith several other groups, AAPS filed a lawsuit in 1993 against Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala over closed-door meetings related to the 1993 Clinton health care plan. The AAPS sued to gain access to the list of members of President Clinton's health care taskforce. Judge Royce C. Lamberth initially found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded $285,864 to the AAPS for legal costs; Lamberth also harshly criticized the Clinton administration and Clinton aide Ira Magaziner in his ruling. Subsequently, a federal appeals court overturned the award and the initial findings on the basis that Magaziner and the administration had not acted in bad faith. AAPS also opposed the Obama Administration's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and on March 26, 2010 AAPS filed suit to invalidate the new health care bill.\n\nThe AAPS was involved in litigation against Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), arguing that it violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by allowing government access to certain medical data without a warrant. (Title II of HIPAA, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers, and is intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the US's health care system by encouraging the widespread use of electronic data interchange in the health care system.)\n\nIn 2004, AAPS filed a brief on behalf of conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh in Florida's Fourth District Court of Appeal, opposing the seizure of his medical files in an investigation of drug charges for Limbaugh's alleged misuse of prescription drugs. The AAPS stated the seizure was a violation of state law and that \"It is not a crime for a patient to be in pain and repeatedly seek relief, and doctors should not be turned against patients they tried to help.\"\n\nIn 2006 the group criticized what it called sham peer review, claiming it was a device used to punish whistleblowers. The next year, AAPS helped appeal the conviction of Virginia internist William Hurwitz, who was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for prescribing excessive quantities of narcotic drugs after 16 former patients testified against him. Hurwitz was granted a retrial in 2006, and his 25-year prison sentence was reduced to 4 years and 9 months.\n\nThe \"Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons\" (\"JPandS\"), until 2003 named the \"Medical Sentinel\", is the journal of the association. Its mission statement includes \"… a commitment to publishing scholarly articles in defense of the practice of private medicine, the pursuit of integrity in medical research … Political correctness, dogmatism and orthodoxy will be challenged with logical reasoning, valid data and the scientific method.\" The publication policy of the journal states that articles are subject to a double-blind peer-review process.\n\nThe \"Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons\" is not listed in academic literature databases such as MEDLINE/PubMed or the Web of Science. The quality and scientific validity of articles published in the \"Journal\" have been criticized by medical experts, and some of the political and scientific viewpoints advocated by AAPS are not held by mainstream scientists and other medical groups. The U.S. National Library of Medicine declined repeated requests from AAPS to index the journal, citing unspecified concerns. As of September 2016, \"JPandS\" was listed on Beall's list of potential or probable predatory open-access journals. Quackwatch lists \"JPandS\" as an untrustworthy, non-recommended periodical. An editorial in \"Chemical & Engineering News\" described \"JPandS\" as a \"purveyor of utter nonsense.\" Investigative journalist Brian Deer wrote that the journal is the \"house magazine of a right-wing American fringe group [AAPS]\" and \"is barely credible as an independent forum.\" Writing in \"The Guardian\", science columnist Ben Goldacre described the \"Journal\" as the \"in-house magazine of a rightwing US pressure group well known for polemics on homosexuality, abortion and vaccines.\"\n\nArticles and commentaries published in the journal have argued a number of non-mainstream or scientifically discredited claims, including:\n\n\nA series of articles by pro-life authors published in the journal argued for a link between abortion and breast cancer. Such a link has been rejected by the scientific community, including the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the World Health Organization, among other major medical bodies.\n\nA 2003 paper published in the journal, claiming that vaccination was harmful, was criticized for poor methodology, lack of scientific rigor, and outright errors by the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics. A National Public Radio piece mentioned inaccurate information published in the \"Journal\" and said: \"The journal itself is not considered a leading publication, as it's put out by an advocacy group that opposes most government involvement in medical care.\"\n\nThe \"Journal\" has also published articles advocating politically and socially conservative policy positions, including:\n\nIn a 2005 article published in the \"Journal\", Madeleine Cosman argued that illegal immigrants were carriers of disease, and that immigrants and \"anchor babies\" were launching a \"stealthy assault on [American] medicine.\" In the article, Cosman claimed that \"Suddenly, in the past 3 years America has more than 7,000 cases of leprosy\" because of illegal aliens. The journal's leprosy claim was cited and repeated by Lou Dobbs as evidence of the dangers of illegal immigration.\n\nPublicly available statistics show that the 7,000 cases of leprosy occurred during the past 30 years, not the past three as Cosman claimed. James L. Krahenbuhl, director of the U.S. government's leprosy program, stated that there had been no significant increase in leprosy cases, and that \"It [leprosy] is not a public health problem—that’s the bottom line.\" National Public Radio reported that the \"Journal\" article \"had footnotes that did not readily support allegations linking a recent rise in leprosy rates to illegal immigrants.\" The article's erroneous leprosy claim was pointed out by \"60 Minutes\", National Public Radio, and \"The New York Times\" but has not been corrected by the \"Journal\".\n\n"}

The IRA's South Armagh Brigade fitted a van with wheels that allowed it to move along a railway line. A large bomb was placed inside the van, which was then driven along the railway line to the target. The explosion killed one British soldier and injured 23 others. The compound, just north of the village of Cloghoge in County Armagh, on the southern outskirts of Newry, was wrecked.\n\nDuring the late hours of 30 April, a group of four Provisional IRA members held a family hostage in Killeen and stole a mechanical excavator. This was to be used to build a makeshift ramp up to the Dublin–Belfast railway line, which drew parallel to the Dublin–Belfast motorway (M1).\nAt the same time, other IRA members stole a Renault Master van in Dundalk, which was then loaded with of home-made explosives. The van was fitted with wheels that could run on the rails. The excavator moved up the ramp and lifted the van onto the railway. The van was then driven some 800 metres north and a mile-long wire attached to a triggering device was added to the bomb. Meanwhile, IRA members in support set up roadblocks on both sides of the border to keep people away. The IRA unit who set up the checkpoint in the Republic wore Garda Síochána uniforms.\n\nAt about 2:00 AM, the van was clamped into first gear and directed at the R15 military checkpoint, a permanent vehicle checkpoint on M1 motorway, alongside the railway. A British Army patrol from the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers heard what sounded like a train and spotted the van on the rails heading towards the checkpoint, which was alerted immediately. The sentry at R15, Fusilier Andrew Grundy, spotted the incoming threat and alerted the other soldiers in the checkpoint, who rushed to take shelter from the bomb. Grundy tried to disable the device with gunfire, to no avail. Meanwhile, an IRA member, from the high ground south of the position, waited for the van to reach its target. He then radioed the men at the end of the wire to trigger the bomb. At 2:05, the explosive went off, demolishing the checkpoint. The 10-ton sangar was lifted off of its foundation and thrown 12 yards away. Fusilier Grundy was killed almost instantly, while 23 troops were injured. The rest of the soldiers, all inside a reinforced concrete bunker, survived the massive blast.\n\nFusilier G. A.

{"id": "11584565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11584565", "title": "Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme", "text": "Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme\n\nThe Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (or CPRS) was a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme for anthropogenic greenhouse gases proposed by the Rudd government, as part of its climate change policy, which had been due to commence in Australia in 2010. It marked a major change in the energy policy of Australia. The policy began to be formulated in April 2007, when the federal Labor Party was in Opposition and the six Labor-controlled states commissioned an independent review on energy policy, the Garnaut Climate Change Review, which published a number of reports. After Labor won the 2007 federal election and formed government, it published a Green Paper on climate change for discussion and comment. The Federal Treasury then modelled some of the financial and economic impacts of the proposed CPRS scheme.\n\nThe Rudd government published a final White Paper on 15 December 2008, and announced that legislation was intended to take effect in July 2010; but the legislation for the CPRS (aka ETS) failed to gain the numbers in the Senate and was twice rejected creating a double dissolution election trigger. A bitter political debate within the Coalition Opposition saw Opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull lose the leadership to the anti-CPRS Tony Abbott. The Rudd government did not call an election and in April 2010, Rudd deferred plans for the CPRS. \n\nAfter the 2010 federal election, the Gillard Government was able to get the Carbon Pricing Mechanism (CPM) passed into law as part of the Clean Energy Futures Package (CEF) in 2011, and became effective on 1 July 2012. However, after the 2013 federal election there was a change in government, and the Abbott Government repealed the CEF package on 17 July 2014. Due to the great deal of policy uncertainty surrounding the scheme, organizations in Australia responded in a rather informal and tepid manner and largely withheld from making any large-scale investments in emissions reductions technology during the scheme's operation.\n\nIn the 2007 election year, both the Liberal-led Coalition government and the Labor opposition promised to introduce carbon trading. Opposition leader Rudd commissioned the Garnaut Climate Change Review on 30 April 2007, while Prime Minister John Howard announced his own plan for a carbon trading scheme on 4 June 2007, after the final report of the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading. Labor won the election on 24 November.\n\nThe draft Garnaut Report, issued on 4 July 2008, was only one of many inputs into the policy-making process. The Labor government also issued a \"Green Paper\" on 16 July 2008 that described the intended design of the carbon trading scheme.\n\nThe Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, was a market-based approach to greenhouse gas pollution, to be implemented in 2010 (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 9). The main concern for the Australian government was getting the design of such a scheme correct, so that it would have complemented the integrated economic policy framework, and would have been consistent with the Government’s commercial strategy (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 10).\n\nThe objective of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was to meet Australia’s emissions reduction targets in the most flexible and cost-effective way; to support an effective global response to climate change; and to provide for transitional assistance for the most affected households and firms (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 14).\n\nThe basis of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was a cap and trade system, and was a way of limiting greenhouse gas pollution, as well as giving individuals and businesses incentives to reduce their emissions (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 11). The Australian Government would have set a cap on carbon emissions, consistent with longer term goals of reducing Australia’s emissions by 60% compared with 2000 levels by 2050 (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 11).\n\nThere were two definite elements of the cap and trade scheme: the cap itself, and the ability to trade (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). The cap is the limit on greenhouse gas emissions imposed by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The system aims at achieving the environmental outcome of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the idea being that capping emissions creates a price for carbon and the ability to trade ensures that emissions are reduced at the lowest possible price (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). Setting a limit means that the right to emit greenhouse gases becomes scarce, and scarcity entails a price. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme would have put a price on carbon in a systematic way throughout the economy (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13).\n\nThe ‘covered’ sectors are sources of emissions subject to the cap, which were specified in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). After setting the cap, the Government would have then issued permits that are equal to the cap. The Green Paper gives the example “if the cap were to limit emissions to 100 million tonnes of CO-e in a particular year, 100 million ‘permits’ would be issued that year” (2008, 12). For every tonne of emissions emitted, a source of emissions would have been required to acquire and surrender a permit (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). About one thousand firms were expected to have obligations from the Scheme.\n\nThe price of emissions would increase the cost of those goods and services that are most emissions-intensive (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13). This means that there will be a change across the prices of goods and services across the economy, reflecting how emission-intensive the goods or service is. That therefore provides businesses and consumers with incentives to use and invest in low-emissions technologies.\n\nThe second essential element of a cap and trade scheme is the ability to trade. Since carbon pollution permits will be tradable, the price of permits will be determined by the market (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13). The main idea behind this part of the scheme is that a firm who can undertake abatement more cheaply than the permit price will do so, and that a company will pay for permits if the cost to it of lowering its emissions exceeds the cost of the permits. By trading among themselves, firms achieve the scheme cap at the least cost to the economy (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13).\n\nThe cap would only achieve the desired environmental objectives if it is enforced. This means that firms responsible for emissions covered by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme must monitor their emissions and report them accurately to government (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). The reported emissions data would need to be monitored and verified.\n\nThe Australian Treasury's report on the economics of climate change mitigation was released on 30 October 2008. The report was a key input in determining the structure and targets for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.\n\nThe Treasury’s modeling demonstrated that early global action to reduce carbon emissions would be less expensive than later action and stated that a market-based approach allows robust economic growth into the future as emissions fall.\n\nThe report also stated that:\n\nThe White Paper was released on 15 December 2008. The White Paper included the Rudd Labor government's targets for Greenhouse gas emission reductions, 5% below 2000 by 2020 on a unilateral basis or up to 15% below 2000 by 2020 if also agreed by the other major emitters. This compares to the 25 to 40% cut compared to 1990 emissions recommended by the IPCC as needing to be made by developed countries to keep CO below 450 ppm and to have a reasonable chance of keeping global warming at less than a 2 degree Celsius increase above pre-industrial times.\n\nThe White Paper also set an indicative national emissions trajectory for the first few years of the scheme:\nFor comparison, in 2006, Australia's emissions were 104% of 2000 levels (under Kyoto accounting).\n\nSome of the features of the emissions trading scheme proposed were: \n\nThe national Climate Action Summit of 500 participants representing 140 climate groups Australia wide has condemned the CPRS and agreed to campaign to prevent it becoming law. Major concerns included announced targets, granting of property rights to pollute and providing free permits to major polluters. Summit participants were joined by 2,000 other people in surrounding parliament house to express dissatisfaction with the Rudd Government climate change policies.\n\nSeveral organisations criticised the choice of emission reduction targets in the CPRS. Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wilderness Society and the Climate Institute were joined by the Greens and other environmentalists in calling for more ambitious 2020 targets of 25 to 45 per cent reductions.\nProfessor Andy Pitman described the targets as inadequate.\nProfessor Barry Brook, the Director of the Research Institute for Climate Change and Sustainability at the University of Adelaide, stated that \"the 14% cut in our total emissions by 2020 announced today is such a pitifully inadequate attempt to stop dangerous climate change that we may as well wave the white flag now.\"\nDr Regina Betz, Joint Director of the Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets at UNSW, stated \"The proposed 2020 targets of emission reductions of 5 to 15% are, according to the climate science, entirely inadequate for an equitable global response to avoid dangerous global warming.\"\nDr Frank Jotzo, deputy director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, and former advisor to the Garnaut Climate Change Review, said \"ruling out a 25% reduction is a mistake, since Australia's overwhelming interest is strong global climate action. An international agreement with deep cuts has just become a little bit more unlikely, as a result of Australia not putting a compatible offer on the table\" and \"the Treasury modelling has shown that even deep cuts won't carry big economic costs for Australia, if the policies are sound.\"\n\nAustralian industrialists were concerned about cost impacts. Australian Chamber of Commerce & Industry chief executive Peter Anderson said his members were \"apprehensive\" about the scheme because it was \"too risky\" and warned the costs would be borne not only by emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries but also by \"small and medium businesses through higher energy costs and the flow-on from restructuring of larger industries\".\nAustralian Industry Group chief executive Heather Ridout said the scheme was \"a big ask and will have a big impact on the Australian economy\" and estimated it would add about $7 billion to business costs by 2010.\n\nOther sources of criticism included concerns over coverage of agriculture, impacts on the minerals sector and implications for international agreements. Dr Hugh Saddler, Managing Director of Energy Strategies Pty Ltd, stated \"the white paper does not include measures to reduce emissions from the major non-energy sectors such as agriculture and land clearing. While it is a good decision not to include these emission sources within the CPRS, it is essential that there be other strong programs specifically directed at these sectors.\"\nMitch Hooke, the head of the Minerals Council of Australia, said his organisation was \"profoundly disappointed that the white paper was not better aligned with progress towards a global agreement on reduction commitments, new low emissions technologies and emissions trading schemes in other countries\" South Africa's environment minister, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk, described the scheme as an inadequate \"opening bid\", and warned that it is not \"nearly good enough to bring developing countries to the table\".\n\nProfessor Ross Garnaut, previously an adviser to the Government on climate change, 'damned' the Rudd Government's carbon policy because of the gross over-compensation of coal-fired electricity generators; the possibility of taking 25% emission reduction targets off the table when they are in Australia's best interest; the lack of a principled basis for support of trade-exposed industries and the potential threat to public finances of the proposed compensation to industry.\n\nStatements of support included:\nThe United Nations climate negotiator Yvo de Boer told ABC Radio \"Australia's now put a figure on the table, something countries have been calling for a long time\".\nGerard Henderson, the former Chief-of-Staff to John Howard, has described Rudd's emissions targets as \"responsible\".\n\nAfter changes announced in May 2009, some business and environment groups announced that the CPRS, although weak, was now worth supporting.\n\nWhether or not the Federal Opposition will support the proposed legislation will depend on an independent assessment of the Government's carbon emission scheme it will commission. Without support of some Opposition members in the Senate there is a possibility the enabling legislation may not be passed unless it gains the support of the Greens, Family First and independent senators. If the enabling legislation is not passed, there is a chance that it could be passed if the Government uses it as a trigger for a double dissolution election.\n\nOn 4 May 2009, the government announced a number of modifications to the proposed Scheme, including a delayed start, a deeper conditional target (25% by 2020, in the event of a global agreement aiming at 450 ppm), more assistance for industry, and a \"carbon trust\" to enable voluntary action by households.\n\nThere were a number of significant changes made to the scheme in November 2009 after Malcolm Turnbull negotiated with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. These changes included large increases in compensation for polluting industries, including the coal and aluminium smelting industries. $4 billion was proposed for the manufacturing sector and $1.5 billion was proposed for electricity generators.\n\nOn 30 November 2009 the Senate failed to pass the CPRS (Senate Hansard page 9602), giving Kevin Rudd a potential reason for calling a double dissolution election.\n\nOn 27 April 2010, the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that the Government has decided to delay the implementation of the CPRS until after the current commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (which ends in 2012). The Government cited the lack of bipartisan support for the CPRS and slow international progress on climate action for the delay. The Prime Minister announced that the CPRS would be introduced only when there is greater clarity on the actions of other major economies including the US, China and India.\n\nIn June 2010, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, told Sky News Australia that he first learned of the scrapping of the CPRS when he read about it in a newspaper after being leaked by a Government source.\n\nThe delay on implementation of the CPRS drew some strong criticism of Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party from the Federal Opposition and from community and grassroots action groups such as GetUp.\n\nOn 5 April 2011, the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, stated that he believed it had been a mistake to delay the ETS during his term as Prime Minister of Australia.\n\nIn February 2011, the Gillard Government announced the Clean Energy Bill 2011, an emissions trading scheme in Australia to replace the CPRS. This bill was passed into law later that year, paving the way forward with a carbon price to be introduced on 1 July 2012.\n\n\n"}

The party was founded by Henry Brookman in 1980, and was represented by Hans Janmaat in the Dutch House of Representatives from 1982, until he was expelled from the party in 1984 and joined the more moderate Centre Democrats. The CP, as well as the CD, was subject to a \"cordon sanitaire\" by the other parties in the House of Representatives. After much infighting and finally legal proceedings against the party, it was declared bankrupt in 1986. The party was soon after succeeded by the Centre Party '86, which would become increasingly radical, until it was banned in 1998.\n\nThe Centre Party was founded on 11 March 1980 by Henry Brookman, one of the founders of the short-lived National Centre Party (NCP) in 1979 (which had been dissolved the day before the founding of the CP), and a prominent member of the Dutch Peoples-Union (NVU). In February 1980 some radical NCP members had harassed Moroccan refugees who held a hunger strike at the Moses and Aaron church in Amsterdam. This led to a conflict within the NCP. Brookman dissolved the NCP and founded the Centre Party (CP). The party contested the 1981 elections unsuccessfully, winning just 0.1% of the vote, the same as the Dutch Peoples-Union.\n\nIn the 1982 election the party won 0.8% of the vote, and one seat, which was taken by Hans Janmaat. This was the first time since the Second World War that a party considered to be right-wing extremist had won a seat in parliament. Janmaat soon took over the leadership of the party, helped by the small membership of the party, his political background in mainstream political parties, and as Brookman had to move into the background due to pressure from his employer.\n\nIn the following years, the party continued its growth, and claimed 3,500 members in 1984. It was highly successful in elections, for instance winning almost 10% of the vote in the 1983 local elections in Almere, and 2.5% of the vote nationwide in the 1984 European elections.\nConflict soon erupted however, between the party leadership led by Nico Konst and Henk de Wijer, and the parliamentary section, of Janmaat and his assistants. Janmaat was accused of financial and personal improprieties, while Janmaat in turn accused the party leadership of neo-Nazi sympathies and political and organisational incompetence. While Janmaat had thought that by steering a more moderate course the CP would be able to attract more voters at the polls, he was expelled from the party by the party leadership. Janmaat then joined the recently founded Centre Democrats (CD) and kept his seat in parliament. The CP became even more isolated, and suffered from disruptive internal struggles, which were very costly. In 1986 the CP and CD organized a reconciliation meeting in Kedichem, which was turned into a disaster by radical anti-fascists. A group of these anti-fascist activists set the hotel where the meeting was located on fire, causing several heavy injuries.\n\nThe party had some moderate success in local elections of March 1986, winning 6 seats. The new optimism in the party was shattered however, when party leader Albrecht Lier defected from the party and joined the Centre Democrats in May. The CP, like the CD, was unable to obtain a seat in the 1986 election, but nevertheless won 0.4% of the vote, compared to the mere 0.1% of the CD.\n\nBy the 1986 election the party was disintegrating rapidly, with the party membership after the split counting a mere 100 persons, and most of the leading party members having gone over to the CD, or left politics. The party was officially declared bankrupt on 13 May 1986, after being fined a sum of money it was not able to pay. The party re-organized itself under the name Centre Party '86 (CP'86) a week later. They were never able to obtain any seats in national elections since then, and were eventually abrogated in 1998 by a Dutch court, because of the racist and xenophobic statements of its party board at a 1995 meeting. The radical neo-Nazi wing of the new party expelled the moderate nationalist wing, and several of the latter members founded the People's Nationalists Netherlands in 1997, which later became the New National Party.\n\nThe CP saw itself as defending the rights of autochthonous Dutch people in the face of mass immigration. After it lost its parliamentary representation in 1984 the party continued in 1986 under the name Centre Party '86 and became even more radical.\n\nThe party's initial manifesto was titled \"not left, not right,\" and combined right-wing, left-wing and green political positions. Its tenth point contained its immigration stance; \"The Netherlands is not an immigrant country, so put a stop to the stream of foreigners.\" Together with the history of some of the party's early members, this point in the program was the main background for portraying the CP as an \"extreme right\" party in the media. The party itself however fiercely rejected any accusations of racism and fascism.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> In 1984 the party's sole representative in parliament, Hans Janmaat, became an independent MP.\n\n"}

The Freedom Charter was drawn-up at the gathering; the charter became the manifesto of the African National Congress and a symbol of internal resistance against apartheid.\n\nThe Freedom Charter was the core statement of principles of the Congress Alliance, consisting of the African National Congress (ANC), the South African Indian Congress, the Coloured People's Congress, the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU), and the Congress of Democrats.\n\nA call was sent out to the people of South Africa by the Congress Alliance for proposals for the content of a freedom charter concerning issues such as land, industry, human rights, education and law. Proposals were received in the form of local demands, in the form of new constitutions, as documents and scraps of papers and these proposals were then developed by a sub-committee into a draft document that could be debated at a future Congress of the People. The draft proposal for the charter would be presented to each delegate when they arrived in Johannesburg for the Congress. The delegates were elected from rural and urban areas after advertising for candidates who would be elected by their communities or organizations with funds raised locally to get their representatives to Johannesburg and where not possible, find delegates from their communities that were already present in the city.\n\nThe Congress of the People, consisting of around 3000 people, gathered in Kliptown outside Johannesburg on 26 June 1955 in a field surrounded by chicken-wire to give it a lawful claim of being a private gathering. The gathering was not prevented from assembling by the South African government. The delegates came from all parts of the country arriving in Johannesburg via car, bus, bicycle, by foot and horseback. The majority of the people in the gathering where Black Africans, with hundreds of people of Indian descent and about a hundred whites. The object of the congress was to write a Freedom Charter representing the aspirations of the black and white South Africans. The aim was to have a lead speaker present each section of the proposed charter and open the section to general discussion and debate by the gathering. This would not happen due to the intervention by the government and each section would be agreed to but not by general discussion.\n\nThe congress would conclude on 27 June, when the gathering was surrounded by the South African Police and broken up. They made several arrests, confiscated documents and photographed the delegates. The last aim of the Congress was to collect one million signatures by 26 June 1956 to acknowledge the creation of the Freedom Charter. A quota of signatures was decided upon with the following required from each province, Transvaal 450 000, Cape 350 000, Natal 150 000 and the Orange Free State 50 000. The delegates then returned home to report back to their communities or organizations to spread the adoption of the Freedom Charter.\n\nBy the end of 1955, 156 leading Congress Alliance activists were arrested and tried for treason and the Charter itself would be used as evidence and would eventually be declared illegal.

She was stopped during transit at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila on April 10, 2017, and sent back to Saudi Arabia on April 11, 2017.\n\nLasloom's documents were confiscated by Filipino airport officials in the International Zone. Her case spread widely on social media after she recorded a video with the help of a Canadian tourist at the Manila airport, in which she said she feared her family would kill her if she returned. However, despite physically resisting, she was forcibly taken onto a plane by her uncles on April 11, 2017, to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis is a rare documented case in the history of female liberation in Saudi Arabia, bearing many parallels to that of Princess Misha'al. Taleb Al Abdulmohsen, a self-described ex-Muslim who aids people attempting to flee Saudi Arabia, said that Lasloom did not disclose her beliefs or circumstances to him; however, most of those who seek his counsel are domestic violence victims, gay or have rejected Islam.\n\nMadawi al-Rasheed, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics Middle East Centre, commented that Lasloom's case is \"a classic... in which state and family cooperate against women in KSA.\" Reasons pushing Saudi women to flee their country are various, mostly stemming from a severe lack of women rights. Under the Saudi guardianship system adult women must obtain permission from a male guardian to travel abroad, marry, or be released from prison, and may be required to provide guardian consent to work or get health care. These restrictions last from birth until death, as women are, in the view of the Saudi state, permanent legal minors.\n\nHer case has sparked global outrage with millions of sympathizers around the world.\n\nThe role Philippines authorities played in Lasloom’s return is unclear. As a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the Convention against Torture, the Philippines has an obligation not to return anyone to a territory where they face persecution because of their gender or a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.While on a layover in the Philippines, Dina Ali was allegedly detained by the Philippines authorities and held until male relatives from Saudi Arabia could arrive and return her to their home. A video posted on Twitter purports to be her testimony before being kidnapped and returned to Saudi Arabia. No face is shown in the video. In the testimony, she claims that she will be killed upon return to her family. \n\nDina stated in the self-recorded video that the Philippine authorities had held her at the Manila airport, and confiscated her passport. She is quoted to have said, \"My name is Dina Ali and I'm a Saudi woman who fled Saudi Arabia to Australia to seek asylum. If my family come they will kill me. If I go back to Saudi Arabia I will be dead.\" The video has been circulated widely on social media. A Canadian tourist allowed Dina to use her phone, and shared her witness account.\n\nA second video later surfaced, showing Lasloom arguing with a woman Dina identified to that tourist as a representative from the Kuwait Embassy: \"He is not my father, he is not my father, he is not my father. You are not helping, you don't know him,\" referring to her uncle. Another witness published a video on YouTube where several security personnel are seen and Dina is heard screaming in the background from the airport in Manila.\"Dina told the airport workers that she was in danger the entire time. Several times she cried hysterically to them that she needed help. They ignored her. I saw myself they looked at her like she didn't exist. They were helpful when I asked questions about my own flights and when I asked about Dina, they gave me more information that they gave her. They told me that they didn't know more other than an important person called and told them to hold her documents and don't allow her to leave. They told me they would give her more information as they found out but they never did. Her uncles arrived while she was trying to eat a sandwich and I was trying to connect to the internet to send the video she had just recorded. I was looking in another direction and Dina noticed when they came in and I knew something was wrong. Her looked terrified and she whispered to me, Meagan, Meagan they are here, send the video, send the video. I asked, those are your uncles and she said yes. When the men approached us, with a woman, they were smiling and looked friendly. They sat down with us and I said hi and Dina started to cry. She said, Meagan, can I speak to you in private and I said yes, and I took my phone and we both had the blue Philippine airline blankets wrapped around us and we went to the washroom. The woman followed us and I whispered and told Dina she's behind us, I am sending the video and I will take pictures, let's go back. So we went back and I sat not far away and took the photos that's online of the two men and Dina. Those are her uncles and across there's a woman, that the woman they came with. Dina told me after she was from the Kuwait Embassy.\"Calls to the police department at Manila International airport were not answered on Tuesday night. It is understood that the airport confirmed Lasloom’s detention with an Amnesty International representative. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte began a three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia on April 10, the same day Lasloom attempted to fly to Australia.\n\nInitially, Filipino officials denied any knowledge of Lasloom being detained. However, they later confirmed her detention, but attempted to shift blame onto the Saudi government and airline: \"As far as immigration is concerned, we did not hold any Saudi national.\" The spokeswoman said that if Lasloom was a transiting passenger, then she would not have passed through immigration and it would have been up to the airline to decide what happened to her.\n\nThe Filipino government has been widely condemned for their poor response to the situation by many groups, including Human Rights Watch director Kenneth Roth, who described it as appalling.\n\nThe only information provided to why Lasloom's transfer to Sydney was stopped by the Filipino airport authorities was that a very important person had called and told them to hold her documents without further information.\n\nSaudi activists said Ali was forced onto a Saudi Arabia Airlines flight from Manila to Riyadh on Tuesday night April 11, 2017. A Saudi feminist who obtained the video from an eyewitness reported Dina was forced onto the plane by her two diplomat uncles and Filipino police. Human Rights Watch interviewed four people linked to Dina case, including two who said that they spoke to her at Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport.\n\nFeminist activist Moudhi Aljohani, who claims to have talked to Dina on the phone, is quoted in a report in The Australian saying Dina avoided a first attempt to force her onto a plane to Saudi Arabia \"by screaming and physically resisting, attracting the attention of other passengers.\" A video of the incident was released on YouTube.\n\nAn airline security official told Human Rights Watch, he saw two airline security officials and three apparently Middle Eastern men enter the hotel and go to her room, which he said was near the lobby. He said he heard her screaming and begging for help from her room, after which he saw them carry her out with duct tape on her mouth, feet, and hands. He said she was still struggling to break free when he saw them put her in a wheelchair and take her out of the hotel.\n\nA witness reported in The Australian, said she saw a women being pulled out of a room with her mouth taped shut, and her body was wrapped in a sheet. This is assumed to have been done by her two uncles and a member of the Saudi Embassy. \"They weren't Filipino. They looked Arab,\" Another woman, who declined to give her name told The Australian. A third witness claimed to have seen \"A security officer and three middle eastern men doing this\". She was later forced on a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight, the pilots and crew of which were reportedly aware and supportive of Dina being returned to Riyadh against her will, siding heavily with her uncles.\n\nDespite conflicting reports at the time about whether or not Dina was in fact on the flight, while en route to Riyadh social media users began reporting a hostage aboard, prompting the governments of Oman and Qatar to refuse the aircraft passage through their airspace. While only confirmed to confidential sources and not officially verified, it is supported by flight path records, which show an abrupt change in direction and trajectory, seeing the plane make almost a full turn.\n\nPolice presence was heavy outside King Abdulaziz International Airport the night Dina arrived, Saudi campaigners reported Dina was seen arriving in the country in a wheelchair, while multiple passengers told Reuters they had seen a woman being carried onto the plane screaming.\n\nA rare gathering of about 10 Saudi activists appeared in the arrivals area of the Riyadh airport around midnight on April 12, 2017, after a hashtag began circulating on social media urging people to \"receive Dina at the airport.\" Two of them, Alaa Anazi a 23-year-old medical student, and a 27-year-old male, were detained after approaching airport security about the case. Alaa's sister confirmed airport officials told her Alaa had been sent to a police station in central Riyadh, but said she was unable to confirm her sister’s whereabouts.\n\nSaudi-based journalist Vivien Nereim, who was at the airport, said there were no signs of the young girl, but confirmed the Saudi Human Rights Commission was following the case. She did however, collect testimonies from witnesses on the plane who described \"a woman being carried on the flight screaming\", suggesting that she was brought onto the plane against her will, which is illegal in the Philippines according to the Republic Act 9208, as this happened in the International zone, where Philippine law applies. Two other witnesses stated they heard her cry for help, but it was impossible to determine her condition because she was covered.\n\nThe Saudi embassy in the Philippines confirmed that the citizen had returned to Saudi Arabia, adding that what happened was a \"family affair\":\n\n\"The Embassy of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in the Republic of the Philippines confirms the incorrectness of what has been circulated on some social media platforms... what happened was a family matter and the citizen returned home with the family.\"\n\nThe event has brought to the forefront women's rights in Saudi Arabia and male guardianship laws. While some social media users rushed to Dina's aid, others called for Dina to be killed for stepping out of line with Saudi patriarchal society.\n\nAmid ongoing public outcry Dina's current whereabouts remain unknown. Sources stated that she is held at the Correctional Facility for Women in Riyadh while further procedures are being taken by the authorities in her case. On April 19, 2017, a Saudi government official with knowledge of the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Bloomberg that Dina Ali was being held in a detention facility for women aged under 30 as a precaution and does not face any charges, and authorities are trying to find \"appropriate solutions\" to allow her to live a normal life.\n\nMoudhi Aljohani said Dina's uncles hit her and told her they would kill her when they landed in Saudi Arabia. \"It is most likely that she is not alive,\" Aljohani said in her emotional video. She criticized rights organizations for doing little to aid in the situation and then called on people not to be silent. Mohamed al-Maady from the government-led Human Rights Commission in Saudi Arabia said the organisation would be coordinating with the Saudi ministry of social development to gather information on the case. No information was available in relation to her physical or mental wellbeing. She is at risk of legal sanctions under the charge of “disobedience” because of her attempt to escape from her guardian.\n\nHuman Rights Watch called on Saudi Arabia to reveal whether Lasloom is with her family or is being held by the state at a shelter. \"If held by the state, the authorities should disclose under what conditions she is being held, including whether she is at a shelter at her request and whether she has freedom of movement and ability to contact the outside world.\"\n\nDina's story triggered protest outside Saudi embassies in several countries around the world, most notably by the Labour Party in Ireland. The Labour Party also demanded to know if Ireland was among European UN members who voted Saudi Arabia onto the UN Commission on the Status of Women, the Irish government responded by refusing to disclose how they voted.\n\nA campaign was also started by Human Rights Watch, instructing social media users to tweet to Saudi King Salman using the hashtag #SaveDinaAli, urging a Royal Pardon.\n\nThe case continues to receive widespread media coverage due to the extreme and legally questionable nature of Dina's extradition.\n\nOn May 7, 2017, Russia Today published an entire segment on the event. The report came a day after United States President Donald Trump announced a foreign trip to Saudi Arabia, highlighting increased economic and political ties with the kingdom, while a deep cultural divide remains. A day earlier, a Saudi royal decree allowing women greater access to government services was passed.\n\nOn May 28, 2017 BBC World Service aired a segment chronicling Dina's attempted escape.\n\nOn 8 June 2017, Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB) organized a side event during the UN Human Rights Council’s 35th session, where Dina's case was a topic of the discussion.\n\nAfter Norwegian Public Broadcaster NRK referred Dina's story several parliamentarians, including Socialist Left Party Leader Audun Lysbakken and Abdi Raja, requested foreign minister Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide take up the women's rights situation with Saudi Arabia. \"This is an extreme form of gender apartheid. I would like to ask, if the Foreign Minister agrees, that Norway raise the matter with Saudi Arabia.\" said parliamentary representative Jan Bøhler. A meeting has been set for spring 2018. \n\n"}
{"id": "1474096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1474096", "title": "Electronic colonialism", "text": "Electronic colonialism\n\nElectronic colonialism theory was first started by Tom McPhail, a Canadian who began his career with Marshall McLuhan. Following a posting with UNESCO in Paris, McPhail wrote a book for SAGE entitled Electronic Colonialism: the Future of International Broadcasting and Communication in 1981. The foreword was written by Everett Rogers. The theory is about the impact on the mind of repeated mass media messages, including commercials, on audiences around the world. Just as earlier colonial institutions, like Great Britain, sought out soil anywhere in the world for colonies, now multimedia giants seek to capture the eyeballs, ears and minds of millions of viewers, readers, or listeners. Disney, MTV, Netflix, Comcast, Hollywood, CNN, BBC, Fox, Google, the Internet, and others—all seek to influence, not by force of arms, but by packaging media to attract large audiences for advertisers around the globe. The mass media over time will impact more and more individuals—primarily using the English language—to become more similar as indigenous films and artifacts become marginalized by a cultural tsunami created by high-quality and mass-produced media messages and systems.\n\nElectronic colonialism theory explains how mass media are leading to a new concept of empire. It will not be one based on military power or land acquisition but one based on controlling the mind. It is a psychological or mental empire. It is an evolving global \"Empire of the Mind.\" The global media are collectively influencing the minds, attitudes, values, and languages of individuals around the globe. It is an electronic mass media driven phenomena which over time will not only expand the frontiers of the multi-national communication firms but will far exceed even the vast reach of the declining, once-great British Empire.\n\nPrime examples of electronic colonialism are the initiatives of Google Inc. The first is to digitize the works of five major US and UK libraries. (The libraries are at Harvard, Stanford, the University of Michigan, Oxford University, and the New York Public Library—all Anglo-Saxon in language (English), history, focus, framing, and orientation. Google will help define the future of knowledge by its vast network power and global platform. The wealth and impact of other, non-English, libraries around the world will be both diminished and marginalized by the Google project. For example, the 600-year-old National Library of France will not contribute to the new data base and thus the 8-year-old-Google suddenly represents a major challenge to France's academic, cultural, and linguistic heritage.\n\nThe second example is a 2007 project to personalize Google's search results. Using the search history or pattern used by individuals, Google intends to customize information or thinking patterns to select which results to prioritize for each individual researcher. Google and other internet-based search services are attempting to get into the brains of users to aid in presenting more relevant results based on previous research patterns. Other search firms, such as Microsoft and Yahoo! are also attempting to develop unique algorithms to aid in customizing searches based on user patterns. It is not only the large corporations that are tracking user's'patterns. CenturyTel Inc. of Louisiana, a small telephone company, is also into behavior targeting. Using equipment installed on the phone lines, CenturyTel will collect data about every web site visited and then sell the information to external online advertisers.\n\nAll media and communication firms want a big piece of the $17 billion internet advertising market. By chasing more precise and detailed mapping behavior, via an algorithm, they want to deliver \"the minds\" of internet customers to a growing list of online advertisers.\n\nThe theory of electronic colonialism also examines the hegemonic power of the USA as it applies to the global cultural industries. This includes the American-centric control of the Internet via ICANN and the expansion of American media and communication empires around the world.\n\n"}

It is managed by the Foodsharing association (foodsharing e.V.) and was founded on December 12, 2012. On foodsharing.de individuals, retailers and producers can offer or collect food that would otherwise be thrown away. This service is completely free, and functions thanks to volunteer work. The projects' goal is to fight everyday food waste and to raise awareness about this problem in society.\n\nThe original idea to create a platform against food waste arose between Valentin Thurn, director of the film Taste the Waste, and Sebastian Engbrocks, supervisor of the film's social media campaign, in the summer of 2011. In early 2012 the design students Thomas Gerling and Christian Zehnter, and television journalist Ines Rainer, independently came up with a similar idea. The joint project is the result of the collaboration of all these individuals. From April to July 2012 they raised the necessary starting capital through crowdfunding via Startnext.de. The goal was to collect 10.000 EUR and in the end 11.594 EUR was received from 394 supporters.\n\nOn November 16 the platform entered beta phase and launched on December 12, 2012. A relaunch on May 12, 2013 equipped it with a revised design and new search options. In May 2013 it was also launched in Austria, initially under the name myfoodsharing.at, and is now merged with the German platform. As of February 2014 the German foodsharing.de has attracted close to 35.000 active users. It won the Greentec Award in the communication category on July 10, 2013.\n\nIn December 2014, foodsharing.de and lebensmittelretten.de, a web site founded by Raphael Fellmer and Raphael Wintrich, merged their operations. The functionality for sharing food with other individuals was taken from foodsharing.de, while the collaborations with shops and supermarkets was taken from lebensmittelretten.de.\n\nfoodsharing.de enables individuals to share food, whilst also allowing volunteers to pick up food from businesses to distribute it through public storage places. Since most supermarkets are organized as chains and therefore each branch has to follow standardized rules and regulations, the management is contacted directly. This results in regional and sometimes even national collaborations, e.g. with Bio Company. There are also many local co-operations with single supermarkets or bakeries, which are often started independently by members of the community.\n\nOther organizations like the German Tafel differ from foodsharing in that the surplus food is given to people before date expires. Whereas with foodsharing.de expired food is also distributed if it is still edible and does not pose a health risk. Volunteers (so-called 'foodsavers') need to sign a legal agreement that renders the businesses not liable and obliges the foodsavers to pass on the food for free. While the main focus of Tafel is to assert if someone is in need, foodsharing.de is interested only in saving food, without focusing on the financial circumstances of the recipient.\n\nIn contrast to dumpster diving, which is about taking non-spoiled food from waste containers, foodsaving.de wants to prevent food from being thrown away in the first place.\n"}

{"id": "19170396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19170396", "title": "IT baseline protection", "text": "IT baseline protection\n\nThe IT baseline protection (in German \"IT-Grundschutz\") approach from the German Federal Office for Information Security (FSI) is a methodology to identify and implement computer security measures in an organization. The aim is the achievement of an adequate and appropriate level of security for IT systems. To reach this goal the FSI recommends \"well-proven technical, organizational, personnel, and infrastructural safeguards\". Organizations and federal agencies show their systematic approach to secure their IT systems (e.g. Information Security Management System) by obtaining an \"ISO/IEC 27001 Certificate on the basis of IT-Grundschutz\".\n\nThe term baseline security signifies standard security measures for typical IT systems. It is used in various contexts with somewhat different meanings. For example:\n\nThe foundation of an IT baseline protection concept is initially not a detailed risk analysis. It proceeds from overall hazards. Consequently, sophisticated classification according to damage extent and probability of occurrence is ignored. Three protection needs categories are established. With their help, the protection needs of the object under investigation can be determined. Based on these, appropriate personnel, technical, organizational and infrastructural security measures are selected from the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs.\n\nThe Federal Office for Security in Information Technology's IT Baseline Protection Catalogs offer a \"cookbook recipe\" for a normal level of protection. Besides probability of occurrence and potential damage extents, implementation costs are also considered. By using the Baseline Protection Catalogs, costly security analyses requiring expert knowledge are dispensed with, since overall hazards are worked with in the beginning. It is possible for the relative layman to identify measures to be taken and to implement them in cooperation with professionals.\n\nThe FSI grants a baseline protection certificate as confirmation for the successful implementation of baseline protection. In stages 1 and 2, this is based on self declaration. In stage 3, an independent, FSI-licensed auditor completes an audit. Certification process internationalization has been possible since 2006. ISO/IEC 27001 certification can occur simultaneously with IT baseline protection certification. (The ISO/IEC 27001 standard is the successor of BS 7799-2). This process is based on the new FSI security standards. This process carries a development price which has prevailed for some time. Corporations having themselves certified under the BS 7799-2 standard are obliged to carry out a risk assessment. To make it more comfortable, most deviate from the protection needs analysis pursuant to the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. The advantage is not only conformity with the strict FSI, but also attainment of BS 7799-2 certification. Beyond this, the FSI offers a few help aids like the policy template and the GSTOOL.\n\nOne data protection component is available, which was produced in cooperation with the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information and the state data protection authorities and integrated into the IT Baseline Protection Catalog. This component is not considered, however, in the certification process.\n\nThe following steps are taken pursuant to the baseline protection process during structure analysis and protection needs analysis:\n\nCreation occurs in the following steps:\n\nAn IT network includes the totality of infrastructural, organizational, personnel, and technical components serving the fulfillment of a task in a particular information processing application area. An IT network can thereby encompass the entire IT character of an institution or individual division, which is partitioned by organizational structures as, for example, a departmental network, or as shared IT applications, for example, a personnel information system. It is necessary to analyze and document the information technological structure in question to generate an IT security concept and especially to apply the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. Due to today's usually heavily networked IT systems, a network topology plan offers a starting point for the analysis. The following aspects must be taken into consideration:\n\nThe purpose of the protection needs determination is to investigate what protection is sufficient and appropriate for the information and information technology in use.\nIn this connection, the damage to each application and the processed information, which could result from a breach of confidentiality, integrity or availability, is considered. Important in this context is a realistic assessment of the possible follow-on damages. A division into the three protection needs categories \"low to medium\", \"high\" and \"very high\" has proved itself of value. \"Public\", \"internal\" and \"secret\" are often used for confidentiality.\n\nHeavily networked IT systems typically characterize information technology in government and business these days. As a rule, therefore, it is advantageous to consider the entire IT system and not just individual systems within the scope of an IT security analysis and concept. To be able to manage this task, it makes sense to logically partition the entire IT system into parts and to separately consider each part or even an IT network. Detailed documentation about its structure is prerequisite for the use of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs on an IT network. This can be achieved, for example, via the IT structure analysis described above. The IT Baseline Protection Catalogs' components must ultimately be mapped onto the components of the IT network in question in a modelling step.\n\nThe baseline security check is an organisational instrument offering a quick overview of the prevailing IT security level. With the help of interviews, the status quo of an existing IT network (as modelled by IT baseline protection) relative to the number of security measures implemented from the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs are investigated. The result is a catalog in which the implementation status \"dispensable\", \"yes\", \"partly\", or \"no\" is entered for each relevant measure. By identifying not yet, or only partially, implemented measures, improvement options for the security of the information technology in question are highlighted.\n\nThe baseline security check gives information about measures, which are still missing (nominal vs. actual comparison). From this follows what remains to be done to achieve baseline protection through security. Not all measures suggested by this baseline check need to be implemented. Peculiarities are to be taken into account! It could be that several more or less unimportant applications are running on a server, which have lesser protection needs. In their totality, however, these applications are to be provided with a higher level of protection. This is called the (cumulation effect).\n\nThe applications running on a server determine its need for protection. In this connection, it is to be noted that several IT applications can run on an IT system. When this occurs, the application with the greatest need for protection determines the IT systems protection category.\n\nConversely, it is conceivable that an IT application with great protection needs does not automatically transfer this to the IT system. This may happen because the IT system is configured redundantly, or because only an inconsequential part is running on it. This is called the (distribution effect). This is the case, for example, with clusters.\n\nThe baseline security check maps baseline protection measures. This level suffices for low to medium protection needs. This comprises about 80% of all IT systems according to FSI estimates. For systems with high to very high protection needs, risk analysis-based information security concepts, like for example ISO/IEC 27000-series standards, are usually used.\n\nDuring its 2005 restructuring and expansion of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs, the FSI separated methodology from the IT Baseline Protection Catalog. The BSI 100-1, BSI 100-2, and BSI 100-3 standards contain information about construction of an information security management system (ISMS), the methodology or basic protection approach, and the creation of a security analysis for elevated and very elevated protection needs building on a completed baseline protection investigation.\n\nBSI 100-4, the \"Emergency management\" standard, is currently in preparation. It contains elements from BS 25999, ITIL Service Continuity Management combined with the relevant IT Baseline Protection Catalog components, and essential aspects for appropriate Business Continuity Management (BCM). Implementing these standards renders certification is possible pursuant to BS 25999-2. The FSI has submitted the FSI 100-4 standards design for online commentary under.\n\nThe FSI brings its standards into line with international norms like the ISO/IEC 27001 this way.\n\n\n"}

The bill has also been translated as Anti-Corruption and Bribery Prohibition Act, though \"Improper Solicitation and Graft Act\" is the official name. The law was passed in 2015 and started being enforced on September 28, 2016.\n\nThe law has been described in \"Financial Times\" as \"aimed at widespread corruption\" in the country. \"The Korea Times\" noted in 2014 that Korea was \"still lagging behind its peers\" in the OECD in terms of transparency. In Transparency International's 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, which annually ranks countries \"by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys,\" South Korea was ranked 43rd (higher rankings indicate higher levels of perceived corruption). This was the third-best performance among East Asian countries, behind Japan (15th) and Taiwan (35th).\n\nThe Kim Young-ran Act was not the first anti-corruption measure enacted in South Korea. The Criminal Act \"already prohibited domestic public officials from receiving, demanding or promising to accept a bribe in connection with their duties, and also prohibited individuals from giving or offering to give a bribe,\" and the 1998 Act on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions \"regulates bribery related to foreign officials.\"\n\nThe law was passed by the South Korean parliament in March 2015. The bill received bipartisan support in parliament. The law was formally promulgated by President Park Geun-hye as Act No. 13278 on March 26, 2015.\n\nIn July 2016, the Constitutional Court of Korea upheld the law, rejecting a challenge brought by the Korean Bar Association, the Journalists Association of Korea, and others, who argued that the law's provisions were unconstitutional. The challengers argued the law defines public officials too broadly by including private-school employees and journalists. The court also addressed the criticisms which suggested it would negatively affect the economy, saying \"Some argued that the law will discourage economic growth, but we have seen proof in advanced countries that a country advances when corruption decreases. Based on this situation, the law does not excessively violate basic rights.\"\n\nThe law took effect on September 28, 2016.\n\nThe law makes it illegal for public officials (including journalists, private school teachers and their spouses) to accept gifts of more than 50,000 won (about 45 USD) or 100,000 won (about 90 USD) at closed events such as weddings and funerals; it also limits dinner expenditures to 30,000 won (about 27 USD) per person. In addition, the law also prohibits fifteen categories of \"improper solicitations to public officials\"; such solicitations are prohibited even if not accompanied by a 'payment, offer, or promise to pay or provide, money or a thing of value.\" The legislation also includes \"seven categories of requests to which the Act does not apply.\" These exceptions have been criticized as vague.\n\nThe law clashed with Korean traditions, such as that the most senior person at a social gathering should pay the entire bill. Another controversy surrounds traditional gift baskets during holidays such as Chuseok, which usually are priced at 70–80,000 won. Both of those customs are made illegal by the law.\n\nSome Korean lobby groups like Federation of Korean Industries have opposed the law, arguing that it could cause economic losses for Korean economy, negatively affecting spending in some industry sectors, like in the restaurants business. \n\nSince the law came into force, many Korean officials reported that they are cancelling dinners and splitting bills at cheaper cafeterias, which have seen increased number of customers. On the other hand, higher-end restaurants, flower shops, golf courses, and chauffeur services at business and government districts reported a decline in business. Some officials also reported that they can return home earlier, spending more time with their families, as the number of work-related gatherings, often lasting until late hours, have been sharply curtailed.\n\nA survey conducted by Gallup Korea in early October 2016 showed that the law is supported by 71% of Koreans.\n\n"}

They are located in Aix-en-Provence, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lille, Lyon, Paris, Rennes, Strasbourg and Toulouse, and since 2014 Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Their vocation is the study and research of contemporary political science. All students at the IEPs study a curriculum that is highly practical and broadbased, focusing on the full range of the social sciences: law, economics, finance, management, etc. These schools are considered as some of the most selective in France, mainly because they are the place where main political and business leaders are born.\n\nThese establishments are more known under the name of Sciences Po, followed by the name of the city where they are located (for example Sciences Po Bordeaux). The epithet \"Sciences Po\" without precision of place indicates the IEP Paris. The Paris Institute is referred to as simply the Sciences Po because it is the school after which all other IEPs in France were modelled from the inception of the IEP system by Charles de Gaulle in 1945, apart from Strasbourg, which was created by the same law but with the status of an internal institute of the Robert Schuman University.\n\nAccording to article 2 of an 18 December 1989 decree, their mission is:\n\nThe Sciences Po approach and style inspired many universities in France but also abroad (the most famous example is that of the London School of Economics, founded on the model of the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques).\n\nThe ten Instituts d'études politiques are:\n\n\nThe other Instituts d'études politiques around the world are :\n\nEvery year an inter-IEP competition is held, hosted by the hometown of one of the IEPs and attended by participants from all 10 IEPs.

For a brief period, he essentially ran a separate, independent government from Haiti's central government.\n\nPerrier or Duperrier may have a been a slave on the Perrier plantation in the area of the Plaine des Cayes. In 1792, after a plantation revolt, general André Rigaud negotiated a settlement with slaves and masters which included 700 manumissions. Goman may have been one of the \"affranchis\".\n\nGoman, Nicolas Regnier, and Gilles Bénech were ex-slave leaders of the Platons insurrections of 1792-93. Subsequently, Goman became a company captain in the Third Regiment of the legion, though Goman proved to be a chronic deserter. After the civil war, Goman returned to his former master's plantation, again becoming a maroon after the French arrival. He met Jean Panier, and became the leader of his band after Panier's death, joining with Benech and Regnier still later. In 1803, Goman and Regnier had devised a plan of attack against Tiburon, assisted by plantation workers, who had deserted in large numbers, joining the insurrection. They were aided by mulatto officers of the French army.\n\nFrom 1807 to 1819, Goman led an autonomous farmers' republic that was situated in the southwest.\nThe peasant insurrection was financed by Henri Christophe and he had kept up a Kikongo tradition with his group of maroons until 1820. At the height of the insurrection, Goman was essentially running a separate independent government from Haiti's central government. Goman was pursued by Gens. Jérôme Maximilien Borgella and Lys for nine months before his ultimate defeat in 1820.\n\n"}
{"id": "15777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15777", "title": "Joseph Goebbels", "text": "Joseph Goebbels\n\nPaul Joseph Goebbels (; 29 October 1897 – 1 May 1945) was a German Nazi politician and Reich Minister of Propaganda of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945. He was one of Adolf Hitler's close associates and most devoted followers, and was known for his skills in public speaking and his deep, virulent antisemitism, which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust.\n\nGoebbels, who aspired to be an author, obtained a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1921. He joined the Nazi Party in 1924, and worked with Gregor Strasser in their northern branch. He was appointed as \"Gauleiter\" (district leader) for Berlin in 1926, where he began to take an interest in the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted controlling supervision over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempting to shape morale.\n\nIn 1943, Goebbels began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce \"total war\", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments production and the Wehrmacht.\n\nAs the war drew to a close and Nazi Germany faced defeat, Magda Goebbels and the Goebbels children joined him in Berlin. They moved into the underground \"Vorbunker\", part of Hitler's underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April. In accordance with Hitler's will, Goebbels succeeded him as Chancellor of Germany; he served one day in this post. The following day, Goebbels and his wife committed suicide, after poisoning their six children with cyanide.\n\nPaul Joseph Goebbels was born on 29 October 1897 in Rheydt, an industrial town south of Mönchengladbach near Düsseldorf. Both of his parents were Roman Catholics with modest family backgrounds. His father Fritz was a factory clerk; his mother Katharina (\"née\" Odenhausen) was ethnically Dutch. Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893–1947), Hans (1895–1949), Maria (1896–1896), Elisabeth (1901–1915), and Maria (1910–1949), who married the German filmmaker Max W. Kimmich in 1938. In 1932, Goebbels published a pamphlet of his family tree to refute the rumours that his grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.\n\nDuring childhood, Goebbels suffered from ill health, which included a long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.\nGoebbels was educated at a Christian \"Gymnasium\", where he completed his \"Abitur\" (university entrance examination) in 1917. He was the top student of his class and was given the traditional honour to speak at the awards ceremony. His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and Goebbels seriously considered it. He studied literature and history at the universities of Bonn, Würzburg, Freiburg, and Munich, aided by a scholarship from the Albertus Magnus Society. By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself from the church.\n\nHistorians, including Richard J. Evans and Roger Manvell, speculate that Goebbels' lifelong pursuit of women may have been in compensation for his physical disabilities. At Freiburg, he met and fell in love with Anka Stalherm, who was three years his senior. She went on to Würzburg to continue school, as did Goebbels. In 1921 he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, \"Michael\", a three-part work of which only Parts I and III have survived. Goebbels felt he was writing his \"own story\". Antisemitic content and material about a charismatic leader may have been added by Goebbels shortly before the book was published in 1929 by Eher-Verlag, the publishing house of the Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers' Party; NSDAP). By 1920, the relationship with Anka was over. The break-up filled Goebbels with thoughts of suicide.\n\nAt the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels wrote his doctoral thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. He had hoped to write his thesis under the supervision of Friedrich Gundolf, who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. Gundolf was no longer teaching, so directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg, also Jewish, recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921. By 1940 he had written 14 books.\n\nGoebbels then returned home and worked as a private tutor. He also found work as a journalist and was published in the local newspaper. His writing during that time reflected his growing antisemitism and dislike for modern culture. In the summer of 1922, he met and began a love affair with Else Janke, a schoolteacher. After she revealed to him that she was half-Jewish, Goebbels stated the \"enchantment [was] ruined.\" Nevertheless, he continued to see her on and off until 1927.\n\nHe continued for several years to try to become a published author. His diaries, which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write. The lack of income from his literary works (he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold) forced him to take jobs as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in Cologne, a job he detested. He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt. During this period, he read avidly and was influenced by the works of Oswald Spengler, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the British-born German writer whose book \"The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century\" (1899) was one of the standard works of the extreme right in Germany. He also began to study the \"social question\" and read the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, August Bebel and Gustav Noske. According to German historian Peter Longerich, Goebbels' diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied by \"religious-philosophical\" issues, and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries of mid-December 1923 forward show Goebbels was moving towards the \"völkisch\" nationalist movement.\n\nGoebbels first took an interest in Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1924. In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began in the wake of his failed attempt to seize power in the Beer Hall Putsch of November 8–9, 1923. The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda. Hitler was sentenced to five years prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year. Goebbels was drawn to the NSDAP mostly because of Hitler's charisma and commitment to his beliefs. He joined the NSDAP around this time, becoming member number 8762. In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to Karl Kaufmann, who was \"Gauleiter\" (NSDAP district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with Gregor Strasser, a leading Nazi organiser in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and to do secretarial work for the regional party offices. He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for Rhineland-Westphalia. Members of Strasser's northern branch of the NSDAP, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich. Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.\n\nHitler viewed Strasser's actions as a threat to his authority, and summoned 60 \"Gauleiters\" and party leaders, including Goebbels, to a special conference in Bamberg, in Streicher's \"Gau\" of Franconia, where he gave a two-hour speech repudiating Strasser's new political programme. Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean \"political bolshevization of Germany.\" Further, there would be \"no princes, only Germans,\" and a legal system with no \"... Jewish system of exploitation ... for plundering of our people.\" The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonising territories to the east. Goebbels was horrified by Hitler's characterisation of socialism as \"a Jewish creation\" and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property. He wrote in his diary: \"I no longer fully believe in Hitler. That's the terrible thing: my inner support has been taken away.\"\n\nAfter reading Hitler's book \"Mein Kampf\", Goebbels found himself agreeing with Hitler's assertion of a \"Jewish doctrine of Marxism\". In February 1926 Goebbels gave a speech titled \"Lenin or Hitler?\" in which he asserted that communism or Marxism could not save the German people, but he believed it would cause a \"socialist nationalist state\" to arise in Russia. In 1926, Goebbels published a pamphlet titled \"Nazi-Sozi\" which attempted to explain how National Socialism differed from Marxism.\n\nIn hopes of winning over the opposition, Hitler arranged meetings in Munich with the three Greater Ruhr \"Gau\" leaders, including Goebbels. Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally. The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them. Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: \"I love him ... He has thought through everything,\" \"Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius.\" He later wrote: \"Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius.\" As a result of the Bamberg and Munich meetings, Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded. The original National Socialist Program of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.\n\nAt Hitler's invitation, Goebbels spoke at party meetings in Munich and at the annual Party Congress, held in Weimar in 1926. For the following year's event, Goebbels was involved in the planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed. Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolise him even more.\n\nGoebbels was first offered the position of party \"Gauleiter\" for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and by the middle of October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern \"Gauleiters\" group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the \"Gau\". Goebbels was given control over the local \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) and \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany. Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues. His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.\n\nLike Hitler, Goebbels practised his public speaking skills in front of a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. Goebbels usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience. He used loudspeakers, fire decorations, uniforms, and marches to attract attention to speeches.\n\nGoebbels' tactic of using provocation to bring attention to the NSDAP, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the NSDAP from the city on 5 May 1927. Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets. Goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban until the end of October. During this period, he founded the newspaper \"Der Angriff\" (\"The Attack\") as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area, where few supported the party. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone; 126 libel suits were pending against Goebbels at one point. To his disappointment, circulation was initially only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic. Among the paper's favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police Bernhard Weiß. Goebbels gave him the derogatory nickname \"Isidore\" and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit. Goebbels continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book \"Michael\" finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (\"Der Wanderer\" and \"Die Saat\" (\"The Seed\")). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting. During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new. He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.\n\nThe ban on the NSDAP was lifted before the Reichstag elections on 20 May 1928. The NSDAP lost nearly 100,000 voters and earned only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they attained only 1.4 per cent of the vote. Goebbels was one of 12 NSDAP members to gain election to the Reichstag. This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Weiß. The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in \"Der Angriff\" over the course of the previous year.\n\nIn his newspaper \"Berliner Arbeiterzeitung\" (\"Berlin Workers Newspaper\"), Gregor Strasser was highly critical of Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent of the vote in some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.\n\nBy 1930 Berlin was the party's second-strongest base of support after Munich. That year the violence between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader Horst Wessel being shot by two members of the Communist Party of Germany. He later died in hospital. Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march \"Die Fahne hoch\" (\"Raise the flag\"), renamed as the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\", to be the NSDAP anthem.\n\nThe Great Depression greatly impacted Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment. During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in Berlin, the \"Nationaler Sozialist\". Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers' own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism. Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler, and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be \"pushed to the wall\". In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser and appointed Goebbels to replace him as Reich leader of NSDAP propaganda. One of Goebbels' first acts was to ban the evening edition of the \"Nationaler Sozialist\". Goebbels was also given control of other Nazi papers across the country, including the party's national newspaper, the \"Völkischer Beobachter\" (\"People's Observer\"). He still had to wait until 3 July for Otto Strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving the NSDAP. Upon receiving the news, Goebbels was relieved the \"crisis\" with the Strassers was finally over and glad that Otto Strasser had lost all power.\n\nThe rapid deterioration of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and Paul von Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees. He appointed Heinrich Brüning as chancellor. Goebbels took charge of the NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.\n\nIn late 1930 Goebbels met Magda Quandt, a divorcée who had joined the party a few months earlier. She worked as a volunteer in the party offices in Berlin, helping Goebbels organise his private papers. Her flat on the \"Reichskanzlerplatz\" soon became a favourite meeting place for Hitler and other NSDAP officials. Goebbels and Quandt married on 19 December 1931.\n\nFor two further elections held in 1932, Goebbels organised massive campaigns that included rallies, parades, speeches, and Hitler travelling around the country by aeroplane with the slogan \"the Führer over Germany\". Goebbels wrote in his diary that the Nazis must gain power and exterminate Marxism. He undertook numerous speaking tours during these election campaigns and had some of their speeches published on gramophone records and as pamphlets. Goebbels was also involved in the production of a small collection of silent films that could be shown at party meetings, though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium. Many of Goebbels' campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half-clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as \"International High Finance\". His propaganda characterised the opposition as \"November criminals\", \"Jewish wire-pullers\", or a communist threat. Support for the party continued to grow, but neither of these elections led to a majority government. In an effort to stabilise the country and improve economic conditions, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Reich chancellor on 30 January 1933.\n\nTo celebrate Hitler's appointment as chancellor, Goebbels organised a torchlight parade in Berlin on the night of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann Göring. Goebbels was disappointed not to be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post Goebbels was expecting to receive. Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. The NSDAP took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship—headed by Hitler—in its place. On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis at the end of the Second World War. While the NSDAP increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership. Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on 14 March.\n\nThe role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century Ordenspalais across from the Reich Chancellery, was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life. Goebbels hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the NSDAP had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population. One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in Potsdam on 21 March. He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorising the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, held on 1 April. Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.\n\nGoebbels converted the 1 May holiday from a celebration of workers' rights (observed as such especially by the communists) into a day celebrating the NSDAP. In place of the usual ad hoc labour celebrations, he organised a huge party rally held at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. The following day, all trade union offices in the country were forcibly disbanded by the SA and SS, and the Nazi-run German Labour Front was created to take their place. \"We are the masters of Germany,\" he commented in his diary entry of 3 May. Less than two weeks later, he gave a speech at the Nazi book burning in Berlin on 10 May, a ceremony he suggested.\n\nMeanwhile, the NSDAP began passing laws to marginalise Jews and remove them from German society. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans to retire from the legal profession and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise. The first Nazi concentration camps (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power. In a process termed \"Gleichschaltung\" (co-ordination), the NSDAP proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches. In a move to manipulate Germany's middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the \"Schriftleitergesetz\" (Editor's Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party's control of the popular press. Modeled to some extent on the system in Benito Mussolini's Italy, the law defined a \"Schriftleiter\" as anyone who wrote, edited, or selected texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria. The law required journalists to \"regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government.\"\n\nAt the end of June 1934, top officials of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the Night of Long Knives. Goebbels was present at the arrest of SA leader Ernst Röhm in Munich. On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as \"Führer und Reichskanzler\" (leader and chancellor).\n\nThe propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film censorship; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic. Goebbels style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable. He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public. Goebbels was successful at his job, however; \"Life\" wrote in 1938 that \"[p]ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department.\" John Gunther wrote in 1940 that Goebbels \"is the cleverest of all the Nazis\", but could not succeed Hitler because \"everybody hates him\".\n\nThe Reich Film Chamber, which all members of the film industry were required to join, was created in June 1933. Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages. Under the auspices of the \"Reichskulturkammer\" (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre. As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced. In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored. Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.\n\nGoebbels was particularly interested in controlling radio, which was then still a fairly new mass medium. Sometimes under protest from individual states (particularly Prussia, headed by Göring), Goebbels gained control of radio stations nationwide, and placed them under the \"Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft\" (German National Broadcasting Corporation) in July 1934. Manufacturers were urged by Goebbels to produce inexpensive home receivers, called \"Volksempfänger\" (people's receiver), and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold. Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans. On 2 September 1939 (the day after the start of the war), Goebbels and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty. Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime \"made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, 80 million people were deprived of independent thought.\"\n\nA major focus of Nazi propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a cult of personality. Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of Goebbels' propaganda work. Adulation of Hitler was the focus of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, where his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film \"Triumph of the Will\", one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by Leni Riefenstahl. It won the Gold Medal at the 1935 Venice Film Festival. At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that \"Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.\"\n\nGoebbels was involved in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started having an affair with the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938. A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors. A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year. Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.\n\nIn 1933, Hitler signed the \"Reichskonkordat\" (Reich Concordat), a treaty with the Vatican that required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches and to try to weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences. Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the \"Kirchenkampf\" (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.\n\nIn response to the persecution, Pope Pius XI had the \"Mit brennender Sorge\" (\"With Burning Concern\") Encyclical smuggled into Germany for Passion Sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit. It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church. In response, Goebbels renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics. His speech of 28 May in Berlin in front of 20,000 party members, which was also broadcast on the radio, attacked the Catholic church as morally corrupt. As a result of the propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime. Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling back of the church struggle by the end of July 1937.\n\nAs early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. Goebbels was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: \"[N]ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing.\" In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing \"war panic\" in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.\n\nAfter the Invasion of Poland in 1939, Goebbels used his propaganda ministry and the Reich chambers to control access to information domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals for the remainder of the Nazi era. Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.\n\nThe Propaganda Ministry took over the broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers as a way to gain the trust of the citizens. Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department. The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play. Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans. Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people. From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in \"Das Reich\" which were later read aloud over the radio. He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio. At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the Wehrmacht).\n\nGoebbels became preoccupied with morale and the efforts of the people on the home front. He believed that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be. For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front. At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more \"entertaining material\" in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment. As \"Gauleiter\" of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse. Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim. The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period – the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (February 1943) – were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and sceptical that it could be won. On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings. In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local \"Gauleiters\", and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.\n\nBy early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\" (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Martin Bormann, who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the \"Dreierausschuß\" (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance by September 1943.\n\nPartly in response to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce \"total war\", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels' dismay, Göring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription, even if they had child care available. After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war. His next speech, the Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the Bolshevik onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway. The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well. During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the \"extermination\" of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.\n\nGoebbels' efforts had little impact for the time being, as while Hitler was in principle in favour of total war, he was not prepared to implement changes over the objections of his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.\n\nAfter the Allied invasion of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet victory in the Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began to recognise that the war could no longer be won. Following the Allied invasion of Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.\n\nAs Germany's military and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took the lives of thousands of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.\n\nThroughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer continued to press Hitler to bring the economy to a total war footing. The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played into the hands of those who had been pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort. Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service. However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer. Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.\n\nAt Hitler's behest, the \"Volkssturm\" (People's Storm) – a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his \"Gau\" alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve on the front lines against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.\n\nIn the last months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine River, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had little in the way of fortifications or artillery (or even \"Volkssturm\" units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.\n\nWhen other Nazi leaders urged Hitler to leave Berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in the National Redoubt in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin. His family (except for Magda's son Harald, who had served in the Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end. He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January. He knew how the outside world would view the criminal acts committed by the regime, and had no desire to subject himself to the \"debacle\" of a trial. He burned his private papers on the night of 18 April.\n\nGoebbels knew how to play on Hitler's fantasies, encouraging him to see the hand of providence in the death of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April. Whether Hitler really saw this event as a turning point as Goebbels proclaimed is not known. By this time, Goebbels had gained the position he had wanted so long – at the side of Hitler. Göring was utterly discredited, although he was not stripped of his offices until 23 April. Himmler, whose appointment as commander of Army Group Vistula had led to disaster on the Oder, was also in disgrace with Hitler. Most of Hitler's inner circle, including Göring, Himmler, Ribbentrop, and Speer, prepared to leave Berlin immediately after Hitler's birthday celebration on 20 April. Even Bormann was \"not anxious\" to meet his end at Hitler's side. On 22 April, Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself. Goebbels moved with his family into the \"Vorbunker\", connected to the lower \"Führerbunker\" under the Reich Chancellery garden in central Berlin, that same day. He told Vice-Admiral Hans-Erich Voss that he would not entertain the idea of either surrender or escape. On 23 April, Goebbels made the following proclamation to the people of Berlin:\n\nAfter midnight on 29 April, with the Soviets advancing ever closer to the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony within the \"Führerbunker\". Afterwards, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. Goebbels and Bormann were two of the witnesses.\n\nIn his last will and testament, Hitler named no successor as Führer or leader of the Nazi Party. Instead, he appointed Goebbels as Reich Chancellor; Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, who was at Flensburg near the Danish border, as Reich President; and Bormann as Party Minister. Goebbels wrote a postscript to the will stating that he would disobey Hitler's order to leave Berlin: \"For reasons of humanity and personal loyalty\", he had to stay. Further, his wife and children would be staying, as well. They would end their lives \"side by side with the Führer\".\n\nIn the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler shot himself. Goebbels was depressed, and stated that he would walk around the Chancellery garden until he was killed by the Russian shelling. Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: \"It is a great pity that such a man (Hitler) is not with us any longer. But there is nothing to be done. For us, everything is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example.\"\n\nOn 1 May, Goebbels completed his sole official act as Chancellor. He dictated a letter to General Vasily Chuikov and ordered German General Hans Krebs to deliver it under a white flag. Chuikov, as commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile.\nLater on 1 May, Vice-Admiral Voss saw Goebbels for the last time: \"... While saying goodbye I asked Goebbels to join us. But he replied: 'The captain must not leave his sinking ship. I have thought about it all and decided to stay here. I have nowhere to go because with little children I will not be able to make it, especially with a leg like mine...' \" On the evening of 1 May, Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of cyanide could be then crushed in each of their mouths. According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS-\"Obersturmbannführer\" Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide.\n\nAt around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda left the bunker and walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they committed suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. One account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried, and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.\n\nThe bodies were then doused with petrol, but they were only partially burned and not buried. A few days later, Voss was brought back to the bunker by the Soviets to identify the partly burned bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their children. The remains of the Goebbels' family, Hitler, Braun, General Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. Those were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.\n\nLike many Germans of that time, Goebbels was antisemitic from a young age. After joining the NSDAP and meeting Hitler, his antisemitism grew and became more radical. He began to see the Jews as a destructive force with a negative impact on German society. After the Nazis seized power, he repeatedly urged Hitler to take action against the Jews. Despite his extreme antisemitism, Goebbels spoke of the \"rubbish of race-materialism\" and of the unnecessity of biological racism for the Nazi ideology. He also described Himmler's ideology as \"in many regards, mad\" and thought Alfred Rosenberg's theories were ridiculous.\n\nThe Nazi party's goal was to remove Jews from German cultural and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether. In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through pogroms, legislation, and other actions. Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin in the early years of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.\n\nIn November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath was killed in Paris by a young Jewish man. In response, Goebbels arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, and the result was the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalised in an event called \"Kristallnacht\" (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property, since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.\n\nGoebbels continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, which Goebbels helped to write:\n\nWhile Goebbels had been pressing for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, there were still 62,000 living in the city in 1940. Part of the delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in the armaments industry. Deportations of German Jews began in October 1941, with the first transport from Berlin leaving on 18 October. Some Jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as Riga and Kaunas. In preparation for the deportations, Goebbels ordered that all German Jews were required by law to wear an identifying yellow badge as of 5 September 1941. On 6 March 1942, Goebbels received a copy of the minutes of the Wannsee Conference. The document made the Nazi policy clear: the Jewish population of Europe was to be sent to extermination camps in occupied areas of Poland and killed. His diary entries of the period show that he was well aware of the fate of the Jews. \"In general, it can probably be established that 60 percent of them will have to be liquidated, while only 40 percent can be put to work. ... A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved,\" he wrote on 27 March 1942.\n\nGoebbels had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met. He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. He was one of the few top Nazi officials to do so publicly.\n\nHitler was very fond of Magda Goebbels and the children. He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax. Magda had a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends. She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.\n\nIn 1936, Goebbels met the Czech actress Lída Baarová and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her. Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about it on 15 August 1938. Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship. Thereafter, Joseph and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September. The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together. Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October. Magda too had affairs, including a relationship with Kurt Ludecke in 1933 and Karl Hanke in 1938.\n\nThe Goebbels family included Harald Quandt (Magda's son from her first marriage; born 1921), plus Helga (1932), Hilde (1934), Helmuth (1935), Holde (1937), Hedda (1938), and Heide (1940). Harald was the only member of the family to survive the war.\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}
{"id": "58359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58359", "title": "Kett's Rebellion", "text": "Kett's Rebellion\n\nKett's Rebellion was a revolt in Norfolk, England during the reign of Edward VI, largely in response to the enclosure of land. It began at Wymondham on 8 July 1549 with a group of rebels destroying fences that had been put up by wealthy landowners. One of their targets was yeoman farmer Robert Kett who, instead of resisting the rebels, agreed to their demands and offered to lead them. Kett and his forces, joined by recruits from Norwich and the surrounding countryside and numbering some 16,000, set up camp on Mousehold Heath to the north-east of the city on 12 July. The rebels stormed Norwich on 29 July and took the city. On the 1st of August the rebels defeated a Royal Army led by the Marquess of Northampton who had been sent by the government to suppress the uprising. Kett's rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of the Earl of Warwick at the Battle of Dussindale. Kett was captured, held in the Tower of London, tried for treason, and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle on 7 December 1549.\n\nThe 1540s saw a crisis in agriculture in England. With the majority of the population depending on the land, this led to outbreaks of unrest across the country. Kett's rebellion in Norfolk was the most serious of these. The main grievance of the rioters was enclosure, the fencing of common land by landlords for their own use. Enclosure left peasants with nowhere to graze their animals. Some landowners were forcing tenants off their farms so that they could engross their holdings and convert arable land into pasture for sheep, which had become more profitable as demand for wool increased. Inflation, unemployment, rising rents and declining wages added to the hardships faced by the common people. As the historian Mark Cornwall put it, they \"could scarcely doubt that the state had been taken over by a breed of men whose policy was to rob the poor for the benefit of the rich\".\n\nKett's rebellion, or \"the commotion time\" as it was also called in Norfolk, began in July 1549 in the small market town of Wymondham, nearly ten miles south-west of Norwich. The previous month there had been a minor disturbance at the nearby town of Attleborough where fences, built by the lord of the manor to enclose common lands, were torn down. The rioters thought they were acting legally, since Edward Seymour (1st Duke of Somerset, and Lord Protector during part of Edward VI's minority) had issued a proclamation against illegal enclosures. Wymondham held its annual feast on the weekend of 6 July 1549 and a play in honour of St Thomas Becket, the co-patron of Wymondham Abbey, was performed. This celebration was illegal, as Henry VIII had decreed in 1538 that the name of Thomas Becket should be removed from the church calendar. On the Monday, when the feast was over, a group of people set off to the villages of Morley St. Botolph and Hethersett to tear down hedges and fences. One of their first targets was Sir John Flowerdew, a lawyer and landowner at Hethersett who was unpopular for his role as overseer of the demolition of Wymondham Abbey (part of which was the parish church) during the dissolution of the monasteries and for enclosing land. Flowerdew bribed the rioters to leave his enclosures alone and instead attack those of Robert Kett at Wymondham.\n\nKett was about 57 years old and was one of the wealthier farmers in Wymondham. The Ketts (also spelt Ket, Cat, Chat, or Knight) had been farming in Norfolk since the twelfth century. Kett was the son of Tom and Margery Kett and had several brothers, and clergyman Francis Kett was his nephew. Two or possibly three of Kett's brothers were dead by 1549, but his eldest brother William joined him in the rebellion. Kett's wife, Alice, and several sons are not recorded as having been involved in the rebellion. Kett had been prominent among the parishioners in saving their parish church when Wymondham Abbey was demolished and this had led to conflict with Flowerdew. Having listened to the rioters' grievances, Kett decided to join their cause and helped them tear down his own fences before taking them back to Hethersett where they destroyed Flowerdew's enclosures. The following day, Tuesday 9 July, the protesters set off for Norwich. By now Kett was their leader and they were being joined by people from nearby towns and villages. A meeting point for the rebels was an oak tree on the road from Hethersett to Norwich. Known as Kett's Oak, it has been preserved by Norfolk County Council, and a new plaque was unveiled in 2006. The oak became a symbol of the rebellion when an oak tree on Mousehold Heath was made the centre of the rebel camp, but this \"Oak of Reformation\" no longer stands.\n\nKett and his followers camped for the night of 9 July at Bowthorpe, just west of Norwich. Here they were approached by the sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, Sir Edmund Wyndham, who ordered them to disperse. The response was negative, and the sheriff retreated back to Norwich. Next the rebels were visited by the mayor of Norwich, Thomas Codd, who met a similar response. The following night the rebels camped at nearby Eaton Wood and then, having been refused permission to march through Norwich to reach Mousehold Heath north-east of the city, crossed the River Wensum at Hellesdon and spent the night at Drayton. On Friday 12 July, the rebels reached Mousehold, where they had a vantage point overlooking Norwich, and set up the camp that was their base for the next six and a half weeks. The camp was the largest of several rebel camps that had appeared in East Anglia that summer. The rebels were known at the time as the \"camp men\" and the rebellion as the \"camping tyme\" or \"commotion tyme\".\nKett set up his headquarters in St Michael's Chapel, the ruins of which have since been known as Kett's Castle. Mount Surrey, a house built by the Earl of Surrey on the site of the despoiled St Leonard's Priory, had lain empty since the Earl's execution in 1547 and was used to hold Kett's prisoners. Kett's council, which consisted of representatives from the Hundreds of Norfolk and one representative from Suffolk met under the Oak of Reformation to administer the camp, issuing warrants to obtain provisions and arms and arrest members of the gentry. According to one source the Oak of Reformation was cut down by Norwich City Council in the 1960s to make way for a car park, although Reg Groves wrote in the 1940s that had already been destroyed. The camp was joined by workers and artisans from Norwich, and by people from the surrounding towns and villages, until it was larger than Norwich, at that time the second-largest city in England with a population of about 12,000. The city authorities, having sent messengers to London, remained in negotiation with the rebels and Mayor Thomas Codd, former Mayor Thomas Aldrich and preacher Robert Watson accepted the rebels' invitation to take part in their council.\n\nOnce the camp was established at Mousehold the rebels drew up a list of 29 grievances, signed by Kett, Codd, Aldrich and the representatives of the Hundreds, and sent it to Protector Somerset. The grievances have been described by one historian as a shopping-list of demands but which nevertheless have a strong logic underlying them, articulating \"a desire to limit the power of the gentry, exclude them from the world of the village, constrain rapid economic change, prevent the overexploitation of communal resources, and remodel the values of the clergy\". Although the rebels were all the while tearing down hedges and filling in ditches, only one of the 29 articles mentioned enclosure: 'We pray your grace that where it is enacted for enclosing, that it be not hurtful to such as have enclosed saffren grounds, for they be greatly chargeable to them, and that from henceforth no man shall enclose any more.' The exemption for 'saffren grounds' has puzzled historians; one has suggested that it may have been a scribal error for 'sovereign grounds', grounds that were the exclusive freehold property of their owners, while others have commented on the importance of saffron to local industry. The rebels also asked 'that all bondmen may be made free, for God made all free, with his precious blood shedding.' The rebels may have been articulating a grievance against the 1547 \"Act for the Punishment of Vagabonds\", which made it legal to enslave a discharged servant who did not find a new master within three days, though they may also have been calling for the manumission of the thousands of Englishmen and women who were serfs. (In 1549, an \"Act Touching on the Punishment of Vagabonds and Other Idle Persons\" avoided the word \"slave\" but retained many of the harshest provisions of the 1547 \"Act\".)\n\nThe truce between the city and the camp was ended on 21 July by a messenger from the King's Council, York Herald Bartholomew Butler, who arrived at Norwich from London, went with city officials to Mousehold, proclaimed the gathering a rebellion, and offered pardon. Kett rejected the offer, saying he had no need of a pardon because he had committed no treason. York Herald lacked the forces to arrest the rebels and retreated into Norwich with the Mayor. Kett and his followers were now officially rebels; the authorities therefore shut the city gates and set about preparing the city defences.\n\nKett was now left with a decision. He would not, probably could not, disperse the camp, but without access to the markets of Norwich, his people would starve. It was therefore decided to attack Norwich.\n\nIn the late evening of 21 July 1549, rebel artillery positioned on and beneath Mount Surrey, the heights opposite the Bishopsgate bridge, at the top of which now stands a memorial to the rebellion, opened fire. The bombardment and the response from the city's artillery entrenched next to the bridge and around the Cow Tower lasted through the night.\n\nAt first light on 22 July, Kett withdrew his artillery. The city defenders had repositioned six artillery pieces in the meadow behind the hospital (now the cricket ground of Norwich school) and were laying down such an accurate fire that the rebels feared the loss of all their guns. Under a flag of truce the rebels demanded access to the city, which the city authorities refused.\n\nKett's artillery, now on the slopes of Mousehold Heath, opened fire on the city. The guns in the hospital meadow could not reach far enough uphill to return the fire. At this point an assault began, ordered by Kett or perhaps by other rebel leaders. Thousands of rebels charged down from Mousehold and began swimming the Wensum between the Cow Tower and Bishops Gate. The city defenders fired volleys of arrows into the rebels as they crossed, but could not stop the attack. A running battle ensued. In the market square the York Herald tried to address the rebels, but as threats were made against him he fled in fear of his life. England's second largest city was in the hands of a rebel army.\n\nThe King sent the Marquess of Northampton with 1,500 men, including Italian mercenaries, to quell the rebellion. As he drew near to the city he sent forward his herald to demand the surrender of the city. The Deputy Mayor, Augustine Steward, responded. It was conveyed that the rebels had retreated back to the safety of the high ground overlooking the city. Kett had already seen how difficult it was to defend miles of walls and gates and had instead chosen to withdraw. It was much more prudent to allow Northampton's tiny army to defend the city while he again laid siege to it.\n\nOn the night of 31 July, the Royal army made its defensive preparations and started patrolling the city's narrow streets. Around midnight alarms rang out, waking Northampton. It appeared hundreds of rebels were using the cover of darkness and their knowledge of the maze of small streets and alleys around Tombland to launch hit-and-run attacks on Royal troops. Lord Sheffield suggested constructing ramparts along the eastern side of the city, which was open to attack, and warned that the rebels were crossing the river around Bishopsgate with ease.\n\nBy 8 am the following morning, 1 August, the ramparts were strengthened between the Cow Tower and Bishopsgate, so Sheffield retired to The Maid's Head inn for breakfast. A little after this, Northampton received information that the rebels wished to discuss surrender and were gathering around the Pockthorpe gate. Sheffield went with the Herald to discuss this apparent good turn of events with the rebels. On arrival, Sheffield found no rebels at all. It appears to have been either a false rumour or a diversion, as at that point thousands of rebels again began crossing the River Wensum around Bishopsgate.\n\nNorthampton's main force was in the market place. As the attack developed, he fed men through the streets into a growing and vicious street battle across the whole eastern area of the city. Seeing things going the rebels' way, Sheffield took command of a body of cavalry and charged the rebels across the cathedral precinct, past St Martin at Place Church and into Bishopsgate Street. Outside the Great Hospital in Bishopsgate Street, Sheffield fell from his horse into a ditch. Expecting then to be captured and ransomed, as was the custom, he removed his helmet, only to be killed by a blow from a rebel, reputedly a butcher named Fulke.\n\nWith the loss of a senior commander and his army being broken up in street fighting, Northampton ordered a retreat. The retreat did not stop until the remnants of the Royal Army reached Cambridge.\nThe Earl of Warwick was then sent with a stronger army of around 14,000 men including mercenaries from Wales, Germany and Spain. Warwick had previously fought in France, was a former member of the House of Commons and subsequently the Privy Council, making him a strong leader. Despite the increased threat, the rebels were loyal to Kett throughout and continued to fight Warwick's men.\n\nNorthampton served as Warwick’s second-in-command in the second attempt to deal with the rebel host, this time with a much larger force. Warwick managed to enter the city on 24 August by attacking the St Stephen's and Brazen gates. The rebels retreated through the city, setting fire to houses as they went in an attempt to slow the Royal army's advance. About 3 pm Warwick's baggage train entered the city. It managed to get lost and rather than halting in the market place it continued through Tombland and straight down Bishopsgate Street towards the rebel army. A group of rebels saw the train from Mousehold and ran down into the city to capture it. Captain Drury led his men in an attempt to recapture the train, which included all the artillery. He managed to salvage some of the guns in yet another fierce fight around Bishopsgate.\n\nAt 10 pm that same night shouts of \"fire\" started. The rebels had entered the city and were burning it. Warwick was in the same trap as Northampton had been, surrounded inside a city in danger of being burnt to the ground.\n\nAt first light on 25 August the rebels changed tactics. Their artillery broke down the walls around the northern area of the city near the Magdalen and Pockthorpe gates. With the north of the city again in rebel hands, Warwick launched an attack. Bitter street fighting eventually cleared the city once again. The rebels bombarded the city throughout the day and night.\n\nOn 26 August, 1,500 foreign mercenaries arrived in the city. These were German \"landsknechts\", a mix of handgunners and pikemen. With these reinforcements and the townsfolk, Warwick now had an army so formidable it could no longer hide within the city. Kett and his people were aware of this, and that night they left their camp at Mousehold for lower ground in preparation for battle.\n\nDuring the morning of 27 August, the armies faced each other outside the city. The final battle took place at \"Dussindale\", and was a disaster for the rebels. In the open, against well-armed and trained troops, thousands were killed and the rest ran for their lives.\n\nThe location of Dussindale has never been established. The most popular theory is that the dale began in the vicinity of the Plumstead Road East allotments that swept into Valley Drive and into the present remnant of Mousehold, into the Long Valley and out into what is now Gertrude Road and the allotments. In Victorian times this area was known as 'Ketts Meadow'. The name Dussindale has been given to a recent housing development in nearby Thorpe St Andrew.\n\nAbout 3,000 rebels are thought to have been killed at Dussindale, with Warwick's army losing some 250 men. The morning after the battle, 28 August, rebels were hanged at the Oak of Reformation and outside the Magdalen Gate. Estimates of the number vary from 30 to 300. Warwick had already executed 49 rebels when he had entered Norwich a few days before. There is only one attested incident in which the rebels had killed in cold blood: one of Northampton's Italian mercenaries had been hanged following his capture.\n\nKett was captured at the village of Swannington the night after the battle and taken, together with his brother William, to the Tower of London to await trial for treason. Found guilty, the brothers were returned to Norwich at the beginning of December. Kett was hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle on 7 December 1549; on the same day William was hanged from the west tower of Wymondham Abbey.\n\nIn 1550, the Norwich authorities decreed that in future 27 August should be a holiday to commemorate \"the deliverance of the city\" from Kett's Rebellion, and paid for lectures in the cathedral and parish churches on the sins of rebellion. This tradition continued for over a century.\n\nThe only known surviving eye-witness account of the rebellion, a manuscript by Nicholas Sotherton, son of a Norwich mayor, is hostile towards the rebels. So too is Alexander Neville's 1575 Latin history of the rebellion, \"De furoribus Norfolciensium\". Neville was secretary to Matthew Parker, who had preached to Kett's followers under the Oak of Reformation on Mousehold, unsuccessfully appealing to them to disperse. In 1615 Neville's work was translated into English by Norfolk clergyman Richard Woods under the title \"Norfolke Furies\" and was reprinted throughout the following century. Kett's name was thus kept alive as a \"reviled symbol of rustic violence\". It was only in the 19th century that more sympathetic portrayals of the rebellion appeared in print and started the process that saw Kett transformed from traitor to folk hero. An anonymous work of 1843 was critical of Neville's account of the rebellion, and in 1859 clergyman Frederic Russell, who had unearthed new material in archives for his account of the rebellion, concluded that \"though Kett is commonly considered a rebel, yet the cause he advocated is so just, that one cannot but feel he deserved a better name and a better fate\".\nIn 1948, Alderman Fred Henderson, a former mayor of Norwich who had been imprisoned in the Castle for his part in the food riots of 1885, proposed a memorial to Kett. Originally hoping for a statue, he settled for a plaque on the walls of Norwich Castle engraved with his words and unveiled in 1949, 400 years after the rebellion. In the 21st century the death of Kett is still remembered by the people of Norwich. On 7 December 2011, the anniversary of his death, a memorial march by members of Norwich \"Occupy\" and Norwich Green Party took place and a wreath was laid by the gates of Norwich Castle.\n\nAfter the rebellion the lands of Kett and his brother William were forfeited, although some of them were later restored to one of his sons. In the longer term the Kett family do not seem to have suffered from their association with the rebellion, but to have prospered in various parts of Norfolk. George Kett, a descendant of Kett's younger brother Thomas, moved to Cambridge and co-founded the architectural masonry company of Rattee and Kett. George Kett's son, also George, was mayor of Cambridge on three occasions and compiled a genealogy of the Kett family.\n\nThe rebellion is remembered in the names of schools, streets, pubs and a walking route in the Norwich and Wymondham area, including the Robert Kett Junior School in Wymondham, Dussindale Primary School in Norwich, the Robert Kett pub in Wymondham, Kett House residence at the University of East Anglia, and Kett's Tavern in Norwich, and in a folk band, Lewis Garland and Kett's Rebellion, and a beer, Kett's Rebellion, by Woodforde's Brewery in Norwich.\n\nKett's rebellion has featured in novels, including Frederick H. Moore's \"Mistress Haselwode: A tale of the Reformation Oak\" (1876), F.C. Tansley's \"For Kett and Countryside\" (1910), Jack Lindsay's \"The Great Oak\" (1949), Sylvia Haymon's children's story \"The Loyal Traitor\" (1965), Margaret Callow's \"A Rebellious Oak\" (2012), and C.J. Sansom's \"Tombland\" (2018); plays, including George Colman Green's \"Kett the tanner\" (1909); and poetry, including Keith Chandler's collection \"Kett's Rebellion and Other Poems\" (1982). In 1988 British composer Malcolm Arnold produced the \"Robert Kett Overture (Opus 141)\", inspired by the rebellion.\n\n"}

While it provides the services of a universal bank, it is officially classified as a \"specialized government bank\" with a universal banking license.\n\nLANDBANK is the fourth largest bank in the Philippines in terms of assets and is the largest government-owned bank. It is also one of the biggest government owned and controlled corporations in the Philippines.\n\nUnlike most Philippine banks, LANDBANK has an extensive rural branch network with 365 Branches/Units and 1,607 ATMs. It services many rural sector clients in areas where banking is either limited to rural banks or is non-existent.\n\nIn 2015, it planned to merge with DBP but it did not push through.\n\nOn February 4, 2016, President Benigno Aquino III approved the Executive Order #198 on the merger between Land Bank and the DBP, with the former as the surviving entity.\n\nLANDBANK was established on August 8, 1963 as part of the Agricultural Land Reform Code as part of a program of land reform in the Philippines. It was to help with the purchase of agricultural estates for division and resale to small landholders and the purchase of land by the agricultural lessee. In 1965, LANDBANK's by-laws were approved and its first board of trustees was formed, with the Secretary of Finance as Chairman.\n\nOn October 21, 1972, Presidential Decree No. 27, signed by President Ferdinand Marcos, emancipated all tenant farmers working on private agricultural lands devoted to rice and corn, whether working on a landed estate or not. The system was implemented through a system of sharecropping or lease-tenancy. LANDBANK was tasked to collect 15-year land amortizations from beneficiaries at the cost of the value of the land plus six percent interest per annum.\n\nBy 1973, LANDBANK was in financial distress. It lacked the resources and the capital needed to implement the land reform programs and lacked the structure to implement the programs efficiently. On July 21, Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 251 which revitalized the bank. The decree granted LANDBANK a universal banking license (the first bank in the Philippines to be issued such a license) with a social mission to spur countryside development. The decree expanded LANDBANK's powers to include lending for agricultural, industrial, homebuilding and home-financing projects and other productive enterprises, as well as lending to farmers' cooperatives and associations to facilitate production, marketing of crops and acquisition of essential commodities. LANDBANK was also required by the decree to provide timely and adequate support in all phases involved in the execution of agrarian reform and also increased its authorized capital to 3 billion pesos. It also became exempted from all national, provincial, city and municipal taxes and assessments.\n\nLANDBANK was reorganized in 1977 when it was divided into three sectors to better assess the needs of its customers. It was divided into Agrarian, Banking and Operations sectors to strengthen operations and ensure long-term viability.\n\nIn 1982, the Agricultural Credit Administration (ACA), established under the same law as Landbank, was abolished and all its assets and functions transferred to Landbank. ACA's function was to extend credit to small farmers. Also in this year, Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank) was formed, with LANDBANK having a 40-percent stake in the government-owned commercial bank.\n\nLANDBANK became the financial intermediary for the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) in 1988. It was also in that year that UnionBank started a gradual privatization. The Aboitiz Group of Companies acquired Landbank's 40% share of UnionBank then which it continues to own. LANDBANK also became the third member of Expressnet, an interbank network in December 1991 but now a BancNet member.\n\nOn February 23, 1995, LANDBANK's charter was once again amended. Its authorized capital was increased to nine billion pesos and it became an official government depository. The number of members of the board of trustees was also increased to nine. On August 25, 1998, Landbank's authorized capital was once again increased to 25 billion pesos, and it then increased to 200 billion pesos, after the DBP-LANDBANK merger in 2016.\n\nLANDBANK competes against the major banks such as Metrobank, Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), Banco de Oro and Philippine National Bank (PNB). In rural areas, it either competes against or complements rural banks.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, LANDBANK takes on a dual role with the Development Bank of the Philippines, another government-owned bank. It either competes against or works with DBP, depending on the situation.\n\nLANDBANK has the following subsidiaries and affiliates:\n\n\n\n"}

Peasants were bound to their lords by heavy duties. The \"mainmorte\" system allowed a lord to inherit all the property of a peasant who died childless. This caused the estates of the lords to grow larger and larger. Both peasants and lords had little incentives to invest in agricultural or industrial improvements.\n\nIn 1720, Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, the duke of Savoy, had financial problems. To increase his income, he expropriated all estates held by lords who could not produce title to their lands. Subsequently, he began levying taxes on the nobility. These were the first steps in reducing the power of the feudal lords.\n\nHis son Charles Emmanuel III continued his reforms, and in 1762 he abolished all \"mainmorte\" on the royal estates and personal mainmorte on private estates. In 1771 he also abolished real-estate mainmorte on private estates. In this year he also declared that all duties of peasants towards their lords could be redeemed on terms to be set by negotiation between peasant and seigneur. If no agreement was reached, the duke himself would set the terms. This provision gave leverage to the peasants.\n\nNegotiations were long and slow, but by 1792, when the French Revolution came to Savoy, all estates had been at least partially emancipated. At 1793, the Revolutionary Government of France declared full emancipation with no further redemption price.\n\n"}
{"id": "2900008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2900008", "title": "Lawburrows", "text": "Lawburrows\n\nLawburrows is a little-known civil action in Scots law initiated by one person afraid of another's possible violence.\n\nThe 1429 Act remains in force and says \n\nIt is said that, in some communities, there is a fear of violence from certain known people and that the criminal law has been rendered somewhat ineffective because of the need to involve the police, the Procurator Fiscal (the Scottish name for a prosecutor), to provide witnesses and to establish the case \"beyond reasonable doubt\". Civil law is about the enforcement of private rights and obligations between individuals. Lawburrows enables people to \"take the law into their own hands\" by exercising their rights under civil law. Legal aid is available for civil actions.\n\nThe standard of proof in civil cases is much less onerous than that of criminal law and so too is the standard required of the evidence.\n\nThe most common action against someone who threatens violence is interdict or court order, but this can be refused by the court on the grounds of public interest. Since public interest (the general effects of the action on the welfare of society) is involved, corroborative witnesses may be required. Interdict may require the defender to refrain from a specific conduct. Although provisional interdicts can be granted speedily, obtaining a perpetual interdict may be very time consuming and costly.\n\nA great disadvantage of interdict is the uncertainty about what happens should the defender disobey the interdict. If it is a first offence, a mild or nominal punishment may be imposed or a warning given.\n\nIn Scotland the alternative to interdicts is \"lawburrows\". This was first passed by a Parliament of James I in 1429 as a remedy against threats to the safety of members of the public. The aim of Lawburrows was stated in the Act \"...to prevent such delinquences (the issuing of threats) and terrify evil doers...\" The process is remarkable for its simplicity, speed of execution, low cost of process and the absolute certainty of the exact penalty should the order be contravened. Neither the police nor the Procurator Fiscal is involved unless there is a contravention of lawburrows.\n\nVery roughly: If Alice is put in fear by Bob, Alice asks a Sheriff to hear the case against Bob (this is a civil action and so standard of proof is low). If proven, the Sheriff shall require a deposit from Bob. If, later, Alice shows the Sheriff that Bob has continued to put Alice in fear, the deposit is forfeited and divided equally between Alice and the Court. This does not preclude a criminal action being taken against Bob.\n\nIn an initial writ to the Sheriff Court, the pursuer asserts that he fears harm to his person, property, family, tenant or employees from the defender. He asks the Sheriff to obtain a certain sum of money (a \"caution\") or a bond as security against being molested or troubled further by the defender.\n\nAs soon as this writ is received, the Sheriff must immediately order it to be served on the defender and a date for an early hearing has to be fixed at the same time.\n\nAt the hearing, the standard of proof is \"on the balance of probabilities\" as in other civil actions, so only one credible witness is needed if there is evidence to show that are reasonable grounds for the pursuer’s fear of harm. The pursuer himself may be that witness, although it has been held that corrobarative evidence may be required. This is a summary procedure—no jury is present and no shorthand notes of the evidence are kept.\n\nIf the pursuer is successful, the Sheriff can order a sum of money to be found (or a bond to be given) and he can order that, should the defender fail to provide this, he shall be imprisoned for up to six months.\n\nIf the defender does any harm of the kind specified in the initial writ, the pursuer may (with the consent of the Procurator Fiscal) raise an action for \"contravention of lawburrows\" asking that the money, or bond, be forfeited and divided equally between the Crown and himself.\n\nThe action for contravention of lawburrows does not preclude any other remedies, such as a civil action for damages for assault, or criminal proceedings by the Procurator Fiscal.\n\n\nThe remedy of lawburrows has a very long history. Its application is very narrow, referring only to people being put in fear and there are many alternative remedies in the criminal law, involving the police to whom people put in fear are most likely to appeal in the first instance. Many attempts to obtain remedies in this way are thwarted by the reluctance of the police to get involved in domestic disputes and quarrels between neighbours, often because of the difficulty of obtaining the witnesses needed in criminal proceedings. Such a need is largely circumvented in actions of lawburrows. Although little known to the public, and even to some solicitors, lawburrows is still in use in the present time.\n\nSeveral cases in the 1980s failed because lawburrows was misapplied and, consequently, in 1988, the case for the repeal or the overhaul of lawburrows was argued cogently by W J Stewart.\n\nCivil Judicial Statistics Scotland records 25 instances in the four-year period 1999—2002, 17 of which were in 2001.\n\n\n"}

During his childhood, his father died, and he had to work to help support the family. He worked in a series jobs in Jerusalem, in Ramatayim, and in the kibbutzim of Negba and Givat HaShlosha.\n\nWhile at Givat HaShlosha, Feinstein joined the Haganah. During his military training, Feinstein, an aspiring writer, educated himself in secular subjects with books sent to him by his brother from Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1944, during World War II, after rumors of the Holocaust began spreading, Feinstein enlisted in the British Army. Although only 16 at the time, he enlisted using a forged birth certificate claiming he was 20. Feinstein was accepted and served for two and a half years in the Royal Engineers, during which he was stationed in Palestine, Alexandria, and Beirut. He was discharged from the British Army in August 1946.\n\nWhile still in the British Army, Feinstein had met other Palestinian Jews who were Irgun members, and he began helping them smuggle weapons stolen from British military camps to Palestine for Irgun use.\n\nFollowing his discharge, he joined the Irgun's Jerusalem branch. He initially worked in the Irgun's propaganda section, but was eventually promoted to join the Combat Corps.\n\nOn October 30, 1946, Feinstein participated in a raid on the Jerusalem railway station. The attack was one of a series of sabotage operations the Irgun carried out against the railways that day, as part of the Irgun's overall efforts to paralyze the British Mandatory government. The British had advance intelligence of the plan, and the operation was further compromised when the Irgun, not wanting to harm civilians in the station, published an advance warning. On the day of the raid, the British were waiting in ambush at the station. The Irgun raiders arrived in two taxis, and Feinstein drove the one carrying the bombs which were to be used - three suitcases filled with explosives. The team then rushed into the station, laid the three suitcase bombs, and put up a sign warning of mines. However, they came under British fire, and four of the attackers were hit, including Feinstein, whose left arm was shattered. Feinstein and some teammates rushed back to his taxi, and managed to escape. Despite his injury, Feinstein managed to drive the taxi, under a hail of British gunfire, away from the station using only one arm. After their escape, the British attempted to remove the suitcase bombs they had abandoned. When a police sapper tried to lift one of the bombs, it exploded, killing him and devastating the interior of the station.\n\nAfter escaping, Feinstein drove the taxi to Jerusalem's Yemin Moshe quarter, where the team then scattered, hoping to slip away. Feinstein's arm, however, continued bleeding heavily, and he left a trail of blood behind him. Shortly afterward, the police discovered the abandoned taxi, riddled by bullets and with blood-soaked seats, in the Yemin Moshe quarter. Feinstein was arrested when they followed the trail of blood from the taxi to Feinstein. He was taken to hospital, where his shattered left arm was amputated.\n\nFeinstein's trial in a Jerusalem military court opened on March 25, 1947. He did not participate in the proceedings, refused legal counsel, and refused to recognize the authority of the British court to try him, other than to speak at the summation. Before the reading of the verdict Feinstein gave a defiant speech against British rule, saying:\nOfficers of the army of conquest!\nA regime of hanging trees is the regime you wish to impose on this land, which was destined to be a lighthouse for all of \nhumanity, and in your foolish wickedness, you presumed that by this regime you will break our people's spirit, the people to whom \nthis whole country had been a gallows. You were wrong. You will learn that you have encountered steel, steel forged in the fire \nof love and hatred - love for the homeland and freedom, hatred for enslavement and invader. Burning steel it is. You will not \nbreak it. You will burn your hands.\n\nHow great is your blindness, British tyrants? Did you not notice who stands against you in this campaign, unexampled in the \nhistory of mankind? Shall you scare us with death? We, who have listened for years to the rattling of the wheels of them Railroad \ncars, who led our brothers, our parents, the best of our nation - to slaughter, which too had no precedent in human history? We, \nwho asked, and ask ourselves everyday: in what are we better than them? From the millions of our brothers? What have we won? For \nwe could have been among them and with them in the days of fear and in the moments of dying.\n\nAnd to these recurring questions, there is in our conscience but one answer: we remained alive not to live and await in \nconditions of slavery and oppression, a new Treblinka. We remained alive, to ensure life, freedom and dignity for us, for our \nnation, for our children and their children for generations to come. We remained alive so that it wouldn't matter anymore that \nwhich happened there and might happen under your rule, the rule of treason, the rule of blood.\n\nTherefore we shall not be frightened, for we have learned and by countless of victims for nothing we have learned - that there is \nlife worse than death, and there is death greater than life… \nOn April 21, 1947, a few hours before their scheduled execution by hanging in the Jerusalem Central Prison in the Russian Compound, now the Museum of the Underground Prisoners, could be carried out, he and his friend and fellow prisoner Moshe Barazani blew themselves up in their cells with an improvised grenade which had been smuggled to them in a hollowed-out oranges. They lit the grenade and then stood embracing each other, with the grenade lodged between them.\nThe story of Feinstein and Barazani became one of the most famous tales in the history of Zionism. Menachem Begin was so moved by the deeds of the two men that he requested in his will that he be buried next to them on the Mount of Olives, which he was.\n\nJust before his death, Feinstein gave to British prison guard Thomas Henry Goodwin, whom he and Barazani had nicknamed \"the good jailer\", a copy of the Bible, inscribed in Hebrew and English, \"In the shadow of the gallows, 21.4.47. To the British soldier as you stand guard. Before we go to the gallows, accept this Bible as a memento and remember that we stood in dignity and marched in dignity. It is better to die with a weapon in your hands than to live with hands raised. Meir Feinstein\". He then requested a moment of privacy for prayer, which prevented Goodwin from being able to stop the grenade being detonated (saving Goodwin from being injured by the grenade). In 2007, Goodwin's son Dennis donated the Bible to Feinstein's nephew Eliezer, who received it on behalf of the Museum of Underground Prisoners in Jerusalem at a commemorative state ceremony.\n\nMenachem Begin brought up the story during a speech in 1981:\n\n\"Our Mizrahim were courageous fighters – already in the underground. Feinstein was from European origins, What's it called? Ashkenazi. Moshe Barazani was a Sephardic Jew from Iraq. In the night, after they were sentenced to death, they were due to be taken to the gallows in the early morning, the Rabbi insisted that he would come to accompany them and they didn't want to harm the Rabbi. They held close to their hearts a hand grenade – they pulled the trigger... Ashkenazi? Iraqi? Jews! Brothers! Fighters!\"\n"}

It was created on same principles that existed during the Russian Empire where cultural life in Ukraine was administrated by the Russian Ministry of Enlightenment (see Ministry of National Education (Russian Empire)). In May of 1918 there was established Ministry of People's Education and Arts headed by Mykola Vasylenko. Later there was \"Ministry of Art\" headed by Dmytro Antonovych (December 1918 - February 1919) that was disbanded soon after the Soviet invasion of Ukraine. \n\nThere also existed \"Ministry of Confessions\" that was first created during the government of Skoropadsky on April 30, 1918 and was at first headed by Mykola Vasylenko.

{"id": "677516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=677516", "title": "Negative campaigning", "text": "Negative campaigning\n\nNegative campaigning or mudslinging is the process of deliberate spreading negative information about someone or something to worsen the public image of the described.\n\nDeliberate spreading of such information can be motivated either by honest desire of the campaigner to warn others against real dangers or deficiencies of the described, or by the campaigner's dishonest ideas on methods of winning in political, business or other spheres of competition against an honest rival.\n\nThe public image of an entity can be defined as reputation, esteem, respect, acceptance of the entity's appearance, values and behaviour by the general public of a given territory and/or a social group, possibly within time limits. As target groups of public and their values differ, so negativity or positivity of a public image is relative: e.g. while in most societies having an honest source of income is a positive value and stealing is discouraged, in the world of professional thieves honest work is frowned upon and stealing is encouraged. In polygamous societies monogamy is not viewed in the way it is valued in monogamous societies. Values of a society also change with time: e.g. homosexuality in Western culture was considered immoral and was criminally prosecuted until the sexual revolution of the second half of the 20 century.\nThus negative campaigning to be successful has to take into account current values of the group it addresses. The degree of strictness in practicing the group's values as opposed to its tolerance for violating the norms has also to be taken into consideration: e.g. while in the Old Testament and other traditional religious societies adultery and prostitution were outlawed and supposed to be punished by death, modern Western societies show much greater tolerance to these.\n\nIn United States politics, negative campaigning has been called \"as American as Mississippi mud\" and \"as American as apple pie\". Some research suggests negative campaigning is the norm in all political venues, mitigated only by the dynamics of a particular contest.\n\nThere are a number of techniques used in negative campaigning. Among the most effective is running advertisements attacking an opponent's personality, record, or opinion. There are two main types of ads used in negative campaigning: attack and contrast.\n\nAttack ads focus exclusively on the negative aspects of the opponent. There is no positive content in an attack ad, whether it is about the candidate or the opponent. Attack ads usually identify the risks associated with the opponent, often exploiting people’s fears to manipulate and lower the impression voters have of the opponent. Because attack ads have no positive content, they have the potential to be more influential than contrast ads in shaping voters’ views of the sponsoring candidate’s opponent.\n\nUnlike attack ads, contrast ads contain information about both the candidate and the opponent. The information about the candidate is positive, while the information about the opponent is negative. Contrast ads compare and contrast the candidate with the opponent, juxtaposing the positive information about the candidate with the negative information of the opponent. Because contrast ads must contain positive information, contrast ads are seen as less damaging to the political process than attack ads.\n\nOne of the most famous such ads was \"Daisy Girl\" by the campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson that successfully portrayed Republican Barry Goldwater as threatening nuclear war. Common negative campaign techniques include painting an opponent as soft on criminals, dishonest, corrupt, or a danger to the nation. One common negative campaigning tactic is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign.\n\nDirty tricks are also common in negative political campaigns. These generally involve secretly leaking damaging information to the media. This isolates a candidate from backlash and also does not cost any money. The material must be substantive enough to attract media interest, however, and if the truth is discovered it could severely damage a campaign. Other dirty tricks include trying to feed an opponent's team false information hoping they will use it and embarrass themselves.\n\nOften a campaign will use outside organizations, such as lobby groups, to launch attacks. These can be claimed to be coming from a neutral source and if the allegations turn out not to be true the attacking candidate will not be damaged if the links cannot be proven. Negative campaigning can be conducted by proxy. For instance, highly partisan ads were placed in the 2004 U.S. presidential election by allegedly independent bodies like MoveOn.org and Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.\n\nPush polls are attacks disguised as telephone polls. They might ask a question like \"How would you react if Candidate A was revealed to beat his wife?\", giving the impression that Candidate A might beat his wife. Members of the media and of the opposing party are deliberately not called making these tactics all but invisible and unprovable.\n\nG. Gordon Liddy played a major role in developing these tactics during the Nixon campaign playing an important advisory of rules that led to the campaign of 1972. James Carville, campaign manager of Bill Clinton's 1992 election, is also a major proponent of negative tactics. Lee Atwater, best known for being an advisor to presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, also pioneered many negative campaign techniques seen in political campaigns today.\n\nSponsors of overt negative campaigns often cite reasons to support mass communication of negative ideas. The Office of National Drug Control Policy uses negative campaigns to steer the public away from health risks. Similar negative campaigns have been used to rebut mass marketing by tobacco companies, or to discourage drunk driving. Those who conduct negative political campaigns sometimes say the public needs to know about the person he or she is voting for, even if it is bad. In other words, if a candidate’s opponent is a crook or a bad person, then he or she should be able to tell the public about it.\n\nMartin Wattenberg and Craig Brians, of the University of California, Irvine, considered in their study whether negative campaigning mobilizes or alienates voters. They concluded that data used by Stephen Ansolabehere in a 1994 American Political Science Review article to advance the hypothesis that negative campaigning demobilizes voters was flawed.\n\nA subsequent study done by Ansolabehere and Shanto Iyengar in 1995 corrected some of the previous study's flaws. This study concluded that negative advertising suppressed voter turnout, particularly for Independent voters. They speculated that campaigns tend to go negative only if the Independent vote is leaning toward the opponent. In doing so, they insure that the swing voters stay home, leaving the election up to base voters. They also found that negative ads have a greater impact on Democrats than on Republicans. According to them, base Republicans will vote no matter what (and will vote only for a Republican), but Democrats can be influenced to either stay home and not vote at all or to switch sides and vote for a Republican. This, combined with the effect negativity has on Independents, led them to conclude that Republicans benefit more from going negative than Democrats.\n\nOther researchers have found different, more positive outcomes from negative campaigns. Rick Farmer, PhD, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Akron found that negative ads are more memorable than positive ads when they reinforce a preexisting belief and are relevant to the central issues of a marketing campaign. Researchers at the University of Georgia found the impact of negative ads increases over time, while positive ads used to counteract negative ads lack the power of negative ads . Research also suggests negative campaigning introduces controversy and raises public awareness through additional news coverage .\n\nMost recently, Kyle Mattes and David P. Redlawsk in \"The Positive Case for Negative Campaigning\" show through surveys and experiments that negative campaigning provides informational benefits for voters. Without negativity, voters would not have full information about all of their choices, since no candidate will say anything bad about herself. They argue that candidates have to point out the flaws in their opponents for voters to be fully informed.\n\nSome strategists say that an effect of negative campaigning is that while it motivates the base of support it can alienate centrist and undecided voters from the political process, reducing voter turnout and radicalizing politics. \nIn a study done by Gina Garramone about how negative advertising affects the political process, it was found that a consequence of negative campaigning is greater image discrimination of the candidates and greater attitude polarization. While positive ads also contributed to the image discrimination and attitude polarization, Garramone found that negative campaigning played a more influential role in the discrimination and polarization than positive campaigning.\n\nNegative ads can produce a backlash. A disastrous ad was run by the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the 1993 Canadian federal election, apparently emphasizing Liberal Party of Canada leader Jean Chrétien's Bell's Palsy partial facial paralysis in a number of unflattering photos, with the subtext of criticizing his platforms. Chrétien took maximum advantage of the opportunity to gain the public's sympathy as a man who struggled with a physical disability and his party's subsequent overwhelming victory in the election helped reduce the governing Conservatives to two seats.\n\nA similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party in the 2006 federal election for running an attack ad that suggested that Conservative leader Stephen Harper would use Canadian soldiers to patrol Canadian cities, and impose some kind of martial law. The ad was only available from the Liberal Party's web site for a few hours prior to the release of the attack ads on television; nevertheless, it was picked up by the media and widely criticized for its absurdity, in particular the sentence \"we're not making this up; we're not allowed to make this stuff up\". Liberal MP Keith Martin expressed his disapproval of \"whoever the idiot who approved that ad was,\" shortly before Liberal leader Paul Martin (no relation) stated that he had personally approved them. The effect of the ads was to diminish the credibility of the party's other attack ads. It offended many Canadians, particularly those in the military, some of whom were fighting in Afghanistan at the time. (See Canadian federal election, 2006)\n\nMore recently, in the 2008 US Senate race in North Carolina, Republican incumbent Elizabeth Dole attempted an attack ad on Democratic challenger Kay Hagan, who had taken a small lead in polls, by tying her to atheists. Dole's campaign released an ad questioning Hagan's religion and it included a voice saying \"There is no God!\" over a picture of Kay Hagan's face. The voice was not Hagan's but it is believed the ad implied that it was. Initially, it was thought the ad would work as religion has historically been a very important issue to voters in the American south, but the ad produced a backlash across the state and Hagan responded forcefully with an ad saying that she was a Sunday school teacher and was a religious person. Hagan also claimed Dole was trying to change the subject from the economy (the ad appeared around the same time as the 2008 financial crisis). Hagan's lead in polls doubled and she won the race by a nine-point margin.\n\nBecause of the possible harm that can come from being seen as a negative campaigner, candidates often pledge to refrain from negative attacks. This pledge is usually abandoned when an opponent is perceived to be \"going negative,\" with the first retaliatory attack being, ironically, an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner.\n\nWhile some research has found advantages and other has found disadvantages, some studies find no difference between negative and positive approaches .\n\nResearch published in the Journal of Advertising found that negative political advertising makes the body want to turn away physically, but the mind remembers negative messages. The findings are based on research conducted by James Angelini, professor of communication at the University of Delaware, in collaboration with Samuel Bradley, assistant professor of advertising at Texas Tech University, and Sungkyoung Lee of Indiana University, which used ads that aired during the 2000 presidential election. During the study, the researchers placed electrodes under the eyes of willing participants and showed them a series of 30-second ads from both the George W. Bush and Al Gore campaigns. The electrodes picked up on the \"startle response,\" the automatic eye movement typically seen in response to snakes, spiders and other threats. Compared to positive or neutral messages, negative advertising prompted greater reflex reactions and a desire to move away.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "308511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308511", "title": "Nolan Chart", "text": "Nolan Chart\n\nThe Nolan Chart is a political spectrum diagram created by American libertarian activist David Nolan in 1969. The chart divides human political views into two vectors—economic opinion and personal opinion—to produce a type of Cartesian chart. It expands political view analysis beyond the traditional left–right line, which measures politics along a one-dimensional line, into a graph with two dimensions: degrees of economic freedom and personal freedom.\n\nThe claim that political positions can be located on a chart with two axes: left-right (economics) and tough-tender (authoritarian-libertarian) was put forward by the British psychologist Hans Eysenck in his 1954 book \"The Psychology of Politics\" with statistical evidence based on survey data. This leads to a loose classification of political positions into four quadrants, with further detail based on exact position within the quadrant.\n\nA similar two-dimensional chart appeared in 1970 in the publication \"The Floodgates of Anarchy\" by Stuart Christie and Albert Meltzer, but that work distinguished between the axes collectivism–capitalism on the one hand, individualism–totalitarianism on the other, with anarchism, fascism, \"state communism\" and \"capitalist individualism\" in the corners. In \"Radicals for Capitalism\" (p. 321), Brian Doherty attributes the idea for the chart to an article by Maurice Bryson and William McDill in \"The Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought\" (Summer 1968) entitled \"The Political Spectrum: A Bi-Dimensional Approach\".\n\nDavid Nolan first published his version of the chart in an article named \"Classifying and Analyzing Politico-Economic Systems\" in the January 1971 issue of \"The Individualist\", the monthly magazine of the Society for Individual Liberty (SIL). In December 1971, he helped to start the group that would become the Libertarian Party.\n\nFrustrated by the \"left-right\" line analysis that leaves no room for other ideologies, Nolan devised a chart with two axes which would come to be known as the Nolan Chart, and later became the centerpiece of the World's Smallest Political Quiz. Nolan's argument was that the major difference between various political philosophies, the real defining element in what a person believes politically, is the amount of government control over human action that is advocated. Nolan further reasoned that virtually all human political action can be divided into two broad categories: economic and personal. The \"economic\" category includes what people do as producers and consumers – what they can buy, sell and produce, where they work, who they hire and what they do with their money. Examples of economic activity include starting or operating a business, buying a home, constructing a building and working in an office. The \"personal\" category includes what people do in relationships, in self-expression and what they do with their own bodies and minds. Examples of personal activities include whom they marry; choosing what books they read and movies they watch; what foods, medicines and drugs they choose to consume; recreational activities; religious choices; organizations they join; and with whom they choose to associate.\nAccording to Nolan, since most government activity (or government control) occurs in these two major areas, political positions can be defined by how much government control a person or political party favors in these two areas. The extremes are no government at all in either area (anarchism) or total or near-total government control of everything (various forms of totalitarianism). Most political philosophies fall somewhere in between. In broad terms:\n\nIn order to visually express this argument, Nolan came up with a two-axis graph. One axis was for economic freedom and the other was for personal freedom, with the scale on each of the two axes ranging from zero (total state control) to 100% (no state control). 100% freedom in economics would mean an entirely free market (\"laissez-faire\"); 100% freedom in personal issues would mean no government control of private, personal life. By using the scale on each of the two axes, it was possible to graph the intersection of the amount of personal liberty and economic liberty a person, political organization, or political philosophy advocates. Therefore, instead of classifying all political opinion on a one-dimensional range from left to right, Nolan's chart allowed two-dimensional measurement: how much (or little) government control a person favored in personal and economic matters.\n\nNolan said that one of the impacts of his chart is that when someone views it, it causes an irreversible change as viewers henceforth view the included orientations in two dimensions instead of one.\n\nIn 1987, Marshall Fritz, founder of Advocates for Self-Government, tweaked the chart and added ten questions – which he called the World's Smallest Political Quiz – which enabled people to plot their political beliefs on the chart.\n\nDiffering from the traditional left–right distinction and other political taxonomies, the Nolan Chart in its original form has two dimensions, with a horizontal x-axis labeled \"economic freedom\" and a vertical y-axis labeled \"personal freedom\". It resembles a square divided into five sections, with a label assigned to each of the following sections:\n\nIn August 2011, the libertarian \"Reason\" magazine worked with the Rupe organization to survey 1,200 Americans by telephone and place their views within the Nolan chart categories. The Reason-Rupe poll found that \"Americans cannot easily be bundled into either the 'liberal' or 'conservative' groups\". Specifically, 28% expressed conservative views, 24% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views and 28% expressed liberal views. The margin of error was ±3.\n\nThe Nolan chart is problematic to those who equate economic regulation with personal freedom and because the libertarian definition of freedom is different from the leftist definition. In his book \"Eight Ways to Run the Country: A New and Revealing Look at the Left and the Right\", Brian Patrick Mitchell gives three reasons for the perception that the chart has a libertarian bias. First, the chart shows no division between the personal and the economic. Second, personal freedoms are defined from different perspectives by the right and the left. Third, \"the chart is based on a Libertarian definition of freedom not accepted by most Liberals\". \n\n\n"}

They are used to help maintain product safety and extend shelf life.\nThere are many types of oxygen absorbers available to cover a wide array of applications.<ref name=\"doi10.1046/j.1365-2621.2002.00558.x\"></ref>\n\nThe components of an oxygen absorber vary according to intended use, the water activity of the product being preserved, and other factors. Often the oxygen absorber or scavenger is enclosed in a porous sachet or packet but it can also be part of packaging films and structures. Others are part of a polymer structure.\n\nThe first patent for an oxygen scavenger used an alkaline solution of pyrogallic acid in an air-tight vessel.\n\nModern scavenger sachets use a mixture of iron powder and sodium chloride. Often activated carbon is also included as it adsorbs some other gases and many organic molecules, further preserving products and removing odors.\n\nWhen an oxygen absorber is removed from its protective packaging, the moisture in the surrounding atmosphere begins to permeate into the iron particles inside of the absorber sachet. Moisture activates the iron, and it oxidizes to form iron oxide. Typically, there must be at least 65% relative humidity in the surrounding atmosphere before the rusting process can begin. To assist in the process of oxidation, sodium chloride is added to the mixture, acting as a catalyst or activator, causing the iron powder to be able to oxidize even with relatively low humidity. As oxygen is consumed to form iron oxide the level of oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere is reduced. Absorber technology of this type may reduce the oxygen level in the surrounding atmosphere to below 0.01%. Complete oxidation of 1 g of iron can remove 300 cm of oxygen in standard conditions. Though other technologies can remove more, iron is the most useful as it does not cause odor like sulfur compounds or passivate like aluminium compounds. Many other alternatives are not food safe. The moisture requirement of iron-based scavengers makes them ineffective in moisture sensitive applications.\n\nThe performance of oxygen scavengers is affected by ambient temperature and relative humidity.\nNewer packaging technologies may use oxygen scavenging polymers to prevent accidental ingestion of oxygen scavengers.\n\nWhile most standard oxygen scavengers contain ferrous carbonate and a metal halide catalyst, there are several non-ferrous variants, such as ascorbate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, citrus and others available.\n\nTypical reasons to use a non-ferrous variant would include the packaging of products intended for international shipping where metal detection would pose a problem; a desire to reduce the odor associated with ferrous carbonate; or dietary products where contact with iron should be avoided.\n\nAscorbic acid is often used to scavenge oxygen for generation of anaerobic environments for microbiology.\n\n\nOxygen scavenging technology can quickly reduce oxygen levels in sealed containers to below 0.01%.\n\n\nPlastic sachets offer greater protection than paper as they are not prone to disintegrating in products with high fat contents.\n\n"}
{"id": "217462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217462", "title": "Paleoconservatism", "text": "Paleoconservatism\n\nPaleoconservatism (sometimes shortened to paleocon) is a predominantly United States=based conservative political philosophy which stresses traditionalism, limited government, Judeo-Christian ethics, regionalism, nationalism and European identity. \n\nPaleoconservativism's concerns overlap those of the Old Right that opposed the New Deal in the 1930s and 1940s as well as American social conservatism of the late 20th century.\n\nAccording to the international relations scholar Michael Foley, \"paleoconservatives press for restrictions on immigration, a rollback of multicultural programmes, the decentralization of federal policy, the restoration of controls upon free trade, a greater emphasis upon economic nationalism and non-interventionism in the conduct of American foreign policy, and a generally revanchist outlook upon a social order in need of recovering old lines of distinction and in particular the assignment of roles in accordance with traditional categories of gender, ethnicity, and race\".\n\nPolitical theorist Paul Gottfried is credited with coining the term in the 1980s. He says the term originally referred to various Americans, such as conservative and traditionalist Catholics and agrarian Southerners, who turned to anti-communism during the Cold War.\n\nThe prefix \"paleo\" derives from the Greek root \"παλαιός\", meaning \"ancient\" or \"old\". It is somewhat tongue-in-cheek and refers to the paleoconservatives' claim to represent a more historic, authentic conservative tradition than that found in neoconservatism. Adherents of paleoconservatism often describe themselves simply as \"paleo\". Neoconservative Rich Lowry of \"National Review\" claims the prefix \"is designed to obscure the fact that it is a recent ideological creation of post–Cold War politics\".\n\nThe paleoconservatives use the term \"conservative\" somewhat differently from some American opponents of leftism. Paleoconservatives may reject attempts by Rush Limbaugh and others to graft short-term policy goals—such as school choice, enterprise zone and faith-based initiatives—into the core of conservatism. This is mainly due to the paleoconservatives' desire to see these incorporated as long-term institutional goals, rather than short-term victories for the movement itself. In this way, paleoconservatives are generally regarded as taking the \"long view\" toward American conservatism, willing to suffer temporary setbacks while never taking their aim off the goal of establishing the primacy of conservative thought into American politics.\n\nMoreover, Samuel T. Francis, Thomas Fleming and some other paleoconservatives de-emphasized the \"conservative\" part of the \"paleoconservative\" label, saying that they do not want the \"status quo\" preserved. Fleming and Paul Gottfried called such thinking \"stupid tenacity\" and described it as \"a series of trenches dug in defense of last year's revolution\". Francis defined authentic conservatism as \"the survival and enhancement of a particular people and its institutionalized cultural expressions\". He said of the paleoconservative movement: \n\nThe earliest mention of the word \"paleoconservative\" listed in Nexis is an article by J. Patrick Lewis in the October 20, 1984 issue of \"The Nation\", referring to academic economists who allegedly work to redefine poverty. The fourth edition of the \"American Heritage Dictionary\" lists a generic, informal use of the term, meaning \"extremely or stubbornly conservative in political matters\". Outside of the United States, the word is sometimes spelled \"palaeoconservative\".\n\nMany paleoconservatives identify themselves as classical conservatives and trace their philosophy to the Old Right Republicans of the interwar period which influenced the United States not to join the League of Nations, reduce immigration with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 and oppose Franklin D. Roosevelt. They often look back even further, to Edmund Burke as well as the anti-federalist movement that stretched from the days of Thomas Jefferson to John C. Calhoun.\n\nPaleoconservativism is opposed to open immigration by non-Europeans, and disapproves of United States intervention overseas.\n\nPaleoconservatism is strongly critical of neoconservatism in print media, talk radio and cable TV news. Paleoconservatives may say they are not conservatives in the sense that they wish to preserve existing institutions or seek to slow the growth of modern big-government conservatism. Rather, they promote Republicanism as a feature of Western heritage and customs. Paleoconservatives see neoconservatives as empire-builders and themselves as defenders of the republic.\n\nAs with other conservatives, paleoconservatives tend to oppose abortion on demand and gay marriage while supporting handgun ownership.\n\nPaleoconservatives argue that since human nature is limited and finite, any attempt to create a man-made utopia is headed for disaster and potential carnage. Instead, they lean toward tradition, family, customs, religious institutions and classical learning to provide wisdom and guidance.\n\nFleming stated this opposition to abstract ideals in a way that critic David Brooks called a \"startling crescendo\":\nThe political scientist W. Wesley McDonald explains the opposition to ideology this way:\nAlong these lines, Joseph Sobran argues in his \"Pensees\" that Western civilization relies on civility at the center of the society:\nCertain paleoconservatives say that tradition is a better guide than reason. For example, Mel Bradford wrote that certain questions are settled before any serious deliberation concerning a preferred course of conduct may begin. This ethic is based in a \"culture of families, linked by friendship, common enemies, and common projects\". So a good conservative keeps \"a clear sense of what Southern grandmothers have always meant in admonishing children, 'we don't do that'\".\n\nFleming calls tradition \"a body of wisdom and truth and a set of attitudes and behavior handed down from one generation to another. It is our parents' respect for their grandfathers that we reflect when we refuse to think ourselves wiser than our ancestors and do not presume to condemn their shortcomings\". By following tradition, Sobran said that society can maintain continuity with the past through words, rituals, records, commemorations and laws: \n\nFurthermore, James Kalb argues that tradition succeeds where ideology fails because it includes habits and attitudes about things that are hard to articulate rationally. Many aspects of social life resist clear definition, so technocratic approaches to social policy deserve suspicion: \n\n that Westerners have lost touch with their classical and European heritage, to the point that they are in danger of losing their civilization. Fleming wrote:\n\nPaleoconservatives tend to dislike abstract principles presented without connection to concrete roots, like religion, heritage, or traditional institutions. This distaste for universalism includes the doctrinal conclusions by socialists, neo-Thomists and Straussians. For example, Bradford wrote in \"A Better Guide Than Reason\" (citing Michael Oakeshott): \n\nSome paleoconservatives also profess a conservative value-centered historicism, which Gottfried defines as \"the belief that historical circumstances set values\". This is distinguished from nihilism, postmodernism, and moral relativism. Francis argued that this position is a \"Burkean appeal to tradition\". For example, Edmund Burke wrote in his \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\":\nClaes G. Ryn says that life has \"an enduring purpose, but one that manifests itself differently as individuals and circumstances are different\". He writes: \n\nAnti-federalism (see the American anti-Federalist movement) is another key aspect of paleoconservatism, which adherents see as an antitype to the managerial state. The paleoconservative flavor urges honoring the principle of subsidiarity, that is decentralized government, local rule, private property and minimal bureaucracy. In an international context, this view would be known as federalism and paleoconservatives often look to John C. Calhoun for inspiration. As to the role of statecraft in society, Fleming says it should not be confused with soulcraft. He gives his summary of the paleoconservative position:For example, Russell Kirk argued that most government tasks should be performed at the local or state level. This is intended to ward off centralization and protect community sentiment by putting the decision-making power closer to the populace. He rooted this in the Christian notion of original sin as since humanity is flawed, society should not put too much power in a few hands. Gerald J. Russello concluded that this involved \"a different way of thinking about government, one based on an understanding of political society as beginning in place and sentiment, which in turn supports written laws\".\n\nThis anti-federalism extends to culture too. In general, this means that different regional groups should be able to maintain their own distinct identity. For example, Fleming and Michael Hill argue that the American South and every other region have the right to \"preserve their authentic cultural traditions and demand the same respect from others\". In the Southern context, they call on citizens to \"take control of their own governments, their own institutions, their own culture, their own communities and their own lives\" and \"wean themselves from dependence on federal largesse\". They say:In a similar fashion, Pat Buchanan argued during the 1996 campaign that the social welfare should be left to the control of individual states. He also called for abolishing the Department of Education and handing decision-making over to parents, teachers and districts. Controversies such as evolution, busing and curriculum standards would be settled on a local basis. In addition, he opposed a 1998 Puerto Rican statehood plan on the grounds that the island would be ripped from its cultural and linguistic roots: \"Let Puerto Rico remain Puerto Rico, and let the United States remain the United States and not try to absorb, assimilate and Americanize a people whose hearts will forever belong to that island\".\n\nPaleoconservatives often argue that modern managerial society is a threat to stable families. Allan C. Carlson, former president of the Rockford Institute, argues: \n\nHe calls this a universal rule of human nature, true for Westerners and non-Westerners alike. He also argues that happiness \"comes through natural family bonds\" and that \"the future of any nation shall be by way of the family\". He defines family as \"a man and a woman living in a socially sanctioned bond called marriage for the purposes of propagating and rearing children, sharing intimacy and resources, and conserving lineage, property, and tradition\".\n\nSobran picks up this same theme, saying that heterosexual marriage is hard-coded into human nature: \n\nPaleoconservatives also question the validity of gender feminism in similar ways, some questioning feminism in both its radical and moderate forms. They say that the push for total gender equality dehumanizes both men and women, damaging the nuclear family and sacralizing abortion. Certain attitudes toward feminism also create room for the managerial state to try engineering sexual equality. Gottfried described this position, which was influenced by scholar Allan Carlson, thus: \n\nAllan C. Carlson says that we live in a \"post-family order\", in which elites no longer accept the centrality of family life. In response, he calls for a pro-active social conservatism that seeks \"real alternatives to the centralized ‘corporate state’ that are compatible with liberty and family life\". He argues that there is a permanent tension between the family and \"individualist, industrialized society\". He says the modern \"abstract state\" too often sees the family as \"its principal rival\" and tries to suppress it. It can also hurt family living by the unintended consequences of public policy with good intentions. He also chides American Republicans \"for consistently favoring Wall Street over Main Street\".\n\nAs an alternative to the \"abstract state\", Carlson argues the state must recognize that men and women \"are different in reproductive, economic, and social functions\", even though they share political and property rights. He says that churches and other religious bodies must step in and help rebuild \"family-centered communities\". As for common people, he says: \n\nCarlson argues that the family's greatest challenge in the early 21st century comes from what he calls \"soft totalitarianisms\", which are \"packaged around a militant secular individualism, but still seeking to build a marriage-free, post-family order\". This includes same-sex marriage, the left's association of family values with abortion and \"equity feminism\". Francis uses similar ideas to argue that society should regulate sexual behavior, specifically laws against sodomy and gays in the military.\n\nOther contemporary luminaries include Donald Livingston, a Professor of Philosophy at Emory and corresponding editor for \"Chronicles\"; Paul Craig Roberts, an attorney and former Reagan administration Treasury official; Joseph Sobran, a columnist and contributing editor for \"Chronicles\"; the novelist and essayist Chilton Williamson, senior editor for books at \"Chronicles\"; and the historian Clyde N. Wilson, long-time contributing editor for \"Chronicles\". Another prominent paleoconservative, Theodore Pappas, is the current executive editor of \"Encyclopædia Britannica\".\n\nThe movement combines disparate people and ideas that might seem incompatible in another context. Such diversity of thought echoes the paleo opposition to ideology and political rationalism, reflecting the influence of thinkers like Russell Kirk and Michael Oakeshott.\n\nPat Buchanan argues that a good politician must \"defend the moral order rooted in the Old and New Testament and Natural Law\"—and that \"the deepest problems in our society are not economic or political, but moral\". On the other hand, Samuel T. Francis complained that the Christian right focuses on certain social issues and neglects other civilizational crises.\n\nRussell Kirk (1914–1994) is a key figure in paleoconservatism, in that several of his books present an outline of a pervasive Anglo-American conservative tradition that exists despite many other distinctions. His own career stretched long enough to for him to defend Robert A. Taft in the 1950s, write for \"National Review\" during the Cold War, criticize neoconservatism in the 1980s and give speeches supporting Buchanan in 1992. One neoconservative writer, Dan Himmelfarb, even refers to Kirk's \"The Conservative Mind\" as \"the seminal work of paleoconservatism\", even though it was first published in 1953.\n\nKirk developed six \"canons\" of conservatism. Gerald J. Russello described them thus:\nIn addition, Kirk said that \"all culture arises out of religion. When religious faith decays, culture must decline, though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief\".\n\nKirk called libertarians \"chirping sectaries\" by quoting T. S. Eliot and said that they and conservatives have nothing in common apart from their opposition to collectivism. He called the movement \"an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating\". He said a line of division exists between believers in \"some sort of transcendent moral order\" and \"utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct\", libertarians being in the latter category.\n\nKirk also popularized the Anglo-Irish statesman Edmund Burke as the prototypical conservative—and many paleoconservatives consider him a hallowed ancestor. For them, he represents a vital link between the American right and the greater tradition of British customs and common law. As such, his ideas are a touchstone for a conservatism that respects tradition, while rejecting authoritarianism.\n\nUnlike paleoconservatives, Kirk was not particularly influenced by the social sciences and other \"modernist disciplines\".\n\nIn the United States, the Southern Agrarians, John T. Flynn, Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, Robert R. McCormick, Felix Morley and Richard M. Weaver, among others, articulated positions that have influenced contemporary paleoconservatives. Some paleoconservatives embrace the decentralizing tenets of the Anti-Federalists, such as John Dickinson and George Mason. Neoconservative critic David Brooks lists William Jennings Bryan, T. S. Eliot, Allen Tate, John Crowe Ransom, Cleanth Brooks and Walker Percy as major paleo influences.\n\nCounter-revolutionary (Roman Catholic) European precursors to the paleoconservatives include Joseph de Maistre, Charles Maurras, Juan Donoso Cortés, Klemens Wenzel von Metternich and Pope Pius IX, specifically in the Roman Catholic traditionalist subset of paleoconservatism. G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc also influence paleo thought. Regarding Chesterton and Belloc, Sobran said:\nOther historical sources referenced by paleoconservatives include Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes and Antonio Gramsci. Contrarian leftists such as Eugene Genovese, Christopher Lasch and Paul Piccone have also influenced the movement. Modern European continental conservatives Jacques Barzun, Alain de Benoist and René Girard have also been praised by paleoconservatives.\n\nAccording to historian Paul V. Murphy, paleoconservatives developed a focus on \"states' rights\" and political localism. From the mid-1980s onward, \"Chronicles\" promoted a Southern traditionalist worldview focused on national identity, regional particularity, and skepticism of abstract theory and centralized power. According to Hague, Beirich, and Sebesta (2009), the antimodernism of the paleoconservative movement defined the neo-confederate movement of the 1980s and 1990s. During this time, notable paleoconservative argued that desegregation, welfare, tolerance of gay rights, and church-state separation had been damaging to local communities, and that these issues had been imposed by federal legislatures and think tanks. Paleoconservatives also claimed the Southern Agrarians as forebearers in this regard.\n\nMany first-generation paleoconservatives were \"National Review\" supporters, but drifted away as the magazine was seen as becoming neoconservative starting in the 1970s. \"Chronicles\" founder Leopold Tyrmand complained that the movement gave political solutions to cultural problems.\n\nOpen hostility broke out in the mid-1980s and was never resolved. Some paleoconservatives argued that fusionism failed and suggested a new alliance on the right to stand outside the neoconservative consensus. Buchanan stated that \"We are old church and old right, anti-imperialist and anti-interventionist, disbelievers in \"Pax Americana\"\".\n\nThe Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) still follows the old fusionism. It showcases both neoconservative and Old Right ideas, such as anti-interventionism, limited government and cultural regionalism, in its publications and conferences. While it favors free-market solutions it tends to recognize the limitations of the market, or as economist Wilhelm Röpke says, \"the market is not everything\". ISI scholarship includes analysis of agrarian and distributist works, along with the idea of an \"humane economy\".\n\nOne fusionist, James Burnham, influenced paleocons, especially Francis. Gottfried said that the two men believed that social forces create ideologies—and that \"moral visions are the mere accompaniments of the process by which classes make themselves economically dominant and try to control other groups\".\n\nAs paleoconservatism germinated as a reaction to neoconservatism, most of its development as a distinct political tendency under that name has been in the United States, although there are parallels in the traditional Old Right of other Western nations. French conservatives such as Jean Raspail and British conservatives such as Enoch Powell, Peter Hitchens, Antony Flew (whom the Rockford Institute awarded the Ingersoll Prize), Sir John Betjeman, and Sir Roger Scruton as well as Scruton's \"Salisbury Review\" and Derek Turner's \"Quarterly Review\", along with Australia's \"Sydney Traditionalist Forum\" and \"Edmund Burke's Club\" all emphasize skepticism, stability and the Burkean inheritance and may be considered broadly sympathetic to paleoconservative values. For example, Hitchens wrote in opposition to the Iraq War: \n\nNote the One Nation movement in 1990s Australia, Germany's Junge Freiheit and Italy's Lega Nord and compare the Russian dissidents Andrei Navrozov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.\n\nPat Buchanan calls neoconservatism \"a globalist, interventionist, open-borders ideology\". The paleoconservatives argue that the \"neocons\" are illegitimate interlopers in the conservative movement. In 1986, the historian Stephen Tonsor, who rejects the label \"paleoconservative\", said: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7601841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7601841", "title": "Pathfinder Mural", "text": "Pathfinder Mural\n\nThe Pathfinder Mural is a work of art formerly located at 410 West Street in the New York City neighborhood known as the West Village. It was conceived of by artist Mike Alewitz in 1988 and painted as a collaboration among eighty artists from twenty nations, who painted it on the side of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) building housing the Pathfinder Press, the publishing arm of the Pathfinder tendency, a left-wing organization.\n\nThe mural consisted of a red-colored printing press in the center, out of which seemed to flow posters of revolutionary heroes, with crowds of people depicted above and below the press. Well-known activists and political figures included Martin Luther King, Jr., Sojourner Truth, Malcolm X, Fidel Castro, Stephen Biko, and Harriet Tubman. The press itself is printing Fidel Castro's words, \"The truth must not be only the truth--it must also be told.\"\n\nThe SWP commissioned the mural at the suggestion of Alewitz, a long-time member of the party. \n\nParticipants in the project included artists such as Armand Vaillancourt, Dumile Feni, Arnoldo Guillien and Carlos Montenegro. There were also other, anonymous contributors with revolutionary and/or working-class backgrounds. \n\nIn an interview with the New York Times dated September 7, 1997, Alewitz said of the mural \"I wanted to do this one because Pathfinder represents the tradition of publishing important revolutionary ideas. I'm critical of the New York art scene. I find that much of the art taught in the schools and produced through the gallery system reflects the values of the cynical and confused middle class. Basically, a stronger art is produced in those societies--like Cuba and Nicaragua--where there's a pulling together, an optimism about going forward.\"\n\nPolitical conflicts, however, beset the project. From the right, Patrick Buchanan attacked it in the Washington Times as \"a six-story shrine to communism, a Marxist Mount Rushmore in Greenwich Village.\" More disruptive to the project were criticisms from the SWP itself who criticized Alewitz' vision of a work that would depict revolutionary heroes as human beings and insisted on an homage to the party's heroes and attempted to micromanage the project by issuing directives on matters such as how large Leon Trotsky's head should be. \n\nA quotation from Eugene Debs' famous anti-war speech made in Canton, Ohio were replaced with words from Fidel Castro. Also removed were personal touches by Alewitz such as depictions of two students killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in 1970, one of whom had been a close friend of Alewitz’s.\n\nAlewitz was expelled from the SWP prior to the project's conclusion and was excluded from its opening ceremony.\n\nIn 1996, the mural was permanently removed in order to repair cracks in the exterior wall of the Pathfinder building.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1720 Tsar Peter I of Russia issued a decree in which he ordered the expurgation of all Ukrainian linguistic elements in theological literature printed in Ukrainian typographical establishments. Later Empress Catherine II of Russia issued a secret order to Count Aleksandr Alekseyevich Vyazemsky (the Prosecutor General of the Russian Empire from 1764 to 1792) in which she instructed him to institute a program of Russification for the provinces of Ukraine (\"malorossia\"), Livonia and Finland, \"using light-handed methods\". In 1862, all Ukrainian Sunday schools, numbering over 100 at the time, were abolished and proscribed. In 1863, minister of internal affairs Pyotr Valuyev issued the so-called Valuev Circular, in which he stated that the Ukrainian language never existed, doesn't exist, and cannot exist. In 1876, tsar Alexander II of Russia issued the Ems Ukaz, a secret decree banning the use of the Ukrainian language in print, with the exception of reprinting of old documents.\n\nCities with the Russian suffix \"-hrad\" (grad) in their names have never existed in Ukraine prior to Russian rule. Such cities were built or renamed after the annexation of Ukraine by the Russian Empire through the partitions of Poland. Instead, the corresponding suffix \"-horod\" is native to Ukrainian toponymic morphology, for example in Myrhorod, Sharhorod, Zvenyhorod, Horodok, Horodyshche, Horodenka and others.\n\nAfter World War I, Ukrainian culture was revived due to the Bolshevik policy of Korenization (\"indigenisation\"). While it was meant to bolster the power of the Party in local cadres, the policy was at odds with the concept of a Soviet people with a shared Russian heritage. Under Stalin, \"korenization\" took second stage to the idea of a united Soviet Union, where competing national cultures were no longer tolerated, and the Russian language increasingly became the only official language of Soviet socialism.\n\nThe times of restructuring of farming and the introduction of industrialization brought about a wide campaign against \"nationalist deviation,\" which in Ukraine translated into the end of \"korenization\" policy and an assault on the political and cultural elite. The first wave of purges between 1929 and 1934 targeted the revolutionary generation of the party that in Ukraine included many supporters of Ukrainization. Soviet authorities specifically targeted the commissar of education in Ukraine, Mykola Skrypnyk, for promoting Ukrainian language reforms that were seen as dangerous and counterrevolutionary; Skrypnyk committed suicide in 1933. The next 1936–1938 wave of political purges eliminated much of the new political generation that replaced those who perished in the first wave. The purges nearly halved the membership of the Ukrainian communist party, and purged Ukrainian political leadership was largely replaced by the cadre sent from Russia that was also largely \"rotated\" by Stalin's purges.\n\nRussification of Soviet-occupied Ukraine intensified in 1938 under Nikita Khrushchev, then secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party, but was briefly halted during World War II, when Axis forces occupied large areas of the country. After the war ended, Western Ukraine was reabsorbed into the Soviet Union, and most prominent Ukrainian intellectuals living there were purged or exiled to Siberia. Leonid Brezhnev continued the Russification policies of Khrushchev in postwar Ukraine.\nIn the 1960s, the Ukrainian language began to be used more widely and frequently in spite of these policies. In response, Soviet authorities increased their focus on early education in Russian. After 1980, Russian language classes were instituted from the first grade onward. In 1990 Russian became legally the official all-Union language of the Soviet Union, with constituent republics having rights to declare their own official languages.\n\nThe list includes Russian language names of settlements intentionally adopted in Ukrainian language instead of its Ukrainian correspondents. Ukrainian language names of settlements intentionally being recognized as self-invented and never existed before due to systematic erasing or silencing of local history.\n\nRussification policy was more intense in Ukraine than in other parts of the Soviet Union, and the country now contains the largest group of Russian speakers who are not ethnically Russian: as of 2009, there were about 5.5 million Ukrainians whose first language was Russian. Russian speakers are more prevalent in the southeastern half of the country, while both Ukrainian and Russian are used equally in the center, and Ukrainian dominates in the west. Some of these \"russified Ukrainians\" speak Russian, while others speak a mix of Ukrainian and Russian known as \"surzhyk\"; many do have some proficiency in Ukrainian. Estimates of their prevalence in the country vary, but according to different studies, \"russified Ukrainians\" comprise a third to a half of the total population of Ukraine.\n\nIn post-Soviet Ukraine, Ukrainian remains the only official language in the country; however, in 2012, President Victor Yanukovitch introduced a bill recognizing \"regional languages\", according to which, in particular, Russian could be used officially in the predominantly Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine, in schools, courts, and government institutions. While the bill was supported by Ukrainians in the eastern and southern regions, the legislation triggered protests in Kiev, where representatives from opposition parties argued that it would further divide the Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking parts of the country and make Russian a \"de facto\" official language there. On 28 February 2018 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine ruled this legislation unconstitutional.\n\nTelevision and other media cater both languages. In Ukraine there have been attempts to make Ukrainian the main language for the media and the press, see Ukrainization: Mass media/entertainment for more details.\n\n\n"}

The organization lists its main concerns as females being victims of social norms and old traditions, working to eliminate these traditions through media, proper education, collaboration with other human rights organizations and social discussions. Sahiyo aims to empower victims and help them to spread their stories through public awareness campaigns and advocacy initiatives. \n\nIn early 2015, five women started the collective; Mariya Taher, Aarefa Johari, Priya Goswami, Insia Dariwala and Shaheeda Tavawalla-Kirtane, decided to take a step against female circumcision and create a collective, they managed to partner with national and international NGOs such as German-Iraqi NGO Wadi, SpeakOut, Breakthrough and others. \nIn July, Sahiyo launched an exploratory online survey to understand the motive, expanse and effect of female circumcision around the world, significant researchers participated in the survey including Gerry Mackie. In June, they partnered with Breakthrough to uncover the different connections of violence that are based on gender by highlighting the effects of orthodox ethics and customs that suppresses female sexuality in specific communities.\n\nIn August 2016, convened a media workshop in partnership with IAWRT. In September, Sahiyo collaborated with Inclusive Mosque Initiative, they participated in the “Gender Justice” session at the Islamic Society of North America Annual Conference. In October, Sahiyo participated in lecturing, discussing and collaborating over female genital mutilation challenges at Justice and Peace Commission in Mumbai which is run by Catholic Church in Mumbai.\n\nIn January 2017, Sahiyo launched a worldwide online petition on Change.org appealing to United Nations and other establishments to invest in more research and support to push to end female genital mutilation in India and Asia and then to eliminate it globally, the petition was launched in collaboration with 33 non-governmental human rights organizations, including Equality Now, Orchid Project, Tahirih Justice.\n\n‘Sahiyo’ is the Gujarati word for ‘friends’, which indicates the collective's mission to end female genital cutting through social discussions with the community in order to reach collaborative solutions towards ending the practice. Advocating its views against female genital cutting, Sahiyo uses online media to present stories of women who undergone mutilation to spread awareness of female circumcision, often drawing special attention to survivor stories. Sahiyo started its first \"Thaal Pe Charcha\" (Discussions over food) in 2017, a meeting for Bohra women to discuss their life challenges concerning social norms and community fear of women sexuality, with an emphasis on female genital mutilation. In July, Sahiyo held the second Thaal Pe Charcha meeting in Mumbai, the third meeting was convened in October, in which the organization received an invitation for speaking at Hilton Humanitarian Symposium in Los Angeles on their recent work and engagement with local and global communities. \n\nThrough its local research, Sahiyo found that 80% of Bohra woman had undergone clitoridectomy procedure. Also it has released an investigative report revealed publicly for that first time that female mutilation cutting was carrying out in several parts of coastal state Kerala, including cities of Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode, the reporters and reserchers interviewed clinic doctors who agree on the illegal procedure and also encourage it, which caused controversial reactions among supporters and opposers in India.\nThe global survey found that female genital cutting is not only present in some African and Asian countries, but happens also among these communities in developed countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nIn February 2016, Sahiyo partnered with NGO Speak Out to run \"Each One Reach One\", a one month campaign was launched to motivate different people to participate in social discussions with Bohra women. In the following year, they have launched the second edition of the campaign. In March, they started \"I Am Bohra Photo\" campaign, encouraging women and men of Bohra to post their photos with comments to condemn khatna activities.\n\n"}
{"id": "40838871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40838871", "title": "Supply management (Canada)", "text": "Supply management (Canada)\n\nSupply management () (SM) is a national agricultural policy framework used in Canada that coordinates supply and demand of dairy, poultry and eggs through production and import control and pricing mechanisms designed to prevent shortages and surpluses, to ensure farmers a fair rate of return and Canadian consumer access to a high-quality, stable, and secure supply of these sensitive products.\n\nThe supply management system was authorized by the 1972 \"Farm Products Agencies Act\", which established the two national agencies that oversee the system. Five national supply management organizations, the SM-5 Organizations — Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC), Turkey Farmers of Canada (TFC), Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC), the Canadian Hatching Egg Producers (CHEP) and the Ottawa-based Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC), a Crown corporation — in collaboration with provincial and national governing agencies, organizations and committees, administer the supply management system. The Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada federal department is responsible for both the Canadian Dairy Commission and its analogue for eggs, chicken and turkey products, the Farm Products Council of Canada. In the dairy industry, the supply management system implements the federated provincial policy through the CMSMC, CDC, three regional milk pools — Newfoundland's, the five eastern province (P5) and four western provinces — and provincial milk marketing boards. Since 1970, the CMSMC has set the yearly national industrial raw milk production quota or Market Sharing Quota (MSQ) and the MSQ share for each province to ensure Canada to match production with domestic need and to remain self-sufficient in milk fat. Each province allocates MSQs to individual dairy farmers.\n\nSupply management mechanisms such as import controls were recognized as a valid practice and protected under Article XI of the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). During the Uruguay round of negotiations (1986-1993), Article XI was lost and tariffs were introduced to protect Canada's domestic dairy. The Canadian dairy industry was not part of trade negotiations in 1994 when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect. As a result of Canada's forced removal of some export subsidies with the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, the federal government and the CDC updated the pricing system to be more stringent, a system that remains in place in 2018. During the 2004 WTO Doha Development Round (DDA) trade negotiations in Geneva, that had begun in 2001, Canada's supply management system was under attack by almost all their trading partners for the first time.\n\nOf the 193,492 farms in Canada in 2017, 16,351, representing approximately 12 per cent, were under supply management. The controls provided by supply management have allowed the federal and provincial governments to avoid subsidizing the sectors directly, in contrast to general practice in the European Union and the United States. \n\nSupply management's supporters say that the system offers stability for producers, processors, service providers and retailers. Detractors have criticized tariff-rate import quotas, price-control and supply-control mechanisms used by provincial and national governing agencies, organizations and committees. The policy has been described as regressive and protectionist and costly with money transferred from consumers to producers through higher prices on milk, poultry and eggs which some label as a subsidy. Canada's trade partners posit that SM limits market access.\n\nWhile many federal and provincial politicians from major parties \"have long maintained support for a supply-managed system for dairy, poultry and egg farmers,\" there has been ongoing debate about SM. A 2018 report based on government data and the 2017 Nielsen's Fresh Milk Price Report, showed that although it has always been claimed that Canadians pay higher dairy prices than other countries, the price of 1 litre of liquid milk in Canadian dollars in Canada was $1.50 compared to $1.57 in Australia it was $1.57, $1.61 in the USA a litre (of rBST -free milk), and $1.83 in New Zealand.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) maintained in 2017 that Canada's \"export growth would be boosted if Canada phased out its Canadian dairy supply management policies.\" \n\nSupply management was one of many issues in Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a free-trade agreement between Canada, the European Union and its member states and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) negotiations and the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA). Under the October 1, 2018 United States Mexico Canada Agreement, the supply management system remained intact, Canada opened the domestic market by 3.6% and Class 7 was eliminated. \n\nCanada's supply management system, which encompasses \"five types of products: dairy, chicken and turkey products, table eggs, and broiler hatching eggs\", \"coordinates production and demand while controlling imports as a means of setting stable prices for both farmers and consumers.\"\n\nIn Canada, the dairy supply management system is administered by the federal government through the Ottawa-based Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) a Crown corporation. The Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada federal department is responsible for both the Canadian Dairy Commission and its analogue for eggs, chicken and turkey products, the Farm Products Council of Canada.\n\nIn total, there are about 12,000 dairy farms, 2,800 chicken farmers, 1,000 regulated egg farmers who produce table eggs and broiler hatching eggs, and 551 turkey farmers, that operate under supply management. According to the 2016 Canadian Census of Agriculture, there are 193,492 farms in Canada; about 12 per cent of Canadian farms are under supply management.\n\nThere are five national organizations, known jointly as the SM-5 Organizations, that administer or support agricultural supply management systems. According to a CBC article, \"The SM-5 Organizations say federal-provincial agreements for each of the supply-managed sectors weave together the legislative jurisdiction of both levels of government to 'ensure a seamless regulatory scheme'... \"designed to enable farmers to get a reasonable return while stabilizing the supply of agricultural products to Canadian consumers.\"\n\nThe supply management system was authorized in 1972 through the Farm Products Agencies Act and subsequently the national agencies that established the system were created. The Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee, which is chaired by CDC is \"responsible for the administration of supply management for the dairy industry\". By 1983 all provinces except Newfoundland had signed the National Milk Marketing Plan (NMMP) which replaced the 1971 Interim Comprehensive Milk Marketing Plan. The goal of the NMMP agreement was to manage the supply of raw industrial milk to meet Canadian needs, to establish provincial MSQs and to raise fees to remove surplus.\n\nIn 1972, the national marketing agency to administer the supply management system for eggs, Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC), was established. In 1974 one was set up for turkey farmers, Turkey Farmers of Canada (TFC), and the chicken marketing agency, Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC), was created in 1978, and the Canadian Hatching Egg Producers (CHEP) agency was established in 1986.\n\nThe National Farm Products Marketing Council, now the Farm Products Council of Canada, established by the 1972 Farm Products Agencies Act, oversees the national supply management system agencies for eggs, chicken, and turkey. \n\nThe Farm Products Council of Canada \"oversees the various agencies in an effort to promote an efficient and competitive agricultural sector while ensuring that the marketing system operates well, in the interests of producers and consumers.\"\n\nIn Ontario, for example, the 2017 Agricultural Products Marketing Act (FPMA) \"allows the Minister of Agriculture and Food to enter into contracts with the federal government to have national marketing agencies perform marketing functions within Ontario on behalf of the Ontario government\" through the Ontario Farm Products Marketing Commission.\n\nThe milk supply management system is a \"federated provincial policy\" with four governing agencies, organizations and committees—Canadian Dairy Commission, Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee (CMSMC), regional milk pools, and provincial milk marketing boards.\n\nThe Ottawa-based Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) composed mostly of dairy farmers, was created in 1966. The federal government is involved in SM through the CDC in the administration of imports and exports. The CDC establishes \"support prices for butter and skim milk powder (SMP) and operates surplus removals at the support prices, removing butterfat and SMP from the market for export or later sale. It also facilitates the process for the setting of Market Sharing Quota (MSQ) for industrial milk nationally.\" According to the CDC website, it operates as an agency supporting \"farmers, processors and consumers.\" CDC, under CEO Serge Riendeau—a former farmer, dairy producer and Agropur Cooperative Director—also \"manages programs that target the industry, upholds milk quality standards and supports Canadians working in the dairy industry\". Riendeau is responsible for \"cooperating and negotiating with dairy industry stakeholders to reconcile their interests and maintain compliance with the supply management system\". Riendeau, who was a farmer and dairy producer before becoming President of Agropur Cooperative in 1992, advocates for the \"supply management system\" and \"was instrumental in the establishment of a national strategy to promote the use of Canadian dairy ingredients.\"\n\nIn 1970, the Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee (CMSMC), was established to set the national industrial milk Market Sharing Quota (MSQ) which is then allocated among the provinces. The national MSQs \"ensure that Canada is self-sufficient in milk fat.\"\n\nThe CMSMC, which is chaired by the Ottawa-based Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC), administers SM for the dairy sector with the CDC performing a role of supervision, support and regulation.\n\nThere are three regional milk pools—Newfoundland's, the Eastern Canadian Milk Pooling P5 Agreement which includes Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Québec and Ontario and the Western Milk Pooling Agreement (WMP) which includes Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, that operate under the supervision of the CDC. They pool milk sale revenues, costs and markets, and harmonize pricing and establish daily quotas.\n\nUnder GATT's Article XI supply management enjoyed an exemption. When Article XI was lost during the Uruguay round of negotiations (1986-1993), tariffs were introduced to protect Canada's domestic dairy. The loss of Article XI was one of the driving forces behind the formation of a milk pooling agreement. When the WTO replaced GATT in 1995, it was recognized by Canada's Dairy Industry Advisory Committee that expanded regional milk pools would be needed to adapt to changes.\n\nDairy producers must hold a quota or permit to sell their products to a processing plant. These quotas, or Market Sharing Quota (MSQ), avoid overproduction. In the SM system, provincial marketing boards, allocate production quotas or MSQs on milk for example, based on regional milk pools recommendations which include daily milk quotas.\n\nThe provincial milk marketing boards are responsible for most of the regulation of milk marketing, organization of dairy producers, quota administration and transfers, and producer-processor settlement. Individual provinces regulate their own marketing systems with marketing boards that may engage in product promotion, collective sales, and price negotiation. Marketing boards have regulatory control over the feeding, treatment, and conditions of animals on farms, as the board is in direct control of the quota allotted and can directly sanction farms who violate board policy. In Ontario the FPMA authorizes the province to control and regulate the production and marketing of Ontario farm products [except dairy products] including their prohibition. The Dairy Farmers of Ontario regulate the dairy marketing system.\n\nDuring the 2015 TPP negotiations, as the United States, New Zealand and Australia called for an end to SM, the role of the provincial marketing boards was challenged. By October 2015, however, it was agreed that in exchange for an opening the market to other countries, marketing boards could continue to perform their decision-making role in production quotas and farm gate prices.\n\nA 2001 \"NAFTA - Report Card on Agriculture\", traces the history of trade disputes to the 1930s. After the United States enacted the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, US tariffs rose to record levels. This devastated the Canadian economy and resulted in implementation of protectionism at a global level. By 1932, Canadian exports dropped from $515 million to $235 million. Canada, the United States, and many other countries erected \"high and discriminatory barriers\" in the pursuit of \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" policies. The signing of the first liberal trade agreement, the 1936 Canada–US agreement, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister Mackenzie King represented the start of an economic relationship between the two countries that resulted in the steady decline of trade barriers such as tariffs.\n\nDuring the economic crisis of the 1930s, Canadian Dairy Farmers’ Federation (now the Dairy Farmers of Canada), the Saint-Hubert, Québec-based Agropur Cooperative, along with hundreds of other dairy cooperatives in Québec at that time, were established.\n\nBy 1942, the Dairy Farmers of Canada (DFC)'s mandate was to stabilize the dairy market and increase revenues for dairy farmers.\n\nPost-WWII, following the collapse of world trade, negotiators of multilateral trade agreements, including advocates of free trade and protectionism, carved out the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), first signed by 23 countries in 1947. Through GATT markets were freer and less discriminatory, market competition became global, benefiting all signatories.\n\nSupply management in its current form dates from Federal legislation passed in December 1971 under the Pierre Elliot Trudeau government. Trudeau had expressed support for the system since 1949 when he was as an assistant to Robert Gordon Robertson.\n\nThrough the 1958 federal Agricultural Stabilization Act (ASA), an agricultural commodity could be designated by the ASA for direct deficiency payments if the price dropped 80% below the price averaged over the preceding decade. This was the first act of its kind in Canada and a majority of ASA cash subsidies to farmers went to the dairy industry for industrial milk—milk used in making cheese, milk powder and butter.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s there was volatility in dairy prices, dairy producers had more bargaining power relative to dairy farmers, and the United Kingdom was poised to enter the European Common Market, resulting in the loss of Canada's largest dairy export customer. As low milk prices continued into the 1960s, the Canadian Dairy Commission Act was passed in 1967, establishing the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC). The CDC's mandate was to ensure producers received a fair return on investment, and to ensure the quality and supply of milk.\n\nThe Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee (CMSMC) was first introduced in 1970 as the body responsible for setting the national Market Sharing Quota (MSQ). By 1974 every province except Newfoundland had signed on. The dairy industry was the first in Canada to be operated through the national supply management system. Following dairy, a national supply management system was implemented for eggs in 1972, turkey in 1974, chicken in 1978 and chicken hatching eggs in 1986. The national agencies for eggs, turkeys, and chickens were also established in the 1970s.\n\nWhen the European Economic Community (EEC) adopted Canada's model in introducing its own quotas in April 1984, they were motivated by a milk supply surplus. In Canada, where there was no milk surplus in the 1970s—the MSQs were designed to \"guarantee a fair level of return for producers and to promote a stable supply of high-quality dairy products for consumers.\"\n\nUnder the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), \"imposing import controls on commodities subject to supply management [was] a valid and recognized practice. Such controls prevent[ed] the displacement of significant quantities of Canadian dairy products on the Canadian market, and thus protect[ed] [Canadian] producers against losses incurred through having to export all production in excess of domestic demand.\n\nIn 1981, American economist Thomas Borcherding published his 117-page report entitled \"The Egg Marketing Board\" for the Fraser Institute in which he used the phrase, the \"egg marketing cartel\". In the same year, based on his report, he also wrote several 1981 articles and editorials in \"The Globe and Mail\" about the artificially high-prices of eggs in Canada allegedly caused by a supply management mechanism, egg marketing boards, which Borcherding called an \"egg marketing cartel\". According to Simon Fraser University professor \"emeritus\", Donald Gutstein in his 2014 publication \"\", this marked the beginning of an aggressive campaign by the Fraser Institute and other think tanks, that he described as neo-liberal, to eliminate supply management in the ensuing decades.\n\nThe historic Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) came into force on January 1, 1989. CUSTFA, which built on GATT rights and obligations, was the largest trade agreement concluded between two countries up to that time.\n\nWhen the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into force on January 1, 1994, the Canadian dairy system was not part of negotiations.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, when Canada was forced to remove some of its export subsidies, dairy farmers underwent a major consolidation. The federal government and the CDC created the a new more stringent pricing system which was still in place in 2018. The four sectors in 1995 were grains and oilseeds with 90,000 farmers, beef and hog farmers with 75,000 farmers, supply-managed dairy, poultry and egg sectors with 30,000 farmers, and horticulture with 9000 farmers.\n\nCanada participated in the WTO Doha Development Round (DDA) of trade-negotiations that began in 2001 with the objective of facilitating global trade by lowering trade barriers. By 2004, whereas previously, Canada's supply management system had some support from other countries, in Geneva, the system was under attack. \"In terms of supply management, and in the case of the Wheat Board...we were under attack. It was one against 146. We had absolutely no allies at the negotiating table.\"\n\nA WTO panel ruled in 2002 that Canada \"breached its trade obligations through its dairy support, siding with the United States. The result of the WTO ruling is that Canada is not allowed to export much dairy.\"\n\nIn 2005, \"MPs voted unanimously in favour of a motion reiterating\" their support for supply management. All the parties say it \"necessary so farmers can earn a decent living.\" Liberals published a press release to tell Conservatives that they \"must protect supply management.\" \"Canadian politicians have long maintained support for a supply-managed system for dairy, poultry and egg farmers.\" I\n\nIn December 2006, in an interview with the \"Western Producer\", Trade Minister David Emerson under Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper predicted that the SM would limit Canada's trading ability and in the end Canada would lose in trade negotiations. In March 2007, Emerson walked back his statement, and reiterated the Harper administration's support for supply management.\n\nIn the 2008 OECD policy brief, \"Economic survey of Canada 2008: Modernising Canada's agricultural policies\", was highly critical of supply managed sectors especially dairy farming.\n\nA November 2009 report by the Standing Committee on International Trade (CIIT), in preparation for TPP talks, recommended that \"the Government of Canada affirm its unequivocal support of, and commitment to defend, Canada's supply management system.\" The House of Commons \"unanimously passed a resolution instructing Canadian negotiators to defend supply management\". This \"unanimous support for supply management among Canada’s main political parties\" was explained in part by the fact that supply-managed sectors employed 232,000 across Canada and contributed \"over $13 billion to GDP annually.\n\nIn April 2010, the \"Globe and Mail\" reported that Canada was denied a seat at the TPP negotiating table because New Zealand opposed Canada's \"official position in support of supply managed poultry, egg and dairy sectors.\" In 2010, it was expected that in the TPP negotiations, agriculture would be the \"game-changer affecting hundreds of thousands of farmers particularly in Canada, particularly in the supply-managed sectors.\"\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the TPP talks, a series of articles were published that were \"highly critical of milk supply management\" and supporters of supply management responded with counter-arguments. David E. Bond, the retired chief economist of HSBC Bank Canada, published an opinion piece in the \"Globe and Mail\" stating that the \"government sanctioned\" National Dairy Policy resulted in a \"wealth transfer of more than $2.4-billion annually from consumers and food processors to dairy farmers. That's more than $175,000 for each dairy farmer.\" Ed Mussell of the George Morris Centre and Maurice Doyon, a professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Consumer Science at Laval University described the series of articles and their counter-arguments from supporters of supply management, as \"a great deal of rhetoric, simplistic arguments and invalid and untested assumptions\".\n\nSylvain Charlebois from Dalhousie University, a well-known critic of supply management, has argued since 1998 that the system needs to be reformed. He has published numerous studies on the issue, suggesting the system would need to make sectors more competitive, and open to international trades. However, in an August 2018 CBC interview, Charlebois cautioned that it would be \"too dangerous\" to abolish the SM system now: Canadian farms are not competitive. As well, the multibillion-dollar quotas held by thousands of individual farmers, have been used as collateral to take out government loans and invest in farm improvements. He called for a debate on an SM phase out instead.\nMartha Hall Findlay ran for the Liberal Party leadership of the Liberal Party in the 2013 race, on a \"mostly one-issue campaign\", abolishing supply management. According to the \"Washington Post\", \"her taboo-breaking crusade inspired a deluge of favorable editorials that helped make supply management — the Canadian jargon for dairy protectionism — a household phrase.\" Hall Findlay's widely cited June 2012 paper, uploaded to the School of Public Policy, University of Calgary site, where she was an Executive Fellow, called for an end to Canada's supply management system. Hall Findlay published a number of articles based on her report in \"Macleans\". At the same time, other think tanks, such as the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and the Fraser Institute, released their studies on the negative effect supply management had on the Canadian economy.\n\nIn his 2014 paper published by Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), University of Waterloo by researcher Bruce Muirhead and cited in the Library of Parliament, \"supply management benefits all Canadians.\" Muirhead wrote, \"To lose it, however, would be a tragedy — it has served dairy farmers, consumers and processors well over the years, providing cost-effective, safe and secure dairy products in a world where those realities are increasingly difficult to guarantee\".\n\nIn March 2015 University of Manitoba professors Professors Ryan Cardwell, Chad Lawley, along with then-PhD student, Di Xiang, published an article in the \"Canadian Public Policy\" (CPP) journal entitled \"Milked and Feathered: The Regressive Welfare Effects of Canada’s Supply Management\". They concluded that supply management was regressive and placed a greater burden on lowest income households with children, representing up to $592 more annually for dairy and poultry based on Statistics Canada data from 2001. Their award-winning article generated much media attention. \nBy October 2015, as part of its commitment under the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Canada, under the Harper administration, had agreed to cut back both dairy tariffs and import quotas. In return Canada kept its SM policies in place with provincial marketing boards still deciding the farm gate price of milk and production quotas, but with some adjustments for opening up the Canadian dairy market by 3.25%. The U.S. had asked for 10%. When the U.S. under the Trump administration withdrew from TPP on January 24, 2017, the tariff-rate quotas (TRQ) on dairy products remained in effect. No U.S. exports ever pay the 200 to over 300% TRQs because US dairy products are never imported to Canada outside the TRQ.\n\nIn April 2017, President Trump, while visiting Wisconsin, said he would \"stand up for our dairy farmers\" against Canada's \"unfair” practices\" without specifying which \"parts of Canada’s tariff-protected dairy sector he wanted to change, nor what measures [Trump] would take to make it happen\". As a result, Australia and New Zealand \"re-ignited\" their calls for a \"fresh complaint to the world trade organization. It evolved into the end of such surplus sales and called for the dismantling of the supply-management system within 10 years, or, at least concessions, to allow greater market access for their country’s products.\n\nFollowing his June 3, 2018 interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" with Chuck Todd, in which Prime Minister Trudeau clarified Canada's position on newly imposed tariffs, the Dairy Farmers of Canada (DFC) wrote Trudeau to advise against concluding an agreement that would \"negatively impact the dairy farming community.\" Trudeau has mentioned that the US \"want a better deal on their auto sector from Mexico, and I think they want more access on certain agriculture products like dairy to Canada. We--We're moving towards, you know, flexibility in those areas that I thought was very, very promising.\"\n\nOn June 13, against the backdrop of NAFTA re-negotiations, Andrew Scheer, the leader of the opposition—the Conservative Party of Canada—removed Maxime Bernier, MP of the Beauce, from his shadow cabinet, allegedly for his party disloyalty for his April 2018 online publication of a chapter from his postponed book \"Doing Politics Differently: My Vision for Canada\". In the chapter, \"Live or die with supply management\", Bernier explained why ending supply management was one of his major campaign issues when he ran unsuccessfully in 2016-2017 for leadership of the Conservative Party. In January 2017, a Québécois farmer, Jacques Roy, created a Facebook group, \"Les amis de la Gestion de L'offre et des Régions\" (Friends of Supply Management and Rural Communities) with Martin Nichols, to promote the \"selection of a pro-supply management Conservative Party leader\" in the 2017 CPC race. They became CPC members and encouraged others to join. By July 2017, the group had about 10,000 members. Bernier wrote that the group, which he said, supported Andrew Scheer as CPC leader, had joined the CPC party just before the election were \"fake Conservatives\".\n\nBernier said that he was dismissed from the cabinet because of his view of SM. On June 13, during Question Period, Liberal ministers, Diane Lebouthillier and Chrystia Freeland, said that Bernier was clear proof that Conservatives would not defend it.\n\nIn a June 15, 2018 press statement, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at Lawrence MacAulay's family farm, Perdue said that he was not attempting to convince Canada to abolish the SM system. He said, \"We all have our interests and Canada has an embedded supply management system in their dairy industry, and it's not our desire to do away with that, just to regulate it in a way that does not depress world prices.\" Back in Wisconsin, Perdue clarified that while the U.S. should not request that Canada eliminate SM, it would be difficult to reach a NAFTA agreement with Class 7 in place.\n\nBy July 2018, with Canada and the U.S. \"locked in an unprecedented, cross-border trade fight\", President Trump said that he would not commit to any new NAFTA agreement until after the November 2018 congressional midterm elections. Trump \"has frequently attacked Canadian trade barriers on agriculture — dairy products in particular — as unfairly hurting American farmers...Trudeau has insisted the U.S. president's complaints about Canada's trade barriers are the result of Canada's refusal to give in to Trump's demands to do away with the country's supply-management system, which is designed to protect dairy, poultry and egg producers.\" However, a \"vocal contingent\" of American dairy farmers support the Canadian supply and management system. In March 2018, both the Wisconsin Farmers Union (WFU) and Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) were looking at Canada's supply management system to resolve their own problems of low prices resulting in farm failures.\n\nIn 2017, the federal government established a five-year $250 million Dairy Farm Investment Program (DFIP), to lessen the impacts of CETA's implementation on dairy farmers. The first round of funds were distributed to eligible licensed dairy farms in 2018. Each applicant is eligible for up to $250,000 in DFIP funds over the five-year period to upgrade milk production equipment.\n\nAfter the Conservative convention in August 2018, Scheer denied an allegation that the Dairy Farmers of Canada worked with his office to block a motion changing the party stance on supply management after a binder from the Dairy Farmers of Canada was found by a delegate. \n\nThe national supply management system has three basic pillars: production control, pricing mechanism, and import control.\nThe five sectors operate in a similar way, even though they operate under separate provincial marketing boards and national organizations. All five systems have the following elements in common. A quota system controls production volume, through the Market Sharing Quota (MSQ), for example. Through tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), the volume of imported product is limited. Pricing mechanisms that control the farm gate price that producers receive based on cost of production, are coordinated through provincial marketing boards and national organizations.\n\nNational agencies, such as the Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC), Turkey Farmers of Canada (CFC), Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC), Canadian Hatching Egg Producers (CHEP), and the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC), are mandated to \"prevent surpluses and shortages that can cause significant price fluctuations\" by \"setting the national production level based on provincial demand.\" Under the authority of the Farm Products Agencies Act the individual national agencies can \"restrict production\", \"set provincial production quotas\" and \"impose penalties for overproduction or underproduction\". It is the role of each provincial board to set \"minimum quotas and quota transfer rules\", to negotiate prices with buyers, for example, the three major processors, Parmalat, Saputo Inc and Agropur, and to allocate production among farmers. If farmers fail to produce within their \"allotted quota\" they may face penalties.\n\nA permit to sell under supply management caps is called a Market Sharing Quota (MSQ). By 2001, all Canadian provinces were signatories to the National Milk Marketing Plan (NMMP) which fixes a yearly production quota for industrial raw milk across Canada and each province's share of the Market Sharing Quota (MSQ). In some provinces, fluid milk quotas were managed separately by provincial marketing boards, while industrial raw milk was managed by CDC's MSQs. Most provinces roll fluid quota and MSQ into a single production quota, held by dairy producers. The production quota system was designed to prevent overproduction. Each province then allocates MSQs to individual dairy farmers according to provincial policies and based on pooling agreements. Since the 1970s the Canadian dairy industry SM system matches production with domestic market needs.\n\nMSQs can be inherited for free or sold, subject to regulations from the respective board.\n\nIn Ontario, from 2000 to 2010, quota values increased to $25,000/kg of butterfat, a significant leap. This represents the quota or permit required for one dairy cow's production and therefore represents the right to keep a single dairy cow. By 2015, a MSQ was valued at $30,000. By 2018, the combined value of MSQs was $CDN35 billion. \"Farmers use quota as collateral, and total farm debt across Canada amounts to $102 billion — nearly one-third of it lent through a federal agency.\" An average dairy farm of 70 cattle would hold quotas worth 2,100,000. \n\nAccording to the annual Dairy Farm Accounting Project report, Ontario dairy farmers saw their net farm profit drop from C$178,601 in 2012 to C$90,114 in 2016, the lowest point since 2006. The June 2018 report, showed the that the net farm income in 2017 was C$128,230, the first increase since 2012. According to a 2008 OECD policy brief, the median gross income in 2007, before expenses, for a dairy farmer was C$250,000 a year. In 2006, milk quota values on their balance sheets soared to over C$26 billion\" or about 2% of total GDP. OECD says that SM's very high milk quota created \"barriers to entry for young producers.\" For farmers wishing to enter the market, the price of the quota can be up to 75% of start-up costs. This can leave farmers entering the industry with a heavy debt burden, or effectively exclude them from ever starting. A Conference Board of Canada report estimated the book value of dairy quota at about $3.6 to $4.7 billion. Speaking at a GrowCanada 2014 agricultural conference, Mulroney said \"we should consider \"a careful, innovative and generous phase-out of our supply managed programs for dairy and poultry.\n\nTo establish a \"fair price\", the CDC consults with \"dairy producers, processors, further processors, restaurateurs and consumers\" each fall, then completes an annual study to determine the support price for industrial raw milk. Along with the study, Commissioners also consider factors such as \"arguments presented by various stakeholders, an evaluation of the processors' margin, and economic indicators such as the consumer price index\". The support price is posted each December and effective in February of the following year.\n\nProducers create the goods (milk, poultry or eggs), and sell them to either processors or consumers at farm gate prices. Farm gate prices are set by negotiations between the farmers and downstream processors and ratified by the Local Marketing Board (one for each Province or Territory). The farm gate price that the processors or consumer pay is the minimum legal price, but the farmer could negotiate a higher price with one or more of their customers.\n\nIn 1993 multiple component pricing was implemented with dairy farmers were no longer paid based on volume of milk, they were paid based on butterfat, protein and other milk solids. In 1995 changes were made in to the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) Act to allow the CDC to operate revenue sharing milk pools resulting in a national harmonized milk classification system using end-use pricing. \n\nBoth the Canadian and American dairy industries apply end-use classified pricing systems. In Canada, for example, prices of raw industrial milk purchased by milk processors are based on end-use−fluid consumption, yogurt, ice cream, cottage cheese, butter, whole milk powder, skim milk and milk protein concentrates (MPCs). The highest price is for Class A or Class 1 for fluid consumption and the lowest price is for milk products in 'Special Milk Class 7', a new class Canada introduced in February/March 2017. By 2005, the United States had four classes and by 2016 Canada had five. In Canada industrial raw milk is sold to three major processors, Parmalat, Saputo Inc and Agropur. Class 1 included fluid liquid products; Class 2 included yogurt, ice cream, soft products; Class 3 included Cheese; Class 4 included butter, milk powders and Class 5 included exports under access, permits 5(d) subsidized exports. In April 2016, Ontario began to implement a new milk price (Class 6) and Manitoba did the same in August 2016.\n\nBy June 2015, skim milk processing plants hit their capacity in Ontario, Québec and the Maritimes. The Dairy Farmers of Nova Scotia, the producers' marketing board, that purchases pools of raw milk from farmers to sell to dairy milk processors, raised their milk quota in March 2015, in response to an \"unprecedented\" increase in demand for butter and cream. They were left with a surplus of skimmed milk.\n\nCanada's supply management system attracted media attention in 2016, when the province of Ontario responded to the exponential increase of the imports of diafiltered milk (UV) from the United States. In April 2016, the Dairy Farmers of Ontario created a new class of milk designed to encourage processors to invest in new facilities in Canada. They adjusted prices for certain milk ingredients such as MPIs, to compete with U.S. proteins.\n\nThe Global Dairy Ingredients Market is booming and expected to increase as these relatively new milk products, specifically milk protein isolates (MPIs), milk protein concentrates (MPCs), also known as ultrafiltered milk (UV) or diafiltered milk, entered the marketplace. MPC's are produced in facilities in the U.S. along the CA-US border. Compared with raw milk, MPIs are inexpensive and easier to ship and more efficient in cheese production. Because the technology was invented post-NAFTA, and because they were listed as proteins by Canada's border agency, not milk, at the Canadian border U.S. MPI were both tariff and quota free. The MPIs were a \"cheap alternative to skim milk for Canadian processors such as Saputo Inc and Parmalat Canada Inc, who must meet federal standards for milk and protein content in cheese\". By October 2008, the TRQ for MPIs was put in place and there was a very strong import demand in 2009. By 2010, MPIs were placed under Re-export Program (IREP). By 2011, the TRQs for MPCs were always filled and the demand for Re-export Program (IREP) was strong. Over a five-year period ending in January 2016, the quantity of U.S. milk protein isolates imports rose to 2,700 tonnes—an increase of ten times by volume, representing about $150 million a year.\n\nIn response to the new Class 6 introduced by Ontario in 2016, Agropur cancelled its MPIs (diafiltered milk) contracts with American facilities, such as Cayuga Milk Ingredients, who claimed they lost $30 million in exports. Cayuga, Wisconsin-based Grassland Dairy Products Inc and other US facilities in turn cancelled contracts with dozens of dairy farmers in Wisconsin and the New York. There are concerns that \"thousands of [US] family farms could be lost without access to Canada's processors' contracts. Politicians in affected states blamed Canada for the threats to dairy farms and asked for intervention from the Trump administration. In June 2016, federal Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay responded to concerns from Canadian dairy farmers that US MPIs caused a \"reduced demand for domestic milk.\"\n\nIn March 2017, the Canadian dairy industry implemented a Canada-wide domestic policy, creating a lower-priced class of industrial milk, Class 7, as part of Canada's National Ingredient Strategy negotiated between Canadian processors and producers, to address the surplus of 'non-fat solids' which include milk ingredients such as whole milk powder, skim milk and milk protein concentrates (MPCs) as \"fast-rising volumes of U.S. milk proteins not subject to high tariffs\" flowed into Canada. Class 7 promotes the production of protein substances in Canada using Canadian milk and benefits the domestic cheese-manufacturing sector. According to the media outlets in October 2017, in the list of U.S. requests in the NAFTA negotiations, the phasing out of SM over a ten-year period and the elimination of the Class 7 mechanism, were included. In April 2018, a 68-member bi-partisan group of members of Congress wrote a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer calling for the removal of Class 7 and other Canadian dairy policies. In their July 2018 report, Canadian agrifood economists, Al Mussell and Douglas Hedley, explained how Canada's SM system, which was bound by a butterfat quota, would become bound by a skim quota because of the \"structural surplus of skim\" which threatens to overpower the SM system.\n\nTen dairy industry organisations, including the Dairy Companies Association of New Zealand (DCANZ) and other dairy industry leaders from the US, EU, Argentina, Australia, and Mexico, co-signed a letter to request that their governments intervene in ending Canada's \"new and harmful\" 'Special Milk Class 7' mechanism by potentially entering a complaint through the WTO's Dispute Settlement System (DSS), a process which could take several years to conclude.\n\nIn 2016, before Class 7 was introduced, Canada exported less than 24,000 tonnes of skim milk powder (SMP). Although the organizations expressed concerns that as Canada moves its surplus skim milk powder onto the global market at low prices in \"significant\" volumes, this could distort and depress global prices, Statistic Canada reported in 2017 that Canada exported 71,880 tonnes which is valued at C$173 million ($133 million USD) and represents an increase of 47,880 tonnes over 2016. The US exports \"five times more dairy to Canada than vice-versa\". Agri-Food Economic Systems' research lead, Al Mussell, said \"concerns about Class 7 are overblown\" as Canadian SMP sales are \"a drop in the bucket.\" Even though there was an increase in SMP exports in 2017 and 2018, that \"growth cannot continue because Canada’s system restricts production\". The price of Class 7 SMP was about $0.5488 USD a lb. in March 2017.\n\nIn April 2018 Export Action Global report, co-authored by Adam Taylor, who was a senior advisor for Ed Fast, Minister for International Trade (2011-2015) under Stephen Harper during negotiations for the Canada-EU trade deal and the TPP, said that, \"We’ve always been told this as though it’s actual, verifiable fact — that Canada has higher dairy prices because of supply management. We now know that that is factually not true.\" The 44-page document by Taylor and Fion Anastassiades was based on Canadian government data and the 2017 Nielsen's Fresh Milk Price Report. According to AC Nielson Fresh Milk Price Report, which compared the global retail fluid milk price per litre for 12 months ending October 2017, the price of 1 litre of liquid milk in Canadian dollars in Canada was $1.50. In Australia it was $1.57, in the USA a litre of rBST-free milk was $1.61, in France, $1.77, and in New Zealand, $1.83.\n\nWhile farm gate prices are decided by SM mechanisms, other factors affect retail prices across the country. In Québec, the minimum retail price of milk had been frozen for two years by the Régie des marchés agricoles et alimentaires du Québec, which regulates all agricultural and food retail prices in Québec in general and milk in particular. In February 2018, the Régie approved an increase of about 1.2% or c. 2 cents per liter for 2018. Retailers had successfully lobbied for the price increase under the leadership of Association des détaillants en alimentation (ADA) and its CEO Florent Gravel. CTV News reported that in Québec City and Montreal consumers could pay from $1.76 ($1.34) to $1.92 ($1.46 USD) a litre for homo milk and from $1.56 (1.18 USD) to $1.72 (1.31 USD) a 1 litre of skim milk. A 2017 study by AC Nielson, a global marketing research firm, \"commissioned by the Dairy Farmers of Canada, suggests that the prices Canadians pay for milk, for example, are comparable to those in many countries throughout the world, at an average retail price of around $1.30 per litre.\"\n\nSM limits milk imports through tariff-rate quota (TRQ) to prevent the Canadian market from being flooded by much larger food-producing nations who now have milk surplus. Only seven per cent of all milk produced globally is exported with ninety three per cent \"consumed in the country of origin\". The DFO says that most countries, including Canada produce milk for domestic consumers.\n\nIn 2015, the three top dairy imports into the country were specialty cheeses, milk protein substance and whey products. The largest suppliers into Canada were the United States, New Zealand, France and Italy.\n\nA tariff-rate quota (TRQ) is an international trade policy tool that combines import quotas and tariffs. By 2013, there were approximately 1200 WTO TRQs in the agricultural sector annually among supplying countries under GATT Article XIII. TRQs are a result of the \"current market access requirements\" and the \"minimum market access requirements\" forming the basis of the \"Uruguay Round country schedules for agriculture.\" TRQs are two-tiered tariffs in which quotas of certain sensitive domestic products are assigned a quantitative threshold or WTO \"minimum access commitments\" for imports during a designated time period. Tariffs for imports that are at or below the threshold, are either nonexistent or very low. Imports above the quantitative threshold, are much higher, making the cost of importation intentionally prohibitive. Once imports exceed the \"minimum access commitments\" as required by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which allow for imports at no or lower tariffs, in Canada imports face prohibitive tariffs such as 168% for eggs, 285% for chicken, 246% for cheese and over 300% for butter. These steep tariffs have been often cited to criticize SM for creating barriers to free trade and artificially raising prices by SM critics such as David E. Bond (2010), Andrew Coyne (2011), Hall Findlay (2012) and President Trump in 2016.\n\nTRQs came into use after World Trade Organization (WTO)'s 1995 Uruguay Round Agreement with 123 nations as contractual parties. By 2018 the United States's quantitative TRQ threshold for the import of milk products is 3% and Canada's is 10%. By 2018, about 41 countries, including Canada and the U.S., had WTO approved tariff-rate quotas.\n\nHigh TRQs are only placed on imports above the quota, not on all the dairy products sold to Canada. Below the quantitative threshold, Canadian TRQs on dairy products are often zero or less than 5%. Canada's milk quota system is butterfat-based so the highest TRQ is on butter at 298.5%. The threshold in 2005 for butter was 3,274 tonnes, of which 2,000 tonnes was allocated to New Zealand. Imports above the quota for butter would pay the steep tariff. Brookings noted that \"[as] a practical matter, no dairy products are sold to Canada outside the quota, so no U.S. exports really pay a high tariff.\n\nPrior to 1995 Canada employed agricultural import controls in use since the 1983 World Trade Organization's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA). These were converted to TRQs after 1995. By 2011, Canada's WTO-authorized TRQ represented 8% of the cheese market and 1% of the yogurt market.\n\nThe Canadian supply management system uses these TRQs to ensure that the majority of Canadian dairy and poultry are supplied by Canadian farms shielding Canadian farmers against the \"heavily subsidized dairy coming into Canada\". Canada has classified the dairy, poultry and egg sectors as \"sensitive\" and this has been accepted under WTO trading rules. It established a quota of allowable imports in these sensitive sectors of 4% to fulfill minimum access commitments at low tariffs. The allowable quota for cheese was 8% of the domestic market and 1% for yogurt. In 2009, in preparation for entry into TPP negotiations, Canada was calling for a minimum 6% TRQ threshold on designated 'sensitive' products, dairy, poultry and egg, as opposed to the existing 4% TRQ, which they said was necessary to adequately protect supply management. At that time, it was proposed \"to designate 6% of tariff lines as sensitive in exchange for raising its TRQ threshold on those products – effectively allowing more foreign supply to enter the Canadian market. That proposal was not acceptable to Canada’s supply managed industries.\" By October 2015, Canada had agreed to open the dairy market by 3.5% while retaining the SM system.\n\nWhen the U.S. under the Trump administration withdrew from TPP on January 24, 2017, the tariff-rate quotas (TRQ) on dairy products remained in effect.\n\nIn 2015, the three top dairy imports into Canada were specialty cheeses, milk protein concentrates (MPCs) and whey products. The largest suppliers into Canada were the United States, New Zealand, France and Italy.\n\nThe Business Council of Canada (BCC) reported in 2012 that, beginning in 2000, New Zealand and Australia phased out their dairy supply management programs and as a result, their dairy industries increased productivity and efficiency and became global industry leaders. Muirhead explained that from 2007 to 2014, the demand for New Zealand's milk intensified with \"new consumers in China, India and Indonesia\" raising the price by 50 percent. \n\nWith the supply management system, processors of dairy, poultry, and eggs benefit from predictable supply from the system, while having to pay higher prices for their inputs, which can generally be passed on to the consumer. However, this means they are at a disadvantage on the international market, because their inputs are comparatively expensive. Total dairy exports in Canada amount to only 5% of production. New Zealand by contrast, which has phased out subsidies and does not have supply management, 95% of dairy is exported. New Zealand's share in world milk markets jumped from 5.8 per cent in 1995 to 16.7 per cent in 2014. Canada's share fell from 0.9 per cent to 0.45 per cent. In 2014, New Zealand produced 21 million tonnes and Australia produced 9.5-million tonnes of milk, compared with Canada's 8.4-million tonnes. In his 2014 article University of Waterloo's Bruce Muirhead wrote that the liberalized market benefited New Zealand in terms of food exports and economy, but the price of milk for New Zealanders rose so much, a price freeze was placed in 2011 and farmers lost income. \n\nOne of the mandates of the Canadian Dairy Commission is to \"ensure the quality and supply of milk\". According to Hall Findlay, though the responsibility of milk is under the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to ensure proper oversight of dairy production and to guarantee that strict standards of biosecurity are upheld.\"The Council of Canadians cautioned that, \"Given the subsidized U.S. industrialized farming industry, allowing U.S. farms more market access [by eliminating supply management] would mean Canadian small farmers would be in competition with larger industrialized U.S. farms. The market would expand to include milk from U.S. farms that may have Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH) in it, unlike the milk here in Canada, which doesn’t allow BGH.\" In an August 21, 2017 article in the \"Globe and Mail\", Martha Hall Findlay wrote that, Canada could demand milk to be hormone-free like Europe does with Canadian beef.\n\nJohn Manley, former deputy prime minister of Canada, criticized provincial dairy marketing boards that \"control and restrict the sale of dairy products\" by setting production quotas and imposing \"strict limits on interprovincial shipments\". However, Ontario MP John Nater, the Conservative critic for interprovincial trade, expressed concerns that changes to \"marketing boards and supply management\" should not be \"to the detriment of farmers.\" In R v Comeau, a controversial Supreme Court of Canada case on the scope of free trade between the Canadian provinces, led some supporters of the supply management system to express concern that if inter-provincial conditions were removed, then it could lead to unintended consequences. The SM-5 Organizations \"acting jointly\" said that it \"could result in the destruction of supply management — a regulatory system in place for generations, on which the livelihood of thousands of farmers across the country depends.\"\n\nIn a 2013 report by the George Morris Centre, the authors recommended reforms in supply-management system to align with changes in its environment related to market growth, improved efficiency, reduction in costs and liberalized pricing. To improve efficiency they suggested the elimination of the provincial \"balkanization\" of the dairy market and the liberalization of milk quota transfers.\n\nCritics claim the supply system has been a major barrier in free trade negotiations, including in inter-provincial trade in Canada.\n\nWhile supply management was one of many issues in Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a free-trade agreement between Canada, the European Union and its member states and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) negotiations, and the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) the system remained intact. \n\nThe United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) was reached on October 1, 2018. Under USMCA, supply management remains in place, the US was granted an expanded 3.6 % market access to the domestic dairy market, similar to what it would have accessed, had the US remained in the CPP, (3.6% vs 3.25%), and Class 7 was eliminated. \n\nSupply management policies provide \"stability and wealth\" for \"primary producers, processors, retailers and input and service providers like equipment manufacturers and financial institutions.\" They have been \"criticized for being costly and regressive tools to transfer dollars from consumers to producers and for creating barriers to entry for young producers.\" Canada's trade partners say that supply management curbs market access.\n\nIn a 2014 article by Barrie McKenna, former Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, who served as Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993 suggested during the 2014 CETA \nnegotiations that abolishing supply management would \"bolster Canada's case for concessions from the U.S. on government purchasing (Buy America), non-tariff barriers (country labelling for meat) and on agricultural export subsidies.\" Barrie McKenna notes that \"Many Conservative MPs grumble privately about supply management. But on the record, they and members of every other federal party stand as a monolithic block in defence of the status quo.\" Apart from Bernier, the leaked binder from that Conservative MPs, David Anderson, Kevin Sorenson, Dan Albas, Alupa Clarke, Tony Clement, Tom Kmeic, Alex Nuttall and Len Webber as not being supportive towards Supply Management.\n\nOne of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Policy Advisors for the Minister of International Trade's Global Affairs Canada, Simon Beauchemin, had published an opinion piece in \"La Presse\" in 2014, in which he stated that Canada's supply management system disadvantaged us in the TPP negotiations particularly in relation to the US, who have been seeking greater access to the Canadian dairy and poultry market for many years. Beauchemin suggested that Canada revisit our commitment to supply management. When this was publicized in 2018, Trudeau's senior press secretary Chantal Gagnon said that Beauchemin \"now fully supports the Liberal government's policy on supply management.\n\nIn its 2008 review, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was highly critical of the supply-managed system, particularly relating to the dairy industry. In their 2017 review they again called for a phase out of the supply management system to improve Canada's export growth in 2008. Think tanks such as the Broadbent Institute, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, The Council of Canadians, and the Parkland Institute support supply management. Some of Canada's most influential think tanks, such as the C.D. Howe Institute, and the Fraser Institute, Business Council of Canada (BCC), the Canada West Foundation, the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, Montreal Economic Institute (MEI), Macdonald-Laurier Institute and the Conference Board of Canada have been publishing in-depth articles since the early 2000s that are critical of supply management. A 2012 \"Globe and Mail\" commentary adds that Other countries have either eliminated or drastically reduced dairy subsidies, and taken advantage of growing global opportunities for their dairy products, while Canadian dairy farmers are limited to a smaller market.\n\nIn their most recent poll in May 2018, Ipsos commissioned by the Dairy Farmers of Canada, reported that three-quarters of Canadians \"agree that the federal government should defend Canada’s dairy farmers in the NAFTA renegotiation.\" An April 2017 poll by Abacus Data showed that 92% of Canadians were \"happy with the range and quality of dairy products available in Canada\". Two-thirds of Canadians answered that they were \"satisfied with prices.\" Only 23% said that Canada should change the rules to allow more foreign dairy products to compete with Canadian dairy to potentially lower prices and have more dairy products available. Angus Reid market research poll published on August 2, 2017 indicated that most Canadians admitted they knew \"nothing at all\" about the supply management system. In spite of that, 29% were committed to keeping SM in place for farmers even if the US retaliated in the 2017 NAFTA negotiations. Forty-five per cent would consider using SM in tough trade negotiations but only as a \"last resort.\" Only twenty-six per cent would scrap SM outright.\n\nIn 2010, the BCC also noted that Canada's wine industry was \"shielded from foreign competition\" prior to the 1988 Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA). The wine industry phased out \"tariff and non-tariff barriers\" to free trade and \"flourished\". \"Canadian wines are now internationally renowned. Output, exports, productivity and employment have all increased, while labour and producer incomes have doubled.\" Findlay claims the supply management system has been a major barrier in free trade negotiations, including free trade with the European Union, free trade with India, and inter-provincial trade in Canada.It has not prevented these agreements from being completed. Ed Fast, MP and former federal minister of International Trade, wrote that \"supply management focuses on regulating domestic production; it’s not necessarily synonymous with free trade.\"\n\nThe Canadian government says that \"every country supports its agriculture sector in some way. Supporters state that other countries use subsidies to support their dairy farmers on the global market. However, critics have stated that Australia, New Zealand, and the United States have either eliminated or drastically reduced dairy subsidies, and taken advantage of growing global opportunities for their dairy products, which have restricted Canada dairy farmers to a small market. When Britain in the 1980s and the European Union in 2015, ended their milk quotas it resulted in overproduction and milk surpluses, the collapse or milk prices and dairy farms. \n\nThe Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a free-trade agreement between Canada, the European Union and its member states was provisionally applied in 2017. The federal government relaxed its supply-management system, agreeing to tariff rate quotes for 18 million kilograms of annual cheese imports. The EU pursued increased access to the Canadian cheese market and requested that provincial representatives, particularly Québec and Ontario, who are specifically concerned by potential challenges to the supply management system. The increase which nearly doubles the amount of duty-free EU cheese imports duty-free, is the first time it has raised the cheese quota since the 1970s. \n\nIn March 2018, Canada signed its most recent trade agreement, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes ten countries. In 2011, Australia and New Zealand moved to exclude Canada from participation in the TPP trade negotiations because of its Supply management system. Once Canada agreed to negotiate on the supply management system, Canada was invited to fully participate in the TPP negotiations, but faced protests from supply management supporters.The TPP only managed to open 3.25 percent for dairy, 2.3 percent for eggs, 2.1 percent for chicken, 2 percent for turkey, and 1.5 percent for broiler hatching eggs in market access.\n\nSupply management has been one of many issues in negotiations such as the re-negotiation of NAFTA which are ongoing in 2018, Some American farmers such as the Wisconsin Farmers Union, the National Family Farm Coalition and Institute for Agricultural & Trade Policy and others, would leave the Canadian system alone instead of fighting it as expected. In its June 2017 report on Canada, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) projected that Canada's export growth could generally decrease with NAFTA re-negotiations but \"renegotiation of trade agreements could boost inclusive growth if it led to a phasing-out of Canadian dairy supply management policies.\" Canadian wheat and barley farmers have raised similar over the talks.\n\nIn the context of NAFTA talks, Jean Charest has suggested scrapping Supply Management in exchange for the United States scrapping their farm subsidies. Stanely Hartt argued that if supply management was ended New co-operatives, like Agropur, could emerge providing ownership interests and employment to the owners of small farms dedicated to those product lines and, with proper adjustment programs, the resulting growth would increase our prosperity and standard of living.\n\nSupporters said that supply management is effective at keeping revenue stable for farmers. For this reason, farmers lobby to protect supply management from any challenges, both domestic and international.\n\nSupporters have stated that supply management protects farmers but critics say that there are other ways for the government to impact farmers without removing supply management, such as changing Canada's Food Guide to shift from a dairy-based diet to a plant-based diet.\n\nAccording to a 2015 Boston Consulting Group study, New Zealand's production costs are half those of North American dairy farmers whose cattle spend most of their lives indoors, because New Zealand's \"free-roaming\", \"grass-eating cows\" live outdoors year-round. Critics state that New York and Wisconsin have colder climates than Canada and their industries are thriving without supply management.\n\nSupporters of supply management say that it protects customers from US milk produced by cattle injected with growth hormones that enables United States dairy farms to be more productive than those in Canada. John Barber, a supporter says that family farms in Canada that milk an average of 80 cows a day. Critics say that the state of Washington (whose own cows are rbST-Free) produces milk per year per cow compared to Wisconsin (which permits the use of hormones) at per cow. Canada produces of milk per year per cow.\n\nTaxpayers do not pay direct subsidies to supply-managed industry products, such as dairy, poultry and egg farmers. Agricultural subsidies are common in many developed countries. The majority of Canadian farmers in sectors that are not supply-managed, including grain, beef, pork, food oils and pulses, receive few if any subsidies. The OECD estimated the subsidy equivalent in 2012 (producer support estimate) in all Canadian agriculture represented 18% of the value of the industry with most of this amount going to supply managed sectors which represent only a percentage of Canadian agriculture. Critics say that this results in a \"much higher effective subsidy\" for supply-managed industries. According to Hall Findlay's 2012 study, in the European Union, the effective subsidies were 27%, with the United States at 10%, Australia (6%), New Zealand (1%), Brazil (6%), and China at 9%.\n\nCalgary-based lawyer, Michael Osborne wrote in a July 2018 \"Financial Post\" article that \"Supply management may be lawful, but it is undoubtedly an equal assault on the market...The only difference between supply management and price-fixing cartels is the web of federal and provincial laws that support the first and make the second a criminal offence.\" Osborne cited the example of a 2012 decision on auto parts price-fixing by Federal Court Judge Paul Crampton in which Crampton described price-fixing cartels, in general, as \"an assault on our open-market economy.\"\n\nCritics such as the Frontier Centre for Public Policy's Eric Merkley, Canada West Foundation's Martha Hall Findlay, \"Bloomberg\"'s Stephen Mihm, and Maxime Bernier have described SM as a \"cartel\". Jonathan Kay called it a \"milk racket.\" Bernier explained in his chapter that “The word cartel applies to a system, not to individuals, and it doesn’t necessarily describe criminal behaviour,”\n\nArticles in and the \"Globe and Mail\" in 2017 and in the \"Toronto Star\" in 2018 compared supply management to the bread price-fixing in Canada scandal. \"The Star\" editors wrote that consumers are \"penalized through the absolutely legal, indeed highly valued, practice of supply management.\"\n\nProponents of supply management claim that it is effective at keeping small family farms viable instead of having them crowded out by large factory farms.\n\nThe number of dairy farms decreased from 500,000 just after WWII to 18,500 in 2005. According to Hall Findlay, the numbers continued to decrease from 135,000 in 1971 to 13,000 in 2011, representing a 91 percent loss. The number of chicken farms has declined 88 percent; while in the same period of time in the United States, the number of dairy farms dropped by 88 percent. Supply-managed farms represent 8% to 13% of all farms in the country. Hall Findlay says that even with supply management, \"[t]here has been more consolidation in dairy, poultry and eggs than in almost every other agricultural sector\". Supporters, such as the Broadbent Institute, say that the supply management system \"allows Canada a degree of food security and food sovereignty that is remarkable\". The \"global dairy is in the throes of a massive downturn, which has created havoc everywhere\" except Canada. Without the stability of the supply management system, farmers could lose their livelihood while \"consumers do not necessarily benefit from lower prices given the activities of supermarkets (and others) to keep prices as high as possible.\" Though Hall Findlay has stated hypocritical to support supply management and claim to support \"progressive, \"social justice\" values.\n\nIn her 2014 \"Maclean's\" article Hall Findlay wrote that the \"average dairy farm’s net worth was well more than $2.5 million\" in 2010 and \"the average poultry/egg farm’s net worth was almost $4 million—far more than all other Canadian farmers, and far, far more than the average Canadian family.\"\n\nOne of the lobby groups that oppose supply management as an impediment to the pursuit of \"reciprocal trade and investment liberalization\" is the Business Council of Canada (BCC)—Canadian Council of Chief Executives (CCCE)— a registered lobbyist on Canadian public policy. Since at least 2012, when Harper announced his intention to enter into TPP trade talks, the former Liberal deputy prime minister John Manley as BCC CEO, has led the call for review and reform of Canada's supply management system to increase productivity, exports, and employment.\n\nThe Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC), a Crown corporation composed mainly of dairy farmers, and its analogue for eggs, chicken and turkey products, the Farm Products Council of Canada, are just some of the organizations that defend supply management. DFC partners who publish articles in support of supply management include the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the GO5, Coalition for a Fair Farming Model, Supply Management, FarmGate5, and the five national marketing agencies that administer or support agricultural supply management systems, known jointly as the SM-5 Organizations, such as, Dairy Farmers of Canada (DFC), Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC), Turkey Farmers of Canada (TFC), Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC) Canadian Hatching Egg Producers (CHEP) support the system. Other supporters include Québec Federation of Milk Producers, and the Union of Agricultural Producers (UPA) that represent dairy farmers and turn up at protests. In March 2018, the Wisconsin Farmers Union (WFU) hosted events for Wisconsin dairy farmers and lawmakers in five Wisconsin cities in which Dairy Farmers of Ontario (DFO) representatives explained Canada's dairy supply management system. At the end of the presentation, by a show of hands 70 to 80% of participants indicated that there were elements of Canada's SM \"that would make sense in the U.S.\" When asked if they believed Canada caused the \"challenges dairy farmers in the U.S. [were] experiencing, there were \"no hands raised at any of the five meetings.\" Hall Findlay described the dairy lobby as a small group with out-sized power, that pose a threat to the political careers of those who oppose SM.\n\nThe Dairy Farmers of America (DFA), the largest cooperative of milk-producers in the United States, representing 14,000 farmers, faced with the increasing number of dairy farm bankruptcies, low milk prices, voted at their annual meeting in March 2018, to look into Canada's supply management system.\n\nAgropur, which is one of three milk processors in Canada that control 80% of production−the others are Montreal-based Saputo Inc and Parmalat Canada−defends the \"supply management system, both in the public arena and with various levels of government.\" In preparation for TPP negotiations, Agropur had commissioned the Boston Consulting Group to produce the 2015 report, \"Analysis of the potential impacts of the end of supply management on the Canadian dairy industry\", and distributed it widely, which they said, \"had a significant impact on decision makers and the media alike.\" The report estimated that a complete and abrupt abolition of supply management would put 40% of Canadian dairy production at risk, resulting in the loss of about 5,000 dairy farms. \"Agropur Cooperative and Saputo Inc., have expanded into the U.S. or even Brazil to boost revenues.\"\n\nDairy farmers have greater political influence because \"[as] producers, [they] are very involved in [their] regional economy and regional politics. Each producer has more impact than the average voter, because [they] buy supplies from local companies, [they] sell to local processors, [they] are at the base of the regional economy.\" Dairy farmers have been major players in international trade talks such as NAFTA and TPP talks. In 2015, during TPP negotiations, dairy farmers and their cows \"converged on Parliament Hill to protest the mere possibility that supply management would be significantly affected by TPP negotiations.\"\n\nA 2015 \"Maclean's\" article, \"Why the dairy lobby is so powerful\", described an incident during the September 28, 2015 federal leaders Munk Debate on foreign affairs, then-NDP Leader Tom Mulcair asked Stephen Harper if they could assure the Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec (UPA) President Marcel Groleau, reached out to the New Democrats, Liberals and Bloc Québécois, of his full support for supply management. Harper immediately complied. In his 2018 on-line political memoir, Maxime Bernier grouped together supporters of supply-managed sectors under a combined dairy lobby. Bernier described the UPA as an \"extension\" of Québec's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. He wrote that the combined dairy lobby funds millions of dollars in university graduate programs and research on \"collective marketing of agricultural products\" across the country in support of SM policies.\n\nAccording to the Federal lobbyist registry, from January to September 2012, the Chicken Farmers of Canada had 92 contacts with federal officials making it on the list of top ten lobby groups with the most contacts that year. They lobbied on poultry import tariffs, medicated feed mixing regulations, meat inspection regulations and food safety programs.\n\nAccording to their 2015 Boston Consulting Group comprehensive report, there are about 12,000 dairy farms in Canada that produce about 8 billion litres of milk annually which is sent for \"treatment and processing to approximately 450 dairy plants\". Critics state supply management can be used to deter manufacturing jobs away from Canada. In 2010, 22,650 people were employed in the dairy processing sector. Critics state that number could be, and should be, much higher.\n\nAnother study stated an estimate for dairy input \"costs of Canadian manufacturers, which produce everything from frozen pizza to ready-made lasagna, to be between five and 30 percent higher than those of U.S. companies.\"\n\nIn 2017, the Chinese corporation, Feihe International, invested $225 million to construct an infant formula plant in Kingston, Ontario in 2017, citing one of the main reasons for choosing Canada, was the supply management system though it was mainly for the quality of milk. In 2013, Chobani, a yogurt maker from the US, abandoned plans to build a $76 million plant in Kingston, which would have created 1,300 direct and indirect jobs based on quota limitation.\n\nCritics state that the high cost associated with supply management had led to Canada's food processing industry bleeding \"market share to U.S. competitors and several major companies such as Campbell Soup Co, Kraft Heinz Co., and Kellogg Co. closing Canadian plants in recent years.\" In addition, they state that dairy processors establish operations outside the country to meet global demand due saturation in the Canadian market caused by the tariffs.\nPostmedia columnist Joe Childley wrote in his November 2017 article in the \"Financial Post\" that the butter crisis in France, was an \"object lesson\" for Canada's SM system in NAFTA renegotiations. In March 2017, the \"Wisconsin Agriculturist\" reported that butter consumption in the United States was increasing and was nearing a fifty-year record high which was pushing the price of butter higher. Europe also experienced a butter shortage.\n\nIn Canada, starting in 2015 there was also an \"unprecedented\" demand for butter (and cream) in Canada resulting in a brief but \"severe butter shortage\" that some blamed on supply management. Provincial marketing boards raised their milk quotas to respond to demand. By April 2017, there was enough growth in the Canadian domestic butterfat output to meet demand.\n\nSupply management limits the production of dairy product in Canada, and imposes tariffs on imports. The direct consequence of these policies is to increase the retail prices of dairy products. According to the Conference Board of Canada's March 2014 report, \"Canada's Reforming Dairy Supply Management: The Case for Growth\", Canadian households paid on average about $276 more annually than those from other countries for dairy products because of SM. According to the CPP 2015 article \"Milked and Feathered\", the average cost for Canadian households was $444 annually based on StatsCan's 2001 data. The OECD estimated that the consumer support estimate (CSE) from 2001 to 2011 represented about $2.6 billion annually. Based on a rough estimate of 9.4 million households in 2011, this represented about $276 per household annually.\n\nHall Findlay has been saying since 2012 that Canadian consumers pay one and a half to three times as much for dairy, poultry and eggs than they otherwise would without the supply management system, or pay up to around C$450/year per household and $600/year for households with children. This has been criticized as a regressive tax on the poor (around 37 cents per litre), for whom food is a large portion of their budget, and who are in effect subsidizing well-off farmers.\n\nIn addition, a study pointed out that supply management was costing Canadian consumers $2.6 billion per year (compare to supply management dairy product bringing in $970 Million into the economy). The study stated that supply management impacts the poorest households five times (2.4% of income or almost 25% of income on food) more than wealthy families (0.5% of income or almost 6% of income on food) in relative household income, while another study point to that around 133,032 to 189,278 Canadians (or 67,000 to 79,000 households) are pushed into poverty due to burden of SM.\n\nCanadians farm products that are not supply managed do as well as their American or European competitors, who receive more support from their government. Nearly 60% of Canada's agricultural and agri-food production is bound for foreign markets, with nearly half of this going to the U.S. market. Hall Findlay wrote that \"other agricultural sectors in Canada (grain, beef, pork, etc.) do not have similar controls or subsidies, and for the most part compete as a normal product on the international market.\n\nMontreal Economic Institute's public policy analyst, Alexandre Moreau, said that Canadian farmers who are not under SM would \"pay the price\" if President Trump is unable to deliver on his 2017 promise related to NAFTA re-negotiations, to increase \"market access to U.S. dairy farmers\" in a direct \"aim at Canada's supply management.\" Wheat farmer Kevin Auch, former chair of the Alberta Wheat Commission does not want the 90% of Canadian farmers who are not under SM to put at risk to preserve SM for the 10% who are. In other sectors of agriculture. There are ten times more farmers that benefit from increased trade. \n\nSupply management make farmers poorer by limiting options for farmers when selling dairy products as well as missing opportunities to prevent food shortages when supplying the growing population.\n\nIn a 2015 anti-SM article by the Ottawa-based Centre for International Policy Studies' Alan Freeman described SM as a \"bizarre system of agricultural market protection that seems to have been lifted from a five-year economic plan in 1950s Communist Romania\". Freeman cited the University of Guelph’s Food Institute's Sylvain Charlebois, who is also a \"trenchant\" SM critic, saying Canadian dairy farmers under SM are not as productive as their American counterparts and it costs them twice as much to produce milk as it does in the United States. Canada's supply management forces Canada, Canadian farmers, and Canadians to give up billions in GDP, exports, prosperity, jobs, and tax revenue.\n\n"}

Later non-veterans were accepted as its supporter-members. The organisation was founded in 1929, emerged as a mass anti-socialist and anti-parliamentary movement. The leaders of this association were Andres Larka (formal figurehead and presidential candidate) and Artur Sirk.\n\nThe Vaps Movement was a paramilitary anti-socialist organisation with most of its base being the lower middle class. They had no elaborate ideology or any connection with foreign fascist movements, their goal was simply a more authoritarian and nationalist government in Estonia. The league rejected racial ideology and openly criticized the Nazi persecution of Jews, it also lacked the willingness to use violence, or the goal of territorial expansion. However, they were known for sharing some aspects of fascist movements of the time, such as the wearing of a black beret as their uniform headgear, and the use of the Roman salute. Moderate members of the movement such as Johan Pitka gradually left the organization and new members were allowed to join, who were not veterans. The organization issued its own newspaper, Võitlus ('The Struggle').\n\nThe movement strongly supported constitutional reform that would enable a strong President to address Estonia's problems. Estonian patriots had been advocating such a change since the mid 20s, but it was not until October 1933 that the government was forced to allow the Vaps movement to put forward its own referendum on constitutional reform, after watered down centre-right proposals failed to win any support. This was approved by 72.7 percent of the voters. The organization was banned by the government of Jaan Tõnisson (who opposed the constitutional reform) under a state of emergency imposed before the referendum, but after this the organization was re-established and became even more radically patriotic. The league spearheaded replacement of the parliamentary system with a presidential form of government and laid the groundwork for an April 1934 presidential election, which it expected to win.\n\nAfter the League won absolute majorities in local elections in the three largest cities at the beginning of 1934, but not in the most rural self-governments nor small towns and boroughs, the recently elected constitutional \"State Elder\" (head of government and head of state) Konstantin Päts declared a state of emergency in the whole country (in certain parts, this was already in effect since 1918) on 12 March 1934, disbanding the Vaps movement and arresting its leading figures. Konstantin Päts established a moderate regime that the historian Georg von Rauch has called Authoritarian Democracy. In 1935, a National Association was formed to replace political parties and series of state corporate institutions were introduced.\n\nThe league was banned and disbanded in December 1935. On 6 May 1936, 150 members of the league went on trial; 143 of them were convicted and sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment. They were granted an amnesty and freed in 1938, by which time the league had lost most of its popular support. By 1 January 1938, a new constitution took effect and new parliament was elected in February 1938. The new constitution combined a strong President with a partly elected and partly appointed, officially non-partisan Parliament.\n\nMembers of the movement used the Roman salute and wore black berets as symbols of their allegiance to the organisation.\n\nThey had maintained good relations with Finnish nationalist movements such as the Lapua Movement, Patriotic People's Movement and Academic Karelia Society.\n\nJüri Liim claimed to be restoring the original Vaps Movement. But he didn't get a registration and his organization is illegal.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1192971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1192971", "title": "Wicked problem", "text": "Wicked problem\n\nA wicked problem is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. The use of the term \"wicked\" here has come to denote resistance to resolution, rather than evil. Another definition is \"a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point\". Moreover, because of complex interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems.\n\nThe phrase was originally used in social planning. Its modern sense was introduced in 1967 by C. West Churchman in a guest editorial Churchman wrote in the journal \"Management Science\", responding to a previous use of the term by Horst Rittel. Churchman discussed the moral responsibility of operations research \"to inform the manager in what respect our 'solutions' have failed to tame his wicked problems\". Rittel and Melvin M. Webber formally described the concept of wicked problems in a 1973 treatise, contrasting \"wicked\" problems with relatively \"tame\", soluble problems in mathematics, chess, or puzzle solving.\n\nRittel and Webber's 1973 formulation of wicked problems in social policy planning specified ten characteristics:\n\n\nConklin later generalized the concept of problem wickedness to areas other than planning and policy; Conklin's defining characteristics are:\n\n\nClassic examples of wicked problems include economic, environmental, and political issues. A problem whose solution requires a great number of people to change their mindsets and behavior is likely to be a wicked problem. Therefore, many standard examples of wicked problems come from the areas of public planning and policy. These include global climate change, natural hazards, healthcare, the AIDS epidemic, pandemic influenza, international drug trafficking, nuclear weapons, nuclear energy, waste and social injustice.\n\nIn recent years, problems in many areas have been identified as exhibiting elements of wickedness; examples range from aspects of design decision making and knowledge management to business strategy.\n\nRittel and Webber coined the term in the context of problems of social policy, an arena in which a purely scientific-engineering approach cannot be applied because of the lack of a clear problem definition and differing perspectives of stakeholders. In their words, \n\nThus wicked problems are also characterised by the following:\n\n\nAlthough Rittel and Webber framed the concept in terms of social policy and planning, wicked problems occur in any domain involving stakeholders with differing perspectives. Recognising this, Rittel and Kunz developed a technique called Issue-Based Information System (IBIS), which facilitates documentation of the rationale behind a group decision in an objective manner.\n\nA recurring theme in research and industry literature is the connection between wicked problems and design. Design problems are typically wicked because they are often ill defined (no prescribed way forward), involve stakeholders with different perspectives, and have no \"right\" or \"optimal\" solution. Thus wicked problems cannot be solved by the application of standard (or known) methods; they demand creative solutions.\n\nWicked problems cannot be tackled by the traditional approach in which problems are defined, analysed and solved in sequential steps. The main reason for this is that there is no clear problem definition of wicked problems. In a paper published in 2000, Nancy Roberts identified the following strategies to cope with wicked problems:\n\n\nIn his 1972 paper, Rittel hints at a collaborative approach; one which attempts \"to make those people who are being affected into participants of the planning process. They are not merely asked but actively involved in the planning process\". A disadvantage of this approach is that achieving a shared understanding and commitment to solving a wicked problem is a time-consuming process. Research over the last two decades has shown the value of computer-assisted argumentation techniques in improving the effectiveness of cross-stakeholder communication. The technique of dialogue mapping has been used in tackling wicked problems in organizations using a collaborative approach. More recently, in a four-year study of interorganizational collaboration across public, private, and voluntary sectors, steering by government was found to perversely undermine a successful collaboration, producing an organizational crisis which led to the collapse of a national initiative.\n\nIn \"Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems\", Robert Knapp stated that there are ways forward in dealing with wicked problems: \n\nExamining networks designed to tackle wicked problems in health care, such as caring for older people or reducing sexually transmitted infections, Ferlie and colleagues suggest that managed networks may be the \"least bad\" way of \"making wicked problems governable\".\n\nA range of approaches called \"problem structuring methods\" (PSMs) have been developed in operations research since the 1970s to address problems involving complexity, uncertainty and conflict. PSMs are usually used by a group of people in collaboration (rather than by a solitary individual) to create a consensus about, or at least to facilitate negotiations about, what needs to change. Some widely adopted PSMs include soft systems methodology, the strategic choice approach, and strategic options development and analysis (SODA).\n\nRussell L. Ackoff wrote about complex problems as messes: \"Every problem interacts with other problems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems, a system of problems... I choose to call such a system a mess.\"\n\nExtending Ackoff, Robert Horn says that \"a Social Mess is a set of interrelated problems and other messes. Complexity—systems of systems—is among the factors that makes Social Messes so resistant to analysis and, more importantly, to resolution.\"\n\nAccording to Horn, the defining characteristics of a social mess are:\n\nE. F. Schumacher distinguishes between \"divergent and convergent problems\" in his book \"A Guide for the Perplexed\". Convergent problems are those for which attempted solutions gradually converge on one solution or answer. Divergent problems are those for which different answers appear to increasingly contradict each other all the more they are elaborated, requiring a different approach involving faculties of a higher order like love and empathy.\n\nIn 1990 DeGrace and Stahl introduced the concept of wicked problems to software development. In the last decade, other computer scientists have pointed out that software development shares many properties with other design practices (particularly that people-, process-, and technology-problems have to be considered equally), and have incorporated Rittel's concepts into their software design methodologies. The design and integration of complex software-defined services that use the Web (web services) can be construed as an evolution from previous models of software design, and therefore becomes a wicked problem also.\n\nKelly Levin, Benjamin Cashore, Graeme Auld and Steven Bernstein introduced the distinction between \"wicked problems\" and \"super wicked problems\" in a 2007 conference paper, which was followed by a 2012 journal article in \"Policy Sciences\". In their discussion of global climate change, they define super wicked problems as having the following additional characteristics:\n\n\nWhile the items that define a wicked problem relate to the problem itself, the items that define a super wicked problem relate to the agent trying to solve it. Global warming is a super wicked problem, and the need to intervene to tend to our longer term interests has also been taken up by others, including Richard Lazarus.\n\n"}

Widening participation is one of the strategic objectives of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).
