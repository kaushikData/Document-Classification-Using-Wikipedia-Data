The bell, which was founded by Petit und Fritsen, weighs 8 tons and has a support structure of post and beam style with two concrete shafts. A plaque rests on the ground in front of the bell that reads:\n\nThe bell, a Bicentennial gift from the American Legion, is a model of the bell on display at the American Legion Headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana. Authorized by Congress on October 12, 1976, it was cast outside of the US because no foundry had the capacity to cast the bell. \n\nWhen the bell was completed it was shipped to Baltimore and then traveled to all 48 contiguous states aboard the American Freedom Train for the Bicentennial, starting on April 1, 1975 in Wilmington, DE and ending Dec 31, 1976 in Miami, FL. The bell shared train car No. 41 (later renumbered 40) with a map of the American Freedom Train's journey and a lunar rover. From 1977–1978 the bell was placed in National Park Service storage until lengthy discussions led to an agreement and the bell was placed at Union Station in 1981. The American Legion, who hoped for placement at the National Mall, were unhappy with the bell's placement.\n\nThe details of the casting were handled by I. T. Verdin Company of Cincinnati, Ohio. Jack Patrick served as associate architect for the sculpture and Allen J. Wright Associates created the post and beam support for the bell. The iron work was completed by Fred S.

Furthermore, armed violence impedes humanitarian and socio-economic development and, hence, it is an obstruction to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).\n\n\nArmed violence reduction is therefore essential for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.\n\n\n"}

She was a Member of the Althing (MP) for the Southwest Constituency from 2013 to 2017, representing the Pirate Party, having been elected at the 2013 election. She was previously an MP for Reykjavík Constituency South from 2009 to 2013. In November 2017, she has announced to retire from politics \"for now\".\n\nShe published her first book of poetry at the age of 22, and later became a web developer. She was a noted Icelandic activist, and took on a number of roles during the protests following the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\nShe was first elected as an MP representing the Citizens' Movement in the 2009 election. Later in 2009, she left the Citizens' Movement and joined The Movement. She became involved with WikiLeaks during Julian Assange's visit to Iceland in 2010, and also helped to produce the Collateral Murder video. Following her time with WikiLeaks, she created the International Modern Media Institute, of which she became executive director in 2011. She was also involved in two court cases in the United States during her parliamentary term, one of which was the high-profile case \"Hedges vs Obama\". In 2012, close to the end of her term, she co-founded the Icelandic Pirate Party, becoming their first MP.\n\nIn the 2013 election, Birgitta was elected as a Pirate Party MP, alongside two others. She was portrayed in the 2013 film about WikiLeaks, \"The Fifth Estate\", of which she was critical. She also served as Chairman of the Pirate Party from 2014 to 2015, when they became the most popular party in Iceland.\n\nBirgitta was born in Reykjavík on 17 April 1967, the daughter of Icelandic folk singer Bergþóra Árnadóttir (1948–2007). Her father left the family when she was just a baby, and so she was adopted by her mother's new husband, shipowner and fisherman Jón Ólafsson (1940–1987). She completed her primary school education in 1983. Her first love, as a teenager, was Jón Gnarr, who went on to become Mayor of Reykjavík. They \"took drugs together, read anarchist literature and planned to start an Icelandic branch of Greenpeace.\" Her adoptive father, Jón Ólafsson, committed suicide when she was 20 years old by walking into an icy river during a storm.\n\nAt the age of 20, her first book of poetry, \"Frostdinglar\", was published. From a young age, she sought to combine art and poetry, \"by looking holistically at issues artists could bring new perspectives.\" Therefore, she styles herself as a 'poetician'. Her art has been exhibited on three different continents, she has performed at lectures and festivals around the world, and her work has been published in anthologies, newspapers, magazines, and on TV, radio and the internet. In 1995, her focus shifted to the internet, saying that \"I dove into the internet and haven’t been out of there since.\" In 1996, she organised Iceland's first live stream using CU-SeeMe. In 2002, she edited two anthologies, \"The Book of Hope\" and \"The World Healing Book\". She is also a member of the (RSÍ), and the founder of Radical Creations and Beyond Borders Press.\n\nIn an interview with \"Take Part\", Birgitta described how \"after the financial collapse I was one of the very few people that was a known protester.\" She was therefore asked to coordinate various grassroots organisations and organised a large protest in December 2008. She later became a member of the Academia Group, which talked about what kind of government and constitution Iceland required.\nIn the 2009 Iceland parliamentary election, Birgitta was elected as a Member of the Althing for Reykjavík Constituency South, representing the Citizens' Movement. Upon her election, she was appointed as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Environment and Communications Committee, and the Icelandic delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Later, in 2009, she was also appointed as a member of the Parliamentary Review Committee of the SIC Report.\n\nOn 14 August 2009, Þráinn Bertelsson left the Citizens' Movement to sit as an Independent, and, on 18 September 2009, the remaining three MPs for the Citizens' Movement (Birgitta, Margrét Tryggvadóttir and Þór Saari) left the party to form their own parliamentary grouping, the Movement.\n\nIn 2009, a court injunction prevented broadcasters talking about the recent leak of the details of Kaupthing Bank's loansbook. Live on television, Bogi Ágústsson directed viewers to the WikiLeaks website to see for themselves. This created considerable popularity for WikiLeaks in Iceland, and, shortly after the incident, Julian Assange visited Iceland. During his visit, Birgitta met with him and offered her help. It was agreed that Birgitta should be part of a team to help create a stronger set of free speech laws internationally and, particularly, in Iceland. Birgitta was also a producer of WikiLeaks' Collateral Murder video, released in 2010.\n\nThe project for creating stronger free speech laws eventually became known as the International Modern Media Initiative (IMMI), which was proposed in February 2010 with Birgitta being the chief sponsor. It was adopted unanimously by the Althing on 16 June 2010, shortly following the release of the Collateral Murder video. She later split from WikiLeaks, however, saying in September 2010 that \"I have strongly urged him to focus on the legalities that he’s dealing with and let some other people carry the torch\" following the Swedish police wanting to question Assange over allegations of rape. She spoke to the \"National Post\" about WikiLeaks in January 2011, saying: \"There is not enough transparency within the organization about decisions and not good enough communication flow.\"\n\nIn 2010, she was appointed as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee's Working Group on European Affairs and also the EU-Iceland Joint Parliamentary Committee. In October 2011, she attended a meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Bucharest, Romania, where she offered criticisms of Lord Jopling's report on cyber security, writing on her blog that \"Apparently such criticism is not common here at the assembly on reports.\"\n\nIn 2011, part way through the parliamentary term, she was demoted from full member to observer status in both the Foreign Affairs Committee and their Working Group on European Affairs. She stopped being a member of the Environment and Communications Committee, and instead became a member of both the Judicial Affairs and Education Committee and the Special Committee on the Standing Orders of Althing. From 2011 to 2012, she was the rotating chairman of the Movement's overall party. In 2011, she also became Executive Director of the International Modern Media Institute (IMMI), that the earlier initiative had transitioned into.\n\nIn 2012, Birgitta began assisting other The Movement MPs in forming a new political party, Dawn. Dawn was officially formed in March 2012 as a merger between The Movement, the Citizens' Movement and the Liberal Party. However, in July 2012, she changed her attention to forming a Pirate Party in Iceland alongside others, including Smári McCarthy. Speaking to \"The Grapevine\", she said: \"I’m often crossing paths with nerds as I’m such a nerd myself. The Pirate Party doesn’t revolve around me. I’m just one of many who are creating the group.\" The party was officially formed in November 2012, with Birgitta unanimously appointed as the first Chairman.\n\nIn 2011, the US Department of Justice issued a subpoena to Twitter for all of Birgitta's Twitter information dating back to November 2009. In response, Birgitta petitioned a federal appeals court in Virginia to force the Department of Justice to open its files on her to disclose the other internet providers that had also been ordered to submit her private data. In response to the case, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) issued a resolution in support of Birgitta, including an expression of deep concern \"at the efforts made by a State to obtain information about the communications of a member of parliament of another State and the likely consequences of this for members of parliament the world over on their ability to discharge their popular mandate freely.\"\n\nIn 2012, she was a plaintiff in the lawsuit \"Hedges v. Obama\", initiated against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (NDAA). The NDAA allowed the US government to detain indefinitely those \"who are part of or substantially support Al Qaeda, the Taliban or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States.\" Her fellow plaintiffs included Chris Hedges, Noam Chomsky, Daniel Ellsberg, Jennifer Bolen, Alexa O'Brien and Cornel West. Her testament was read by Naomi Wolf in her place in March 2012. In the judgement of the court, Birgitta Jónsdóttir and fellow plaintiff presented separate evidence against the NDAA to the other plaintiffs, as neither were US citizens. During the judgement of the district court, according to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the \"district court found that both Birgitta and Wargalla had an actual fear of detention under Section 1021 and had incurred costs and other present injuries due to this fear.\" The result of the case was that a New York district court issued an injunction on the detention powers, but, in 2013, this was overturned by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nIn the 2013 Icelandic parliamentary election, Birgitta was elected as a Member of the Althing for Southwest Constituency, this time representing the Pirate Party. She continued as both an observer on the Foreign Affairs Committee and as a member of the EU-Iceland joint Parliamentary Committee, but also became a member of the Icelandic delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and of the Constitutional and Supervisory Committee, where she was also appointed as the 2nd Deputy Chairman.\n\nIn October 2013, a film was released about Wikileaks, called \"The Fifth Estate\". In it, Birgitta was portrayed by Dutch actress Carice van Houten. During the production of the film, Birgitta advised the director and the scriptwriters, but later said that the \"script is very inaccurate in many ways.\" During an interview with \"The New Republic\", she described how she asked for several scenes to be changed or removed because of their inaccuracies. In December 2013, she was criticised by Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson for her involvement with the film, and particularly for receiving payment for her consultancy work.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2015, Birgitta served as the rotating chairman of the Pirate Party. Since April 2015, the Pirate Party has topped the polls in Iceland ahead of the 2017 parliamentary election. Speaking to \"Quartz\", Birgitta said that \"I'm very shocked and I don't know how long it will last. I think it's an expression of the lack of faith in the current, traditional parties in power. We are offering them alternative solutions.\" In February 2016, she announced that she would be standing for a third term, as, according to \"Iceland Review\", \"she feels it’s important for the party to have someone on board experienced in working with the ministries and the inner political structure to ensure the effectiveness of the party.\"\n\nIn April 2016, following calls for Prime Minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson's resignation in the wake of the Panama Papers leak, Birgitta said that the Pirates were ready to form part of a new government in the event of a snap election. For about a year before April 2016, the Pirates were Iceland's most popular party, with varying support ranging from 36%-43% support from voters.\n\nIn the Icelandic parliamentary election, 2016 where the Pirate Party won 10 seats with 15% of the vote.\n\nIn the run up to election Birgitta was accused of trying to manipulate the Pirate primary in the NV election district including by trying to slander the top list seat Þórðar Pétursson and asking other candidates to step down and pushing for the NV list to be invalided to get Gunnar Ingiberg Jónsson in the top seat.\n\nBirgitta was married to Charles Egill Hirt (1964-1993), who went missing in June 1993, aged 29. His body was found five years after his disappearance. With Hirt, Birgitta had one son, Neptunus, born in 1991.\n\nBirgitta married Australian Daniel Johnson in 2009. They were married for five years and she had a son with him, Delphin, who was born in Melbourne in 2000.\n\n\n"}

She spent over four decades in prison and Siberian exile for peaceful opposition to Tsarism, acquiring, in her latter years, international stature as a political prisoner. Also popularly known as Babushka, the grandmother of the Russian Revolution.\n\nShe left her home at the age of 26 to join followers of anarchist Mikhail Bakunin in Kiev. As a Narodnik extremist, she was imprisoned 1874 at Katorga and exiled to Siberia in 1878, where she received a harsher sentence because of her refusal to submit to the authority of the Tsarist court. during which she was interviewed by George Kennan, a journalist working for The \"Century \"magazine, along with artist George A. Frost. Kennan was later quoted to say \"All my standards of courage, of fortitude, and of heroic self-sacrifice have been raised for all time, and raised by the hand of a woman\". After her release in 1896, she formed a Socialist-Revolutionary group and helped to organize the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1901.\nShe escaped to Switzerland and the United States in 1900. After returning to the Russian Empire in 1905, she was captured and exiled to Siberia again. After the February Revolution of 1917, political prisoners were released, and Breshkovsky was given a seat in Aleksandr Kerensky's government. When the Bolsheviks organized the October Revolution, Breshkovsky was again forced to flee to the United States and Japan. She then moved to Czechoslovakia in 1924 where she continued to fight the Bolshevik regime until her death.\n\nHer son Nikolay Breshko-Breshkovsky became a writer.\n\n\n"}

She is married to Tony Blair, who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nBooth was born in 23 September 1954 at Fairfield General Hospital, Bury, Lancashire, England, and brought up in Ferndale Road, Waterloo, Merseyside, just north of Liverpool. Although her birth was registered as 'Cherie', owing to her maternal grandmother's influence she was christened 'Theresa Cara' in deference to the requirement that she be given a saint's name. Her father, British actor Tony Booth, left her mother, actress Gale Howard (née Joyce Smith; 14 February 1933 – 5 June 2016), when Cherie was 8 years old. Cherie and her younger sister Lyndsey were then brought up by Gale and their paternal grandmother Vera Booth, a devout Roman Catholic of Irish descent. The sisters attended Catholic schools in Crosby, Merseyside. Cherie Booth attended Seafield Convent Grammar, which is now part of Sacred Heart Catholic College, where she achieved 4 Grade-A GCE A Level passes.\n\nShe read law at the London School of Economics and graduated with First-Class Honours. Later she was enrolled at the College of Law and passed her BVC. She came at the top of her year in the bar exams, while teaching law at the Polytechnic of Central London (University of Westminster). She was the Labour candidate for the Conservative safe seat of North Thanet in Kent in the 1983 general election, losing to Roger Gale.\n\nA member of Lincoln's Inn, she became a barrister in 1976 and Queen's Counsel in 1995. Until 1988, her head of chambers was George Carman. In 1999, she was appointed a Recorder (a permanent part-time judge) in the County Court and Crown Court.\n\nShe was a founding member of Matrix Chambers in London, from which she continues to practice as a barrister but is no longer a partner. Matrix was formed in 2000 specialising in human rights law, though members also practice in a range of areas of UK public and private law, the Law of the European Union and European Convention on Human Rights, and public international law. She is Founder and Chair of law firm Omnia Strategy LLP. She specialises in employment, discrimination, and public law and, in this capacity, has occasionally represented claimants taking cases against the UK Government.\n\nBlair has appeared in a number of leading cases. A notable example before the European Court of Justice was concerned with discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.\n\nIn January 2010, when sentencing a defendant, Shamso Miah, for assault, Booth announced that she would suspend his prison sentence after describing him as a \"religious man\". The court heard that Miah had been to a mosque shortly before he broke a man's jaw following a row in a bank queue. Blair told Miah: \"You are a religious man and you know this is not acceptable behaviour.\" This was interpreted by some observers as special leniency given on account of the criminal's religiosity. The Office for Judicial Complaints released an initial statement saying they had \"received a number of complaints in relation to the comments\" that Blair had made when sentencing Shamso Miah and that the matter was under investigation. On 10 June 2010, the OJC released a statement saying that the investigation had \"found that Recorder Booth's observations did not constitute judicial misconduct\" and accordingly \"no disciplinary action is necessary\". A private letter to the National Secular Society said, however, that the OJC had taken action in the form of \"informal advice\" from a more senior judge.\n\nBlair launched a company called Mee Healthcare with an American business partner Gail Lese in 2011. In June 2015, it ceased trading and all staff were dismissed without notice.\n\nShe was the 3rd Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University from 1999–2006. On 26 July 2006, was awarded the honorary title of Emerita Chancellor, as well as the university honorarily naming its new Cherie Booth Building. She is also Governor of the London School of Economics and the Open University. On 2 March 2011, Cherie Blair was appointed the Chancellor of the Asian University for Women.\n\nIn July 1999, Blair was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of the University (DUniv) from the Open University. Blair is a patron of Breast Cancer Care, a UK breast cancer information and support charity, Jospice, the international hospice organisation based in her home town of Crosby, and disability charity Scope. She is also involved with the British branch of Child in Need India (CINI UK), and is the organisation's patron.\n\nIn 2008, she launched her foundation the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, a development organisation that aims to support women entrepreneurs in developing countries. \"Our mission is to provide women with the skills, technology, networks and access to capital that they need to become successful small and growing business owners, so that they can contribute to their economies and have a stronger voice in their societies,\" says its mission statement.\n\nShe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to women's issues and charity.\n\nIn January 2000 Ms Blair avoided paying her train fare on a Thameslink train from London to Luton and was fined £10 plus the fare due. \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/11/cherieblair.politics refers.\n\nIn 2002, Blair purchased two flats in Bristol with the assistance, it was alleged but later denied, of Peter Foster, a convicted Australian conman and boyfriend of Blair's friend Carole Caplin, who negotiated a discount for Blair. Blair publicly apologised for her embarrassing connection to Foster,\n\nHer relationship with Caplin gave rise to headlines in some newspapers, as Caplin is credited with introducing Blair to various New Age symbols and beliefs. Reports of Blair's New Age practices included an account of her 2001 holiday in Mexico, when she and her husband, wearing only swimming costumes, privately took part in a rebirthing procedure that involved smearing mud and fruit over each other's bodies while sitting in a steam bath.\n\nIn 2002, she apologised after saying within hours of a Jerusalem blast that killed at least 19 people in reference to the Palestinian suicide bombers: \"As long as young people feel they have no hope but to blow themselves up, we're never going to make progress, are we?\"\n\nOn 12 December 2008 Blair gave a lecture alternatively entitled \"The Church and Women's Rights: time for a fresh perspective?\" or \"Religion as a Force in protecting Women's Human Rights\" at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\", in Rome.\n\nIn summer 2015, in the wake of the Hillary Clinton email controversy, Blair was revealed by \"The Guardian\" to have lobbied Clinton in 2009 on behalf of prominent members of the Qatari monarchy; Clinton was US Secretary of State at the time. In a letter to the newspaper, Blair denied this characterisation of her mediation efforts, describing their story as \"sensationalist and inaccurate\".\n\nPrecisely two months later, the release of another batch of Clinton's private emails confirmed that Blair had, indeed, arranged meetings with Clinton for the Qataris outside normal diplomatic channels, with discussions to involve \"the US/Qatar relationship generally\", not merely joint philanthropic efforts. In one case, Blair herself stated that her purpose was to help the eldest of Sheikha Mosah's sons, Jasim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, \"build up an international profile\".\n\nIn summer 2015, Blair's law firm accepted a large fee to advise the Maldives government as it faced a challenge from former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed over his imprisonment for \"terrorism\". Nasheed, who served during 2008–12 as his country's first democratically elected leader, is seeing out a 13-year prison sentence after a widely criticised trial.\n\nIn 1976, while she was studying to become a barrister, she met future Prime Minister and husband Tony Blair. She obtained a pupillage in the chambers of Derry Irvine ahead of him, although he was also taken on. Married on 29 March 1980, the Blairs have three sons and one daughter: Euan (born 1984), Nicholas (born 1985), Kathryn (born 1988), and Leo (born 2000).\n\nLeo was the first child born to the wife of a serving British Prime Minister in over 150 years, since Francis Russell was born to the wife of Lord John Russell on 11 July 1849. Another pregnancy at the age of 47 ended in miscarriage in early August 2002. The Blair children attended Catholic secondary schools. All four children have Irish passports, by virtue of Tony Blair's mother, Hazel Elizabeth Corscadden, a Protestant, the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to Ballyshannon in 1923, where Hazel was born to George and Sarah Margaret (née Lipsett), above her family's grocery shop. Via her father, Blair and her younger sister Lyndsey have six half-sisters, including British journalist Lauren Booth.\n\nHer first grandchild (a girl) was born in October 2016.\n\nBlair has described herself as a socialist and, at times, has appeared to have views further to the left than those of her husband. In March 2008 she chaired the Street Weapons Commission on behalf of the broadcaster Channel 4. She toured the UK and took evidence from people affected by street crime and published a report and practical advice in June 2008.\n\nShe is a practising Roman Catholic. In 2009, Blair urged the Catholic Church to reconsider its hardline stance against contraception, suggesting it could be holding some women back from pursuing a career.\n\nIn George W. Bush's 2010 autobiography \"Decision Points\", Blair is briefly described as a fierce opponent of the death penalty.\n\nBlair wrote a book of her memoirs, published in late May 2008, entitled \"Speaking for Myself: The Autobiography\", and the book was listed as a \"Sunday Times\" best-seller. Interviewed about the book by Carole MacNeil on the Canadian network CBC Television on 1 June 2008, Blair stated that she felt most of the controversy about her in the British media was due to her pioneering role as the first wife of a British Prime Minister who had her own career, with the media simply not knowing how to treat her fairly and objectively.\n\nPlayed by Helen McCrory, Blair features as a character in \"The Queen\" (2006), starring Helen Mirren, about the aftermath of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, and is portrayed as a fierce anti-monarchist. McCrory played her again in the 2010 HBO film \"The Special Relationship\". Cherie Blair also features as a character in Chris Bush and Ian McCluskey's production \"TONY! The Blair Musical\". Phoebe Nicholls played her in \"The Trial of Tony Blair\" (2007). She was also a subject in Shoot The Dog, a song by George Michael that was critical of the Iraq war.\n\n"}

The al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb has claimed responsibility for the attacks, stating that it was \"another successful conquest […] carried out by the Knights of the Faith with their blood in defense of the wounded nation of Islam.\" These attacks constitute another act of violence in the ongoing Islamic insurgency, a continuation of the Algerian Civil War that has claimed 200,000 lives.\n\nTwo car bombs containing 800 kg (1,700 lb) of explosives each were used in the bombings. The first explosion occurred in the Ben Aknoun district, near the Supreme Constitutional Court. This was followed ten minutes later by a second blast on the road that separates the United Nations offices from the offices of the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) in the Hydra neighborhood. The United Nations building partially collapsed in the explosion while the UNHCR offices were \"leveled\" according to a UNHCR official. The United Nations building housed the offices of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the Department of Safety and Security (DSS) and the Population Fund (UNFPA). The collapsed section mainly housed the UNDP.\n\nThe attack against the UN office was a suicide bombing. It is as yet unknown whether the same is true for the Constitutional Court attack.\n\nThe attack caused the third highest staff casualties in the history of the United Nations, after the 2003 Canal Hotel bombing, which targeted the UN headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq and also killed the Secretary-General's Special Representative to Iraq Sérgio Vieira de Mello and 21 other staff members and the 2010 Haiti earthquake in which 22 UN peacekeepers have been confirmed dead as of January 14, 2010; and 150 missing.

Among the dead were 17 United Nations employees at work in their offices, including 14 Algerians and a Dane, a Filipino, and a Senegalese. A Chinese construction worker was also killed. This official death toll, provided by Algerian Interior Minister Yazid Zerhouni, conflicts with numbers reported by hospital and rescue officials, which triple the government's count.\n\nMany people are still unaccounted for. A number of them are possibly still trapped under the rubble, according to UN spokeswoman Maria Okabe.

The alleged irregularities are currently being investigated by the post coup government.\n\nAt least 20 alleged corruption scandals came to light during his first year. By February 2007, his administration had prosecuted four cases, and three had been dismissed while the others were still being investigated.\n\nOne of the early instances of alleged financial irregularities in the administration was a contract to resurface 94 miles of road from Tegucigalpa to Danli. The company was paid the full price of the contract, but it resurfaced only 50 kilometers.\n\nZelaya spent millions of dollars on consulting and professional costs without documentation.\nA joint investigation by auditors in Honduras has so far identified alleged squandering of presidential expenses amounting to 123,025,613.63 lempiras.\n\nHondutel was the best-documented case of embezzlement. Manuel Zelaya's nephew Marcelo Chimirri is one of the suspects. The investigations were helped by evidence retrieved by the FBI. After the scandal was published in Honduran media, Chimirri sued the journalists. Renato Alvarez was sentenced to 2 years and 8 months in prison.\n\nZelaya allegedly earmarked 5.4 million lempiras on mobilizing supporters of the country's accession to the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), an organization founded by Hugo Chávez. The pro-ALBA \"demonstration\" took place on August 25, 2008. The beneficiaries included 38 individuals, union leaders, unions, and owners transport companies.\n\nThe constitution of Honduras requires that the President files the budget by September 15. Zelaya refused. He claimed that it was impossible to come up with numbers. Julio Raudales, Zelaya’s former deputy minister, said the budgetary black hole cost the country some $400 million in funding. Cardinal Rodríguez criticized Zelaya for using public money to promote his plans instead of spending it on the poor. He said \"We were good friends. But he changed drastically... It was Chávez.\"\n\nOn September 30, 2008 Zelaya issued emergency executive decree 46-A-2208, which authorized transfer of 30 million lempiras of public money to advertising of his fourth ballot box. Soon after he issued another emergency executive decree which is identical except that the money is transferred to his office.\nAuditors later found documentation of 29 checks and total 29,995,887.62 lempiras. The expenses weren't well documented.The supposed advertisers paid no sales tax.\nOn May 30, 2009, auditors found that Zelaya had directly spent more than 2 billion lempiras without competitive bidding.\n\nOn June 24, Enrique Flores Lanza, Zelaya's chief of staff, withdrew millions of dollars from the Central Bank of Honduras. The money was taken \"to help the Ministry of the Presidency\" and transported by car to Lanza's office. The suspected theft was captured by surveillance cameras.\n\n"}

Based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the Centre seeks to assist the creation of successful societies and was founded on the premise that tolerance, openness and understanding towards the cultures, social structures, values and faiths of other peoples are now essential to the survival of an interdependent world.\n\nThe Global Centre for Pluralism is an international initiative of Aga Khan IV, 49th hereditary Imam of Ismaili Muslims, and was established jointly with the Government of Canada in 2006. It is located in the former Canadian War Museum building along Ottawa's Sussex Drive and was officially opened on May 16, 2017. The Centre draws inspiration from the Canadian experience and functions as a global repository and a source of knowledge and know-how about fostering pluralistic values, policies, and practices. It aims to work with countries to nurture successful civil societies in which every citizen, irrespective of cultural, religious or ethnic differences, is able to realize his or her full potential.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Global Centre for Pluralism gathered for their inaugural meeting in Ottawa from October 7–8, 2010. Composed of renowned Canadian and international leaders and thinkers, the Board includes the following members:\n\nWhen fully operational, the Global Centre for Pluralism will be located at 330 Sussex Drive in Ottawa, a building that served as the home of the Public Archives of Canada from 1906 to 1967 and the Canadian War Museum from 1967 to 2005. The building was built from 1904 to 1906 and is designated a National Historic Site of Canada and a Classified Federal Heritage Building.\n\nThe building has been vacant for several years and requires significant renovation and rehabilitation. A multi-phased revitalization of the heritage property is currently underway.\n\nThe Global Centre for Pluralism draws on Canada’s successful record in constructing and sustaining pluralist civil society. Working closely with governments, academia and civil society around the world, the Centre is a think-tank for studying and fostering pluralism. It seeks to foster legislation and policy that strengthens developing countries’ capacity for enhancing pluralism in law, justice, the arts, the media, financial services, health and education. In addition, it will deliver programs, facilitate dialogue, develop pedagogical materials and work with partners worldwide to build capacity to promote indigenous approaches to pluralism within countries and communities.\n\nFrom its inception, the Centre is expected to be one of the largest think-tanks in Canada. Its mission is consistent with Canadian international policy objectives, including the promotion of democracy and good governance, a more equitable sharing of the world’s resources between developed and developing countries, and the projection of Canadian values, such as the rule of law, human rights and respect for diversity.\n\nThe Centre honours people, for efforts to build an inclusive society, with the Global Pluralism Awards.

With a population of 9,322 it is the world's least populous independent republic. Nauru's government operates under its constitution, part two of which contains 'protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.' The Human Rights Council (UNHRC) carried out Nauru's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in January 2011. The review was generally favourable with only a few areas of concern.\n\nNauru became a member of the United Nations on 14 September 1999. Of the nine core human rights treaties Nauru has ratified or acceded to four of them- the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Convention Against Torture (CAT),and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) along with the First Optional Protocol were both signed on 12 November 2001 but are yet to be ratified. Nauru stated that the burden of reporting, specifically the financial cost, was a significant factor behind their low rate of participation in international human rights instruments.\n\nDue to Australia's use of the Nauru Detention Centre for housing asylum seekers, and in response to many recommendations from other states and human rights monitoring bodies, in June 2011, Nauru ratified the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees . Nauru also acceded to the OPCAT on 24 January 2013.\n\nDomestic violence is a systemic problem in Nauru and was referred to frequently throughout the UPR report. In response Nauru accepted recommendations to ratify CEDAW and drew attention to several already existing measures. The elimination of domestic violence has been a national priority since 2002 when the government created the Women's Affairs Office. In 2008 the Nauruan Police Force received funding to establish a Domestic Violence Unit and safe-house for victims. International Women's Day is a national holiday. The Nauru \"Crimes Act 2016\", makes domestic violence and revenge pornography a criminal offence since May 2016.\n\nThe May 2016 passage of the \"Crimes Act 2016\" replaced the \"Nauruan Criminal Code 1899\", removed any criminal penalties for sexual activity between consenting adults of the same sex in private.\n\nIn 2009 the Nauruan Parliament passed a bill to amend part II of the Constitution. The amendment proposed extending the protection of the rights of disabled persons, the environment and children as well as recognising the right to receive healthcare, education and maternity leave in the Constitution. The amendment failed to gain the required two-thirds approval in a referendum held on 27 February 2010. The Constitutional Review Committee, a Standing Committee of Parliament, aims to explore alternative formats for a subsequent referendum.\n\nIn May 2016, Nauru has implemented a new \"Crimes Act 2016\", that modernised the criminal justice system of Nauru and bring it in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nNauru has no national human rights institution. However, in November 2009 Nauru invited a delegation to visit the country and advise the government on the potential establishment of a national human rights mechanism. Delegates included representatives from the Asia Pacific Forum and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Several states noted in the UPR that since the delegation Nauru had not taken further steps to establish a human rights institution and recommended that this be addressed. Nauru accepted these recommendations but cited resources and expertise as their 'biggest obstacles' in pursuit of this goal and stated that the funding of other institutions took precedence.\n\n"}
{"id": "3317239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3317239", "title": "Indigenous land rights", "text": "Indigenous land rights\n\nIndigenous land rights are the rights of indigenous peoples to land, either individually or collectively. Land and resource-related rights are of fundamental importance to indigenous peoples for a range of reasons, including: the religious significance of the land, self-determination, identity, and economic factors. Land is a major economic asset. The majority of indigenous peoples living in forest areas depend on the natural resources of their lands to fulfill their subsistence needs. Hunting, fishing, gathering of forest products, and small garden plots still form the basis of their household economy. The security and permanence of their control and use of the natural resource base is actually more important to most indigenous groups than direct ownership of the land itself. The demand for ownership, in fact, derives from the need to ensure their access to these resources, so it is of particular importance to examine how the different national-level legal regimes handle this aspect of indigenous ownership. Land is also an important instrument of inheritance and it is a symbol of social status. The land is essential for people’s spiritual development. The land is sacred and everything they get from the land is a gift from their gods. Losing their land means a loss of contact with the earth and a loss of identity. Land is not only an asset with economic and financial value, but also a very important part of people's lives, worldviews and belief systems.\n\nIndigenous land claims have been addressed, with varying degrees of success on the national and international level, since colonization. Such claims may be based upon the principles of international law, treaties, common law, or domestic constitutions or legislation. Statutory recognition and protection of indigenous and community land rights continues to be a major challenge, with the gap between formally recognized and customarily held and managed land is a significant source of underdevelopment, conflict, and environmental degradation.\n\nIndigenous land rights have historically been undermined by a variety of doctrines such as \"terra nullius\".\n\nThe foundational documents for indigenous land rights in international law include Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (\"ILO 169\"), the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the American Convention on Human Rights.\n\nAboriginal title is the common law doctrine that the land rights of indigenous peoples to customary tenure persist after the assumption of sovereignty. Indigenous peoples may also have certain rights on Crown land in many jurisdictions.\n\nThe leading case for aboriginal title in Canada is \"Delgamuukw v. British Columbia\" (1997).\n\nIndigenous land rights were recognised in the Treaty of Waitangi made between the British Crown and various Māori chiefs. The Treaty itself has often been ignored, but New Zealand courts have usually accepted the existence of native title. Controversies over indigenous land rights have tended to revolve around the means by which Māori lost ownership, rather than whether they had ownership in the first place.\n\nThe foundational decision for aboriginal title in the United States is \"Johnson v. McIntosh\" (1823), authored by Chief Justice John Marshall.\n\nNative Americans in the United States have largely been relegated to Indian reservations managed by tribes under the United States Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\nAs the political systems of some Latin American countries are now becoming more democratic and open to listening and embracing the views of minorities these issues of land rights have clearly come up to the surface of the political life. Despite this new “re-recognition” bit by bit, the indigenous groups are still among the poorest populations of the countries and they often have less access to resources and they have lesser opportunities for progress and development.\nThe legal situation of indigenous land rights in the countries of Latin America is highly varied. There is still a very broad variation of indigenous rights, laws and recognition throughout the whole continent. In the year 1957, the International Labour Organization(ILO), made the ILO Convention 107. This convention created laws and norms for the protection and integration of indigenous peoples in independent countries. All the independent countries of Latin America and the Caribbean of that time ratified this convention. Since the 1960s they started with the recognition of the first indigenous land claims since the colonial era. In the year 1989 the ILO made the Convention 169; the convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, which updates the ILO 107 of 1957. In this convention was also the recognition of the very close and important relationship between land and identity, or cultural identity very important. Today this convention has been ratified by 15 Latin American and Caribbean countries.\n\nThe years after the Mexican Revolution of 1910 saw agrarian reforms (1917–1934), and in \"article 27\" of the Mexican Constitution the encomienda system was abolished, and the right to communal land for traditional communities was affirmed. Thus the ejido-system was created, which in practice should comprise the power of private investments by foreign corporations and absentee landlords, and entitled the indigenous population to a piece of land to work and live on.\nSince the 1980s and 1990s the focus of Mexico's economic policy concentrated more on industrial development and attracting foreign capital. The Salinas government initiated a process of privatization of land (through the PROCEDE-program). In 1992, as a (pre)condition for Mexico for entering the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Canada, art.4 and art.27 of the Constitution were modified, by means of which it became possible to privatize communal ejido-land. This undermined the basic security of indigenous communities to land entitlement, and former \"ejidatorios\" now became formally \"illegal land-squatters\", and their communities informal settlements.

Herer also founded and served as the director of the organization Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP).\nThe Jack Herer Cup is held in Las Vegas each year to honor Jack Herer.\n\nAn early glass pipe entrepreneur, opening his first head shop in 1973, Herer was a pro-cannabis and hemp activist. There was a documentary made about his life called, \"Emperor of Hemp,\" which was aired on PBS stations throughout the U.S. and was translated into French and Spanish.\nAs an activist he taught that the cannabis plant should be decriminalized and argued that it could be used as a renewable source of fuel, medicine, food, fiber and paper/pulp and that it can be grown in virtually any part of the world for medicinal as well as economical purposes. He further asserted that the U.S. government has been deliberately hiding the proof of this from their own citizens.\n\nA former Goldwater Republican, Herer ran for United States President twice, in 1988 (1,949 votes) and 1992 (3,875 votes) as the Grassroots Party candidate.\n\n\nA sativa-dominant sativa/indica hybrid strain of cannabis has been named after Jack Herer in honor of his work. This strain has won several awards, including the 7th \"High Times\" Cannabis Cup. Jack Herer was also inducted into the Counterculture Hall of Fame at the 16th Cannabis Cup in recognition of his first book.\n\nIn July 2000, Herer suffered a minor heart attack and a major stroke, resulting in difficulties speaking and moving the right side of his body. Herer mostly recovered, and claimed in May 2004 that treatment with the \"Amanita muscaria\", a psychoactive mushroom, was the \"secret\".\n\nOn September 12, 2009, Herer suffered another heart attack while backstage at the Hempstalk Festival in Portland, Oregon.\n\nHe was discharged to another facility on October 13, 2009. Paul Stanford of The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation said \"He is waking up and gazing appropriately when someone is talking... but he is not really communicating in any way.\" On April 15, 2010, he died in Eugene, Oregon from complications related to the September 2009 heart attack. He was 70 years old at the time of his death. Herer was buried at the Eden Memorial Park Cemetery in Mission Hills, California.\n\nEuropean experts on hemp, like Dr. Hayo M.G. van der Werf, author of the doctoral thesis \"Crop physiology of fibre hemp\" (1994), and Dr. Ivan Bûcsa criticized Herer for making unrealistic claims regarding the potential of hemp, compare L.H.Dewey(1943).\n\n\n\n"}

Dr. Coleman directed the American Library Association, Office for Literacy and Outreach Services (OLOS) which serves the Association by identifying and promoting library services that support equitable access to the knowledge and information stored in our libraries. OLOS focuses attention on services that are inclusive of traditionally underserved populations, including new and non-readers, people geographically isolated, people with disabilities, rural and urban poor people, and people generally discriminated against based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identification, age, language and social class. In support of this mission OLOS sponsors the Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture each year at the annual American Library Association conference.\n\nThe Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture series is an opportunity for library workers to learn more about their roles in providing equity of access. The Social Responsibilities Round Table Action Council of the American Library Association approved the following testimonial to the work of African American librarian Jean Coleman in outreach during her work from 1973 to 1986 for the ALA Office for Library Outreach Services (now Office for Literacy and Outreach Services: OLOS):\n\nSo important were her contributions to the world of diversity in librarianship, that in 1999 it was noted that the Smithsonian Institution accepted two items for its collection from Coleman's estate, including two Apache toy cradle boards, and a sand painting\n\nFor background on the development of outreach services in U.S. libraries \"The evolution of library outreach 1960-75\" provides historical background in the context of the War on Poverty. Jean Coleman's legacy is the evolving mission of the Office of Literacy and Outreach Services. This also includes the ideals of equity of access. Carla Hayden took equity of access as her theme when she was American Library Association president (2003–04). A book written during Hayden's presidency, \"From outreach to equity innovative models of library policy and practice\" includes an introduction coauthored by Jean E. Coleman's successor, Satia Orange (director, OLOS). The book suggests reframing`outreach based on `equity rather than underserved populations.

{"id": "29987485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29987485", "title": "List of material published by WikiLeaks", "text": "List of material published by WikiLeaks\n\nSince 2006, the document archive website WikiLeaks has published anonymous submissions of documents that are generally unavailable to the general public.\n\nWikiLeaks posted its first document in December 2006, a decision to assassinate government officials, signed by Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys. \"The New Yorker\" has reported that \n\nOn 31 August 2007, \"The Guardian\" featured on its front page a story about corruption by the family of the former Kenyan leader Daniel arap Moi. The newspaper stated that the source of the information was WikiLeaks.\n\nIn February 2008, the wikileaks.org domain name was taken offline after the Swiss Bank Julius Baer sued WikiLeaks and the wikileaks.org domain registrar, Dynadot, in a court in California, United States, and obtained a permanent injunction ordering the shutdown. WikiLeaks had hosted allegations of illegal activities at the bank's Cayman Islands branch. WikiLeaks' U.S. Registrar, Dynadot, complied with the order by removing its DNS entries. However, the website remained accessible via its numeric IP address, and online activists immediately mirrored WikiLeaks at dozens of alternative websites worldwide.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a motion protesting the censorship of WikiLeaks. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press assembled a coalition of media and press that filed an amicus curiae brief on WikiLeaks' behalf. The coalition included major U.S. newspaper publishers and press organisations, such as the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press, the Citizen Media Law Project, the E. W. Scripps Company, the Gannett Company, the Hearst Corporation, the \"Los Angeles Times\", the National Newspaper Publishers Association, the Newspaper Association of America and the Society of Professional Journalists. The coalition requested to be heard as a friend of the court to call attention to relevant points of law that it believed the court had overlooked (on the grounds that WikiLeaks had not appeared in court to defend itself, and that no First Amendment issues had yet been raised before the court). Amongst other things, the coalition argued that:\n\nWikiLeaks provides a forum for dissidents and whistleblowers across the globe to post documents, but the Dynadot injunction imposes a prior restraint that drastically curtails access to Wikileaks from the Internet based on a limited number of postings challenged by Plaintiffs. The Dynadot injunction therefore violates the bedrock principle that an injunction cannot enjoin all communication by a publisher or other speaker.\n\nThe same judge, Jeffrey White, who issued the injunction vacated it on 29 February 2008, citing First Amendment concerns and questions about legal jurisdiction. WikiLeaks was thus able to bring its site online again. The bank dropped the case on 5 March 2008. The judge also denied the bank's request for an order prohibiting the website's publication.\n\nThe executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Lucy Dalglish, commented: \n\nIt's not very often a federal judge does a 180 degree turn in a case and dissolves an order. But we're very pleased the judge recognized the constitutional implications in this prior restraint.\n\nA copy of \"Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta\"–the protocol of the U.S. Army at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp–dated March 2003 was released on the WikiLeaks website on 7 November 2007. The document, named \"gitmo-sop.pdf\", is also mirrored at \"The Guardian.\" Its release revealed some of the restrictions placed over detainees at the camp, including the designation of some prisoners as off-limits to the International Committee of the Red Cross, something that the U.S. military had in the past repeatedly denied.\n\nOn 3 December 2007, WikiLeaks released a copy of the 2004 edition of the manual, together with a detailed analysis of the changes.\n\nOn 24 March 2008, WikiLeaks made 35 uncensored videos of civil unrest in Tibet available for viewing, to get around official Chinese censorship during the worst of the unrest.\n\nOn 24 March 2008, WikiLeaks published what they referred to as \"the collected secret 'bibles' of Scientology\". On 7 April 2008, they reported receiving a letter (dated 27 March) from the Religious Technology Center claiming ownership of the several documents pertaining to OT Levels within the Church of Scientology. These same documents were at the center of a 1994 scandal. The email stated:\n\nThe letter continued on to request the release of the logs of the uploader, which would remove their anonymity. WikiLeaks responded with a statement released on Wikinews stating: \"in response to the attempted suppression, WikiLeaks will release several thousand additional pages of Scientology material next week\", and did so.\n\nIn September 2008, during the 2008 United States presidential election campaigns, the contents of a Yahoo! account belonging to Sarah Palin (the running mate of Republican presidential nominee John McCain) were posted on WikiLeaks after being hacked into by members of Anonymous. It has been alleged by Wired that contents of the mailbox indicate that she used the private Yahoo! account to send work-related messages, in violation of public record laws. The hacking of the account was widely reported in mainstream news outlets. Although WikiLeaks was able to conceal the hacker's identity, the source of the Palin emails was eventually publicly identified as David Kernell, a 20-year-old economics student at the University of Tennessee and the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell from Memphis, whose email address (as listed on various social networking sites) was linked to the hacker's identity on Anonymous. Kernell attempted to conceal his identity by using the anonymous proxy service ctunnel.com, but, because of the illegal nature of the access, ctunnel website administrator Gabriel Ramuglia assisted the FBI in tracking down the source of the hack.\n\nWikiLeaks publicised reports on extrajudicial executions by Kenyan police for one week starting 1 November 2008 on its home page. Two of the human rights investigators involved, Oscar Kamau Kingara and John Paul Oulu, who made major contributions to a Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) report that was redistributed by WikiLeaks, \"The Cry of Blood – Report on Extra-Judicial Killings and Disappearances\", were assassinated several months later, on 5 March 2009. WikiLeaks called for information on the assassination. In 2009, Amnesty International UK gave WikiLeaks and Julian Assange an award for the distribution of the KNCHR's \"The Cry of Blood\" report.\n\nAfter briefly appearing on a blog, the membership list of the far-right British National Party was posted to WikiLeaks on 18 November 2008. The name, address, age and occupation of many of the 13,500 members were given, including several police officers, two solicitors, four ministers of religion, at least one doctor, and a number of primary and secondary school teachers. In Britain, police officers are banned from joining or promoting the BNP, and at least one officer was dismissed for being a member. The BNP was known for going to considerable lengths to conceal the identities of members. On 19 November, BNP leader Nick Griffin stated that he knew the identity of the person who initially leaked the list on 17 November, describing him as a \"hardliner\" senior employee who left the party in 2007. On 20 October 2009, a list of BNP members from April 2009 was leaked. This list contained 11,811 members.\n\nOn 7 February 2009, WikiLeaks released 6,780 Congressional Research Service reports.\n\nIn March 2009, WikiLeaks published a list of contributors to the Norm Coleman senatorial campaign.\n\nIn November 2009, controversial documents, including e-mail correspondence between climate scientists, were released (allegedly after being illegally obtained) from the University of East Anglia's (UEA) Climatic Research Unit (CRU). According to the university, the emails and documents were obtained through a server hacking; one prominent host of the full 120 MB archive was WikiLeaks, although the information was not originally leaked to them.\n\nIn March 2009 documents concerning complex arrangements made by Barclays Bank to avoid tax appeared on Wikileaks. The documents had been ordered to be removed from the website of \"The Guardian\". In an editorial on the issue, \"The Guardian\" pointed out that, due to the mismatch of resources, tax collectors (HMRC) now have to rely on websites such as Wikileaks to obtain such documents.\n\nWikiLeaks has published the lists of forbidden or illegal web addresses for several countries.\n\nOn 19 March 2009, WikiLeaks published what was alleged to be the Australian Communications and Media Authority's blacklist of sites to be banned under Australia's proposed laws on Internet censorship. Reactions to the publication of the list by the Australian media and politicians were varied. Particular note was made by journalistic outlets of the type of websites on the list; while the Internet censorship scheme submitted by the Australian Labor Party in 2008 was proposed with the stated intention of preventing access to child pornography and sites related to terrorism, the list leaked on WikiLeaks contains a number of sites unrelated to sex crimes involving minors. When questioned about the leak, Stephen Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in Australia's Rudd Labor Government, responded by claiming that the list was not the actual list, yet threatening to prosecute anyone involved in distributing it. On 20 March 2009, WikiLeaks published an updated list, dated 18 March 2009; it more closely matches the claimed size of the ACMA blacklist, and contains two pages that have been independently confirmed as blacklisted by ACMA.\n\nWikiLeaks also contains details of Internet censorship in Thailand, including lists of censored sites dating back to May 2006.\n\nWikileaks published a list of web sites blacklisted by Denmark.\n\nSince May 2009, WikiLeaks has made available reports of several meetings of the Bilderberg Group. It includes the group's history and meeting reports from the years 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1980.\n\nOn 28 January 2009, WikiLeaks released 86 telephone intercept recordings of Peruvian politicians and businessmen involved in the \"Petrogate\" oil scandal. The release of the tapes featured on the front pages of five Peruvian newspapers.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, Iranian news agencies reported that the head of Iran's atomic energy organization Gholam Reza Aghazadeh had abruptly resigned for unknown reasons after twelve years in office. Shortly afterwards WikiLeaks released a report disclosing a \"serious nuclear accident\" at the Iranian Natanz nuclear facility in 2009. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) released statistics that say the number of enriched centrifuges operational in Iran mysteriously declined from about 4,700 to about 3,900 beginning around the time the nuclear incident WikiLeaks mentioned would have occurred.\n\nAccording to media reports the accident may have been the direct result of a cyberattack at Iran's nuclear program, carried out with the Stuxnet computer worm.\n\nIn September 2006, commodities giant Trafigura commissioned an internal report about a toxic dumping incident in the Ivory Coast, which (according to the United Nations) affected 108,000 people. The document, called the Minton Report, names various harmful chemicals \"likely to be present\" in the waste and notes that some of them \"may cause harm at some distance\". The report states that potential health effects include \"burns to the skin, eyes and lungs, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of consciousness and death\", and suggests that the high number of reported casualties is \"consistent with there having been a significant release of hydrogen sulphide gas\".\n\nOn 11 September 2009, Trafigura's lawyers, Carter-Ruck, obtained a secret \"super-injunction\" against \"The Guardian\", banning that newspaper from publishing the contents of the document. Trafigura also threatened a number of other media organizations with legal action if they published the report's contents, including the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and \"The Chemical Engineer\" magazine. On 14 September 2009, WikiLeaks posted the report.\n\nOn 12 October, Carter-Ruck warned \"The Guardian\" against mentioning the content of a parliamentary question that was due to be asked about the report. Instead, the paper published an article stating that they were unable to report on an unspecified question and claiming that the situation appeared to \"call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1689 Bill of Rights\". The suppressed details rapidly circulated via the internet and Twitter and, amid uproar, Carter-Ruck agreed the next day to the modification of the injunction before it was challenged in court, permitting \"The Guardian\" to reveal the existence of the question and the injunction. The injunction was lifted on 16 October.\n\nWikiLeaks made available an internal document from Kaupthing Bank from just prior to the collapse of Iceland's banking sector, which led to the 2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis. The document shows that suspiciously large sums of money were loaned to various owners of the bank, and large debts written off. Kaupthing's lawyers have threatened WikiLeaks with legal action, citing banking privacy laws. The leak has caused an uproar in Iceland. Criminal charges relating to the multibillion-euro loans to Exista and other major shareholders are being investigated. The bank is seeking to recover loans taken out by former bank employees before its collapse.\n\nIn October 2009, Joint Services Protocol 440, a 2,400-page restricted document written in 2001 by the British Ministry of Defence was leaked. It contained instructions for the security services on how to avoid leaks of information by hackers, journalists, and foreign spies.\n\nOn 25 November 2009, WikiLeaks released 570,000 intercepts of pager messages sent on the day of the September 11 attacks. Chelsea Manning (see below) commented that those were from an NSA database. Among the released messages are communications between Pentagon officials and New York City Police Department.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, WikiLeaks released a secret 32-page U.S. Department of Defense Counterintelligence Analysis Report from March 2008. The document described some prominent reports leaked on the website. These related to U.S. security interests, and described potential methods of marginalizing the organization. WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange said that some details in the Army report were inaccurate and its recommendations flawed, and also that the concerns of the U.S. Army raised by the report were hypothetical.\nThe report discussed deterring potential whistleblowers via termination of employment and criminal prosecution of any existing or former insiders, leakers or whistleblowers. Reasons for the report include notable leaks such as U.S. equipment expenditure, human rights violations in Guantanamo Bay, and the battle over the Iraqi town of Fallujah.\n\nOn 5 April 2010, WikiLeaks released classified U.S. military footage from a series of attacks on 12 July 2007 in Baghdad by a U.S. helicopter that killed 12–18 people, including two Reuters news staff, Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen, on a website called \"Collateral Murder\". The footage consisted of a 39-minute unedited version and an 18-minute version that had been edited and annotated. According to some media reports, the Reuters news staff were in the company of armed men and the pilots may have thought Chmagh and Noor-Eldeen were carrying weapons (which was actually camera equipment).\nThe military conducted an investigation into the incident and found there were two rocket propelled grenade launchers and one AK-47 among the dead.\n\nIn the week following the release, \"Wikileaks\" was the search term with the most significant growth worldwide in the last seven days as measured by Google Insights.\n\nA 22-year-old US Army intelligence analyst, PFC (formerly SPC) Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning), was arrested after alleged chat logs were turned in to the authorities by former hacker Adrian Lamo, in whom she had confided. Manning reportedly told Lamo she had leaked the Baghdad airstrike video, in addition to a video of the Granai airstrike and around 260,000 diplomatic cables, to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks said \"allegations in Wired that we have been sent 260,000 classified US embassy cables are, as far as we can tell, incorrect.\" WikiLeaks have said that they are unable as yet to confirm whether or not Manning was actually the source of the video, stating \"we never collect personal information on our sources\", but that they have nonetheless \"taken steps to arrange for (Manning's) protection and legal defence.\" On 21 June Julian Assange told \"The Guardian\" that WikiLeaks had hired three US criminal lawyers to defend Manning but that they had not been given access to her.\n\nOn 28 February 2013, Manning confessed in open court to providing vast archives of military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks. She pleaded guilty to 10 criminal counts in connection with the huge amount of material she leaked, which included videos of airstrikes in Iraq and Afghanistan in which civilians were killed, logs of military incident reports, assessment files of detainees held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and a quarter-million cables from American diplomats stationed around the world. She read a statement recounting how she joined the military, became an intelligence analyst in Iraq, decided that certain files should become known to the American public to prompt a wider debate about foreign policy, downloaded them from a secure computer network and then ultimately uploaded them to WikiLeaks.\n\nManning reportedly wrote, \"Everywhere there's a U.S. post, there's a diplomatic scandal that will be revealed.\" According to \"The Washington Post\", she also described the cables as \"explaining how the first world exploits the third, in detail, from an internal perspective.\"\n\nOn 25 July 2010, WikiLeaks released to \"The Guardian\", \"The New York Times\", and \"Der Spiegel\" over 92,000 documents related to the war in Afghanistan between 2004 and the end of 2009. The documents detail individual incidents including friendly fire and civilian casualties. The scale of the leak was described by Julian Assange as comparable to that of the Pentagon Papers in the 1970s. The documents were released to the public on 25 July 2010. On 29 July 2010 WikiLeaks added a 1.4 GB \"insurance file\" to the Afghan War Diary page, whose decryption details would be released if WikiLeaks or Assange were harmed.\n\nAbout 15,000 of the 92,000 documents have not yet been released on WikiLeaks, as the group is currently reviewing the documents to remove some of the sources of the information. Speaking to a group in London in August 2010, Assange said that the group will \"absolutely\" release the remaining documents. He stated that WikiLeaks has requested help from the Pentagon and human-rights groups to help redact the names, but has not received any assistance. He also stated that WikiLeaks is \"not obligated to protect other people's sources...unless it is from unjust retribution.\"\n\nAccording to a report on the Daily Beast website, the Obama administration has asked Britain, Germany and Australia among others to consider bringing criminal charges against Assange for the Afghan war leaks and to help limit Assange's travels across international borders. In the United States, a joint investigation by the Army and the Federal Bureau of Investigation may try to prosecute \"Mr. Assange and others involved on grounds they encouraged the theft of government property\".\n\nThe Australia Defence Association (ADA) stated that WikiLeaks' Julian Assange \"could have committed a serious criminal offence in helping an enemy of the Australian Defence Force (ADF).\" Neil James, the executive director of ADA, states: \"Put bluntly, Wikileaks is not authorised in international or Australian law, nor equipped morally or operationally, to judge whether open publication of such material risks the safety, security, morale and legitimate objectives of Australian and allied troops fighting in a UN-endorsed military operation.\"\n\nWikiLeaks' recent leaking of classified U.S. intelligence has been described by commentator of \"The Wall Street Journal\" as having \"endangered the lives of Afghan informants\" and \"the dozens of Afghan civilians named in the document dump as U.S. military informants. Their lives, as well as those of their entire families, are now at terrible risk of Taliban reprisal.\" When interviewed, Assange stated that WikiLeaks has withheld some 15,000 documents that identify informants to avoid putting their lives at risk. Specifically, Voice of America reported in August 2010 that Assange, responding to such criticisms, stated that the 15,000 still held documents are being reviewed \"line by line,\" and that the names of \"innocent parties who are under reasonable threat\" will be removed. Greg Gutfeld of Fox News described the leaking as \"WikiLeaks' Crusade Against the U.S. Military.\" John Pilger has reported that prior to the release of the Afghan War Diaries in July, WikiLeaks contacted the White House in writing, asking that it identify names that might draw reprisals, but received no response.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders criticized WikiLeaks for what they saw as risking people's lives by identifying Afghans acting as informers. A Taliban spokesman said that the Taliban had formed a nine-member \"commission\" to review the documents \"to find about people who are spying.\" He said the Taliban had a \"wanted\" list of 1,800 Afghans and was comparing that with names WikiLeaks provided, stating \"after the process is completed, our Taliban court will decide about such people.\"\n\nFollowing the Love Parade stampede in Duisburg, Germany on 24 July 2010, the local news blog \"Xtranews\" published internal documents of the city administration regarding Love Parade planning and actions by the authorities. The city government reacted by acquiring a court order on 16 August forcing \"Xtranews\" to remove the documents from its blog. Two days later, however, after the documents had surfaced on other websites as well, the government stated that it would not conduct any further legal actions against the publication of the documents. On 20 August WikiLeaks released a publication titled \"Loveparade 2010 Duisburg planning documents, 2007–2010\", which comprised 43 internal documents regarding the Love Parade 2010.\n\nIn October 2010, it was reported that WikiLeaks was planning to release up to 400,000 documents relating to the Iraq War. Julian Assange initially denied the reports, stating: \"WikiLeaks does not speak about upcoming releases dates, indeed, with very rare exceptions we do not communicate any specific information about upcoming releases, since that simply provides fodder for abusive organizations to get their spin machines ready.\" \"The Guardian\" reported on 21 October 2010 that it had received almost 400,000 Iraq war documents from WikiLeaks. On 22 October 2010, Al Jazeera was the first to release analyses of the leak, dubbed \"The War Logs\". WikiLeaks posted a tweet that \"Al Jazeera have broken our embargo by 30 minutes. We release everyone from their Iraq War Logs embargoes.\" This prompted other news organizations to release their articles based on the source material. The release of the documents coincided with a return of the main wikileaks.org website, which had been offering no content since 30 September 2010.\n\nThe BBC quoted The Pentagon referring to the Iraq War Logs as \"the largest leak of classified documents in its history.\" Media coverage of the leaked documents focused on claims that the U.S. government had ignored reports of torture by the Iraqi authorities during the period after the 2003 war.\n\nOn 22 November 2010 an announcement was made by the WikiLeaks Twitter feed that the next release would be \"7x the size of the Iraq War Logs.\" U.S. authorities and the media speculated that they contained diplomatic cables. Prior to the expected leak, the government of the United Kingdom (UK) sent a DA-Notice to UK newspapers, which requests advance notice from the newspapers regarding the expected publication. According to Index on Censorship, \"there is no obligation on media to comply\". \"Newspaper editors would speak to [the] Defence, Press and Broadcasting Advisory Committee prior to publication.\" The Pakistani newspaper \"Dawn\" stated that the U.S. newspapers \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" were expected to publish parts of the diplomatic cables on Sunday 28 November, including 94 Pakistan-related documents.\n\nOn 26 November, via his lawyer Jennifer Robinson, Assange sent a letter to the US Department of State, asking for information regarding people who could be placed at \"significant risk of harm\" by the diplomatic cables release. Harold Koh, Legal Adviser of the Department of State, refused the proposal, stating, \"We will not engage in a negotiation regarding the further release or dissemination of illegally obtained U.S. Government classified materials.\"\n\nOn 28 November, WikiLeaks announced it was undergoing a massive distributed denial-of-service attack, but vowed to still leak the cables and documents via prominent media outlets including \"El País\", \"Le Monde\", \"Der Spiegel\", \"The Guardian\", and \"The New York Times\". The announcement was shortly thereafter followed by the online publication, by \"The Guardian\", of some of the purported diplomatic cables, including one in which United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apparently orders diplomats to obtain credit card and frequent flier numbers of the French, British, Russian and Chinese delegations to the United Nations Security Council. Other revelations reportedly include that several Arab nations urged the U.S. to launch a first strike on Iran, that the Chinese government was directly involved in computer hacking, and that the U.S. is pressuring Pakistan to turn over nuclear material to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. The cables also include unflattering appraisals of world leaders. Despite the steps taken by United States Government forbidding all unauthorized federal government employees and contractors from accessing classified documents publicly available on WikiLeaks, in the week following the release (28 November – 5 December 2010), \"Wikileaks\" remained the top search term in United States as measured by Google Insights.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton responded to the leaks saying, \"This disclosure is not just an attack on America's foreign policy; it is an attack on the international community, the alliances and partnerships, the conventions and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity.\" Julian Assange is quoted as saying, \"Of course, abusive, Titanic organizations, when exposed, grasp at all sorts of ridiculous straws to try and distract the public from the true nature of the abuse.\" John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote a tweet saying: \"The first serious infowar is now engaged. The field of battle is WikiLeaks. You are the troops.\"\n\nOn 24 April 2011 WikiLeaks began a month-long release of 779 US Department of Defense documents about detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\nOn 1 December 2011 WikiLeaks started to release the \"Spy Files\".\n\nOn 27 February 2012, WikiLeaks began to publish what it called \"The Global Intelligence Files\", more than 5,000,000 e-mails from Stratfor dating from July 2004 to late December 2011. It was said to show how a private intelligence agency operates and how it targets individuals for their corporate and government clients. A few days before, on 22 February, WikiLeaks had released its second insurance file via BitTorrent. The file is named \"wikileaks-insurance-20120222.tar.bz2.aes\" and about 65 GB in size.\n\nOn 5 July 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing the Syria Files, more than two million emails from Syrian political figures, ministries and associated companies, dating from August 2006 to March 2012.\n\nIn April 2013, WikiLeaks releases 1.7 million U.S. diplomatic and intelligence reports including Kissinger cables.\n\nReleased on 19 May 2013.\n\nWednesday 4 September 2013 at 1600 UTC, WikiLeaks released 'Spy Files #3' – 249 documents from 92 global intelligence contractors.\n\nDraft text for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement Intellectual Property charter.\n\nWikiLeaks published a secret draft of the Financial Services Annex of the Trade in Services Agreement in June 2014. On its website, the organization provided an analysis of the leaked document. TISA, an international trade deal aimed at market liberalization, covers 50 countries and 68% of the global services industry. The agreement's negotiations have been criticized for a lack of transparency.\n\nOn 29 July 2014, WikiLeaks released a secret gagging order issued by the Supreme Court of Victoria that forbid the Australian press from coverage of a multimillion-dollar bribery investigation involving the nation's central bank and several international leaders. Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Australian government officials were named in the order, which was suppressed to \"prevent damage to Australia's international relations that may be caused by the publication of material that may damage the reputations of specified individuals who are not the subject of charges in these proceedings.\"\n\nPublic criticism of the suppression order followed the leak. Human Rights Watch General Counsel Dinah PoKempner, said \"Secret law is often unaccountable and inadequately justified. The government has some explaining to do as to why it sought such an extraordinary order, and the court should reconsider the need for it now that its action has come to light.\" At a media conference, Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the gagging order, calling for an open and transparent investigation.\n\nOn 25 March 2015 WikiLeaks released the \"Investment Chapter\" from the secret negotiations of the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) agreement.\n\nWhistle blower, Royal Navy Able Seaman William McNeilly exposed serious security issues relate to the UK's nuclear weapons system.\n\nOn 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 e-mails and over 8,000 attachments from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the governing body of the U.S. Democratic Party. The leak includes emails from seven key DNC staff members, and date from January 2015 to May 2016. The collection of emails allegedly disclose the bias of key DNC staffers against the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton's campaign. WikiLeaks did not reveal their source.\n\nOn 7 October 2016, WikiLeaks started releasing emails from John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The emails provide some insight to the inner workings of Clinton's campaign. One of the emails contained 25 excerpts from Clinton's paid Wall Street speeches. Another leaked document included eighty pages of Clinton's Wall Street speeches. Also among these emails was an email from Donna Brazile to Podesta that suggested that Brazile had received a town hall debate question in advance and was sharing it with Clinton. One of the emails released on 12 October 2016 included Podesta's iCloud account password. His iCloud account was reportedly hacked, and his Twitter account was briefly compromised. Some emails from revealed emails that Barack Obama and Podesta exchanged in 2008.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has declined to authenticate these leaks. Glen Caplin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said, \"By dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing [Vladimir] Putin's dirty work to help elect Donald Trump.\" The New York Times reported that when asked, president Vladimir Putin replied that Russia was being falsely accused. Julian Assange has also denied that Russia is the source.\n\nOn 25 November 2016, WikiLeaks released 200 emails and 300 internal documents allegedly from the United States Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen. These files appear to provide details on the United States military operations in Yemen from 2009 to March 2015.\n\nOn 28 November 2016, WikiLeaks released more than 500,000 diplomatic cables sent by the United States Department of State in 1979 during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.\n\nOn 1 December 2016, WikiLeaks released 2,420 documents which it claims are from the German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal. German security officials at first suspected the documents were obtained from a 2015 cyberattack on the Bundestag, but now suspect it was an internal leak.\n\nOn 16 February 2017, WikiLeaks released a purported report on CIA espionage orders (marked as NOFORN) for the 2012 French presidential election. The order called for details of party funding, internal rivalries and future attitudes toward the United States. The Associated Press noted that \"the orders seemed to represent standard intelligence-gathering.\"\n\nOn 22 June 2018, Wikileaks published documents containing the personal details of many ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) employees with the declared aim of \"understanding ICE programs and increasing accountability, especially in light of the extreme actions taken by ICE lately, such as the separation of children and parents at the US border\".\n\nThis article only covers a small subset of the leaked documents—those that have attracted significant attention in the mainstream press.

{"id": "26643945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26643945", "title": "Macroprudential regulation", "text": "Macroprudential regulation\n\nMacroprudential regulation is the approach to financial regulation that aims to mitigate risk to the financial system as a whole (or \"systemic risk\"). In the aftermath of the late-2000s financial crisis, there is a growing consensus among policymakers and economic researchers about the need to re-orient the regulatory framework towards a macroprudential perspective.\n\nAs documented by Clement (2010), the term \"macroprudential\" was first used in the late 1970s in unpublished documents of the Cooke Committee (the precursor of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision) and the Bank of England. But only in the early 2000s—after two decades of recurrent financial crises in industrial and, most often, emerging market countries—did the macroprudential approach to the regulatory and supervisory framework become increasingly promoted, especially by authorities of the Bank for International Settlements. A wider agreement on its relevance has been reached as a result of the late-2000s financial crisis.\n\nThe main goal of macroprudential regulation is to reduce the risk and the macroeconomic costs of financial instability. It is recognized as a necessary ingredient to fill the gap between macroeconomic policy and the traditional microprudential regulation of financial institutions (Bank of England, 2009).\n\nFollowing Borio (2003), the macro- and microprudential perspectives differ in terms of their \"objectives\" and understanding on the nature of \"risk.\" Traditional microprudential regulation seeks to enhance the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, as opposed to the macroprudential view which focuses on welfare of the financial system as a whole. Further, risk is taken as exogenous under the microprudential perspective, in the sense of assuming that any potential shock triggering a financial crisis has its origin beyond the behavior of the financial system. The macroprudential approach, on the other hand, recognizes that risk factors may configure endogenously, i.e., as a systemic phenomenon. In line with this reasoning, macroprudential policy addresses the interconnectedness of individual financial institutions and markets, as well as their common exposure to economic risk factors. It also focuses on the procyclical behavior of the financial system in the effort to foster its stability. \n\nOn theoretical grounds, it has been argued that a reform of prudential regulation should integrate three different paradigms: the \"agency paradigm\", the \"externalities paradigm\", and the \"mood swings paradigm\". The role of macroprudential regulation is particularly stressed by the last two of them. \n\nThe agency paradigm highlights the importance of principal–agent problems. Principal-agent risk arises from the separation of ownership and control over an institution which may drive behaviors by the agents in control which would not be in the best interest of the principals (owners). The main argument is that in its role of lender of last resort and provider of deposit insurance, the government alters the incentives of banks to undertake risks. This is a manifestation of the principal-agent problem known as moral hazard. More concretely, the coexistence of deposit insurances and insufficiently regulated bank portfolios induces financial institutions to take excessive risks. This paradigm, however, assumes that risk arises from individual malfeasance, and hence it is at odds with the emphasis on the system as a whole which characterizes the macroprudential approach. \n\nIn the externalities paradigm, the key concept is called pecuniary externality. This is defined as an externality that arises when one economic agent's action affects the welfare of another agent through effects on prices. As argued by Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986), when there are distortions in the economy (such as incomplete markets or imperfect information), policy intervention can make everyone better off in a Pareto efficiency sense. Indeed, a number of authors have shown that when agents face borrowing constraints or other sorts of financial frictions, pecuniary externalities arise and different distortions appear, such as overborrowing, excessive risk-taking, and excessive levels of short-term debt. In these environments macroprudential intervention can improve social efficiency. An International Monetary Fund policy study argues that risk externalities between financial institutions and from them to the real economy are market failures that justify macroprudential regulation.\n\nIn the mood swings paradigm, animal spirits (Keynes) critically influence the behavior of financial institutions' managers, causing excess of optimism in good times and sudden risk retrenchment on the way down. As a result, pricing signals in financial markets may be inefficient, increasing the likelihood of systemic trouble. A role for a forward-looking macroprudential supervisor, moderating uncertainty and alert to the risks of financial innovation, is therefore justified.\n\nIn order to measure systemic risk, macroprudential regulation relies on several indicators. As mentioned in Borio (2003), an important distinction is between measuring contributions to risk of individual institutions (\"the cross-sectional dimension\") and measuring the evolution (i.e. procyclicality) of systemic risk through time (\"the time dimension\"). \n\nThe cross-sectional dimension of risk can be monitored by tracking balance sheet information—total assets and their composition, liability (financial accounting) and capital structure—as well as the value of the institutions' trading securities and securities available for sale. Additionally, other sophisticated financial tools and models have been developed to assess the interconectedness across intermediaries (such as CoVaR), and each institution's contribution to systemic risk (identified as \"Marginal Expected Shortfall\" in Acharya et al., 2011). \n\nTo address the time dimension of risk, a wide set of variables are typically used, for instance: ratio of credit to GDP, real asset prices, ratio of non-core to core liabilities of the banking sector, and monetary aggregates. Some early warning indicators have been developed encompassing these and other pieces of financial data (see, e.g., Borio and Drehmann, 2009). Furthermore, macro stress tests are employed to identify vulnerabilities in the wake of a simulated adverse outcome.\n\nA large number of instruments have been proposed; however, there is no agreement about which one should play the primary role in the implementation of macroprudential policy. \n\nMost of these instruments are aimed to prevent the procyclicality of the financial system on the asset and liability sides, such as:\n\n\nThe following tools serve the same purpose, but additional specific functions have been attributed to them, as noted below:\n\n\nTo prevent the accumulation of excessive short-term debt: \n\n\nIn addition, different types of contingent capital instruments (e.g., \"contingent convertibles\" and \"capital insurance\") have been proposed to facilitate bank's recapitalization in a crisis event.). \n\nSeveral aspects of Basel III reflect a macroprudential approach to financial regulation. Indeed, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision acknowledges the systemic significance of financial institutions in the rules text. More concretely, under Basel III banks' capital requirements have been strengthened and new liquidity requirements, a leverage cap and a countercyclical capital buffer have been introduced. Also, the largest and most globally active banks are required to hold more and higher-quality capital, which is consistent with the cross-section approach to systemic risk.\n\nFor the case of Spain, Saurina (2009) argues that dynamic loan loss provisions (introduced in July 2000) are helpful to deal with procyclicality in banking, as banks are able to build up buffers for bad times. \n\nUsing data from the UK, Aiyar et al. (2012) find that unregulated banks in the UK have been able to partially offset changes in credit supply induced by time-varying minimum capital requirements over regulated banks. Hence, they infer a potentially substantial \"leakage\" of macroprudential regulation of bank capital.\n\nFor emerging markets, several central banks have applied macroprudential policies (e.g., use of reserve requirements) at least since the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Most of these central banks' authorities consider that such tools effectively contributed to the resilience of their domestic financial systems in the wake of the late-2000s financial crisis.\n\nThere is available theoretical and empirical evidence on the positive effect of finance on long-term economic growth. Accordingly, concerns have been raised about the impact of macroprudential policies on the dynamism of financial markets and, in turn, on investment and economic growth. Popov and Smets (2012) thus recommend that macroprudential tools be employed more forcefully during costly booms driven by overborrowing, targeting the sources of externalities but preserving the positive contribution of financial markets to growth. \n\nIn analyzing the costs of higher capital requirements implied by a macroprudential approach, Hanson et al. (2011) report that the long-run effects on loan rates for borrowers should be quantitatively small. \n\nSome theoretical studies indicate that macroprudential policies may have a positive contribution to long-run average growth. Jeanne and Korinek (2011), for instance, show that in a model with externalities of crises that occur under financial liberalization, well-designed macroprudential regulation both reduces crisis risk and increases long-run growth as it mitigates the cycles of boom and bust.\n\nThe macroprudential supervisory authority may be given to a single entity, existing (such as central banks) or new, or be a shared responsibility among different institutions (e.g., monetary and fiscal authorities). Illustratively, the management of systemic risk in the United States is centralized in the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), established in 2010. It is chaired by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and its members include the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System and all the principal U.S. regulatory bodies. In Europe, the task has also been assigned since 2010 to a new body, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), whose operations are supported by the European Central Bank. Unlike its U.S. counterpart, the ESRB lacks direct enforcement power.\n\nIn pursuing their goal of preserving price stability, central banks remain attentive to the evolution of real and financial markets. Thus, a complementary relationship between macroprudential and monetary policy has been advocated, even if the macroprudential supervisory authority is not given to the central bank itself. This is well reflected by the organizational structure of institutions such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council and European Systemic Risk Board, where central bankers have a decisive participation. The question of whether monetary policy should directly counter financial imbalances remains more controversial, although it has indeed been proposed as a tentative supplementary tool for addressing asset price bubbles.\n\nOn the international level, there are several potential sources of leakage and arbitrage from macroprudential regulation, such as banks' lending via foreign branches and direct cross-border lending. Also, as emerging economies impose controls on capital flows with prudential purposes, other countries may suffer negative spillover effects. Therefore, global coordination of macroprudential policies is considered as necessary to foster their effectiveness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10492493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10492493", "title": "Maintenance actions", "text": "Maintenance actions\n\nMaintenance actions, historically referred to as socio-emotive actions, are those leadership actions taken by one or more members of a group to enhance the social relationships among group members. They tend to increase the overall effectiveness of the group and create a more positive atmosphere of interaction within the group. \n\nMaintenance actions are contrasted with Task Actions which are those actions taken to enable the group to complete a specific task or goal.\n\nConceptually developed by social psychologist Kurt Lewin in his extensive research into group interaction during the 1940s, maintenance actions were extended into the discipline of leadership studies through the work of Douglas McGregor in his definitive statement of principles of leadership, \"The Human Side of Enterprise\". Countless texts and \"how to\" manuals on group and team leadership since Lewin's work have sought to identify those activities which can then be used in group situations to maintain as well as increase friendship, warmth, and attachment among the participants of a group.\n\nMaintenance actions can be understood as those activities which maintain the functioning of the group just as a driver of a car maintains the car by putting oil in the engine or making sure that the tires have enough pressure.\n\nLewin specifically identified ten types of maintenance actions: encourager of participation; harmonizer and compromiser; tension reliever; communication helper; evaluator of emotional climate; process observer; standard setter; active listener; trust builder; and interpersonal problem solver. \n\nThe most identifiable and popular of the ten types is the tension reliever or the person who relieves the tension within the group by telling jokes and stories, suggesting breaks or fun (as opposed to task) activities. (Later group and leadership writers frequently identify the person taking on this role as the group \"clown\".)\n\nIn contrast, often the hardest to identify is that of the process observer, similar to a participant observer, or the person who watches the interaction within the group as it unfolds and shares their observations with the other group members by continually pointing out ways in which the group behaviors become inconsistent or erratic which could throw the group off track in its attempt to accomplish a goal.\n\nThe type considered by group facilitators to be the most valuable role is that of interpersonal problem solver or the person who has the natural ability to help people solve their problems in a non-professional manner and draws other people in the group to them by their warmth and openness.\n\nThe success of Lewin's work in defining these group activities is attributable to his explanation of them in behavior theory terms within the context of role theory . This was in contrast to both previous and subsequent research which would utilize such picturesque but often unrealistic terms for group behaviors such as the eagle, the bear, or the possum (creating confusion among group participants who may not share the same ideas of animal behavior as the theorist who proposed the terms). Lewin also sought to explain these maintenance actions within the context of immediate experience of the group participant as opposed to roles associated with a person's individual personality. Group psychotherapist Irvin Yalom presents a contrasting view to Lewin in his position that group behaviors are developed in an individual's first group experiences (primarily in their family of origin) and then carried with them from group to group for the rest of their lives.\n\nMaintenance actions can also be seen as occurring on three levels of interaction within the group. On the primary level there are individual actions within the group which can be seen as maintenance actions. On the secondary level there are people whose majority of actions identify them as having a maintenance personality. On the highest level there are groups which take on the role of social interaction and support as their primary goal which are then identified as maintenance groups. Maintenance groups are seen frequently in society as in a support group, collections of people who meet with the intention of bonding and problem solving through shared experiences such as groups of cancer survivors or people coping with the loss of a loved one.\n\nMaintenance actions have moved on to become the core of several social psychology theories of leadership and group interaction such as Fiedler's distributed actions model of group leadership; Bales' Interaction Process Analysis model; and Blanchard and Hershey's leadership effectiveness model.\n\nBlanchard and Hershey have argued that more successful leaders combine both maintenance and task actions to a certain extent depending on the group members' abilities and experiences in order to achieve the most successful style and process of group leadership. Their concept is vividly underscored in Herman Wouk's popular novel, \"The Caine Mutiny\" where Wouk contrasts the effectiveness of a total task action oriented leader in the character of Captain Queeg versus the leader who combines maintenance and task actions in the character of Captain De Vriess. In the novel, the failure of Queeg to accurately identify the necessary combination of maintenance and task actions to suit the particular setting of the fictional Navy ship the U.S.S. \"Caine\" may be seen to lead to his inevitable downfall and the \"mutiny\" of the crew during a particularly life-threatening mission in the midst of a typhoon. This theme was repeated later in a cinematic form more recently in the movie \"Crimson Tide\" which pitted a task action oriented Captain (played by Gene Hackman) against a maintenance action Executive officer (played by Denzel Washington) in a battle for the crews' hearts and minds on a fictitious U.S. naval submarine.\n\nA more popular view among group leaders and facilitators today is that groups rarely see leaders who exclusively choose one extreme of task actions versus the other extreme of maintenance actions, and are more likely to see a leader whose style is to combine the two styles of leadership in varying ways in relation to their own understanding of their ability to lead.\n"}

Due to the fact that the initiative is implemented by the Member States on a purely voluntary basis, their autonomy with regard to military training is not compromised.\n\nThe number of European crisis management operations and multinational military operations launched by European Union Member States in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) have increased, demonstrating a fast-growing need for a stronger interoperability of military forces, not only with regard to the pure technical and procedural aspects but also to the ability for the European military officers to work closely and effectively together.\n\nOne way to foster this ability is to integrate the education and training of the servicemen and their officers. The European military officers’ educational institutes, and the Member States at a more diplomatic level, have had a long experience and tradition of exchanges, to this end.\n\nThe experience of mobility they acquired nevertheless revealed that, due to the particular nature of the education and training they provide, the military institutes could not make full use of all the possibilities offered by the mobility instruments available which were primarily designed for civilian higher education, such as the Erasmus programme. A need was identified, therefore, for addressing together these structural obstacles at the European level.\n\nIn the second half of 2008, the French EU Presidency then in office launched a programme of reflection on ways to allow greater integration of the initial academic and professional training of young European officers through mobility. The initiative for the exchange of young officers, inspired by Erasmus, was launched in November 2008 with the declaration by the European Ministers of Defence, meeting within the Council of the European Union, on the European Security and Defence Policy (2903rd External Relations Council meeting, Brussels 10 and 11 November 2008).\n\nThe implementation of the initiative is driven by the key idea that exchanges of young officers during their initial training form the cornerstones for the emergence, in the longer run, of the increased interoperability and common culture that are needed for European security and defence. An Implementation Group was created in February 2009 as a task-oriented configuration of the European Security and Defence College’s Executive Academic Board.\n\nRelying on contributions and support from the Member States, their institutes and the European Security and Defence College's Secretariat, the Implementation Group very quickly made substantial progress on various aspects of the initiative.\n\nYoung officers in training are the future military elites, who will have to work ever more closely together for the realisation and consolidation of the Common Security and Defence Policy, regardless of their nationality or their armed forces. It is essential, with view to improve interoperability and to pave the way for a European security and defence culture, that European military students and cadets share parts of their education and training as early as the basic level and become familiar with their future role and responsibilities in international security.\n\nThe European initiative for the exchange of young officers, inspired by Erasmus, is meant to lower the barriers which may oppose to free mobility of knowledge, skills and competences of future military officers, their teachers and instructors between the European academies, schools, colleges, universities and training centres. To this end, the initiative supplements the action of the fora that have been created by European military institutes of a same service, such as the Conference of Superintendents of Naval Academies (Navy), the European Air Force Academies (EUAFA – Air Force) and the European Military Academies Commandants’ Seminar (EMACS – Land Forces).\n\nThe Conclusions of the Council of the European Union, which founded the European initiative for the exchange of young officers, inspired by Erasmus, have translated these objectives into concrete measures, such as:\n• Measures aimed at increasing the number of exchanges, such as the generalisation of the Bologna process, mutual recognition of the outcomes of exchanges in professional training, greater use of Erasmus mobility for students and personnel, opening of national educational opportunities to young European officers;\n• Measures aimed at teaching/learning about Europe and its defence, such as the creation of a common module on the Common Security and Defence Policy, promotion of the learning of several foreign languages.\nOn the basis of the standard curriculum developed by the European Security and Defence College, the Implementation Group created a common module on CSDP specifically addressed to these young audiences and aimed at preparing them for the European and international dimensions of their missions and careers. It was run for the first time in the Portuguese academies in 2009, then by the Spanish, Austrian and Greek initial education and training institutes. After only a year of existence, this module enabled more than 400 young officers to become familiar with the role they may be called to play in European defence in the future.\n\nA detailed stocktaking of the European officers’ initial training has been completed, which assists the institutes concerned in identifying partners with whom they organise exchanges.\n\nA forum and a newsletter, edited by the European Security and Defence College Secretariat, have also been set up for the institutes to communicate regarding supply and demand of exchanges. Communication is also achieved using other channels designed to disseminate information on the initiative, to the military students and the public for example, or to interact with the educational fora for addressing mobility challenges that are specific to one or several armed forces, such as Army, Navy, Air Force or Gendarmerie.\n\nDue to the military nature of these educational exchanges, a framework arrangement has been developed and agreed by the EU Member States. It sets the conditions under which exchanges between Member States – wishing to participate – take place. It also lays down the recognition procedures for the outcomes of exchanges in military professional training. It therefore complements the learning agreements the institutions and the trainees usually set for their exchanges and which do not specifically deal with the military specificity of this form of higher education.\n\nThe officers’ work is integrated into their educational process. Therefore, for exchanges of non-academic training modules, the participating institutes agreed within the initiative on best practices aimed at recognising the value of training undertaken abroad as equivalent in principle to national training.\n\nThe Member States and their institutes in the European initiative for the exchange of young officers also seek to provide a common European vision of the qualifications an officer should have after successfully completing his or her educational and training process.\n\nMost of the military officers’ education and training institutes are fully integrated into the European Higher Education Area. Thus, they also investigate the possibility to exchange through the mobility programmes that are shared with their civilian counterparts, such as the Erasmus programme, and many of them have set up exchange programmes with both civilian universities and other military education establishments using these mobility programmes.\n\nMeanwhile, common curricula on issues shared by the European armed forces are being developed on a continuing basis, and national institutes regularly open or adapt existing learning modules to European participation.\n\n\n"}

A \"truce\" (Ancient Greek: ékécheiria, meaning \"laying down of arms\") was announced before and during the Olympic Games to ensure the host city state (Elis) was not attacked and athletes and spectators could travel safely to the Games and peacefully return to their respective countries.\n\nIn 1998, the International Olympic Committee renewed this tradition by calling upon all nations to observe the Truce during the modern Games. The Truce was revived by United Nations Resolution 48/11 of 25 October 1993, as well by the United Nations Millennium Declaration relating to the world peace and security.\n\nIn 1996, the Athens Bid Committee committed to reviving the Olympic Truce and promoting it to the world through the Olympic flame relay. Three years later, the International Olympic Committee announced the establishment of the International Olympic Truce Foundation and the International Olympic Truce Centre in cooperation with Greece. The vision was to protect the interests of athletes and sport, and to promote peaceful principles in modern day. Each host city was encouraged to embrace the meaning and spirit of the Olympic Truce in the planning and staging of the Games.\n\nThrough this global and symbolic concept, the goal of the Olympic Truce movement is to:\n\n\n\nOn 22 April 2011 a Member of the House of Lords - Michael Bates, Baron Bates - began walking over 3000 miles from Olympia to London to highlight the opportunity to bring the Olympic Truce into reality during the 2012 London Summer Games. Walk for Truce, Lord Bates was successful in securing pledges from a number of governments to both sign and implement the Truce, supported on his journey by the British Foreign Office. Lord Bates arrived back in London on February 15, 2012 and continues to lobby for the cause of the Olympic Truce.\n\nThe UK promoted the ideals of the Olympic Truce both domestically, and for the first time internationally. The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) organised truce activities in the UK including: \"Get Set for the Olympic Truce\" which encourages young people across the UK to learn about the history of the Olympic Truce, to debate and discuss what the Olympic Truce means to their lives and to undertake an activity to promote peace within their school or community. Materials were promoted to over 20,000 schools registered with Get Set.\n\nTruce Inspire is a ‘truce’ strand of the Inspire programme through which LOCOG specifically looked for projects inspired by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games which use sport or culture to promote conflict resolution, reconciliation and peace. LOCOG approved a number of projects including: a project led by the University of Ulster which uses sport to support conflict resolution across the education sector; a project providing 200 schools with the opportunity to debate the theme of the Olympic Truce at a Model UN conference; and a project which uses sport to bring together young people from London communities affected by gang rivalry. Cultural Olympiad and the London 2012 Festival organised by LOCOG and the NGO Peace One Day is delivering a truce strand of the Film Nation Shorts project through which 14- to 25-year-olds are invited to create films focused on the truce theme.

We worked closely on delivering an international response to the Olympic truce, working with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic games, the Department for International Development, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Culture Media and Sport\".\n\n\"We wanted to show that the UN resolution could be translated into international action. Our diplomatic missions across our network and the FCO in London arranged over 70 events and activities which showed how important the contribution of youth, women and those with disabilities is in promoting peace through sport, culture, education and wider public engagement. While activities took place in every continent, we specifically wanted to bring the Olympic truce to life in conflict affected and fragile countries\".\n\n\"The UK is the first games host to deliver this level of international ambition for the Olympic truce. The UN Secretary-General, in the presence of the International Olympic Committee, recognised the UK’s Olympic truce work on the eve of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 games. Now others are seeking to build on our experience. We are currently sharing our experience with the UN Secretary-General’s Special Adviser’s Office on sport and development for peace, as well as with Russia, which will next take stewardship of the Olympic truce in 2013, ahead of the Sochi winter games in 2014. This level of international interest, paired with our continued engagement, will help cement our legacy of encouraging future games hosts to promote the ideals of the Olympic truce in their own ways\".\n\nThe official Olympic Truce logo is a graphic with three elements: a dove, flames, and the Olympic rings. The meaning behind the logo is as follows:\n\nThe United Nations is in support of the Olympic Truce and before each Summer and Winter Olympic Games, adopts a resolution called \"Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal\". UN Member States are asked to observe the Olympic Truce, and work towards the settlement of international disagreements by peaceful and diplomatic means. The United Kingdom was the first ever nation to get all 193 UN Member states to sign the Olympic Truce resolution for the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nUN Support is mainly shown through the resolution. It is also shown by the Solemn Appeals for Truce made by the UN Secretary General and the President of the General Assembly shortly before the Olympic and Winter Olympic Games. The lead office within the UN system is The United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace or UNOSDP. The current UN Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace is Wilfried Lemke from Bremen, Germany. UNOSDP is situated at the UN Office at Geneva plus a liaison office at UN HQ in New York.\n\nOn 17 October 2011, the international community pledged to observe the Olympic Truce, individually and collectively. For London 2012, the resolution was officially titled “Sport for Peace and Development: Building a Peaceful and Better World through Sport and the Olympic Ideal” and was introduced by LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe. “The Truce helps to show the world that peace is a possibility,\" he said Monday in New York City. \"It shows the power that sport has to inspire unity, mutual understanding, and respect among different types of people.” Coe exhorted all member states of the UN to respect the ideals of the Truce. “Countries should feel an obligation to respect the Truce because it holds true to the idea that we can coexist without the need for discrimination and fighting,\" he urged. “It gives us something to strive towards outside of the Olympics and the arena of sport.”\n\nThe United Nations website recognizes the truce as \"the cornerstone of the Olympic Games in ancient times\" and the \"longest lasting peace accord in history\".\n\n\n"}

The conference was led by National Nurses United and The People for Bernie Sanders. Other groups involved in organizing the conference included Democratic Socialists of America, Food & Water Watch, Our Revolution (previously the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016), People Demanding Action, People's Action, Progressive Democrats of America, Reclaim Chicago, United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, United Students Against Sweatshops, Million Hoodies, and African-Americans for Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe organizers of the Summit stated that they wanted to harness the energy of the Sanders campaign. Over 3,000 people attended the 2016 People's Summit to hear speakers including Rosario Dawson, Tulsi Gabbard, Gaby Hoffmann, Naomi Klein, Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, and Frances Fox Piven. The most cited speech was by Nina Turner, a Sanders surrogate and member of the Ohio State Senate, with the rousing line: \"We need folks elected to office who actually give a shit about the people they represent!\".\n\nMedia coverage of the 2016 Summit focused on different themes, with Rolling Stone calling the event a \"coming out party for a new kind of politics\" and \"the kindling for democratic socialism with teeth.\" The New York Times focused on the split among attendees between Bernie supporters who would support Hillary Clinton during the general election, and those who would not - known as 'Bernie or Bust'. The correspondent from The Nation remarked on how organized the Summit was compared to similar left-wing political events.\n\nThe second Peoples Summit was held June 9–11, 2017 at McCormick Place. The conference was sponsored by People for Bernie, National Nurses United, Our Revolution, and others. The theme for the 2017 summit was \"Beyond Resistance: A People’s Movement for a Just World\". \nBernie Sanders headlined the conference, along with RoseAnn DeMoro, Naomi Klein, Nina Turner, Michael Moore, Linda Sarsour, Christine Pellegrino, Larry Krasner, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, and others. The conference was attended by over 4,000 people.\n\nSanders delivered the keynote speech calling for an agenda \"that can enhance and expand issue campaigns and hold all elected officials accountable to popular demands for justice, equality, and freedom.\" During his speech, he repeatedly criticized the Democratic Party, calling it an \"absolute failure\" and blaming it for the election of President Trump.\nThe conference appeared to strive to pass the leadership role from Bernie Sanders to a whole new generation of candidates. When Sanders spoke and the crowd began to chant the familiar “Bernie! Bernie!,” he shouted back, “It's not Bernie. “It's you. It's us.”\n\nSeveral speakers stressed that future generations need protection as well. Nina Turner's speech drew boisterous approval from the attendees. She said, \"You've got to walk the walk...you have to care more about the next generation than the next election.” Mike Sylvester, a union organizer for 20 years who ran a successful campaign as a socialist for the Maine House of Representatives in 2016, said that as he went door-to-door campaigning for long hours, he would remind himself that he was running for office for the future of his children.\n\n\n"}

Such designs are now known as \"omoshirogara\" (面白柄) — literally, “interesting” or “novelty” designs. They include traditional Japanese apparel worn by men, women and children, including nagajuban (underkimono); haori (jackets worn over kimono); haura (decorative inner linings of haori); and miyamairi kimono (kimono used for infants when taken to a Shinto shrine to be blessed).The designs that concentrate on reflecting military and political concerns in Japan during Japan's war years (1931-1945) are commonly referred to as propaganda kimono. Omoshirogara garments were typically worn inside the home or at private parties, during which the host would show them off to small groups of family or friends.\n\nAmong the factors that led to the emergence of omoshirogara/propaganda kimonos, three stand out: the introduction of modern textile manufacturing and printing equipment into Japan in the late 19th century allowed textile manufacturers to produce printable apparel fabric more quickly and cheaply; the social and political impetus for Japan to modernize; and, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the political leadership's desire to rally the population in support of Japan's colonial expansion and, eventually, its war against the Allies.\n\nMuch of the imagery used on propaganda kimonos was widely used on other media and consumer goods, such as popular magazines, toys, posters and dolls. Some of the typical omoshirogara designs from the early 1920s to the mid-1930s focused on the outward signs of modernity, depicting a sleek, Westernized, consumerist future – cityscapes with subways and skyscrapers, ocean liners, steaming locomotives, sleek cars and airplanes, while others showed images reflecting currently events (e.g., the visit of the Graf Zeppelin) and social tends, such as of images of the \"modern girl\" with symbols of the new pastimes she supposedly enjoyed, such as cocktails, nightclubs and jazz. But no matter what the subject, the designs employ a bold palette and show direct influences of social realism, Art Deco, Dadaist and Cubist collage, early cartoons, and other graphic media.\n\nBy the later 1920s and especially following the crash in 1929 (and Japan's economically disastrous return to the gold standard), conservative and ultra-nationalist forces in the military and government elites began to push back against the modernist trends and reasserted more traditional values. Military power, the will to use it, and the ability to manufacture its hardware became ever more central to Japan’s self-image. As a result, the propaganda kimono designs took on an increasing militaristic air.\nIt is only in recent years that scholars in Japan, Europe and the United States have begun to seriously study Japanese propaganda kimonos. In 2005, The Bard Graduate Center mounted one of the first major exhibits of these kimono, curated by Jacqueline M. Atkins, an American textile historian and recognized scholar of Japanese 20th century textiles. The exhibition also was shown at the Allentown Art Museum and the Honolulu Academy of Art (2006-2007). The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Johann Jacobs Museum (Zurich), the Edward Thorpe Gallery in New York City, and the St. Louis Art Museum have mounted exhibits that have included propaganda kimonos, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts has received a significant donation of wartime and other omoshirogara kimonos from an American collector.\n\n"}

Other Carrigan Report recommendations were enacted in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, which raised the age of consent and banned artificial contraception. On dance halls, the report stated:\n\n\"In the course of the Inquiry no form of abuse was blamed more persistently for pernicious consequences than the unlicensed dances held all over the country in unsuitable buildings and surroundings, for the profit of persons who are liable to no control or supervision by any authority. The scandals that are the outcome of such a situation are notorious. They have been denounced in pastorals, exposed in the Press, and condemned by clergy, judges and justices, without avail. Before us the Commissioner, speaking for the Civic Guard, said these dance gatherings in many districts were turned into \"orgies of dissipation, which in the present state of legislation the police are powerless to prevent.\" In short, there is no effective legislation to put down this nuisance.\"\n\nThe Public Dance Halls Bill was introduced in 1934 by the then government of Fianna Fáil, and supported by the opposition Fine Gael and Labour parties. It was supported by the Catholic hierarchy. Secular nationalist institutions like the Gaelic League the legislation were seen as beneficial for protecting Irish culture against foreign influence.\n\nLicensing is administered at the district court, subject to the discretion of the local judge. In the early years of its effect, they were less tolerant of more recently introduced musical styles, such as set dancing (seen as \"foreign\") and jazz dance clubs. However, it also disadvantaged many traditional Irish musical activities, such as private house dances and crossroad dances, forcing spontaneous and social music and dance into a controlled and commercialized environment. This set the conditions for the predominance of the céilidh, with its large and loud musical ensembles and wide open dance spaces. The ceilidh arose at the expense of older traditional music, which declined in popularity for decades until the creation of the Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, and later the Folk Revival brought new attention to traditional Irish music.\n\nThe Act remains in force, with amendments. Nightclubs may be subject to stricter conditions in some districts than in others, depending on the particular judge. The Irish Nightclub Industry Association has described the legislation as \"archaic\". In 2001 there was confusion about whether the Act applied to lapdancing clubs.\n\n"}

A police water cannon with purple dye was turned on thousands of Mass Democratic Movement supporters who poured into the city in an attempt to march on South Africa's Parliament. White office blocks adjacent to Greenmarket Square were sprayed purple four stories high as a protester leapt onto the roof of the water cannon vehicle, seized the nozzle and attempted to turn the jet away from the crowds.\n\nOne of the dyed buildings was the Cape Headquarters of the National Party. The historic Town House, a national monument (now known as a provincial heritage site), was sprayed purple and the force of the jet smashed windows in the Central Methodist Church.\n\nTear gas was fired and the crowd that had knelt defiantly in the purple jet fled. Adderley Street was closed to traffic as scores of shops and businesses closed their doors and hundreds of people were arrested, including Dr Allan Boesak, UCT academic Dr Charles Villa-Vicencio, Western Cape Council of Churches official Rev. Pierre van den Heever and lawyer Essa Moosa.\n\nThe police were using a new water cannon with purple dye whose purpose was to stain protestors for later identification and arrest. Protesters were warned to disperse, but instead knelt in the street. When the cannon was turned on them, some protestors remained kneeling while others fled; some had their feet knocked out from under them by the force of the jet. In Adderley Street, shoppers ran for cover, their eyes streaming, and a young couple with a baby in a pram were hurriedly ushered into a shop which then locked its doors.\n\nA lone protestor, Philip Ivey, redirected the water cannon toward the local headquarters of the ruling National Party. The headquarters, along with the historic, white-painted Old Town House, overlooking Greenmarket Square, were doused with purple dye.\n\nA group of about 50 protesters streaming with purple dye, ran from Burg Street, down to the parade. They were followed by another group of clergymen and others who were stopped in Plein Street. Some were then arrested. On the Parade, a large contingent of policemen arrested everyone they could find who had purple dye on them. When they were booed by the crowd, police dispersed them. About 250 people marching under a banner stating \"The People Shall Govern\" dispersed at the intersection of Darling Street and Sir Lowry Road after being stopped by police.\n\nAfter the riot, somebody sprayed graffiti that would make it into the history books. The Cape Times told it this way:\n\nAnother piece of anti-apartheid graffiti, \"The purple shall govern\", appeared on the old Townhouse in Greenmarket Square. The statement is play on words of the Freedom Charter's declaration that \"The people shall govern\".\n\nThe slogan was used as the title of a book, \"The Purple shall govern: a South African A to Z of nonviolent action\".\n\n\"What about the purple people?\" a reader asked the Cape Times' Teleletters. \"Not only has the government messed up with the tricameral system, now their police have created another problem. They, the government, have made 'provision' for the so-called coloureds and Indians -- how are they going to accommodate the 'purple people? Perhaps the next time they use their water cannon, they would like to consult with their voters as to which colour is fashionable.\" \n\n\"Who's going to pay for the city's day of purple spray?\" asked Don Holliday of the Cape Argus. \"As the controversy continues over who is to pay for the clean-up of buildings, streets, cars and clothing sprayed purple by police during Saturday's Mass Democratic Movement's attempted march to parliament, police announced that they would release details of the effects of the dye.\" \n\n\"A spokesperson for the police directorate of public relations said they had approached their forensic science division to prepare a report on the effects of the dye -- including whether it would eventually wash off and possible solutions for washing.\"\n\nA later statement reported that the dye was a \"harmless substance\" which was mixed with water and could be washed off clothing with soap and water. Walls sprayed with the dye could be cleaned using a mixture of one part hydrochloric acid to 100 parts water and then rinsed.\n\nThe Rev. Herbert Brand of the Dutch Reformed Church was inspired by the \"purple drama\" as well as the 50th anniversary of the start of WW2 to deliver a passionate sermon on \"fascism in the city\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1160318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1160318", "title": "Revisionist Western", "text": "Revisionist Western\n\nThe Revisionist Western or Anti-Western is a subgenre of the Western film that traces its roots to the mid-1960s and early-1970s.\n\nSome post-WWII Western films began to question the ideals and style of the traditional Western. These films placed the context of the Native Americans and the Cowboys alike in a darker setting. They depicted a morally questionable world where the heroes and villains often times resembled each other more closely than had ever previously been shown. The concept of right and wrong became blurred in a world where actions could no longer be said to be good or bad. Whereas in a majority of the classical western films the ethics were clear and defined in 'black and white', the Revisionist film looked to paint a moral 'grey' area where people had to adapt in order to survive. This led to depictions of outlaws such as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" where the heroes of the film are outlaw bank robbers.\n\nMost Westerns from the 1960s to the present have revisionist themes. Many were made by emerging major filmmakers who saw the Western as an opportunity to expand their criticism of American society and values into a new genre. The 1952 Supreme Court holding in \"Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson\", and later, the end of the Production Code in 1968 broadened what Westerns could portray and made the revisionist Western a more viable genre. Films in this category include Sam Peckinpah's \"Ride the High Country\" (1962) and \"The Wild Bunch\" (1969), Arthur Penn's \"Little Big Man\" (1970) and Robert Altman's \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\" (1971).\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, independent filmmakers produced revisionist and hallucinogenic films, later retroactively identified as the separate but related subgenre of \"Acid Westerns\", that radically turn the usual trappings of the Western genre inside out to critique both capitalism and the counterculture. Monte Hellman's \"The Shooting\" and \"Ride in the Whirlwind\" (1966), Alejandro Jodorowsky's \"El Topo\" (1970), Robert Downey Sr.'s \"Greaser's Palace\" (1972), Alex Cox's \"Walker\" (1987), and Jim Jarmusch's \"Dead Man\" (1995) fall into this category. Films made during the early 1970s are particularly noted for their hyper-realistic photography and production design. Notable examples using sepia tinting and muddy rustic settings are \"Little Big Man\" (1970), \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\" (1971) and \"The Culpepper Cattle Co.\" (1972).\n\nOther films, such as those directed by Clint Eastwood, were made by professionals familiar with the Western as a criticism and expansion against and beyond the genre. Eastwood's film \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" (1976) made use of strong supporting roles for women and Native Americans. The films \"The Long Riders\" (1980) and \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" (2007) are revisionist films dealing with the James gang. Jeffrey Wright's portrayal of Black Confederate Daniel Holt riding with the Missouri Bushwhackers in \"Ride with the Devil\" tells the stories of the Missouri-Kansas Border War and Lawrence Massacre. \"Unforgiven\" (1992), which Eastwood directed from an original screenplay by David Webb Peoples, dramatically criticized the typical Western use of violence to promote false ideals of manhood and to subjugate women and minorities.\n\nForeign markets, which had imported the Western since their silent film inception, began creating their own Westerns early on. However, a unique brand of Western emerged in Europe in the 1960s as an offshoot of the Revisionist Western.\n\nThe Spaghetti Western became the nickname, originally disparagingly, for this broad subgenre, so named because of their common Italian background, directing, producing and financing (with occasional Spanish involvement). Originally they had in common the Italian language, low budgets, and a recognizable highly fluid, violent, minimalist cinematography that helped eschew (some said \"de-mythologize\") many of the conventions of earlier Westerns. They were often made in Spain, especially Andalusia, the dry ruggedness of which resembled the American Southwest's. Director Sergio Leone played a seminal role in this movement. A subtle theme of the conflict between Anglo and Hispanic cultures plays through all these movies. Leone conceived of the Old West as a dirty place filled with morally ambivalent figures, and this aspect of the spaghetti Western came to be one of its universal attributes, as seen in a wide variety of these films, beginning with one of the first popular spaghetti Westerns, \"Gunfight at Red Sands\" (1964), and visible elsewhere in those starring John Philip Law (\"Death Rides a Horse\") or Franco Nero, and in the \"Trinity\" series.\n\nThe Ostern, or red Western, was the Soviet Bloc's reply to the Western, and arose in the same period as the revisionist Western. While many red Westerns concentrated on aspects of Soviet/Eastern-European history, some others like the Czech \"Lemonade Joe\" (1964) and the East German \"The Sons of the Great Mother Bear\" (1966) tried to demythologise the Western in different ways: \"Lemonade Joe\" by sending up the more ridiculous aspects of marketing, and \"The Sons of the Great Mother Bear\" by showing how American natives were exploited repeatedly, told from the Native American rather than white settler viewpoint.\n\n\"A Man from the Boulevard des Capucines\" (1987) was a sensitive satire on the Western film itself. It was also highly unusual in being one of the few examples in Soviet film of post-modernism.\n\n"}

The social contract usually refers to a \"quid pro quo\" trade-off through Articles 14–18 of the Constitution, pertaining to the granting of citizenship to the non-Bumiputera of Malaya (particularly Malaysian Chinese and Indian), and this was carried over to Article 153 when Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963, which grants the Malays special position in the country. The term has also been used occasionally to refer to other portions of the Constitution. This circumstance does not apply in Sarawak as all racial groups were citizens, bestowed by the legitimate Brooke government, way before the founding of Malaysia. \n\nIn its typical context related to race relations, the social contract has been heavily criticised by many, including politicians from the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, who contend that constant harping on the non-Malays' debt to the Malays for citizenship has alienated them from the country. Such criticisms have met with opposition from the Malay media and the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the largest political party in Barisan Nasional.\n\nOn 22 October 2010, Malaysian exiled popular blogger RPK (Raja Petra Kamarudin) revealed page by page of the 33-page document (a report by Lord Reid in year 1956 to Queen Elizabeth II) which he retrieved from the archiving library in England. RPK claimed that the Malaysian government has since distorted the content of Lord Reid's report into what is called the 'Social Contract of Malaysia'.\n\nThe Constitution does not explicitly refer to a \"social contract\" (in terms of citizenship rights and privileges), and no act of law or document has ever fully set out the social contract's terms. Its defenders often refer to the Constitution as setting out the social contract, and the Malaysian founding fathers having agreed to it, although no reference to a \"social contract\" appears in the Constitution. Instead, the social contract is typically taken to mean a \"quid pro quo\" agreement that provides the non-Malay and other non-indigenous peoples of Malaysia (mostly the Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian) with citizenship, in return for recognising the special position of the Malays and indigenous people of Malaysia, collectively referred to as the Bumiputra (sons of the soil).\n\nA higher education Malaysian studies textbook conforming to the government syllabus states: \"Since the Malay leaders agreed to relax the conditions for citizenship, the leaders of the Chinese and Indian communities accepted the special position of the Malays as indigenous people of Malaya. With the establishment of Malaysia, the special position status was extended to include the indigenous communities of Sabah and Sarawak.\"\n\nAnother description of the social contract declares it to be an agreement that \"Malay entitlement to political and administrative authority should be accepted unchallenged, at least for the time being, in return for non-interference in Chinese control of the economy\".\n\nThe Constitution explicitly grants the Bumiputra reservations of land, quotas in the civil service, public scholarships and public education, quotas for trade licences, and the permission to monopolise certain industries if the government permits. In reality, however, especially after the advent of the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) due to the racial riots of the May 13 Incident which occurred in 1969 when Malays held only 4% of the Malaysian economy, Bumiputra privileges have extended to other areas; quotas are set for Bumiputra equity in publicly traded corporations, and discounts for them on automobiles and real estate ranging from 5% to 15% are mandated.\n\nThe Constitution also included elements of Malay tradition as part of the Malaysian national identity. The Malay rulers were preserved, with the head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, drawn from their ranks. Islam would be the national religion, and the Malay language would be the national language. These provisions, along with the economic privileges accorded by Article 153 of the Constitution, made up one half of the bargain, and have been referred to as the Malay Agenda. The nature of these provisions is disputed; although many Malays refer to them as \"rights\" – a term common in UMNO rhetoric – critics have argued that the Constitution never refers to special rights for the Malays:\n\nSuch critics have used this basis to argue that the social contract was meant \"to protect the Malays from being overwhelmed economically, administratively and politically from the immigrant ethnic groups of the time\", instead of granting particular special rights to the Malays.\n\nSome suggest that this bias towards Malays in education and politics is, in part, a response to the ability of the Malaysian Chinese to secure most of the country's wealth. The Indian Malaysians, as with the Indian Singaporeans, can make a case for being those that lose out the most, although this may be disputed.\n\nThe government did roll back the quota system for entry to public universities in 2003 and introduced a policy of \"meritocracy\". However, this new system was widely criticised by the non-Bumiputras as benefiting the Bumiputras by streaming them into a matriculation programme that featured relatively easy coursework while the non-Bumiputras were forced to sit for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM, or Malaysia Higher School Certificate). Although in theory non-Bumiputras may enter the matriculation stream, and Bumiputras may sit for the STPM, this rarely occurs in reality. Meritocracy was also criticised by some quarters in UMNO as being discriminatory, as it caused the rural and less-prepared Malays to fall behind in university entrance rates.\n\nThe Reid Commission which prepared the framework for the Constitution stated in its report that Article 153, the backbone of the social contract, would be temporary only, and recommended that it be reviewed 15 years after independence. The Commission also said that the article and its provisions would only be necessary to avoid sudden unfair disadvantage to the Malays in competing with other members of Malaysian society, and that the privileges accorded the Malays by the article should be gradually reduced and eventually eliminated. Due to the 13 May Incident, after which a state of emergency was declared, however, 1972, the year that Article 153 was due to be reviewed, passed without incident.\n\nAccording to the social contract's proponents, in return for the enactment of these originally temporary provisions, non-Malay Malaysians are accorded citizenship under Chapter 1 of Part III of the Constitution. Except for the Bumiputra privileges, non-Bumiputras are otherwise generally regarded as equal to their Bumiputra counterparts, and are accorded all the rights of citizenship as under Part II of the Constitution. In recent years, some have sought to provide Malay citizens with more political rights as per the \"ketuanan Melayu\" philosophy. However, most of these \"ketuanan Melayu\" proponents argue that their additional rights are already written as law and thus only seek to \"defend\" them from their opponents.\n\nWhen he assumed the Presidency of UMNO, Tunku Abdul Rahman (later the first Prime Minister of Malaysia) stated that \"...when we (the Malays) fought against the Malayan Union (which upset the position of the Malays' rights) the others took no part in it because they said this is purely a Malay concern, and not theirs. They also indicate that they owe their loyalty to their countries of origin, and for that reason they oppose the Barnes Report to make Malay the national language. If we were to hand over the Malays to these so-called Malayans when their nationality has not been defined there will be a lot of problems ahead of us.\" However, he continued that \"For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, and they will have the same rights and privileges as the Malays.\"\n\nArticle 153, and thus by extension the social contract, has been a source of controversy since the early days of Malaysia. Singaporean politician Lee Kuan Yew of the PAP publicly questioned the need for Article 153 in Parliament, and called for a \"Malaysian Malaysia\" pointing out that if Dato' Syed Ja'afar Albar, an UMNO stalwart who came to Malaya from Indonesia just before the war at the age of more than thirty, could claim to be Malaysian then so should those non-Malays whose families had been born and bred in Malaysia for generations. \"Therefore it is wrong and illogical for a particular racial group to think that they are more justified to be called Malaysians and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour.\"\n\nLee criticised the government's policies by stating that \"[t]hey, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved.\" He also lamented, \"Malaysia – to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, sitting in this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian.\"\n\nLee's statements upset many, especially politicians from the Alliance, Barisan Nasional's predecessor. Then Finance Minister Tan Siew Sin of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) called Lee the \"greatest, disruptive force in the entire history of Malaysia and Malaya.\" Tunku Abdul Rahman, the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, considered Lee to be too extremist in his views, while other UMNO politicians thought Lee was simply taking advantage of the situation to pander to the Malaysian Chinese.\n\nPAP-UMNO relations were chilled further by the PAP running several candidates in elections on the Malay peninsula, with UMNO retaliating by trying to run candidates on its ticket in Singapore. Eventually, the Tunku decided to kick Singapore out of Malaysia. Lee was sincerely saddened by this and shed tears in an emotional interview on national television as Singapore became an independent nation in 1965. The Constitution of Singapore contains an article, Article 152, that names the Malays as \"indigenous people\" of Singapore and therefore requiring special safeguarding of their rights and privileges as such. However, the article specifies no policies for such safeguarding, and no reference to a \"social contract\" has ever been made by the PAP government in Singapore.\n\nIn 2005, the social contract was brought up by Lim Keng Yaik of the Gerakan party in Barisan Nasional. Lim, a Minister in the government, asked for a re-examination of the social contract so that a \"Bangsa Malaysia\" (literally Malay for a Malaysian race or Malaysian nation) could be achieved. Lim was severely criticised by many Malay politicians, including Khairy Jamaluddin who is Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's son-in-law and Deputy Chairman of the UMNO Youth wing, and Ahmad Shabery Cheek, a prominent Malay Member of Parliament from the state of Terengganu. The Malay press (most of which is owned by UMNO) also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract. Lim was adamant, asking in an interview \"How do you expect non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it if you keep harping on this? Flag-waving and singing the Negaraku (the national anthem) are rituals, while true love for the nation lies in the heart.\"\n\nA year earlier, Abdullah had given a speech where he mentioned the most \"significant aspect\" of the social contract as \"the agreement by the indigenous peoples to grant citizenship to the immigrant Chinese and Indians\". However, Abdullah went on to state that \"the character of the nation\" changed to \"one that Chinese and Indian citizens could also call their own\". However, the speech went largely unremarked.\n\nIn the end, Lim stated that the Malay press had blown his comments out of proportion and misquoted him. The issue ended with UMNO Youth chief and Education Minister Hishamuddin Hussein warning people not to \"bring up the issue again as it has been agreed upon, appreciated, understood and endorsed by the Constitution.\"\n\nEarlier that year, Hishamuddin had brandished the \"keris\" (traditional Malay dagger) at the UMNO Annual General Meeting, warning non-Malays not to threaten \"Malay rights\" and to question the social contract. This was applauded by the UMNO delegates, but widely ridiculed in the Malaysian blogosphere.\n\nOther politicians, mostly from opposition parties, have also criticised the NEP and its provisions, but refrained from directly criticising the social contract or Article 153 of the Constitution. Former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) promised he would roll back the NEP if he ever gained power, and many from the Democratic Action Party (DAP) have also spoken out against the NEP. They criticised the NEP as benefiting only a small portion of Malays, mostly well-connected and urban, while ignoring the rural and poor Malays, and noted that the NEP's avowed goal was to give the Malays a 30% share in the country's economic equity, regardless of whether only a few or many Malays held this share. The DAP has been particular in arguing it does not question Article 153 or the social contract, but merely seeks to abolish inequitable policies such as the NEP.\n\nArticle 10 (4) of the Constitution permits the government to ban the questioning of Article 153, and thus the social contract; indeed, the Sedition Act does illegalise such questioning. The Internal Security Act (ISA) also permits the government to detain anybody it desires for practically an indefinite period of time, and many, including politicians from the DAP such as Lim Kit Siang and Karpal Singh have been held under the ISA; it is widely believed this was because of their vehement criticism of Malay privileges.\n\nMore recently, some commentators have remarked on younger Malaysians chafing at the terms of the social contract. One wrote that \"half a century on, younger non-Malays especially feel they were not parties to deals and contracts (at the time of independence) and should not be beholden to them.\" In 2006, several non-Malay parties in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition called for a re-examination of the social contract; Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's refusal to do so reportedly triggered \"much consternation\". Abdullah was quoted in the Malay media as saying: \"If we change this balance and if we are forced to meet all over again on the rights of every group, it will not be the same as now. It would be far from satisfactory. Whatever the new formula, it will not succeed because the old formula is enough, is already maximum. As everyone had agreed to this before, why do we want to disturb this and meet again?\"\n\nThat year, at the UMNO General Assembly, several delegates criticised other members of the government coalition for criticising the social contract and \"ketuanan Melayu\". One stated that \"If they question our rights, then we should question theirs. So far we have not heard the Malays questioning their right to citizenship when they came in droves from other countries.\" Others argued that the Bumiputra communities continued to lag behind the rest of the country economically, and called for stronger measures in line with the social contract. One delegate, Hashim Suboh, made headlines when he asked Hishammuddin, who had brandished the \"kris\" again, \"Datuk Hisham has unsheathed his \"keris\", waved his \"keris\", kissed his \"keris\". We want to ask Datuk Hisham when is he going to use it?\" Hashim said that \"force must be used against those who refused to abide by the social contract\", provoking criticism from the DAP, which accused him of sedition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21428987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21428987", "title": "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom", "text": "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom\n\nThe Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, officially the Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace, was an oppositional state in China from 1851 to 1864, supporting the overthrow of the Qing dynasty by Hong Xiuquan and his followers. The unsuccessful war it waged against the Qing is known as the Taiping Rebellion. Its capital was at Tianjing (present-day Nanjing).\n\nA self-proclaimed convert to Christianity, Hong Xiuquan led an army that controlled a significant part of southern China during the middle of the 19th century, eventually expanding to a size of nearly 30 million people. The rebel kingdom announced social reforms and the replacement of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Chinese folk religion by his form of Christianity, holding that he was the second son of God and the younger brother of Jesus. The Taiping areas were besieged by Qing forces throughout most of the rebellion. The Qing government defeated the rebellion with the eventual aid of French and British forces.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, China under the Qing dynasty suffered a series of natural disasters, economic problems, and defeats at the hands of the Western powers—in particular, the humiliating defeat in 1842 by the British in the First Opium War. The war disrupted shipping patterns and threw many out of work. It was these disaffected who flocked to join the charismatic visionary Hong Xiuquan.\n\nBeginning with Robert Morrison in 1807, Protestant missionaries began working from Macao, Pazhou (known at the time as \"Whampoa\"), and Guangzhou (\"Canton\"). Their household staff and the printers they employed for Morrison's dictionary and translation of the Bible—men like Cai Gao, Liang Afa, and Qu Ya'ang—were their first converts and suffered greatly, being repeatedly arrested, fined, and driven into exile at Malacca. However, they corrected and adapted the missionaries' message to reach the Chinese, printing thousands of tracts of their own devising. Unlike the westerners, they were able to travel through the interior of the country and began to particularly frequent the prefectural and provincial examinations, where local scholars competed for the chance to rise to power in the imperial civil service. One of the native tracts, Liang's nine-part, 500-page tome called \"Good Words to Admonish the Age\", found its way into the hands of Hong Xiuquan in the mid-1830s, although it remains a matter of debate during which exact examination this occurred. Hong initially leafed through it without interest.\n\nAfter several failures during the examinations, however, Hong told friends and family of a dream in which he was greeted by a golden-haired, bearded man who presented him with a sword and a younger man whom he addressed as \"Elder Brother\". Hong worked in his village another six years as a tutor before his brother convinced him that Liang's tract was not like the others and was worth examination. When he read the tract he saw his long-past dream in terms of Christian symbolism: he was the younger brother of Jesus and had met God the Father. He now felt it was his duty to spread Christianity and overthrow the Qing dynasty. He was joined by Yang Xiuqing, a former charcoal and firewood salesman of Guangxi, who claimed to act as a voice of God to direct the people and gain political power.\n\nFeng Yunshan formed the Society of God Worshippers (), in Guangxi after a missionary journey there in 1844 to spread Hong's ideas. In 1847, Hong became the leader of the secret society. The Taiping faith, inspired by missionary Christianity, says one historian, \"developed into a dynamic new Chinese religion... Taiping Christianity\". Hong presented this religion as a revival and a restoration of the ancient classical faith in Shangdi, a faith that had been displaced by Confucianism and dynastic imperial regimes. The sect's power grew in the late 1840s, initially suppressing groups of bandits and pirates, but persecution by Qing authorities spurred the movement into a guerrilla rebellion and then into civil war.\n\nThe Taiping Rebellion began in 1850 in Guangxi. On January 11, 1851 (the 11th day of the 1st lunar month), incidentally Hong Xiuquan's birthday, Hong declared himself \"Heavenly King\" of a new dynasty, the \"Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace\". After minor clashes, the violence escalated into the Jintian Uprising in February 1851, in which a 10,000-strong rebel army routed and defeated a smaller Qing force. Feng Yushan was to be the strategist of the rebellion and the administrator of the kingdom during its early days, until his death in 1852.\n\nIn 1853 the Taiping forces captured Nanjing, making it their capital and renaming it \"Tianjing\" (\"Heavenly Capital\"). Hong converted the office of the Viceroy of Liangjiang into his Palace of Heavenly King. Since Hong Xiuquan had been supposedly instructed in his dream to exterminate all \"demons\", which was what the Taipings considered the Manchus to be, thus they set out to kill and wipe out the entire Manchu population. When Nanjing was occupied, the Taipings went on a rampage killing, burning and hacking 40,000 Manchus to death in the city They first killed all the Manchu men, then forced the Manchu women outside the city and burnt them to death.\n\nAt its height, the Heavenly Kingdom controlled south China, centered on the fertile Yangtze River Valley. Control of the river meant that the Taiping could easily supply their capital. From there, the Taiping rebels sent armies west into the upper reaches of the Yangtze, and north to capture Beijing, the capital of the Qing dynasty. The attempt to take Beijing failed.\n\nIn 1853 Hong withdrew from active control of policies and administration, ruling exclusively by written proclamations often in religious language. Hong disagreed with Yang in certain matters of policy and became increasingly suspicious of Yang's ambitions, his extensive network of spies, and his declarations when \"speaking as God\". Yang and his family were put to death by Hong's followers in 1856, followed by the killing of troops loyal to Yang.\n\nWith their leader largely out of the picture, Taiping delegates tried to widen their popular support with the Chinese middle classes and forge alliances with European powers, but failed on both counts. The Europeans decided to stay neutral. Inside China, the rebellion faced resistance from the traditionalist middle class because of their hostility to Chinese customs and Confucian values. The land-owning upper class, unsettled by the Taiping rebels' peasant mannerisms and their policy of strict separation of the sexes, even for married couples, sided with the Qing forces and their Western allies.\n\nIn 1859 Hong Rengan, a cousin of Hong, joined the Taiping Rebellion in Nanjing, and was given considerable power by Hong. He developed an ambitious plan to expand the kingdom's boundaries. In 1860 the Taiping rebels were successful in taking Hangzhou and Suzhou to the east (See also: Second rout of the Army Group Jiangnan), but failed to take Shanghai, which marked the beginning of the decline of the Kingdom.\n\nAn attempt to take Shanghai in August 1860 was initially successful but finally repulsed by a force of Chinese troops and European officers under the command of Frederick Townsend Ward. This army would later become the \"Ever Victorious Army\", led by \"Chinese\" Gordon, and would be instrumental in the defeat of the Taiping rebels. Imperial forces were reorganized under the command of Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang, and the Qing government's reconquest began in earnest. By early 1864, Qing control in most areas was well established.\n\nHong declared that God would defend Nanjing, but in June 1864, with Qing forces approaching, he died of food poisoning as the result of eating wild vegetables as the city began to run out of food. He was sick for twenty days before the Qing forces could take the city. Only a few days after his death the Qing forces took the city. His body was buried and was later exhumed by Zeng to verify his death, and cremated. Hong's ashes were later blasted out of a cannon in order to ensure that his remains have no resting place as eternal punishment for the uprising.\n\nFour months before the fall of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Hong Xiuquan abdicated in favour of Hong Tianguifu, his eldest son, who was 15 years old then. Hong Tianguifu was unable to do anything to restore the kingdom, so the kingdom was quickly destroyed when Nanjing fell in July 1864 to Qing forces after vicious fighting in the streets. Most of the so-called princes were executed by Qing officials in Jinling Town (), Nanjing.\n\nAlthough the fall of Nanjing in 1864 marked the destruction of the Taiping regime, the fight was not yet over. There were still several thousands of Taiping rebel troops continuing the fight. It took seven years to finally put down all remnants of the Taiping Rebellion. In August 1871 the last Taiping rebel army, led by Shi Dakai's commander, Li Fuzhong (), was completely wiped out by the Qing forces in the border region of Hunan, Guizhou and Guangxi.\n\nThe Heavenly King was the highest position in the Heavenly Kingdom. The sole people to hold this position were Hong Xiuquan and his son Hong Tianguifu:\n\nRanked below the \"King of Heaven\" Hong Xiuquan, the territory was divided among provincial rulers called kings or princes; initially there were fivethe Kings of the Four Cardinal Directions and the Flank King). Of the original rulers, the West King and South King were killed in combat in 1852. The East King was murdered by the North King during a coup in 1856, and the North King himself was subsequently killed. The Kings' names were:\n\nThe later leaders of the movement were 'Princes':\n\nOther princes include:\n\nIn the later years of the Taiping Rebellion, the territory was divided among many, for a time into the dozens, of provincial rulers called princes, depending on the whims of Hong.\n\nCaptured areas in Jiangsu were called “Sufu Province”.\n\nWithin the land that it controlled, the Taiping Heavenly Army established a totalitarian, theocratic, and highly militarized rule.\n\nIn 1859 the Gan Prince Hong Rengan, with the approval of his cousin the Heavenly King, advocated several new policies, including:\n\n\n\"Taiping Tianguo\" soldiers seem to have been partially equipped with surplus equipment sold by various Western companies and military units' stores, both small arms and artillery. One shipment of weaponry from an American dealer in April 1862 was listed as 2,783 (percussion cap) muskets, 66 carbines, 4 rifles, and 895 field artillery guns.\n\nInitially, the followers of Hong Xiuquan were called God Worshippers. Hong's faith was inspired by visions he reported in which the Christian Lord greeted him in Heaven. Hong had earlier been in contact with Protestant missionaries and read the Bible. Officially, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom endorsed Hong Xiuquan's own version of Christianity combined with elements of Chinese folk religion, the \"restored faith\" in Shingdu and some other native beliefs. Although Hong's followers led the Kingdom, there were also adherents of Buddhism, Chinese folk religion and other religious traditions native to China.\n\nThe movement's founder, Hong Xiuquan, had failed the imperial examinations numerous times. After one such failure in 1836, Hong overheard a Protestant missionary, most probably Edwin Stevens, preaching and took home some Chinese translations of Bible tracts, including a pamphlet entitled \"Good Words for Exhorting the Age\" by Liang Fa. Hong and his cousin were both baptized in accordance with Liang's directions. In 1843, after Hong's final failure at the exams, he had what some regard as a nervous breakdown and others as a mystical revelation, connecting his in-depth readings of the Christian tracts to strange dreams he had been having for the past six years. In his dreams, a bearded man with golden hair and a black robe called himself Jehovah, gave him a sword, and taught him to slay demons beside a younger man whom Hong addressed as \"Elder Brother\".\n\nHong Xiuquan came to believe that the figures in his dreams were God the Father and Jesus Christ the Son, and that they were revealing his destiny as a slayer of demons and the leader of a new Heavenly Kingdom on Earth. The demons were later interpreted by him to be the Qing and false religions.\n\nHong developed a literalist understanding of the Bible, producing a set of his own annotations. He rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, saying \"God is the Father and embodies myriads of phenomena; Christ is the Son, who was manifest in the body... The Wind of the Holy Spirit, God, is also a Son... God is one who gives shapes to things, molds things into forms, who created heaven and created earth, who begins and ends all things, yet has no beginning or end himself...\" and \"God and the Savior are one.\"\n\nIn its first year, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom minted coins that were 23 mm to 26 mm in diameter, weighing around 4.1 g. The kingdom's name was inscribed on the obverse and \"Holy Treasure\" () on the reverse; the kingdom also issued paper notes.\n\nWith the collapse of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Qing Dynasty launched waves of massacres against the Hakkas, killing up to 30,000 each day during the height of the massacres. Another major impact was the bloody Punti-Hakka Clan Wars (1855 and 1867), which would cause the deaths of a million people.\n\n\n\nFor a fuller selection, please see the section Taiping Rebellion: Further reading\n\n"}
{"id": "17766704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17766704", "title": "Three Oaths", "text": "Three Oaths\n\nThe Three Oaths is the popular name for a \"Midrash\" found in the Talmud, which relates that God adjured three oaths upon the world. Two of the oaths pertain to the Jewish people, and one of the oaths pertains to the other nations of the world. The Jews for their part were sworn not to forcefully reclaim the Land of Israel and not to rebel against the other nations, and the other nations in their turn were sworn not to subjugate the Jews excessively.\n\nAmong Orthodox Jews today there are primarily two ways of viewing this \"Midrash\". A faction of the Haredim who are strongly anti-Zionist often view this \"Midrash\" as not being fulfilled, whereas the majority of the Haredim as well as Religious Zionists view it as being fulfilled and maintained, and now obsolete. Both buttress their positions by citing historic rabbinic sources in favor of their view.\n\nThe context of the Talmudic dialogue containing the Three Oaths is a discussion in which attempts are made to defend Rav Zeira's desire to leave Babylon and go to the Land of Israel. It begins on Ketubot 110b and continues on 111a (where the Three Oaths are plainly conveyed). The Gemara quotes R. Yossi ben R. Chanina:\n\nWhy/What are these Three Oaths? One, that Israel should not storm the wall {RaShI interprets: forcefully}. Two, the Holy One adjured Israel not to rebel against the nations of the world. Three, the Holy One adjured the nations that they would not oppress Israel too much.\nThe Midrash is in large part an exegetical analysis of three separate verses in the Song of Songs, and naturally reflects the traditional interpretation, which sees the entire book as an allegory for the relationship between God and the Jewish people. The three verses are:\n\nThere are several other Midrashim that pertain to the Three Oaths and they are primarily recorded in Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah which is also known as Midrash Hazita:\n\nAnother word: \"Before the day\" שֶׁיָּפוּחַ (\"sheyafuaḥ\"), \"breathes\"—before that day the peoples יָפוּחַ (\"yafuaḥ\"), expire. \"And the shadows flee\"—governments that dominate them. \"I will hurry to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense\" (Song of Songs 4:6). Said the blessed Holy One 'I will betake myself to shake the peoples from Jerusalem, the הַר הַמּוֹר (\"har ha-mor\"), \"the mountain of myrrh\",' as is written, \"Jerusalem on\" הַר הַמּוֹרִיָּה (\"har ha-moriyah\"), \"mount Moriah\" (2 Chronicles 3:1). \"And to the hill of frankincense\"—the Temple that is in Zion, as it is written, \"Lovely in heights, all the earth's joy, Mount Zion\" (Psalms 48:3). And it is written, \"To seize the earth's corners, that the wicked be shaken from it\" (Job 38:13)—as one holds a garment to shake all the filth from it.\n\nRabbi Yose said, the blessed Holy One will eventually be revealed in earthly Jerusalem, and purify it from the filth of the peoples, before the day of the peoples is complete. For Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Dominion over Israel lasts only one day, and that is a day of the blessed Holy One which is one thousand years [cf. BT \"Sanhedrin\" 97a; \"Bahir\" §5: Each day of the blessed Holy One is a thousand years, as it is written, \"For a thousand years in Your eyes are like yesterday gone\" (Psalms 90:4)]. This is what is written, \"He has made me desolate, faint all the day\" (Lamentations 1:13)—one day, and no more.\n\nRabbi Yose said, If they are subjugated more than one thousand years, it is not because of the King's decree, but rather because they do not wish to return before Him [in repentance to the Land of Israel]. And it is written, \"And it shall be, when all these things come upon you\", [\"the blessing and the curse that I have set before you, that your heart shall turn back among all the nations to which YHWH your God will make you to stray\"] (Deuteronomy 30:1-2), and, \"Should your strayed one be at the edge of the heavens, from there shall YHWH your God gather you.\" (ibid. 4)\n\nRambam cited the Three Oaths in his famous Epistle to the Jews of Yemen (Iggeret Teiman). It was written around 1172 in reply to an inquiry concerning the crisis the Yemenite Jews were then going through. A decree of forced conversion to Islam which had thrown the Jews into panic. Coupled with this crisis was the rise of a Messianic movement started by a native of Yemen who claimed he was the Messiah which served to further increase the confusion within the Jewish community. In the course of Maimonides attempt to strengthen the morale of the Yemenite Jews. In the Epistle he states:\n\nSolomon, of blessed memory, foresaw with Divine inspiration, that the prolonged duration of the exile would incite some of our people to seek to terminate it before the proper time, and as a consequence they would perish or meet with disaster. Therefore he warned them (to desist) from it and adjured them in metaphorical language, as we read, \"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please.\" (Song of Songs 2:7, 8:4). Now, brethren and friends, abide by the oath, and stir not up love until it please (Ketubot 111a).\n\nThe Mid Thirteenth Century commentator Rabbeinu Bachya, was one of the first to formulate a comprehensive Torah commentary based on the four principles denoted by the word \"PaRDeS\". In his commentary on he wrote:\n... and it is written \"And Hezekiah prayed before God\" (). So too we are required to follow in the way of the Patriarchs and to restore ourselves so that we may be graciously accepted and with our fine language and prayer before God, may He be exalted. However, to wage war is not possible (Song of Songs 2), \"you have been adjured daughters of Jerusalem, etc.\" You have been adjured not to engage in war with the nations.\n\nRamban did not explicitly discuss the Three Oaths, however he did maintain that it is incumbent upon Jews in every generation as a positive commandment to attempt to conquer the Land of Israel. In his glosses (Hashmatot) to Rambam's Sefer HaMitzvot on Positive Commandment #4 he wrote:\n\nThat we are commanded to take possession of the Land which the Almighty, Blessed Be He, gave to our forefathers, to Avraham, to Yitzchak, and to Yaakov; and not to abandon it to other nations, or to leave it desolate, as He said to them, You shall dispossess the inhabitants of the Land and dwell in it, for I have given the Land to you to possess it, (Numbers, 33:53) and he said, further, To Inherit the Land which I swore to your forefathers, (to give them,) behold, we are commanded with the conquest of the land in every generation.\n\nNachmanides' position here is untenable if he maintains that the Three Oaths are Halachically binding. Accordingly, it would appear that Nachmanides implicitly rejects the Three Oaths as Halachically binding, and that to treat it as such would be to effectively nullify a biblical commandment.\n\nThe anti-Zionist response to this is that Nachmanides' words \"we are commanded with the conquest of the land in every generation\" mean every generation until the era of exile. One of the established rules for counting the 613 commandments in the Torah is that we do not count one-time-only commandments, such as God's command to count the Jews in Numbers 1:2. Nachmanides' intent here is to prove that conquering the land was not a one-time-only commandment that applied to Joshua's battles; rather it applied to King David and, by extension, in every generation. This justifies counting it among the 613, even if it does not apply during exile, just as numerous commandments associated with the Temple are counted despite the fact that they cannot be kept during exile. Nachmanides does say explicitly later in the piece that the commandment to live in the Land applies even during exile, but this means strictly living there as an individual - not conquering, since that would conflict with the Three Oaths.\n\nIt has also been proposed that Nachmanides' intent was that even the commandment that a Jew should live in the land as an individual during exile applies only when living in the land is consistent with exile, that is, when a non-Jewish government rules the land. But living under a Jewish government such as the State of Israel might itself constitute a violation of the oath. Nachmanides felt no need to mention this exception to the commandment because he did not foresee the rise of a Jewish government in the Holy Land before the messiah.\n\nOf note is that Rashbash who was himself a descendant of Nachmanides, understood this particular biblical obligation to be binding on the individual level but not on the collective:\n\nIn truth, this commandment is not a commandment which includes the entirety of Israel in the Exile which now exists, but it is a general principle as our Sages stated in the Talmud in Ketubot, that it stems from the Oaths which The Holy One, Blessed be He, made Israel swear not to rush the End, and not to ascend like a wall.\n\nNevertheless, Nachamnides himself explicitly states in his \"Hassagot\" (Positive Commandment #4):\n[The sages] made many other such emphatic statements regarding this positive commandment that we are commanded to possess the Land and settle it. It is therefore an eternal positive command, obligating every single individual even during the time of Exile as is known from the Talmud in many places. \n\nRabbi Chaim Zimmerman in his book, \"Torah and Existence\" explains his solution to the contradiction between Nachmanides's position and the Three Oaths. First, he makes a distinction between \"settling\" the land and \"conquering\" the land. The commandment is realized by \"settling\" the land, and \"conquering\" is merely a preparation for the core obligation of settlement. The obligation to settle the land does not necessarily violate the Three Oaths. Rabbi Zimmerman adds that the Three Oaths only apply to invading the land by force. He writes:\n... the difficulty in the Ramban which says that the mitzva of kibush prevails in our time against the oath, dissolves. The oath, \"shelo yaalu bechoma\" means explicitly that we cannot storm eretz-Yisrael from chutz-laaretz. But when the Jews are in eretz-Yisrael, there is surely a hechsher mitzva of kibbush-haaretz. How can the Jews be in eretz-Yisrael without the aliyah \"bechoma\"? The answer is very simple. If many Jews came to eretz-Yisrael individually, or by permission of the nations, then once they are there, there is a command of kibbush... There was never an oath upon the people who were in eretz-Yisrael.\n\nMaharal discussed the Three Oaths in two locations, in his work Netzach Yisrael and in his commentary to Tractate Ketubot. In his work Netzach Yisrael he wrote:\nכי פירוש 'בדורו של שמד' היינו במדה שהיה לדורו של שמד, שהיו דביקים בה דורו של שמד, ובאותה מדה השביע אותם שלא ישנו בענין הגלות. כי דורו של שמד, אף על גב שהגיע להם המיתה בגלות, לא היו משנים. ועוד פירוש 'בדורו של שמד', רוצה לומר אף אם יהיו רוצים להמית אותם בעינוי קשה, לא יהיו יוצאים ולא יהיו משנים בזה. וכן הפירוש אצל כל אחד ואחד, ויש להבין זה\nAnother explanation of the Midrash's statement (he is speaking of Shir Ha-Shirim Rabba 2:20 that begins \"ורבנן אמרי השביען בדורו של שמד\") that God adjured the Jewish people in a generation of Shmad (religious persecution Jews, or decrees against Jews): that even if they will threaten to kill them with difficult torture, they will not leave [the Exile] nor will they change their behavior in this manner\n\nThe 16th Century Kabbalist, Rabbi Chaim Vital expressed the view that the Three Oaths were only binding for the first thousand years of Exile. He wrote:\n\n'I made you swear, daughters of Jerusalem...' this great oath to God was that they should not arouse the Redemption until that love will be desired and with good will, as it is written 'until I desire,' and our Sages already said that the time of this oath is a thousand years, as it is written in the Baraita of Rabbi Yishmael in Pirkei Heichalot (in a comment on Daniel 7:25)..., and similarly in the Zohar II:17a...that it is one day of the Exile of the Community of Israel...\n\nReligious Zionists suggest that in Maimonides' Epistle to Yemen, he explicitly interprets the oaths metaphorically, and not literally. As it states there \"Therefore he admonished and adjured them in metaphorical language (דרך המשל, lit. by way of metaphor) to desist.\" Therefore, they maintain, that Maimonides did not consider them to be Halachically binding.\n\nA member of the Haredi community, Rabbi Chaim Walkin points out in his book, Da'at Chaim, that Maimonides discussed the Three Oaths only in the Epistle to Yemen, but not in his Halachic work, the Mishne Torah. R. Walkin postulates that this is because while Maimonides saw these oaths as important, he did not consider them to be legally binding as Halacha, only that they serve as \"warnings that these actions would be unsuccessful\".\n\nRabbi Joel Teitelbaum (the Satmar Rebbe) however, in his book Vayoel Moshe noted that the Rambam cites the Three Oaths in Iggeret Teiman, in a way that makes it appear that he is discussing binding Halachah. In using the description \"metaphorical\", Maimonides is referring to the nature of the text of the Song of Songs, and not to the Three Oaths themselves. The Satmar Rebbe however did not consider the breaking of the oaths a halachic issue, but rather a form of heresy. He stated that \"the oath was not given to heretics but to all Jewry; and even if the whole Government were pious like men of old, any attempt to take their freedom prematurely would be to deny the Holy Law and our faith.\"\n\nReligious Zionists argue that Maharal considered the oaths to be a Divine decree (which has thus subsequently expired). They rely upon his commentary to Ketubot which more explicitly indicates that he understood the Oaths to be binding insofar as it is up to God to permit the circumstances wherein Jews can engage in said activities, but it is not binding insofar as Jews are not actually prohibited from engaging in the acts the Oaths are concerned with. They maintain that there is a certain degree of ambiguity in what he has written in Netzach Yisrael and therefore his position must be seen in such a manner, for \"anything to the contrary yields a contradiction within the Maharal's own writings\", which would clearly be undesirable.\n\nHowever, the position of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum (the Satmar Rebbe) in respect to whether Maharal understood the Oaths as prohibitively binding upon Jews is based primarily upon what was written in Netzach Yisrael. It is uncertain whether he considered and factored in Maharal's position in his commentary on Ketubot. (Whether this is due to his not having had access to it, not having been aware of it, or having viewed the text as a forgery is unknown.) However, according to his understanding of the Maharal any violation of the Oaths is absolutely prohibited, even on pain of death.\n\nIn response to Zionists who quote the Maharal's commentary on Ketubot, anti-Zionist writers have said that even if the oaths are to be seen as decrees, it was obviously not God's intent that the Jewish people should keep trying to return to the Land of Israel and build a state until they hit the right moment. In view of the harsh consequences of failure (\"I will declare your flesh ownerless like the gazelles and hinds of the field\"), this would be as foolish as playing Russian roulette. Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.\n\nAn overview of some of the primary claims made by Religious Zionists concerning the Three Oaths:\n\nAn overview of some of the primary claims made by anti-Zionists concerning the Three Oaths:\n\n\nMany Haredim who subscribe to the anti-Zionist view still immigrate to the Land of Israel. Their rationalization is that they do so only as individuals and families, but not as members of the organized mass-immigration, and that they come to the Land solely to live there, not in order to conquer it or rule over it. Such Haredim accordingly do not believe themselves to be in violation of the Three Oaths.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "446263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=446263", "title": "Viriathus", "text": "Viriathus\n\nViriathus (also spelled Viriatus; known as \"Viriato\" in Portuguese and Spanish; died 139 BC) was the most important leader of the Lusitanian people that resisted Roman expansion into the regions of western Hispania (as the Romans called it) or western Iberia (as the Greeks called it), where the Roman province of Lusitania would be finally established after the conquest. This Roman province spread over areas comprising most of Portugal (the northernmost part was included in Gallaecia), all of Extremadura and the province of Salamanca. Its eastern frontier reached the proximities of Toletum, in central Hispania. Current Galicia was not included in the province, since it comprised most of the territory of another province, the aforementioned Gallaecia, but like the Vettonian people in the South, the Galaic tribes living there were also related to them.\n\nViriatus developed alliances with other Iberian groups, even far away from his usual theatres of war, inducing them to rebel against Rome. He led his army, supported by most of the Lusitanian and Vetton tribes as well as by other Celtiberian allies, to several victories over the Romans between 147 BC and 139 BC before being betrayed by them and murdered while sleeping. Of him, Theodor Mommsen said, \"It seemed as if, in that thoroughly prosaic age, one of the Homeric heroes had reappeared.\"\n\nThere are several possible etymologies for the name Viriatus. The name can be composed of two elements: \"Viri\" and \"Athus\".\n\"Viri\" may come from:\n\nThe Celtiberian elite called themselves uiros ueramos, meaning the 'highest man' and the Latin equivalent would be \"summus vir\".\n\nAccording to the historian Schulten, Viriatus had a Celtic name.\n\nLittle is known about Viriatus. The only reference to the location of his native tribe was made by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, who claims he was from the Lusitanian tribes of the ocean side.\n\nHe belonged to the class of warriors, the occupation of the minority ruling elites. He was known to the Romans as the \"dux\" of the Lusitanian army, as the \"adsertor\" (protector) of Hispania, or as an \"imperator\", probably of the confederated Lusitanian and Celtiberian tribes.\n\nLivy described him as a shepherd who became a hunter, then a soldier, thus following the path of most young warriors, the \"iuventus\", who devoted themselves to cattle raiding, hunting and war.\n\nAccording to Appian, Viriatus was one of the few who escaped when Galba, the Roman governor, massacred the \"flos iuventutis\", the flower of the young Lusitanian warriors, in 150 BC.\n\nTwo years after the massacre, in 148 BC, Viriatus became the leader of a Lusitanian army.\n\nViriatus was thought by some to have a very obscure origin, although Diodorus Siculus also says that Viriatus \"approved himself to be a prince\" and that he said he was \"lord and owner of all\". His family was unknown to the Romans who were familiar with the native aristocratic warrior society.\nHis personality and his physical and intellectual abilities as well as his skills as a warrior were described by several authors. He was a man of great physical strength, probably in the very prime of life, an excellent strategist, and possessor of a brilliant mind. Some authors claim that the ancient authors described Viriatus with the precise features of a Celtic king.\n\nHe was described as a man who followed the principles of honesty and fair dealing and was acknowledged for being exact and faithful to his word on the treaties and alliances he made. Livy gives him the title of \"vir duxque magnus\" with the implied qualities that were nothing more than the ideals of the ancient virtues.\n\nA more modern current claims Viriatus belonged to an aristocratic Lusitanian clan who were owners of cattle. For Cassius Dio, he did not pursue power or wealth, but carried on the war for the sake of military glory. His aims could then be compared to pure Roman aristocratic ideals of that time: to serve and gain military glory and honor. Viriatus did not fight for war spoils or material gain, like common soldiers.\n\nThe Lusitanians honored Viriatus as their \"Benefactor\", (Greek: \"euergetes\"), and \"Savior\" (Greek: \"soter\"), typically Hellenistic honorifics used by kings like the Ptolemies.\n\nSome authors assert that he was probably from the \"Herminius Mons\" (Serra da Estrela), in the heart of Lusitania, (in central Portugal) or the Beira Alta region.\n\nMost of his life and his war against the Romans are part of legend and Viriatus is considered the earliest Portuguese national hero, given the fact that he was the leader of the confederate tribes of Iberia who resisted Rome. The historian Appianus of Alexandria in his book about Iberia (in the section \"Historia Romana\", Roman History), commented that Viriatus \"killed numerous Romans and showed great skill\".\n\nIt has been argued that Silius Italicus, in his epic poem entitled \"Punica\", mentions a former Viriatus who would have been a contemporary of Hannibal. He is referenced as \"primo Viriatus in aeuo\", and was a leader of the Gallaeci and of the Lusitanians.\n\nThe historical Viriatus would be the one who received the title of \"regnator Hiberae magnanimus terrae\", the \"magnanimous ruler of the Iberian land\".\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, Rome started its conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. The Roman conquest of Iberia began during the Second Punic War, when the senate sent an army to Iberia to block Carthaginian reinforcements from helping Hannibal in the Italian Peninsula. This began Roman involvement in 250 years of subsequent fighting throughout Iberia, resulting in its eventual conquest in 19 BC with the end of the Cantabrian Wars. The Lusitanian War is one of the most well documented episodes of the conquest.\n\nRome's dominion of Iberia met with much opposition. In 197 BC, Rome divided the southeastern coast of Iberia into two provinces, Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior, and two elected \"praetors\" were assigned to command the legions. As with many other tribes of Iberia, the inhabitants of the Lusitanian castros, or \"citanias\", would have been granted peregrina stipendiaria\" but remaining an autonomous (Greek: αὐτονόμων) country through treaties (\"foedus\").\n\nLusitania's rich land was praised by ancient authors. Polybius in his \"Histories\", \"speaking of the natural wealth of Lusitania [...], tells us that owing to the favorable climate both men and animals are very prolific, and the land is constantly productive.\"\n\nThe Romans charged the native tribes with heavy taxes: a fixed \"vectigal\" or land-tax, the \"tributum\" and a certain quantity of cereals. Taxes were not the only source of income; mine exploitation and peace treaties were a source of denarius as well as war spoils and war prisoners who were sold as slaves. The indigenous towns had to deliver their own treasures to the Romans, which left them only with their yearly earnings to pay the taxes. Between 209 and 169 BC, the Roman army collected 4 tons of gold and 800 tons of silver looting the native tribes of the Iberian peninsula. The governors extorted as much as they could from the tribes. In 174 BC, when Publius Furius Philus was accused of paying very little for the cereals that Iberia was compelled to deliver to Rome, Cato defended the interests of the native tribes. The exploitation and extortion reached such an extreme degree in the provinces that Rome had to create a special tribunal and laws, like the Lex Calpurnia created in 149 BC. Also as part of the payment, a certain number of men were required to serve in the Roman army.\nThe Lusitanians revolted first in 194 BC against the Romans. Iberia was divided between the tribes that supported Roman rule and the tribes that revolted against Roman rule, as they had been divided before by those who supported the Carthaginian or the Romans.\n\nThis period was marked by a number of broken treaties either by the Roman generals, or their senate, that would not ratify the treaties, or by the native people.\n\nIn 152 BC the Lusitanians made a peace agreement with Marcus Atilius, after he conquered \"Oxthracae\", Lusitania's biggest city. In Roman law, peregrini dediticii was the designation given to peoples who had surrendered themselves after taking up arms against the Romans. The terms offered were such that, as soon as Atilius returned to Rome, they rebelled and broke the treaty. Then they attacked the tribes that were Roman subjects and that had sided with the Romans in helping to attack and plunder the Lusitanian towns. Possibly the Lusitanians recovered some of the booty the Romans had divided with those tribes.\n\nIn 151 BC the Celtiberians who had become Roman allies, fearing the revenge of the rebels who considered them traitors, asked the Romans to punish the rebellious tribes who had broken out into war and that the legions should remain in Iberia to protect them.\n\nThe praetor of Hispania Ulterior, Servius Sulpicius Galba commanded the Roman troops in Iberia c.150 BC, and at the same time Lucius Licinius Lucullus was appointed Governor of the Hispania Citerior and commander of an army. In the year 151 BC, Lucullus \"being greedy of fame and needing money\", made a peace treaty with the \"Caucaei\", of the Vaccaei tribe, after which he ordered his men to kill all the tribe's adult males, of which it is said only a few out of 30,000 escaped.\n\nServius Sulpicius Galba joined forces with Lucius Licinius Lucullus and together started to depopulate Lusitania. While Lucullus invaded the country from the east, Galba attacked it from the south. Unable to sustain a war on two fronts, the Lusitanian troops suffered several losses in engagements with the Romans. Fearing a long siege and the destruction the Roman siege engines would cause in their towns, the Lusitanians sent an embassy to Galba to negotiate a peace treaty, although for the Romans it would be perceived as the \"Deditio in dicionem \", the surrender. The Lusitanians hoped they could at least renew the former treaty made with Atilius. Galba received the Lusitanian embassy politely, and a peace treaty was agreed on the terms proposed by him. He commanded them to leave their homes and remain in open country. The Lusitanians probably lost their city and possessions and their land would have become \"Ager Publicus\". The conquest of a territory, unless it had been given special conditions, could imply the acquisition, by the Romans, of the conquered territory and all that it contained.\n\nThe treaty turned out to be a trap, like the one Lucullus had prepared for the \"Caucaei\". When the unarmed Lusitanians, among them Viriathus, were gathered together by Galba to hand over their weapons and to be split into three groups (two of the points of the treaty that had been negotiated) and allocated to new lands, the trap was sprung. With the promise that they would be given new lands they waited unaware while Galba's army surrounded them with a ditch, to prevent them from escaping. Afterwards, Roman soldiers were sent in and began to massacre all the males of military age. The survivors are said to have been sold into slavery in Gaul.\n\nThe relocation of an entire tribe, accompanied by slaughter or their reduction to the status of slaves was a punishment often inflicted on native populations who took part in revolts.\n\nGalba distributed a little of the plunder to the army and a little to his friends, the native tribes that sided with him, and kept the rest. This incited a massive rebellion, with the entire Lusitanian tribe mustering as they waged war for three years against Rome, but met with many failures.\n\nThree years after the massacre, the rebellion was on the verge of defeat when Viriathus appeared and offered himself as leader. Through his understanding of Roman military methods he saved the rebel Lusitanians by a simple though clever escape plan. Viriathus became the leader of the Lusitanians and caused much grief to the Romans in revenge for the massacre of his people.\n\nThe war with Viriatus was called \"War of Fire\" by the Greek historian Polybius of Megalopolis. Two types of war were carried on by Viriatus, \"bellum\", when he used a regular army, and \"latrocinium\", when the fighting involved small groups of combatants and the use of guerrilla tactics. For many authors Viriatus is seen as the model of the guerrilla fighter.\n\nNothing is known about Viriatus until his first feat of war in 149 BC. He was with an army of ten thousand men that invaded southern Turdetania.\n\nRome sent the praetor Caius Vetilius to fight the rebellion. He attacked a group of Lusitanian warriors who were out foraging, and after killing several of them, the survivors took refuge in a place that was surrounded by the Roman army. They were about to make a new agreement with the Romans when Viriatus, mistrusting the Romans, proposed an escape plan. The Lusitanians inflamed by his speech made him their new commander. His first act was to rescue the currently trapped resisting Lusitanians whom he took over command of. First by lining up for battle with the Romans, then scattering the army as they charged. As each way broke apart and fled in different directions to meet up at a later location, Viriatus with 1,000 chosen men held the army of 10,000 Romans in check by being in a position to attack. Once the rest of the army had fled, he and the thousand men escaped as well. Having effectively saved all of the Lusitanians soldiers immediately fortified the loyalty of the people around Viriatus.\n\nViriatus organized an attack against Caius Vetilius in Tribola. Since the Romans were better armed, he organized guerrilla tactics and sprung imaginative ambushes. Charging with iron spears, tridents and roars, the Lusitanians defeated Vetilius by killing 4,000 out of 10,000 Troops including Vetilius himself. As a response, the Celtiberians were hired to attack the Lusitanians, but were destroyed. After that incident, the Lusitanians clashed with the armies of Gaius Plautius, Claudius Unimanus and Gaius Negidius, all of whom were defeated. During this period Viriatus inspired and convinced the Numantine and some Gauls to rebel against Roman rule.\n\nTo complete the subjugation of Lusitania, Rome sent Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, with 15,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry to strengthen Gaius Laelius Sapiens who was a personal friend of Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. The Romans lost most of these reinforcements in Ossuma. When Quintus Fabius risked combat again, he was totally defeated near what is today the city of Beja in Alentejo. This defeat gave the Lusitanians access to today's Spanish territory, modern Granada and Murcia. The results of Viriatus's effects as well as that of the Numantine War caused many problems in Rome, the most notable being a drop in Legion recruitment rates.\n\nLearning of these events, Rome sent one of its best generals, Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus, to Iberia. Near Sierra Morena, the Romans fell into a Lusitanian ambush. Viriatus did not harm the Romans and let the soldiers and Servilianus go. Servilianus made a peace term that recognized the Lusitanian rule over the land they conquered.\n\nThis agreement was ratified by the Roman Senate and Viriatus was declared \"amicus populi Romani\", (), an ally of the Roman people. However, the peace brought by the treaty displeased Quintus Servilius Caepio, who got himself appointed successor of his brother, Q. Fabius Maximus Servilianus, in the command of the army and administration of affairs in Iberia. In his reports to the Roman Senate he sustained that the treaty was in the highest degree dishonorable to Rome. Livy seemed to have a different opinion as he said it was a stain in Servilianus' military career but comments that the treaty was, \"aequis\", fair. The senate authorized Q. Servilius Caepio, on his request, to distress Viriatus as long as it was done secretly. The treaty was in effect for one year. During that time Q. Servilius Caepio harassed Viriatus and kept making pressure with his reports until he was authorized to publicly declare war.\n\nKnowing that the Lusitanian resistance was largely due to Viriatus' leadership, Quintus Servilius Caepio bribed Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus, who had been sent by Viriatus as an embassy to establish peace (Appian). These ambassadors returned to their camp and killed Viriatus while he was sleeping. Eutropius claims that when Viriatus' assassins asked Q. Servilius Caepio for their payment he answered that \"it was never pleasing to the Romans, that a general should be killed by his own soldiers.\", or in another version more common in modern Portugal and Spain, \"Rome does not pay traitors who kill their chief\". Q. Servilius Caepio was refused his Triumph by the Senate.\n\nAfter the death of Viriatus, the Lusitanians kept fighting under the leadership of Tautalus (Greek: Τάυταλος).\n\nLaenas would finally give the Lusitanians the land they originally had asked for before the massacre. Nevertheless, total pacification of Lusitania was only achieved under Augustus. Under Roman rule, Lusitania and its people gradually acquired Roman culture and language.\n\nViriatus stands as the most successful leader in Iberia who ever opposed the Roman conquest. During the course of his campaigns he was only defeated in battle against the Romans once, and from a military standpoint can be said to have been one of the most successful generals to have ever opposed Rome's expansion. Ultimately, even the Romans recognized that it was more prudent to use treachery rather than open confrontation to defeat the Lusitanian uprising. Some fifty years later, the renegade Roman general Quintus Sertorius, at the head of another insurrection in Iberia, would meet a similar fate.\n\nViriatus became an enduring symbol of Portuguese nationality and independence, portrayed by artists and celebrated by its people throughout the centuries. In 1572, Luís Vaz de Camões epic poem Os Lusiadas, the author exalts Viriatus' great deeds.\n\nThe flag of the Spanish province of Zamora, called Seña Bermeja, has 8 red strips honouring the eight victories of Viriatus over the Romans.\n\nThere is a street in Madrid named after him in Chamberí neighborhood.\n\n\n"}

WSSCC facilitates multi-stakeholder collaboration around sanitation and contributes to the international community's broader goals of poverty eradication, health and environmental improvement, gender equality and long-term social and economic development.\n\nWSSCC's main areas of focus are large-scale sanitation and hygiene behaviour change programmes through the Global Sanitation Fund -promoting sanitation and hygiene as the gateway to inclusion and opportunity; and bringing together leaders and activists to strengthen the global sanitation movement.\n\nWSSCC's members and staff lobbied for a Sustainable Development Goal target for sanitation and hygiene. WSSCC contributes measurably to the achievement of SDG 6.2: \"By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.\" \n\nWSSCC works to address the sanitation crisis and promote universal access to sanitation in collaboration with a range of partners. The United Nations estimates that 2.3 billion people live without access to safe sanitation. According to the World Bank, poor sanitation costs countries approximately $260 billion annually. \n\nWSSCC addresses a range of sanitation and hygiene-related issues within its focus areas such as: \n\nWSSCC collaborates with government agencies, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, civil society groups and the private sector internationally and at the national, regional and local levels. Key collaborating partners include WaterAid, the Sanitation and Water For All, and UNICEF, among others. The organization also advocates around key sanitation and hygiene international days such as World Toilet Day and Global Handwashing Day.\n\nThrough the Global Sanitation Fund (GSF), a multi-donor United Nations trust fund, WSSCC supports national efforts to help rural communities improve their sanitation and adopt good hygiene practices. The GSF funds behaviour change activities. Community-led total sanitation is frequently utilized by GSF-funded national programmes, such as in Cambodia and Nigeria.\n\nThe GSF currently funds national programmes in Benin, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Nepal, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda. WSSCC's Secretariat gathers funds and donations at the global level, selects the eligible countries for funding, and manages the disbursement of grants to national sanitation programmes.\n\nWSSCC advocates for equality, human rights and non-discrimination as central to ensuring access to safe water supply, adequate sanitation and good hygiene for all. In particular, WSSCC WASH advocates promote women's participation and leadership and menstrual hygiene management.\n\nA key challenge that WSSCC is addressing relates to the inclusion of menstrual hygiene management in the sustainable development agenda. WSSCC has highlighted that the taboo surrounding menstruation is a barrier to equal participation and opportunities for women. A National Public Radio article highlighted that many policy makers often admit that they had never considered questions around menstruation before.\n\nOperationally, sustaining behaviour change as well as ensuring reliable and consistent monitoring have been identified as challenges. Of particular note is the challenge related to monitoring households that return to previous unhygienic behaviours. WSSCC and its partners are addressing these issues through systems strengthening and impact evaluations.\n\nNotable reports and campaigns supported by WSSCC include:\n\nWSSCC is administratively and legally hosted by UNOPS. The WSSCC Secretariat is governed by the WSSCC Steering Committee, and has three main departments: (i) Networking and Knowledge Management; (ii) Advocacy and Communications; (iii) the GSF.\n\nThe WSSCC Steering Committee decides the policies and strategies of the organization, manages the governance process, and is accountable to both the membership and the donors for its work. It is made up of a chair, regional members, partner agency members, ex officio members, non-voting invitees, and permanent non-voting observers. All WSSCC members are eligible to stand and vote in elections for the Steering Committee. The interim Chairs are Brad Herbert and Ebele Okeke, who have been in post since November 2016. Previous Chairs were: Anna Tibaijuka, 2011-2015; Roberto Lenton, 2005 – 2011; Sir Richard Jolly, 1997 – 2004; and Margaret Catley-Carlson, 1990 – 1996.\n\nAmina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations and former Minister of Environment of Nigeria, served as WSSCC's Chair from April 2016 to November 2016. \n\nThe Secretariat’s Executive Director is Rolf Luyendijk, who will join WSSCC from UNICEF in March 2018. WSSCC’s secretariat is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThe organization currently receives or has received funding from seven governments: Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. \n\nIn 1990, a group of senior staff of developing country governments, bilateral and multilateral agencies, NGOs and research institutions founded WSSCC. On December 21, 1990, the 45th Session of the UN General Assembly elected to pass resolution A/RES/45/181, which emphasized the “importance of intensifying the coordination of national activities undertaken with the assistance of all relevant agencies in the field of water supply and sanitation through, in particular, the inter-agency Steering Committee for Co-operative Action for the International Drinking Water Decade and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council”. Through this resolution the WSSCC was formally established as an independent organization with a United Nations mandate.\n\nDuring the 1990s, WSSCC concentrated on sharing knowledge and convening thematic discussion groups on water- and sanitation-related topics. In 2000, WSSCC published Vision 21, a proposal for achieving universal water, sanitation and hygiene coverage.\n\nWSSCC is an unincorporated membership organization and not a separate legal entity.

This was done to conserve the food supply and increase its production in order to aid the efforts in Europe during the war. This alone helped food industries, including wheat, to take off. In July 1918, the Grain Corporation (a part of the US Food Administration) took on contracts with allied governments, promising to provide as much wheat up to 200 million bushels to the Allied powers. Soon after this, the war ended, and the United States had a decision to make if they were going to honor the wheat prices promised before the war ended. \n\nDuring World War I, the wheat industry was mobilized, but following the end of it the demand started to decline, which hurt the still-mobilized agricultural industry. This resulted in the drafting of the Wheat Price Guarantee Act. The 65th Congress approved this and it was signed into law by Woodrow Wilson. The bill appropriated $1,000,000,000 in funds to keep wheat prices constant through the 1919-1920 crop year. The passage of this act allowed the US Government, specifically the President, to monitor wheat prices in order to guarantee farmers profits based on what they had formerly expected to be. The minimum price per bushel was set to $2.26, which is known as a guaranteed price scheme. The passage of this was intended to give the agricultural industry time to adjust to the war being over. The Wheat Price Guarantee Act would officially expire on June 1, 1920. After this, most farmers fell into debt and this laid some of the roots that would lead to the Great Depression in the 30's.\n\nSenator Gronna attempted to reverse all guarantees within this act with the Gronna Bill. Many state representatives opposed this, choosing to back the farmers with a 100% guarantee on their profits. The bill did not end up passing in the end.\n\nThe passage of the bill required the US to buy bushels of wheat for at least $2.26 each. Following the expiration of the bill in 1920, prices plummeted back to their typical range of $0.50-$1.50 per bushel. Having lost most of the business they had because of the war, the wheat industry took a big hit. In 1931 during the Great Depression, it would hit a low of just $0.33 per bushel.\n\n"}

Founded in 1989, Womankind partners with women's movements in Africa and Asia to support them in their efforts to change discriminatory laws and policies, challenge gender norms and stereotypes, and provide transformative programmes and services to women and girls.\n\nIn nearly 30 years, Womankind, together with its partners, has supported over 18 million women and girls across more than 70 countries.\n\nFounded by Sir Alec Reed, Womankind was launched on International Women's Day on March 8th, 1989. Kate Young was appointed as Executive Director. On March 8th, 2019, the charity will celebrate its 30th anniversary.\n\nWomankind does not have staff or offices in the countries where they work - instead, they support existing women's movements to strengthen and grow to support women's rights in their local and national contexts. Womankind does this by providing technical support, communications, connectivity and shared learning, advocacy platforms, and funding opportunities.\n\nTogether with their partners, Womankind takes a three-pronged approach, working towards:\n\nWomankind works with its partners in pursuit of three main aims:\n\nIn 2016-2017, Womankind identified five focus countries on which to focus the majority of their work:\n\nIn Ethiopia, Womankind works with a number of partners focusing on issues including sexual violence, disabilities, entrepreneurship among women, feminist education, and safe houses and shelters for women escaping violence. For example, they are currently supporting partner Setaweet to introduce feminist curriculum to secondary schools in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nWomankind's partners in Kenya work primarily around legal advocacy for women's rights, providing free legal services to women, and lobbying and advocating for women with disabilities. Currently, they are working in long-term partnership with Federation of Women Lawyers - Kenya to increase women's political participation and access to justice, as well as strengthen community response to early and forced marriage as well as female genital mutilation (FGM).\n\nIn Nepal, Womankind supports partners working primarily with Dalit women, women with disabilities, and indigenous women to enable them to participate in the country's women's movement. Other partners are working or have worked around producing feminist research, guaranteeing the rights of lesbian, bisexual and transgender women, gender-based violence, and women's broader political participation. For example, Womankind partner Feminist Dalit Organization - FEDO lobbying efforts prior to Nepal's 2017 local elections helped result in nearly 7,000 Dalit women being elected to local governments across the country.\n\nWomankind's partners in Uganda work around several issues including gender-based violence, environmental causes, and issues affecting rural women. In March 2018, Womankind and partners National Association of Professional Environmentalists and National Association for Women's Action in Development published \"Digging Deep\", a feminist research report revealing the harmful impacts of Uganda's land rush on women. \n\nIn Zimbabwe, Womankind is supporting partners in strengthening civil society prior to the 2018 general elections, supporting feminist research and documentation in the countries, increasing the voices of lesbian, bisexual and transgender women, supporting women with disabilities, and advocating for improved access to justice, among other issues. For example, through Womankind's partnership with Zimbabwe Women Lawyers Association, the organization provides legal services to women for cases on domestic violence, divorce, land and property disputes, and child support.\n\nIn addition, the charity continues to work with partners in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Ghana, Liberia, Peru, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Zambia.\n\nWomankind is active on social media, including on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Their website also hosts an active blog, as well as case studies featuring women impacted by Womankind's partners. In the media, Womankind has been featured in the Huffington Post, the Independent, and the Guardian.\n\nThe organization is also active in advocacy and campaigning efforts, partaking in annual campaigns for 16 Days of Activism as well as International Women's Day.\n\n"}
{"id": "14252394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14252394", "title": "¿Por qué no te callas?", "text": "¿Por qué no te callas?\n\n¿Por qué no te callas? (, English: \"Why don't you shut up?\") is a phrase that was uttered by King Juan Carlos I of Spain to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, at the 2007 Ibero-American Summit in Santiago, Chile, when Chávez was repeatedly interrupting Prime Minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's speech. The phrase became an overnight sensation, gaining cult status as a mobile-phone ringtone; spawning a domain name; a contest; T-shirt sales; a television program; and YouTube videos.\n\nAt the meeting on 10 November 2007, Chávez repeatedly interrupted Zapatero to call Zapatero's predecessor, José María Aznar, a \"fascist\" and \"less human than snakes\", and accuse Aznar of having supported a failed coup d'état aimed at removing Chávez from power. Zapatero had earlier irritated Chávez by suggesting that Latin America needed to attract more foreign capital to combat its \"chronic, deepening poverty\", and claimed that Chávez's policies scared investors out of Latin America.\n\nChávez's attacks became so strong that Zapatero rose to Aznar's defence, even though he had been severely critical of Aznar in the past. Zapatero pointed out that Aznar had been democratically elected and was \"a legitimate representative of the Spanish people\".\n\nAlthough organizers switched off Chávez's microphone, he continued to interrupt as Zapatero defended Aznar. Juan Carlos leaned forward, turned towards his fellow head of state, and said, \"¿Por qué no te callas?\" The king's rebuke received applause from the general audience. He addressed Chávez using the familiar form of \"you\". (In Spanish, \"tú\" and \"te\" are usually used in informal chat, among young people or when addressing close friends, family, or children, and can be perceived as insulting when used in other circumstances.) Shortly thereafter, he left the hall, when Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega accused Spain of intervention in his country's elections and complained about the presence of Spanish energy companies in Nicaragua. The incident was unprecedented, as never before had the king displayed such anger in public.\n\nFor the king, the incident was part of an \"annus horribilis\" for the royal image, according to the Chilean newspaper \"La Nación\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" analyzed the incident, arguing that it exposed \"the unendingly complicated relations between Spain and its former colonies\".\n\nAfter the events at the summit, Hugo Chávez made statements against King Juan Carlos I, questioning his democratic legitimacy, and whether he knew about and endorsed the attempted coup d'état in Venezuela in 2002. Chávez defended his accusations against Aznar, arguing that prohibiting criticism of an elected official such as Aznar would be similar to prohibiting criticism of Hitler. He stated that he would revise Venezuela's position towards Spain and increase surveillance of the activities of Spanish companies in Venezuela, where Spain had been the main investor and trade partner in the last decade.\n\nThe Spanish government showed appreciation for the reaction of the king and for Zapatero's defense of the dignity of Spanish elected representatives like Aznar.\n\nSeveral days after the event, Chávez demanded an apology from King Juan Carlos and warned Spain that he would review diplomatic ties and take action against Spanish investments such as Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria in Venezuela. He accused the king of displaying the kind of\nSpanish arrogance that led to Spain's ejection from South America at the hands of Venezuela's hero, Simón Bolívar. Spanish diplomats were concerned that Chávez may replace his socialism and attacks on \"American Imperialism\" with attacks on what he called \"Spanish imperialism\". Speaking about Venezuela's indigenous peoples, Chávez said of the Spanish, \"They slit our people's throats and chopped them into little bits and left them on the outskirts of towns and villages – that was what the Spanish empire did here\". The Spanish foreign ministry denied that the \"¿Por qué no te callas?\" incident was indicative of Spanish–Latin American relations. Some analysts say Chávez used such incidents to \"fire up his support base among the majority poor at home with blunt language that played on their misgivings of rich countries' investments in Latin America\".\n\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\", it is uncertain which of the two men came out of the incident looking worse: \"Chávez for his boorish lack of etiquette\", or the king for insulting another leader. The king's words raised questions as the \"200th anniversary of independence for the former Spanish colonies\" approached. Several days after the incident, Venezuela's state-run television ran footage of Juan Carlos with Francisco Franco. The king was depicted as the dictator's lackey; but the fact that the Spanish Constitution of 1978, which preserved the monarchy, had been approved by a referendum; and the key role played by the king in putting down an attempted military coup in 1981, were not mentioned.\n\nThe king's outburst received divided reactions from other leaders. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva defended Chávez, while Peru's and El Salvador's presidents Alan García and Antonio Saca supported the king.\n\nAn editor for the \"Washington Post\" noted the \"Spanish-speaking world has been abuzz about [this] verbal slapdown\" and suggested that King Juan Carlos \"should have asked the assembled heads of state: 'Why don't you speak up?'\"\n\nOne week after the event, \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia delivered a second rebuke in one week to Chávez from a king, when he reminded Chávez that oil should not be used as a tool for conflict. The remarks came minutes after Chávez called for OPEC to \"assert itself as an active political agent\" at the OPEC summit in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh. In a followup at the OPEC summit, \"Reuters\" wrote that \"Spain's king cannot shut Chavez up but bladder can\", and that Chávez said to a throng of reporters at the OPEC summit, \"For a while now, I have needed to go to the bathroom and I am going to pee ... Do you want me to pee on you?\"\n\nTwo weeks after the event, Chile's President Michelle Bachelet revealed that she had politely requested that Chávez abstain from making some statements at the summit, indicating frankly that she felt \"let down\" by the subsequent discussions at the OPEC meeting, considering the effect that the price of oil has on countries like Chile. Also just weeks after the incident, Chávez was \"accused of breaking a protocol accord\" with Colombia's President Álvaro Uribe and \"exhaust[ing] his Colombian counterpart's patience by speaking out of turn once too often\", formally ending Chávez's mediation in hostage negotiations with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group. (Dialogue resumed later and the hostages were freed in January 2008.)\n\nIn 2013, Infobae named the incident among those most noted to have captured public attention in the history of the Ibero-American Summit. \"Entorno Inteligente\" invoked the phrase, paying homage to Spain for the \"immortal lexicon\", and referring to Venezuelan politician Nicolás Maduro as \"inmaduro\" (immature). Analitica.com said that language used at the 2013 Summit should be clear, and that the rebuke of Chávez is still remembered.\n\nZapatero said he did not realize what an influential moment it had been until he returned home and his eldest daughter greeted him with \"¿Por qué no te callas?\", which made them both laugh.\n\nThe king's phrase gained cult slogan status, ringing from mobile phones; appearing on T-shirts; and being used as a greeting. The domain, porquenotecallas.com, had reached US$4,600 on eBay as of 16 November 2007. The phrase became a YouTube sensation overnight and a song was written to a traditional tune. The phrase has spawned countless media articles, jokes, songs and video clips; while in Spain an estimated 500,000 people downloaded the phrase as a ringtone, generating €1.5 million (US$2 million) in sales. As of 14 November 2007, Google generated 665,000 webhits on the phrase and YouTube had 610 videos. Entrepreneurs in Florida and Texas put the slogan on T-shirts, and marketed them on eBay and elsewhere; the phrase became a greeting among Venezuelan expats in Miami and Spain and a slogan for Chávez opponents.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the event, the king's words were used by sports commentators during the radio transmission of Spanish language football games to describe controversial events. A contest for the best audiovisual depiction of the event was announced in Spain. \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" editorial page suggested that the phrase would have the power to change the course of history, as has been credited to Ronald Reagan's, \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" said \"the Spanish-speaking world can hardly stop talking about [the incident]\", which provided \"fodder for satirists from Mexico City to Madrid\". The reaction was apparent \"in newspaper headlines, cable television and on YouTube. His phrase was reproduced on T-shirts, and cellphone ring tones. In Mexico City, the dust-up became a satirical skit, \"El Chabo del 8\". In El Salvador's capital, the phrase became a playful greeting\". In Australia \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" reported the king could earn a multimillion-euro business if he claimed rights over the phrase, which generated a \"Benny Hill Show\"-style skit and a Nike ad, \"Juan do it. Just shut up\", with the Brazilian football star, Ronaldinho. Canada's \"CBC News\" said an actor's voice was used to mimic the king's voice in the ringtone to avoid legal problems over the use of the phrase, which also generated sales of coffee mugs. The infamous phrase was also referred to in a comic song called \"Baila el Chiki-chiki\", Spain's contribution to Eurovision 2008, and in the song \"La Plata\", by the Brazilian band Jota Quest.\n\nProtestors against the Chávez government adopted the phrase as their slogan; T-shirts in Venezuela had the slogan with the \"NO\" in capital letters, representing a call to vote against amendments in the December 2007 constitutional referendum and the phrase was used as a taunt when more than 100,000 marched in protest against Chávez's proposed constitutional changes.\n\nIn Argentina, a television program called \"Por qué no te callas\" began broadcasting on 6 December 2007. The phrase was also seen at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn Colombia, a famous YouTube animation called \"Vulgarcito\" depicted a summit between some Latin American countries and since Hugo Chávez never stopped talking in the animation, Vulgarcito, the main character, slapped him and shouted \"Shhh. It is time to quote the wise King of Spain and ask you: Why don't you shut up?\"\n\nAccording to \"Fundéu BBVA\", the Urgent Spanish Foundation, and the Director of the Chilean Academy of the Spanish language, the phrase uttered by the king, given the situation under which it was said, should be written with exclamation marks instead of question marks: \"¡Por qué no te callas!\" Alternatively, it could be written using a combination of both exclamation and question marks: \"¡¿Por qué no te callas?!\" or \"¿¡Por qué no te callas!?\"\n\n\n"}
