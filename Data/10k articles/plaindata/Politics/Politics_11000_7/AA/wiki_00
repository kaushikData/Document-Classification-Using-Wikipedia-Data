It may be sold with matching documents, such as an international driver's license, club membership card, insurance documents or similar supporting identity papers. A camouflage passport is not a real, valid passport and is to be distinguished from a valid second passport, which an individual with dual citizenship may be eligible to hold, a novelty \"fantasy passport\", or a fake of a real passport.\n\nFalse identity documents have a long history, but in 1998, the idea of the camouflage passport was credited by \"The Financial Times\" to Donna Walker of Houston, who said she had got the idea ten years earlier when an American on a hijacked aircraft was shot because of his nationality. \n\nWalker said that she started by asking the Sri Lankan embassy whether they still had rights over the name \"Ceylon\" and, finding they did not, went on to ask the U.S. State Department whether producing a passport in that name would be illegal, they \"couldn't show me it wasn't\". Walker went on to produce hundreds of passports in different country names, trading as International Documents Service, and described her \"finest hour\" as being during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait when a group of European oil executives were able to use her documents to pass through Iraqi checkpoints and escape to Jordan. \n\nShe said the basic idea was to look like \"a not very interesting man from a not very interesting country\".\n\nCamouflage passports are generally produced in the name of countries that no longer exist or have changed their name. \n\nOften these are former colonies that changed their name on independence, or use the names of places or political subdivisions that exist within a real country but have never issued or cannot issue passports (for instance, the British Hebrides which are islands off the west coast of Scotland that have never been separately independent). \n\nUsually, the names chosen have a plausible or familiar ring to them. Names that have been used include:\n\n\nAccording to sellers, the purpose of a true camouflage passport, rather than a novelty fantasy passport, is to provide false identification to be used in an emergency to protect the bearer from unwelcome attention at border crossings or anywhere that they might be asked to produce their documents and could be at risk. The camouflage passport, they say, is therefore intended primarily to deceive a customs, immigration or police officer into believing that the bearer is a person from a small, unimportant, and far away country that is not an enemy, or, in a terrorist situation, that the bearer is not a potentially high value hostage.\n\nOthers argue, however, that the true purpose of these documents is to be used in criminal activity, including terrorism and money laundering, and that the majority of camouflage passports are bought for those purposes. After the attacks of 9/11, the United States restricted the sale of camouflage passports, although they are still legal to possess in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and all of the European Union. Laws elsewhere may vary.\n\nIn 2011, the European Union resolved that a \"non-exhaustive list of known fantasy and camouflage passports\" should be drawn up that \"should not be subject to recognition or non-recognition. They should not entitle their holders to cross the external borders and should not be endorsed with a visa.\" A list was subsequently published and last updated in January 2014.\n\nThe producers of camouflage passports are generally internet based businesses that specialise in producing various types of identify documents that may be in real or false names. Other services often offered include offshore company formation, introductions to offshore banking and financial services providers and similar services all targeted at international mobile individuals and those interested in avoiding tax and government regulation. Despite several companies withdrawing from this market in recent years, others continue to operate, offering passports that purport to include UV tags and holograms for verisimilitude.\n\nFantasy passports are passport-like documents issued as a novelty or souvenir, to make a political statement or to show loyalty to a political or other cause.\n\nSouvenir United States state passports have also been issued, for Nevada or the Republic of Texas for instance, but these typically are clearly marked as novelties.\n\nExamples include:\n\n\n"}

The definition is not precise; for example the combat endurance of an aircraft, without qualification, is usually the time the aircraft can remain at an altitude suitable for combat, but in a particular theatre of operations it is the time it can remain in the area of combat. During the Battle of Britain, for example, the combat endurance of German fighters was the time they could remain over Britain, i.e., their inherent (endurance)less the time to travel from their base to Britain, and the time to return—about 15 minutes.\n\nIn addition to fuel the expenditure of ammunition and other consumables will reduce combat endurance, for example the limiting factors for a nuclear attack submarine are its torpedoes or for an nuclear aircraft carrier aviation fuel and aircraft munitions.\n\nMilitary units will have a combat endurance, how long they can stay in the field for, measured by how long its logistics train can keep its component subunits supplied with food, fuel, ammunition and spare parts etc.\n\nThe United States Department of Defense and NATO define endurance as \"the time an aircraft can continue flying, or a ground vehicle or ship can continue operating, under specified conditions, e.g., without refueling.\"\n\nCombat endurance training is also used for a system of physical training associated with stamina.\n\nThe improvements of combat endurance are largely concerned with better efficiency to the current platforms and they aim to bridge the gap between the resources available today and the future. Technology, therefore, dominates this field and one specific aspect that demonstrates this involves the technologies that enhance fuel efficiency. There are three improvement categories focused on this area:\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense identified three breakthrough technologies that could significantly improve its capabilities and combat endurance and these are: 1) blended wing body for fixed-wing, heavy-lift aircraft; 2) variable speed tilt rotor for vertical lift aircraft; and, 3) blast bucket design concept for light armor ground vehicles.\n"}

The founder of the conference, HRH Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh, described it as \"an extraordinary experiment\" that provided an opportunity for people from all over the Commonwealth and all walks of life to leave their usual roles and, with a diverse group of people, examine the relationship between industry and the community around it.\n\nThe participants are drawn from all sectors of society and particularly included people from government bodies, non-governmental organizations (NGOS), trade unions and businesses. On average 300 people attend such a conference and are afforded a unique opportunity to examine a broad range of society, how each component functions and its interactions with others.\n\nSince 1956 ten separate Commonwealth Study Conferences have taken place, variously hosted in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Malaysia and the United Kingdom. A number of related Regional conferences have also been held.\n\nIn 2006 a comprehensive 204 page book Leadership In The Making was published in Canada, celebrating 50 years since the first conference in 1956. Prince Phillip describes how the idea came about:\n\n\"The idea for the conference arose as a result of my visit to Canada in 1954. I had asked to visit some of the new and developing industries in Canada's far north on the way home from the Commonwealth Games in Vancouver. \n\n\"Two things struck me. The great majority of these developments were 'single-industry' enterprises, and in most cases the towns associated with the industries were 'company towns'. This is not typical for an industrialised country, but it had the effect of drawing my attention to one of the basic problems faced by industrial communities. While a company in control of an industrial enterprise has to be based on a system of managerial and technical qualifications, the town in which all the workers and the management have to live needs to be managed by some democratic system involving all the inhabitants as citizens. \n\n\"The purpose of the conference was to look into the tensions, problems and opportunities created by this dichotomy between industrial enterprise and community development.\"\n"}
{"id": "19049246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19049246", "title": "Cost approach", "text": "Cost approach\n\nIn real estate appraisal, the cost approach is one of three basic valuation methods. The others are market approach, or sales comparison approach, and income approach. The fundamental premise of the cost approach is that a potential user of real estate won't, or shouldn't, pay more for a property than it would cost to build an equivalent. The cost of construction minus depreciation, plus land, therefore is a limit, or at least a metric, of market value.\n\nThere are some fairly large assumptions embedded here. One of the basics is that there is a sufficient supply of buildable land that construction is a viable alternative to purchase of an existing property. In some parts of the world today, including in the USA, there are areas which are either so fully developed, or so restrictive in their planning approvals, that new construction is not an option because of the scarcity of land. A related question is whether the building in question is anything that would actually be built again in that market. If the trend of development favors, say, high volume warehousing, would anyone consider building a multi-story manufacturing facility? If the trend is to high density condominium buildings, would anyone consider building a detached house? The cost of constructing an obsolete building isn't considered relevant to market value.\n\nThere are other methodological issues which can be problematic. How do you estimate cost? Is it based on reproduction of an exact replica or something that is judged to be functionally equivalent? Can you even estimate cost very exactly? When a project is put up to bid, is there not usually a range of prices offered for the same plans and specifications? Is the final cost of a project equal to the original bid? How should profit be treated? Some maintain that the cost approach will normally be the highest of the three approaches. At the same time it is a truism that a project is only feasible if its projected cost is less than its completed value. \n\nIn between new and totally obsolete various negative elements related to age, fashion and change (depreciation) will accrue. These are lumped into physical (wear, tear and deterioration), functional (look, feel, form and style), and locational (the influence of factors outside the property itself).\n\nIt is generally considered that the cost approach gives the best indication of market value when the property in question is new and an appropriate (highest and best) use.\n"}

He is an investigative journalist who received the first of several British Press Awards in 1979 for an exposure of jury-vetting. He was a journalist for the \"Scotsman\", \"The Times\", and \"The Guardian\", and a Laurence Stern fellow at the \"Washington Post\" in 1980. Between 1989 and 1996, he also worked as a reporter for Thames TV's current affairs series \"This Week\", and a producer/director for Granada TV's investigative series \"World in Action\".\n\nFrom 1980 to 1989, he was chief investigative reporter at \"The Observer\".\nHis book \"The Wilson Plot\" (1988) increased public interest in alleged attempts by the British security services and others to destabilise Harold Wilson's government in the 1970s. His 1995 TV documentary for \"World in Action\", \"Jonathan of Arabia\", led after a libel trial to the jailing for perjury of former Conservative defence minister Jonathan Aitken.\n\nWith his colleague Rob Evans, Leigh published a series of corruption exposures in \"The Guardian\" about international arms giant BAE Systems. After a criminal inquiry by the US Department of Justice and other international prosecutors, the company was eventually required to pay penalties totalling $529 million. In 2006, Leigh became the Anthony Sampson Professor of Reporting in the Journalism department at City University London. His wife's sister married Alan Rusbridger, who later became editor of \"The Guardian\"\n\nIn 2010 Leigh was a member of the team which handled the release of United States diplomatic and military documents which had been passed to WikiLeaks, and which worked closely with Julian Assange. The relationship soured after the Guardian published details of allegations of sexual misbehaviour made against Assange by two Swedish women. This caused David Leigh to tweet: \"The #guardian published too many leaks for #Assange 's liking, it seems. So now he's signed up 'exclusively' with #Murdoch's Times. Gosh.\"\n\nIn \"\" (Guardian Books 2011), written with Luke Harding, Leigh mentioned the password to a set of unredacted classified US State Department cables. WikiLeaks had distributed multiple copies of encrypted files containing these cables, and others had mirrored the data with BitTorrent. Defending himself against criticism for subsequently dumping out all this data, Assange criticised Leigh and the \"Guardian\" instead, for unnecessarily disclosing the password. In response \"The Guardian\" said \"it's nonsense to suggest the Guardian's WikiLeaks book has compromised security in any way\". According to \"The Guardian\", WikiLeaks had indicated that the password was temporary and that WikiLeaks had seven months to take action to protect the files it had subsequently decided to post online. \nThe book was made into a 2014 Hollywood movie, \"The Fifth Estate\". Assange's supporters complained that he and Wikileaks were not given any money for it.\n\nIn 2011, after \"Private Eye\" magazine criticised an allegedly antisemitic Wikileaks associate Israel Shamir, editor Ian Hislop reported that Assange telephoned and complained of a campaign led by \"The Guardian\" to smear Wikileaks and deprive it of Jewish donations. Three people involved, including Leigh, according to Assange, were Jewish. Hislop says he pointed out that at least one of the three was not in fact Jewish and that this \"Jewish conspiracy\" was unconvincing. Assange eventually backed down and told Hislop to, \"Forget the Jewish thing.\" In response, Assange said, \"Hislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase.\"\n\nIn a further spat in 2012, Assange referred in a press release to: \"an information mule in the Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\", Yossi Melman, who conspired with \"Guardian\" journalist David Leigh to secretly, and in violation of WikiLeaks' contract with the \"Guardian\", move WikiLeaks' U.S. diplomatic cables to Israel.\" Melman characterised this as a \"clumsy smear\" attempt.\n\nIn 1979, he won a British Press Awards special award for exposing jury-vetting, whilst a reporter at the Guardian.

The Prime Minister must control a majority of parliament in order to govern. The office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not a permanent position, existing only at the discretion of the Prime Minister.\n\nUnlike analogous offices in some other nations, such as a vice-presidency, the Deputy Prime Minister possesses no special constitutional powers under the Constitution of Northern Cyprus as such, though they will always have particular responsibilities in government. They do not assume the duties and powers of the Prime Minister in the latter's absence, illness, or death. The Deputy Prime Minister does not automatically succeed the Prime Minister when the latter is incapacitated, or resigns from the leadership of his or her party. The designation of someone to the role of Deputy Prime Minister may provide additional practical status within the cabinet, enabling exercise of \"de facto\", if not \"de jure\", power.\n\nIn a coalition government, such as the Özgürgün cabinet between the National Unity Party and Democratic Party, the appointment of the leader of the smaller party (in this case, Serdar Denktaş, leader of the Democratic Party) as Deputy Prime Minister is done to give that person more authority within the cabinet to enforce the coalition's agreed-upon agenda.

{"id": "42976903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42976903", "title": "Dictatorship of the proletariat", "text": "Dictatorship of the proletariat\n\nIn Marxist sociopolitical thought, the dictatorship of the proletariat is a state of affairs in which the proletariat, or the working class, has control of political power. According to this theory, it is the intermediate system between capitalism and communism, when the government is in the process of changing the ownership of the means of production from private to collective ownership, and the existence of any government implies the dictatorship of one social class over another. The term, coined by Joseph Weydemeyer, was adopted in the 19th century by the founders of Marxism, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Both of them argued that the short-lived Paris Commune, which ran the French capital for over two months in 1871 before being suppressed, was an example of the dictatorship of the proletariat. \"Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\" is thus used as an antonym of \"dictatorship of the proletariat\".\n\nIt is termed \"dictatorship\" because it retains the state apparatus as such, with its implements of force and oppression, but differs from the popular notion of dictatorship which Marxists despise as the selfish, immoral, irresponsible and unconstitutional political rule of one man. It instead implies a stage where there is complete \"socialization of the major means of production\", in other words planning of material production so as to serve social needs, provide for an effective right to work, education, health and housing for the masses and fuller development of science and technology so as to multiply material production to achieve greater social satisfaction. However, social division into classes still exists, but the proletariat become the dominant class and oppression is still used to suppress the bourgeois counter-revolution. \n\nThere are two main trends for this political thought, yet both of them retain the state apparatus for its enforcement capabilities:\n\nFriedrich Hayek argued in the book \"The Road to Serfdom\" that the dictatorship of the proletariat, even if democratic, would probably destroy personal freedom as completely as in a autocracy.\n\nKarl Marx did not write much about the nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat, with his published works instead largely focusing on analysing and criticising capitalist society. In 1848, he and Engels wrote in \"The Communist Manifesto\" that \"their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions\". In the same year, commenting on revolution in Vienna he again highlighted the role of the violence, saying that \"there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror\".\n\nOn 1 January 1852, the communist journalist Joseph Weydemeyer published an article entitled \"Dictatorship of the Proletariat\" in the German language newspaper \"Turn-Zeitung\", where he wrote that \"it is quite plain that there cannot be here any question of gradual, peaceful transitions\" and recalled the examples of Oliver Cromwell (England) and Committee of Public Safety (France) as examples of \"dictatorship\" and \"terrorism\" (respectively) required to overthrow the bourgeoisie. In that year, Marx wrote to him, saying: \n\nMarx expanded upon his ideas about the dictatorship of the proletariat in his short 1875 work, \"Critique of the Gotha Program\", a scathing criticism and attack on the principles laid out in the programme of the German Workers' Party (predecessor to the Social Democratic Party of Germany). The programme presented a moderate, evolutionary way to socialism as opposed to revolutionary, violent approach of the \"orthodox\" Marxists. As a result the latter accused the Gotha program as being \"revisionist\" and ineffective.\n\nMarx stated that in a proletarian-run society the state should control the \"proceeds of labour\" (i.e. all the food and products produced) and take from them that which was \"an economic necessity\", namely enough to replace \"the means of production used up\", an \"additional portion for expansion of production\" and \"insurance funds\" to be used in emergencies such as natural disasters. Furthermore, he believed that the state should then take enough to cover administrative costs, funds for the running of public services and funds for those who were physically incapable of working. Once enough to cover all of these things had been taken out of the \"proceeds of labour\", Marx believed that what was left should then be shared out amongst the workers, with each individual getting goods to the equivalent value of how much labour they had invested. In this meritocratic manner, those workers who put in more labour and worked harder would get more of the proceeds of the collective labour than someone who had not worked as hard.\n\nIn the \"Critique\", he noted that \"defects are inevitable\" and there would be many difficulties in initially running such a workers' state \"as it emerges from capitalistic society\" because it would be \"economically, morally and intellectually... still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges\", thereby still containing capitalist elements.\n\nIn other works, Marx stated that he considered the Paris Commune (a revolutionary socialism supporting government that ran the city of Paris from March to May 1871) as an example of the proletarian dictatorship. Describing the short-lived regime, he remarked: The Commune was formed of the municipal councilors, chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible, and revocable at short terms. The majority of its members were naturally workers, or acknowledged representatives of the working class. The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary body, executive, and legislative at the same time.\n\nThis form of popular government, featuring revocable election of councilors and maximal public participation in governance, resembles contemporary direct democracy.\n\nForce and violence played an important role in Friedrich Engels's vision of the revolution and rule of proletariat. In 1877, arguing with Eugen Dühring, Engels ridiculed his reservations against use of force: \n\nIn the 1891 postscript to \"The Civil War in France\" (1872) pamphlet, Engels said: \"Well and good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorship looks like? Look at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of the Proletariat\"; to avoid bourgeois political corruption: [...] the Commune made use of two infallible expedients. In this first place, it filled all posts—administrative, judicial, and educational—by election on the basis of universal suffrage of all concerned, with the right of the same electors to recall their delegate at any time. And, in the second place, all officials, high or low, were paid only the wages received by other workers. The highest salary paid by the Commune to anyone was 6,000 francs. In this way an effective barrier to place-hunting and careerism was set up, even apart from the binding mandates to delegates [and] to representative bodies, which were also added in profusion.\n\nIn the same year, he criticised \"anti-authoritarian socialists\", again referring to the methods of the Paris Commune: \n\nMarx's attention to the Paris Commune placed the commune in the centre of later Marxist forms.\n\nThis statement was written in \"Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League\", which is credited to Marx and Engels: \n\nIn the 20th century, Vladimir Lenin developed Leninism—the adaptation of Marxism to the socio-economic and political conditions of Imperial Russia (1721–1917). This body of theory later became the official ideology of some Communist states.\n\n\"The State and Revolution\" (1917) explicitly discusses the practical implementation of \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" through means of violent revolution. Lenin denies any reformist interpretations of Marxism, such as the one of Karl Kautsky's. Lenin especially focused on Engels' phrase of the state \"withering away\", denying that it could apply to \"bourgeois state\" and highlighting that Engels work is mostly \"panegyric on violent revolution\". Based on these arguments, he denounces reformists as \"opportunistic\", reactionary and points out the red terror as the only method of introducing dictatorship of the proletariat compliant with Marx and Engels work.\n\nIn Imperial Russia, the Paris Commune model form of government was realised in the soviets (councils of workers and soldiers) established in the Russian Revolution of 1905, whose revolutionary task was deposing the capitalist (monarchical) state to establish socialism—the dictatorship of the proletariat—the stage preceding communism.\n\nIn Russia, the Bolshevik Party (described by Lenin as the \"vanguard of the proletariat\") elevated the soviets to power in the October Revolution of 1917. Throughout 1917, Lenin argued that the Russian Provisional Government was unrepresentative of the proletariat's interests because in his estimation they represented the \"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\". He argued that because they continually put off democratic elections, they denied the prominence of the democratically constituted soviets and all the promises made by liberal bourgeois parties prior to the February Revolution remained unfulfilled, the soviets would need to take power for themselves.\n\nLenin argued that in an underdeveloped country such as Russia the capitalist class would remain a threat even after a successful socialist revolution. As a result, he advocated the repression of those elements of the capitalist class that took up arms against the new soviet government, writing that as long as classes existed a state would need to exist to exercise the democratic rule of one class (in his view, the working class) over the other (the capitalist class). He said: \n\nThe use of violence, terror and rule of single communist party was criticised by Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg and Mikhail Bakunin. In response, Lenin accused Kautsky of being a \"renegade\" and \"liberal\" and these socialist movements that did not support the Bolshevik party line were condemned by the Communist International and called social fascism.\n\nSoviet democracy granted voting rights to the majority of the populace who elected the local soviets, who elected the regional soviets and so on until electing the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Capitalists were disenfranchised in the Russian soviet model. However, according to Lenin in a developed country it would be possible to dispense with the disenfranchisement of capitalists within the democratic proletarian dictatorship as the proletariat would be guaranteed of an overwhelming majority.\n\nThe Bolsheviks in 1917–1924 did not claim to have achieved a communist society. In contrast the preamble to the 1977 Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (the \"Brezhnev Constitution\"), stated that the 1917 Revolution established the dictatorship of the proletariat as \"a society of true democracy\" and that \"the supreme goal of the Soviet state is the building of a classless, communist society in which there will be public, communist self-government\".\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War (1918–1922), all the major opposition parties either took up arms against the new Soviet government, took part in sabotage, collaboration with the deposed Tsarists, or made assassination attempts against Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. When opposition parties such as the Cadets and Mensheviks were democratically elected to the Soviets in some areas, they proceeded to use their mandate to welcome in Tsarist and foreign capitalist military forces. In one incident in Baku, the British military, once invited in, proceeded to execute members of the Bolshevik Party (who had peacefully stood down from the Soviet when they failed to win the elections). As a result, the Bolsheviks banned each opposition party when it turned against the Soviet government. In some cases, bans were lifted. This banning of parties did not have the same repressive character as later bans under Stalin would.\n\nInternally, Lenin's critics argued that such political suppression always was his plan. Supporters argued that the reactionary civil war of the foreign-sponsored White movement required it—given Fanya Kaplan's unsuccessful assassination of Lenin on 30 August 1918 and the successful assassination of Moisei Uritsky the same day.\n\nAfter 1919, the Soviets had ceased to function as organs of democratic rule as the famine induced by forced grain requisitions led to the Soviets emptying out of ordinary people. Half the population of Moscow and a third of Petrograd had by this stage fled to the countryside to find food and political life ground to a halt.\n\nThe Bolsheviks became concerned that under these conditions—the absence of mass participation in political life and the banning of opposition parties—counter-revolutionary forces would express themselves within the Bolshevik Party itself (some evidence existed for this in the mass of ex opposition party members who signed up for Bolshevik membership immediately after the end of the Civil War).\n\nDespite the principle of democratic centralism in the Bolshevik Party, internal factions were banned. This was considered an extreme measure and did not fall within Marxist doctrine. The ban remained until the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991. In 1921, vigorous internal debate and freedom of opinion were still present within Russia and the beginnings of censorship and mass political repression had not yet emerged. For example, the Workers Opposition faction continued to operate despite being nominally dissolved. The debates of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued to be published until 1923.\n\nElements of the later censorship and attacks on political expression would appear during Lenin's illness and after his death, when members of the future Stalinist clique clamped down on party democracy among the Georgian Bolsheviks and began to censor material. \"Pravda\" ceased publishing the opinions of political oppositions after 1924 and at the same time, the ruling clique (Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Joseph Stalin) admitted large numbers of new members into the party in order to shout down the voices of oppositionists at party meetings, severely curtailing internal debate. Their policies were partly directed by the interests of the new bureaucracy that had accumulated a great deal of social weight in the absence of an active participation in politics by the majority of people. By 1927, many supporters of the Left Opposition began to face political repression and Leon Trotsky was exiled.\n\nSome modern critics of the concept of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\"—including various anti-communists, libertarian Marxists, anarcho-communists and anti-Stalinist communists and socialists—argue that the Stalinist Soviet Union and other Stalinist countries used the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" to justify the monopolisation of political power by a new ruling layer of bureaucrats, derived partly from the old Tsarist bureaucracy and partly created by the impoverished condition of Russia.\n\nHowever, the rising Stalinist clique rested on other grounds for political legitimacy rather than a confusion between the modern and Marxist use of the term \"dictatorship\". Rather, they took the line that since they were the vanguard of the proletariat, their right to rule could not be legitimately questioned. Hence, opposition parties could not be permitted to exist. From 1936 onward, Stalinist-inspired state constitutions enshrined this concept by giving the various communist parties a \"leading role\" in society—a provision that was interpreted to either ban other parties altogether or force them to accept the Stalinists guaranteed right to rule as a condition of being allowed to exist.\n\nThis justification was adopted by subsequent communist parties that built upon the Stalinist model, such as the ones in China, North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba (initially the 26th of July Movement).\n\nAt the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev declared an end to the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" and the establishment of the \"all people's government\".\n\n\n"}

Although intended as temporary legislation, the Act \"proved in the long run the most important turning-point in American immigration policy\" because it added two new features to American immigration law: numerical limits on immigration and the use of a system for establishing those limits. These limits came to be known as the National Origins Formula.\n\nThe Emergency Quota Act restricted the number of immigrants admitted from any country annually to 3% of the number of residents from that same country living in the United States as of the U.S. Census of 1910. This meant that people from northern European countries had a higher quota and were more likely to be admitted to the U.S. than people from eastern Europe, southern Europe, or other, non-European countries. Professionals were to be admitted without regard to their country of origin. The Act set no limits on immigration from Latin America. The act did not apply to countries with bilateral agreements with the US, or to Asian countries listed in the Immigration Act of 1917, known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act. However, the Act was not seen as restrictive enough since millions of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe had come into the USA since 1890. The Immigration Act of 1924 reduced the Quota to 2% per the Census of 1890 when a fairly small percentage of the population was from the regions regarded as less than desirable. \n\nBased on that formula, the number of new immigrants admitted fell from 805,228 in 1920 to 309,556 in 1921-22. The average annual inflow of immigrants prior to 1921 was 175,983 from Northern and Western Europe, and 685,531 from other countries, principally Southern and Eastern Europe. In 1921, there was a drastic reduction in immigration levels from other countries, principally Southern and Eastern Europe.\n\nFollowing the end of World War I, both Europe and the United States were experiencing economic and social upheaval. In Europe, the destruction of the war, the Russian Revolution, and the dissolution of both the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Ottoman Empire led to greater immigration to the United States, while in the United States an economic downturn following post-war demobilization increased unemployment. The combination of increased immigration from Europe at the time of higher American unemployment strengthened the anti-immigrant movement.\n\nThe act, sponsored by Rep. Albert Johnson (R-Washington), was passed without a recorded vote in the U.S. House of Representatives and by a vote of 90-2-4 in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe Act was revised by the Immigration Act of 1924.\n\nThe use of such a National Origins Formula continued until 1965 when the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 replaced it with a system of preferences based on immigrants' skills and family relationships with U.S. citizens or U.S. residents.\n\n\n\n"}

The goal is to ridicule U.S. President Donald Trump, especially his inaugural statement that \"From this day forward, it's gonna be only America \"first\"! America \"first\"!\" by introducing one's own country with a dose of self-deprecating humour and requesting to become 'second' after America.\n\nThe contest was inspired by Dutch comedian Arjen Lubach's show \"Zondag met Lubach\", which broadcast the parody video \"The Netherlands welcomes Trump in his own words\" on 22 January 2017. In the video, Trump's speeches and actions –mostly from his election campaign– are imitated and mocked by voice actor Greg Shapiro, who gives a short description of the Netherlands using some self-mockery as well, finishing with the request that the Netherlands may come 'second' if America is to be 'first'. A semi-serious undertone is formed by fears that Trump's announced \"America First\" policy signifies isolationism, including withdrawing U.S. support for NATO: \"If you screw NATO, you're gonna make our problems great again.\" The video went viral, being discussed by multiple international newsmedia and reaching over 73 million views worldwide by 3 February.\n\nOn 2 February during \"Neo Magazin Royale\", Böhmermann challenged the Dutch's second place, broadcasting a rival video that claimed 'Germany second' whilst making fun of the Netherlands and Germany itself as well. Then, he encouraged other satirical talkshow producers in all European countries to make similar videos parodying Trump, themselves and challenging the Netherlands' second place behind America. Production teams in at least eleven other countries committed to making their own parody videos, and by 3 February, versions for Belgium (by \"De Ideale Wereld\"), Switzerland (by \"Deville Late Night\"), Denmark (by \"Natholdet\"), Portugal (by \"5 Para A Meia-Noite\") and Lithuania (by \"Laikykitės ten\") had been released; these would all be gathered on the website everysecondcounts.eu. Many of the videos are narrated by voice actor Shaun Streeter, with the exception of the Chinese and Japanese versions.\n\nBy 6 February, Italy (by \"Casa Surace\"), Luxembourg (by \"Studio Ben\"), and Morocco (a non-European country, expanding the contest further) had joined the fray. On 8 February, the website of Every Second Counts changed the original layout from a virtual 360° NATO council room with national flags of all European countries plus Morocco and Namibia next to each seat, to a clickable world map divided into the continents of \"Europe\", \"Middle East\", \"Africa\", \"Oceania\", \"North Asia\", \"South Asia\", \"North America\" and \"South America\", with \"North Asia\" and \"North America\" currently being unavailable.\n\nThough widely varying in contents specific to each country's presentation, and the way in which they criticise and/or ridicule President Trump and his ideas and actions, the videos often share common elements. Many revolve around (sarcastically) taking pride in or mocking their own country's history, and comparing it to Trump's actions or American history in general, and how the latter is better, equal or worse.\n\nThis list only includes those parody videos mentioned on everysecondcounts.eu. Several unofficial videos have also been made by individuals or groups not connected to \"Neo Magazin Royale\". These often feature non-European countries or subnational regions within European countries.\n\n\n"}

It was ideologically aligned with the Situationist International, an avant-garde revolutionary movement. The Situationists, whose intellectual foundations were derived primarily from libertarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century (particularly Dada and Surrealism), initially put its emphasis on concepts like unitary urbanism and psychogeography. Gradually the focus moved more towards revolutionary and political theory. Much like the main organ of that particular ideological current, the Situationist International, the Golden Fleet had its heyday around the protests of 1968, gradually disappearing by the first years of the 1970s.\n\nExtremely little is known about the Golden Fleet, yet still it became notorious, this to such an extent that it has been labelled \"legendary\". Nothing is known about its establishment, composition, and disestablishment. The name was most likely taken from an art exhibit in Denmark by the Situationist Jeppesen Victor Martin, which consisted of geopolitical paintings featuring coastlines, strategic arrows and toy battleships sprayed over with metallic paint. The group was centered in the capital Stockholm, although some members appear to have been from Gothenburg. It is primarily notable through the fact that its members were those that introduced situationist writings to Sweden by its brief but hectic work with publishing political texts. Among them were \"Instruktion i vapendragning\" in 1970 (a translation of \"Instructions for an Insurrection\", originally published 1961), as well as longer translations of texts by Guy Debord and Raoul Vaneigem among others.\n\nThe group also produced a number of works on its own, prominent among them the poster \"Hang the Stalinists High\" (, on the subject of the contemporary left-wing) and the brochure \"King Gustaf's Sardines\" () which discussed the \"meaningful meaninglessness of the Swedish students\".

National Olympic Committees are often concerned with high performance sport, including the funding of athletes likely to win Olympic medals. In public policy, funding for high performance sport may be justified for reasons of national prestige or as a marketing tool for encouraging mass sport.

{"id": "38719819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38719819", "title": "International Association of Women Police", "text": "International Association of Women Police\n\nThe International Association of Women Police (IAWP) is a global organization for women in criminal justice professions. Its mission is to \"strengthen, unite and raise the profile of women in criminal justice internationally.\"\n\nAccording to the IAWP website, its mission, as stated in Article III, is to “strengthen, unite and raise the profile of women in criminal justice internationally”. Its vision is to ensure that “women’s lives [are] free from discrimination, valued for their contribution, and treated with respect and dignity. To contribute by being an example of excellence in securing a safe, harmonious workplace and society as partners in safety in the criminal justice system”. These core beliefs and objectives encompass the main message of the International Association of Women Police, and focus on standing up for the equal treatment that each woman on the police force deserves.\n\nThe International Policewomen's Association was founded in 1915. Alice Stebbins Wells, the first policewoman in the United States, was appointed the association's first president. Its charter was adopted in 1916 in Washington, D.C. From 1919–1932, the president of the association was Mina Van Winkle. After her death, the association dwindled. It was not until 1956 that the association was revived at a meeting of the Women Peace Officers of California, where it was renamed the International Association of Women Police. Lois Higgins, a veteran of the Chicago Police Department, was elected the association's president, and under her leadership the IAWP grew in strength and numbers. The organization fought discrimination against women in the police force and opposed separate women’s bureaus within police departments.\n\nThe Records of the International Association of Women Police are housed in the Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections, John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nAs Stated in its Mission and Vision Statements, The International Association of Women Police came to be in order to fight against the discrimination of women on police forces across the world. Fighting against cases of sexual harassment, limited job opportunities, and discriminatory treatment from male colleagues have all been key reasons for catalyzing the formation of an organization that promotes the equal treatment of women on the police force. The IAWP also works to ensure that women are satisfied with their careers on the force, and to make sure they do not feel powerless or unappreciated in their line of work. Overall, the IAWP was formed in order to promote equality among the sexes in the police force and to ensure the equal treatment, equal pay, and equal protection of women who chose a career in the criminal justice system.\nThe IAWP promotes the idea that female officers should not live in fear of harassment, and should be treated with respect and fairness from each of their coworkers. The members of this organization work to deconstruct the social stigmas that follow women on to the police force. Sanda K. Wells and Betty L. Alt discuss the many forms of harassment in their book “Police Women: Life With a Badge. They discuss how one of the most common occurrences on the force is the issue of harassment. Sexual harassment and a hostile environment are most commonly dealt with. Wells and Alt go on the define the forms of harassment; sexual harassment encompasses unwanted sexual advances such as requesting sexual acts, or promising a promotion or pay raise in return for a sexual favor. A hostile environment involves any act that unwanted and may have a negative effect on the person being acted against and their job performance. This may be in the form of offensive or rude remarks about a person’s body or gender. According to their book, anyone is capable of harassment; it is not limited to just men harassing women. Other forms of harassment involve inappropriate touching, remarks about one’s body, and offensive remarks that degrade the individual. According to Women and Policing News Wire, 80 percent of women on the police force have encountered or been a victim of harassment on the job. Wells and Alt go on to say that few women feel the need to report the colleagues that harass them and usually let the harassment slide, due to the fact that many women who report their harassment end up being accused of various crimes such as drug abuse, child abuse, receive death threats, and fail to receive backup when they call for it. ”\n\nOne of the main goals that the IAWP prides itself on is the abolishment of discrimination of women on the police force. One of the main forms of discrimination, as discussed in Well’s and Alt’s book “Police Women: Life With a Badge” is gender harassment. For example, not being provided a separate place from men in order to change into the work uniform is defined as a form of discrimination. One case mentioned encompasses a women officer who that had been on the force for years was not given a locker or changing space, yet a rookie male cop who had just joined the force was given a locker as soon as he entered the police force. This is means for investigation on the discrimination that women face. “Police Women: Life With a Badge” also goes on to talk about women police officers that become pregnant during their time on the force. Not being given lighter duties due to pregnancy is also an issue that some policewomen must face. Pregnancy may hinder movement and other physical activity on the job, and not being given enough time to recuperate after having a child may result in a decrease in job performance. Because of this, some employees see this as grounds to discriminate against pregnant coworkers, and some agencies fail to provide basic rights such as maternity uniforms or leave benefits for these police women.\n\nThe IAWP prides itself on equality, and ensuring that women are presented equal opportunities in their career is one of its many focusses. An issue discussed in “Police Women: Life With a Badge” are the limited job opportunities that may follow women through the criminal justice career path. For example, a women may only be given duties involving child abuse, sex crimes, and domestic abuse and not be given the chance to participate in more intensive cases that are deemed “more masculine” such as gang related violence or murder. Women may also not be given the same opportunities as men when it comes to issues such as promotions and chances to further themselves in the criminal justice career. Forms of discipline also seem to have inequalities on the police force; where a woman may receive punishment, a man seems to receive none. Women are also dealt harsher punishments than men on the police force. There is also the concern that women are held to a different standard than men on the job. There are different expectations for women to fulfill on performance evaluations and are expected to perform differently overall than men, and not fulfilling these expectations may hinder them from having a successful career. Lastly, women tend to not receive equal consideration for special training and important assignments as men. While a male officer may be asked to go on a special assignment, a female officer may be forced to handle less serious matters.\n\nAll across the world, efforts are being made to ensure the equal treatment of women is being reached. This is especially noticeable in countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria, and Catalonia. For the most part few women participate in policing in Europe, and still have a difficult time receiving the same treatment as men, however, according to Tanja Van Der Lippe, Anne Graumans, and Selma Sevenhuijsen, authors of “Gender Policies and the Position of Women in the Police Force in European Countries,” inequalities may still exist now, but at the rate of how things are changing, it is more than possible to change the social norms that have been engrained into the minds of people on the police force. The IAWP has an intense focus on this area, and works to promote fairness amongst both men and women that hold careers in the criminal justice system.\n\nWomen police offices have also been subject to one form or police work that has been deemed questionable by many: prostitution stings. According to Mary Dodge, Donna Starr-Gimeno, and Thomas Williams, authors of “Puttin’ on the Sting: Women Police Officers' Perspectives on Reverse Prostitution Assignments,” prostitution stings may both endanger the lives of women officers or may degrade them. This journal article mentions how women who take up this position may be objectified by male coworkers. It also offers important insight as to how sting operations may endanger and humiliate women, while men who participate in such operations do not face these consequences. Many police women feel as if they are being used for their bodies, and feel repulsed by the idea that they are acting as nothing more than an object in order to detain a man that is willing to pay for sex. There is also a sense of humiliation that goes along with this process; if the police woman is approached by a man willing to pay for sexual favors, that in itself may feel wrong and inappropriate to some women. However, on the opposite end of the spectrum, if a police woman is not approached or asked for her services, her colleagues may make fun of her for not being able to pick anyone up.\n\nThe discrimination and harassment that may follow some women police offices often leads to many detrimental effects. One of these is strain and stress that is encountered on the job. Not only does unequal treatment lead to stress, but a job on the police force in general may be stressful. According to Leanor Johnson, author of “Job Strain Among Police Officers: Gender Comparisons,” women may begin to feel so stressed from the job that they begin to feel burned out and useless; they feel as if they are not making a difference in the world. Men on the other hand begin to treat citizens as with disrespect and disregard them entirely. While both men and women may handle stress in various ways, there may be some benefits coming from this. Each gender handles the different emotional stresses that may be encountered on the job, thus allowing a wide range of ways in which handling crime can be dealt with. The IAWP makes it known that women are quite capable of handling various difficulties that will appear on the job, and though stress may be difficult to manage, it is not impossible.\n\nIn recent years, women on the police force have been found to have positive effects on society as a whole. TIME Magazine goes on to talk about the recent hiring of women police officers in Mexico City, and provides insight given from police chief Carlos Ortega Carpinteyro: “women are more trustworthy and take their oath of office more seriously, they don’t ask for or take bribes.” This goes on to show how women are making vital contributions in developing countries and how the police force is only becoming stronger due to the number of women that dedicate their lives to the criminal justice system. By incorporating women into the police force and acknowledging the fact that they can make a difference, the IAWP is fulfilling its duty of ensuring that women are being given the equal opportunity to work just as much as men in the criminal justice system. Barbara Sims, Kathryn E. Scarborough and Janice Ahmad also have quite a bit to say about this topic. These authors of “The Relationship between Police Officers' Attitudes Toward Women and Perceptions of Police” go on to say that if women are fully appreciated on the police force, then the benefit of society is sure to follow. Fighting sexism would, overall, promote the growth and success of society.\n\nThe IAWP’s main goal is to empower women all across the world. One way women are able to do this is by working their way up to important roles on the police force such as sheriff or police chief. In the book “Breaking the Brass Ceiling: Women Police Chiefs and Their Way to the Top,” author Dorothy Moses Shulz discusses the struggles that women are faced with in order to reach the top in their criminal justice career. Difficulties such as sexism and lack of faith in their abilities may hinder some women from attempting to have careers in these positions. Though the journey may be difficult for women in this field, Shulz goes on to say that it is definitely not impossible for a women to reach the top of this career path.\n\nIn the organization’s recent years, the number of women joining the IAWP has grown, and has not just been limited to women. Men that support the rights of women on the police force have also been taking part in the IAWP, and since 1976 male officers have been a part of this organization. In order to spread the word of this group, there have been numerous conferences at various universities and other professional organizations in order to promote the growth and development of the IAWP. These conferences have sparked the attention of many different experts in the field of criminal justice, as well as increase awareness of women working to further themselves in this field. Due to the dramatic increase in female members in the criminal justice system, the IAWP has only become more influential and helpful in promoting women across international borders.\n\nThe IAWP holds annual training conferences in major international cities, featuring invited speakers and exhibitors.\n\nThe association offers an international scholarship under the IAWP Scholarship Program. An officer outside of the United States is selected to attend the Annual Training Conference at no expense to the Officer or her police organization. The IAWP also offers prestigious international awards in policing under the IAWP Awards Program. Nominations for each of the categories are solicited and awarded annually on an international basis. The International Association of Women Police is the only non-profit organization to offer international recognition for women in the law enforcement professions.\n\nThe IAWP has a total of 26 regions where there are coordinators for people to contact. Within each region there is at least one coordinator's email linked onto the official IAWP website. There are coordinators in various states of the US, and all throughout Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. To find a coordinator closest to any region/location an individual may find thelist on the IAWP official website.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "193600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193600", "title": "Jay Treaty", "text": "Jay Treaty\n\nThe Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, Between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, commonly known as the Jay Treaty, and also as Jay's Treaty, was a 1795 treaty between the United States and Great Britain that averted war, resolved issues remaining since the Treaty of Paris of 1783 (which ended the American Revolutionary War), and facilitated ten years of peaceful trade between the United States and Britain in the midst of the French Revolutionary Wars, which began in 1792. The Treaty was designed by Alexander Hamilton and supported by President George Washington. It angered France and bitterly divided Americans. It inflamed the new growth of two opposing parties in every state, the pro-Treaty Federalists and the anti-Treaty Democratic Republicans.\n\nThe Treaty was negotiated by John Jay and gained many of the primary American goals. This included the withdrawal of British Army units from forts in the Northwest Territory that it had refused to relinquish under the Paris Peace Treaty. The British were retaliating for the United States reneging on Articles 4 and 6 of the 1783 treaty; American state courts impeded the collection of debts owed British creditors and upheld the continued confiscation of Loyalist estates in spite of an explicit understanding that the prosecutions would be immediately discontinued. The parties agreed that disputes over wartime debts and the American–Canadian boundary were to be sent to arbitration—one of the first major uses of arbitration in modern diplomatic history. This set a precedent used by other nations. The Americans were granted limited rights to trade with British colonies in the Caribbean in exchange for some limits on the American export of cotton.\n\nThe Jay treaty was signed on November 19, 1794, and submitted to the United States Senate for its advice and consent the following June. It was ratified by the Senate on June 24, 1795 by a two-thirds majority vote of 20–10 (the exact number necessary for concurrence). It was also ratified by the British government, and took effect February 29, 1796, the day when ratifications were officially exchanged.\n\nThe treaty was hotly contested by Jeffersonians in each state. An effort was made to block it in the House, which ultimately failed. The Jeffersonians feared that closer economic or political ties with Great Britain would strengthen Hamilton's Federalist Party, promote aristocracy, and undercut republicanism. This debate crystallized the emerging partisan divisions and shaped the new \"First Party System\", with the Federalists favoring the British and the Jeffersonian republicans favoring France. The treaty was for ten years' duration. Efforts failed to agree on a replacement treaty in 1806 when Jefferson rejected the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty, as tensions escalated toward the War of 1812.\n\nThe outbreak of war between France and Great Britain (and other countries) in 1793 ended the long peace that had enabled the new nation to flourish in terms of trade and finance. The United States now emerged as an important neutral country with a large shipping trade. From the British perspective, improving relations with the United States was a high priority lest it move into the French orbit. British negotiators ignored elements that wanted harsher terms in order to get a suitable treaty. From the American viewpoint, the most pressing foreign policy issues were normalizing the trade relations with Britain, the United States' leading trading partner, and resolving issues left over from the Treaty of Paris. As one observer explained, the British government was \"well disposed to America. ... They have made their arrangements upon a plan that comprehends the neutrality of the United States, and are anxious that it should be preserved.\"\n\nWithout warning American officials, the British government used the Royal Navy to capture nearly 250 neutral American merchant ships carrying goods from French colonies in the West Indies. Americans were outraged and Republicans in Jefferson's coalition demanded a declaration of war, but James Madison instead called for an embargo on trade with Britain. British officials told First Nations near the Canada–U.S. border that the border no longer existed and sold weapons to them. Congress voted for a trade embargo against Britain in March 1794.\n\nAt the national level American politics was divided between the factions of Jefferson and Madison, which favored the French, and the Federalists led by Hamilton, who saw Britain as a natural ally and thus sought to normalize relations with Britain, especially in the area of trade. Washington sided with Hamilton. Hamilton devised a framework for negotiations, and President George Washington sent Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Jay to London to negotiate a comprehensive treaty.\n\nThe American government had several outstanding issues: \n\nBoth sides achieved many objectives. Several issues were sent to arbitration, which (after years of discussion) were resolved amicably mostly in favor of the U.S. Britain paid $11,650,000 for damages to American shipping and received £600,000 for unpaid pre-1775 debts. While international arbitration was not entirely unknown, the Jay Treaty gave it a strong impetus and is generally taken as the start of modern international arbitration.\n\nThe British agreed to vacate its forts in United States territory—six in the Great Lakes region and two at the north end of Lake Champlain—by June 1796; which was done. They were:\nThe treaty was \"surprisingly generous\" in allowing Americans to trade with Great Britain on a most-favored-nation basis. In return, the United States gave most favored nation trading status to Britain, and acquiesced in British anti-French maritime policies. American merchants obtained limited rights to trade in the British West Indies. Two joint boundary commissions were set up to establish the boundary line in the Northeast (it agreed on one) and in the Northwest (this commission never met and the boundary was settled after the War of 1812).\n\nJay, a strong opponent of slavery, dropped the issue of compensation for slaves, which angered Southern slaveholders and was used as a target for attacks by Jeffersonians. Jay was unsuccessful in negotiating an end to the impressment of American sailors into the Royal Navy, which later became a key issue leading to the War of 1812.\n\nArticle III states, \"It is agreed, that it shall at all times be free to His Majesty's subjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and also to the Indians dwelling on either side of the said boundary line, freely to pass and repass, by land or inland navigation into the respective territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America, (the country within the limits of the Hudson's Bay Company only excepted) ... and freely carry on trade and commerce with each other.\" Article III of the Jay Treaty declared the right of Indians, American citizens, and Canadian subjects to trade and travel between the United States and Canada, which was then a territory of Great Britain. Over the years since, the United States has codified this obligation in the provisions of Section 289 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and as amended in 1965. As a result of the Jay Treaty, \"Native Indians born in Canada are therefore entitled to enter the United States for the purpose of employment, study, retirement, investing, and/or immigration\". Article III of the Jay Treaty is the basis of most Indian claims.\n\nWashington submitted the treaty to the United States Senate for its consent in June 1795; a two-thirds vote was needed. The treaty was unpopular at first and gave the Jeffersonians a platform to rally new supporters. As historian Paul Varg explains,\n\nThe Jay Treaty was a reasonable give-and-take compromise of the issues between the two countries. What rendered it so assailable was not the compromise spelled out between the two nations but the fact that it was not a compromise between the two political parties at home. Embodying the views of the Federalists, the treaty repudiated the foreign policy of the opposing party.\n\nThe Jeffersonians were opposed to Britain, preferring support for France in the wars raging in Europe, and they argued that the treaty with France from 1778 was still in effect. They considered Britain as the center of aristocracy and the chief threat to the United States' Republican values. They denounced Hamilton and Jay (and even Washington) as monarchists who betrayed American values. They organized public protests against Jay and his treaty; one of their rallying cries said: \"Damn John Jay! Damn everyone that won't damn John Jay! Damn every one that won't put lights in his window and sit up all night damning John Jay!\"\n\nThe treaty was one of the major catalysts for the advent of the First Party System in the United States by further dividing the two major political factions within the country. The Federalist Party, led by Hamilton, supported the treaty. On the contrary, the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Jefferson and Madison, opposed it. Jefferson and his supporters had a counter-proposal to establish \"a direct system of commercial hostility with Great Britain,\" even at the risk of war. The Jeffersonians raised public opinion to fever pitch by accusing the British of promoting Indian atrocities on the frontier. The fierce debates over the Treaty in 1794–95, according to one historian, \"transformed the Republican movement into a Republican party.\" To fight the treaty, the Jeffersonians \"established coordination in activity between leaders at the capital, and leaders, actives and popular followings in the states, counties and towns.\" Jay's failure to obtain compensation for \"lost\" slaves galvanized the South into opposition.\n\nThe Federalists fought back and Congress rejected the Jefferson–Madison counter-proposals. Washington threw his great prestige behind the treaty, and Federalists rallied public opinion more effectively than did their opponents. Hamilton convinced President Washington that it was the best treaty that could be expected. Washington insisted that the U.S. must remain neutral in the European wars; he signed it, and his prestige carried the day in Congress. The Federalists made a strong, systematic appeal to public opinion, which rallied their own supporters and shifted the debate. Washington and Hamilton outmaneuvered Madison, who was opposition leader. Hamilton by then was out of the government, and he was the dominant figure who helped secure the treaty's approval by the needed 2/3 vote in the Senate. The Senate passed a resolution in June, advising the President to amend the treaty by suspending the 12th article, which concerned trade between the U.S. and the West Indies. In mid-August, the Senate ratified the treaty 20–10, with the condition that the treaty contain specific language regarding the June 24 resolution. President Washington signed it in late August. The Treaty was proclaimed in effect on February 29, 1796 and the House funded it in April 1796, in a series of close votes and after another bitter fight.\n\nJames Madison, then a member of the House of Representatives, argued that the treaty could not, under Constitutional law, take effect without approval of the House, since it regulated commerce and exercised legislative powers granted to Congress. The debate which followed was an early example of originalism, in which Madison, the \"Father of the Constitution,\" lost. One interesting feature of this nationwide constitutional debate was an advisory opinion on the subject written by Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth, in which he rejected any alleged right of the House of Representatives to decide upon the merits of the treaty. After defeat on the treaty in Congress, the Jeffersonian Republicans lost the 1796 presidential election on the issue.\n\nWhen Thomas Jefferson became president in 1801, he did not repudiate the treaty. He kept the Federalist minister, Rufus King, in London to negotiate a successful resolution to outstanding issues regarding cash payments and boundaries. The amity broke down when the treaty expired in 1805. Jefferson rejected a renewal of the Jay Treaty in the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty of 1806 as negotiated by his diplomats and agreed to by London. Relations turned increasingly hostile as a prelude to the War of 1812. In 1815, the Treaty of Ghent superseded the Jay treaty.\n\nHistorians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick note that, in conventional diplomatic terms and as a \"piece of adversary bargaining\", Jay \"got much the worst of the 'bargain'. Such a view has to a great degree persisted ever since.\" They conclude that Jay did not succeed in asserting neutral rights, but he did obtain \"his other \"sine qua nons\"\"; he got none of things that were \"desirable, but not indispensable.\" They add that Jay's record on the symbolic side was open to many objections. However, on the \"hard\" (or realistic) side, \"it was a substantial success, which included the prevention of war with Great Britain.\"\n\nHistorian Marshall Smelser argues that the treaty effectively postponed war with Britain, or at least postponed it until the United States was strong enough to handle it.\n\nBradford Perkins argued in 1955 that the treaty was the first to establish a special relationship between Britain and the United States, with a second installment under Lord Salisbury. In his view, the treaty worked for ten years to secure peace between Britain and America: \"The decade may be characterized as the period of 'The First Rapprochement.'\" As Perkins concludes,\n\nFor about ten years there was peace on the frontier, joint recognition of the value of commercial intercourse, and even, by comparison with both preceding and succeeding epochs, a muting of strife over ship seizures and impressment. Two controversies with France ... pushed the English-speaking powers even more closely together.\n\nStarting at swords' point in 1794, the Jay treaty reversed the tensions, Perkins concludes: \"Through a decade of world war and peace, successive governments on both sides of the Atlantic were able to bring about and preserve a cordiality which often approached genuine friendship.\" Perkins suggests that, except perhaps the opening of trade with British India, \"Jay did fail to win anything the Americans were not obviously entitled to, liberation of territory recognized as theirs since 1782, and compensation for seizures that even Britain admitted were illegal\". He also speculates that a \"more astute negotiator than the Chief Justice\" would have gotten better terms than he did. He quoted the opinion of \"great historian\" Henry Adams that the treaty was a \"bad one\":\n\nNo one would venture on its merits to defend it now. There has been no time since 1810 when the United States would not prefer war to peace on such terms.\n\nPerkins gave more weight than other historians to valuable concessions regarding trade in India and the concession on the West Indies trade. In addition, Perkins noted that the Royal Navy treated American commerce with \"relative leniency\" during the wars, and many impressed seamen were returned to America. As Spain assessed the informal British-American alliance, it softened its previous opposition to the United States' use of the Mississippi River and signed Pinckney's Treaty, which the Americans wanted. When Jefferson took office, he gained renewal of the commercial articles that had greatly benefited American shipping.\n\nElkins and McKitrick find this more positive view open to \"one big difficulty\": it requires that the British negotiated in the same spirit. Unlike Perkins, they find \"little indication of this\".\n\nGeorge Herring's 2008 history of US foreign policy says that, in 1794, \"the United States and Britain edged toward war\" and concludes, \"The Jay Treaty brought the United States important concessions and served its interests well.\" Joseph Ellis finds the terms of the treaty \"one-sided in Britain's favor,\" but asserts with a consensus of historians that it was\n\na shrewd bargain for the United States. It bet, in effect, on England rather than France as the hegemonic European power of the future, which proved prophetic. It recognized the massive dependence of the American economy on trade with England. In a sense it was a precocious preview of the Monroe Doctrine (1823), for it linked American security and economic development to the British fleet, which provided a protective shield of incalculable value throughout the nineteenth century. Mostly, it postponed war with England until America was economically and politically more capable of fighting one.\nIn the HBO miniseries \"John Adams\", Vice President John Adams is shown casting the tiebreaker vote in favor of ratifying the Jay Treaty. In reality, his vote was never required as the Senate passed the resolution by 20-10. Furthermore, the Vice President would never be required to cast a vote in a treaty ratification, because the Vice President votes only in case of a tie, and Article II of the Constitution requires that treaties receive a two-thirds vote for approval.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2054729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054729", "title": "Legacy preferences", "text": "Legacy preferences\n\nLegacy preference or legacy admission is a preference given by an institution or organization to certain applicants on the basis of their familial relationship to alumni of that institution, with college admissions being the field in which legacy preferences are most controversially used. (Students so admitted are referred to as legacies or legacy students.) Legacy admissions are almost wholly confined to colleges and universities in the United States and are virtually unheard of in post-secondary institutions in other countries around the world. Legacy preferences in elite college and university admissions in the U.S. are widespread: almost three-quarters of research universities and nearly all liberal arts colleges grant legacy preferences in admissions. Schools vary in how broadly they extend legacy preferences, with some schools granting this favor only to children of undergraduate alumni, while other schools extend the favor to children, grandchildren, siblings, nephews, and nieces of alumni of undergraduate and graduate programs. Preferential treatment based on legacy routinely grants legacies substantial bonus points on their admissions assessments and extra consideration if their applications are initially rejected. As a body of entering freshmen, legacies almost invariably have substantially lower GPAs and SAT scores than the larger body of entering freshmen, and, during their undergraduate careers, legacies as a body of students typically perform worse than the overall student body. A 2005 analysis of 180,000 student records obtained from nineteen selective colleges and universities found that, within a set range of SAT scores, being a legacy raised an applicant's chances of admission by 19.7 percentage points.\n\nWhile the sons of wealthy Americans had received priority in college admissions throughout the nineteenth century, in the early twentieth century, frustrated by the poor academic performances of their students, elite colleges raised their admission standards. Immigrants—especially the children of Jewish immigrant families—and Catholics and people from modest socioeconomic backgrounds frequently performed well on the new admissions tests and started to garner large numbers of undergraduate seats at top universities, while the number of admissions for wealthy white Anglo-American stock dropped significantly. In response, several Ivy League institutions began an official practice of legacy admissions, designed to reserve large numbers of seats at the top schools for the sons of wealthy Protestant American stock. These legacy admissions included decreasing the importance of entrance exams and adding such elements as assessing the \"personal characteristics\" of the young men seeking admittance, considering their \"home influence,\" interviewing some of the applicants, and asking for letters of recommendation attesting to their character. Such elements in the application process curtailed the admittance of immigrants, Jews, Catholics, and working-class men and restored the overwhelming presence of the white, wealthy Anglo-Protestant men.\n\nA 1992 survey found that of the top seventy-five universities in the \"U.S. News & World Report\" rankings, only one (the California Institute of Technology) had no legacy preferences at all; however, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also indicates that it does not consider an applicant's legacy status. Legacy preferences were also ubiquitous among the one hundred top-ranked liberal arts colleges. The only liberal arts college in the top one hundred that explicitly said it did not use legacy preferences was Berea. In recent decades, the use of legacy preferences has expanded well beyond undergraduate studies and now include admissions to graduate schools and professional fields of study, including law schools.\n\nCurrently, the Ivy League institutions are estimated to admit 10% to 30% of each entering class using legacy admissions. For example, in the 2008 entering undergraduate class, the University of Pennsylvania admitted 41.7% of legacies who applied during the early decision admissions round and 33.9% of legacies who applied during the regular admissions cycle, versus 29.3% of all students who applied during the early decision admissions round and 16.4% of all who applied during the regular cycle. In 2009, Princeton admitted 41.7% of legacy applicants—more than 4.5 times the 9.2% rate of non-legacies. Similarly, in 2006, Brown University admitted 33.5% of alumni children, significantly higher than the 13.8% overall admissions rate. In 2003, Harvard admitted 40% of legacy applicants, compared to the overall 11% acceptance rate. In short, Ivy League and other top schools typically admit legacies at two to five times their overall admission rates. Among other top universities, the University of Notre Dame is known to weigh legacy status heavily in its application process.\n\nLegacy preference is not strictly limited to college admissions, however; it may also come about with regard to admission into collegiate fraternities and sororities and other fraternal organizations such as Freemasonry. Legacy preferences are generally not allowed in Europe.\n\nThe advantages that colleges offer legacy students extend well beyond admission preferences. Many colleges have various mechanisms for coaching legacies through the admissions process and for advising them about strategies for constructing successful applications, including notifying legacies of the edge that they can gain by applying early. Some universities have alumni councils that provide legacies with special advising sessions, pair these would-be students with current legacy students, and generally provide advice and mentoring for legacy applicants. Some universities employ admissions counselors dedicated solely to legacy applicants, and it is common to provide scholarships or tuition discounts earmarked especially for legacies and for legacies to be charged in-state tuition fees when they are out-of-state residents. In cases where legacies are rejected, some universities offer legacy admissions counseling and help with placement at other colleges. Such students are often encouraged to enroll at a lesser ranked school for one or two years to prove themselves and then to reapply as transfer students. Because rankings by \"U.S. News & World Report\" and other media take into account only the SAT scores and high school grades of entering freshmen, a college can accept poor achieving legacies as transfer students without hurting its standing. Harvard caters to the children of well-connected alumni and big donors through the \"Z-list\". Z-listers are often guaranteed admittance while in high school but obliged to take a year off between high school and attending Harvard, doing whatever they wish in the interim.\n\nFormer Harvard University president Lawrence Summers has stated, \"Legacy admissions are integral to the kind of community that any private educational institution is.\" In the 1998 book \"The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions\", authors William G. Bowen, former Princeton University president, and Derek Bok, former Harvard University president, found \"the overall admission rate for legacies was almost twice that for all other candidates.\" While the preference is quite common in elite universities and liberal arts colleges, it is quite controversial, with 75% of Americans opposing the preference.\n\nAt some schools, legacy preferences have an effect on admissions comparable to other factors such as being a recruited athlete or affirmative action. One study of three selective private research universities in the United States showed the following effects (admissions disadvantage and advantage in terms of SAT points on the new 1600-point scale):\n\nAlthough it may initially appear that students of color are the most favored of all the groups in terms of college admissions, in practice, the widespread favoring of legacies has greatly reduced acceptance rates for black, Latino, and Asian-American applicants because the overwhelming majority of legacy students are white. According to a 2008 study, Duke's legacies are more likely to be white, Protestant, American citizens, and private high-school graduates than the overall student body. They are also significantly richer, with a familial income of $250,000 per year. In 2000-2001, of 567 alumni children attending Princeton, 10 were Latino and 4 were black. Similarly, a 2005 study reported that half the legacy applicants to selective colleges boasted family incomes in the top quartile of American earnings, compared to 29% of non-legacy students. In 2003, Texas A & M--which no longer practices legacy admissions—enrolled 312 white students and only 27 Latino and 6 black students who would not have been admitted if not for their family ties. When a large number of legacies are admitted to post-secondary institutions, the volume of admissions who are people of color or who are from working classes plummets. Since 1983, there have been formal complaints to The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) that Asian-American applicants are being rejected in favor of students with lesser credentials.\n\nIn 1990, the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) determined that Harvard had admitted legacies at twice the rate of other applicants, that in several cases legacy status \"'was the critical or decisive favor'\" in a decision to admit an applicant, and that legacy preferences helped explained why 17.4% of white applicants were admitted but only 13.2% of Asian-American applicants during the previous decade. The OCR also found that legacies on average were rated lower than applicants who were neither legacies nor athletics in every important category (excluding athletic ability) in which applicants were judged. Legacy students as an overall pool of applicants routinely have poorer grades and lower SAT scores than the general pool of applicants for undergraduate admissions (athletes excepted).\n\nIn the 1990s, the University of California's Board of Regents voted to ban the use of affirmative action preferences throughout the system, and legacy privilege was abandoned across the University of California system soon after.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld race-conscious admissions policies in its 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision, involving the University of Michigan's law school. With the judges having deep ties to their own elite post-secondary institutions, and with several being either former legacy students or the parents of legacies, the Court majority was not eager to ask the broader question regarding whether colleges were using race-conscious admissions policies to improve a problem of their own making, one arising from their legacy preferences and other admission practices that over-advantaged white students from economically privileged backgrounds. The only significant criticism of legacy preferences from the Court came from Justice Clarence Thomas, the sole member of the Supreme Court who grew up poor.\n\nWhile the majority of Americans have been shown to strongly oppose legacy admissions, its beneficiaries hold key positions in Congress and the judiciary, protecting this practice from political and legal challenge.\n\nEconomically, while many schools say that a main reason for legacy preference is to increase donations, at an aggregate (school-wide) level the decision to prefer legacies has not been shown to increase donations. However, in some instances, while alumni donations may go up if a child is intending on applying, donations fall if that child is rejected.\n\nBecause private universities in the U.S. rely heavily on donations from alumni, critics argue that legacy preferences are a way to indirectly sell university placement. Opponents accuse these programs of perpetuating an oligarchy and plutocracy as they lower the weight of academic merit in the admissions process in exchange for a financial one. Legacy students tend to be the white wealthy, contributing to socioeconomic injustices. Another criticism is that the wealthy are given an insurmountable advantage which hinders economic mobility within the society, in effect creating a \"de facto\" caste system.\n\nIn 2008, alumni donations accounted for 27.5% of all donations to higher education in the U.S. In effect, in an era of steeply declining governmental funding to post-secondary education, universities and colleges feel forced to rely heavily on private donations from alumni for donations to fund university operations budgets and infrastructure. Hence, one way to curb legacy admissions preferences would be for federal and state governments to better fund post-secondary education. In fact, several institutions have demonstrated that they can do extremely well without legacy admissions, including UC Berkeley, MIT and Caltech.\n\nSome supporters of the elimination of all non-academic preferences point out that many European universities, including highly selective institutions such as Oxford and Cambridge, do not use legacy, racial, or athletic preferences in admissions decisions.\n\nThere are also legal arguments against legacy preferences. In public schools, legacy preferences may violate the Nobility Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution by creating a hereditary privilege and discriminating on the basis of ancestry. Legacy preferences in both public and private universities may be illegal under the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (now codified in Section 1981 of the U.S. Code).\n\n\n\n"}

With an overall grade of B-, Ms. Silverman stating “The dark magical girl story may not be new, but Magical Girl Special Ops Asuka shows that it's still a genre with potential. Alternately relying on and eschewing genre tropes, Asuka's struggle with her violent past and magical girl identity stands to be both exciting and psychologically interesting.” She was most critical concerning the relaying on tropes without fulling committing to the unique characteristics of the storyline and the inconsistency in the artwork. This inconsistency was mostly with the characteristics of main heroine which contributes to overtly sexualizing the character.\n\n"}

There are generally three types of residential land tenure within the built environment: private sector housing (also known as market housing), social housing, and intermediate (or shared ownership) housing. The term monotenure can be applied to an area where any of these three types of tenures are prevalent; however, the term is generally used to apply to areas where social housing is the primary tenure.\n\n'Monotenure' areas generally relate to the most poverty stricken areas within an urban area, suffering from higher levels of crime, fear of crime, economic deprivation, and social exclusion.\n\nIn recent years, governments in the United States and United Kingdom have targeted social tenure neighbourhoods for 'regeneration', with a primary aim of converting some or all of the social housing into private sector housing. \n\nIn the UK, the majority of monotenure neighbourhoods were formed post World War II, when the Government undertook a programme of slum clearance. Since the 1970s, the UK government has restricted funding for social housing projects. This has also impacted upon the existing housing stock, which has often fallen into disrepair. Many Councils are now seeking to address the problems of monotenure neighbourhoods through estate renewal. Private sector housing is used to not only fund the development but also to address the monotenure nature of the neighbourhood and create a more 'mixed' community. This dilution of public sector housing is considered to lead to more sustainable and successful communities. In addition, the provision and sale of private sector housing can be used to fund improvements to the existing public sector housing. Monies for the improvement of social housing have dried up in recent years and it is anticipated that future improvements to social housing will only be achieved through the provision of private sector housing.\n\n"}
{"id": "21056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21056", "title": "Moral equivalence", "text": "Moral equivalence\n\nMoral equivalence is a term used in political debate, usually to deny that a moral comparison can be made of two sides in a conflict, or in the actions or tactics of two sides.\n\nThe term had some currency in polemic debates about the Cold War, and currently the Arab–Israeli conflict. \"Moral equivalence\" began to be used as a polemic \"term-of-retort\" to \"moral relativism\", which had been gaining use as an indictment against political foreign policy that appeared to use only a situation-based application of widely held ethical standards.\n\nInternational conflicts are sometimes viewed similarly, and interested parties periodically urge both sides to conduct a ceasefire and negotiate their differences. However these negotiations may prove difficult in that both parties in a conflict believe that they are morally superior to the other, and are unwilling to negotiate on basis of moral equivalence.\n\nIn the Cold War context, the term was and is most commonly used by anti-Communists as an accusation of formal fallacy for leftist criticisms of United States foreign policy and military conduct.\n\nMany such people believed in the idea that the United States was intrinsically benevolent, that the extension of its power, influence and hegemony was an extension of benevolence and would bring freedom to those people subject to that hegemony. Therefore, those who opposed the United States were by definition evil, trying to deny its benevolence to people. The USSR and its allies, in contrast, practiced a totalitarian ideology. A territory under US hegemony thus would be freed from possibly being in the camp of the totalitarian power and would help to weaken it. Thus, all means were justified in keeping territories away from Soviet influence in this way. This extended to countries not under Soviet influence but instead said to be sympathetic at all in any way with it. Therefore, Chile under Salvador Allende was not under Soviet domination, but removing him would help weaken the USSR by removing a government ruled with the help of a Communist Party. The big picture, they would say, justified the tortures carried out by the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship as it served to weaken the totalitarian Communist camp and in time bring about the freedom of those under its domination.\n\nSome of those who criticized US foreign policy at the time contended that US power in the Cold War was used only to pursue an economically-driven agenda. They claim that the underlying economic motivation eroded any claims of moral superiority, leaving the hostile acts in (Korea, Hungary, Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Nicaragua) to stand on their own. In contrast, those who justified US interventions in the Cold War period always cast these as being motivated by the need to contain totalitarianism and thus fulfilled a higher moral imperative.\n\nAn early popularizer of the expression was Jeane Kirkpatrick, who was United States ambassador to the United Nations in the Reagan administration. Kirkpatrick published an article called \"The Myth of Moral Equivalence\" in 1986, in which sharply criticized those who she alleged were claiming that there was \"no moral difference\" between the Soviet Union and democratic states. In fact, very few critics of United States policies in the Cold War era argued that there was a moral equivalence between the two sides. Communists, for instance, argued that the Soviet Union was morally superior to its adversaries. Kirkpatrick herself was one of the most outspoken voices calling for the US to support authoritarian military regimes in Central America that were responsible for major human rights violations. When four US churchwomen were raped and murdered by government soldiers in El Salvador, Kirkpatrick downplayed the gravity of the crime, remarking that 'the nuns were not just nuns, they were political activists'. According to Congressman Robert Torricelli, Reagan administration officials, including Kirkpatrick, deliberately suppressed information about government abuses in El Salvador: \"While the Reagan Administration was certifying human rights progress in El Salvador they knew the terrible truth that the Salvadoran military was engaged in a widespread campaign of terror and torture.\"\n\nLeftist critics usually argued that the United States itself created a \"moral equivalence\" when some of its actions, such as President Ronald Reagan's support for the \"Contra\" insurgency against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, put it on the same level of immorality as the Soviet Union.\n\nMoral equivalence has featured in debates over NATO expansion, the overthrow of rogue states, the invasion of Iraq, and the War on Terror. Concepts of moral hierarchy have been applied to foreign policy challenges such as Islamic fundamentalists, anti-Israel powers, Russia, China, drug traffickers, and Serbian nationalists, among others.\n\n"}

After educated at the Lawrence College in Murree, Sharif gained commissioned in the 3rd infantry battalion of the 2nd Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army in 1942. 2nd-Lt. Sharif saw actions in the Burma front during the World War II with the British Indian Army.\n\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, Captain Sharif moved to join the newly formed Pakistan Army where his career progressed extremely well, having attended and graduated from the Imperial Defence College. In 1952, Major Sharif was promoted as a Lieutenant-Colonel and qualified as psc from the Command and Staff College in Quetta; later achieved promotion to the one-star rank in the army in 1959.\n\nIn 1960, Brig. Shariff played a crucial role when he commanded the tactical strike brigade to remove the Nawab of Dir and Khan of Jandol to prevent succession from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\n\nIn 1964–66, Brig. Sharif moved to the staff assignment at the Army GHQ, serving in the Corps of Education where he served on the army board to select the potential candidates to be educated at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. In 1966, Major-General Sharif was appointed as the Inspector General Training and Evaluation (IGT&E) at the Army GHQ, and later appointed as the Commandant of the Command and Staff College in Quetta, which he served until 1970.\n\nIn 1970, Maj-Gen. Sharif was promoted to the three-star rank in the army, and took over the diplomatic assignment as opposed to the command assignment. Lieutenant-General Shariff was posted as the permanent representative at the CENTO's HQ in Ankara, Turkey, which he remained until 1971.\n\nOn 12 December 1971, Lt-Gen. Sharif returned to Pakistan and partially took over the command of the 33rd Infantry Division, stationed in Quetta, from its GOC, Maj-Gen. Naseer Ahmad, who was wounded in action against the Indian Army. After inspecting the infantry division, Lt-Gen. Sharif eventually handed over the command of the 33rd Infantry Division to then Maj-Gen. Iqbal Khan and departed to Turkey.\n\nIn 1972, Lt-Gen. Shariff was appointed as field commander of the II Corps, stationed in Multan. During this time, Lt-Gen. Shariff played a crucial role in his role as a secondment when he led his II Corps to provide the military aid to the civil power to maintain law and order in Karachi, amid the labour unrest. In 1974, Lt-Gen, Shariff was honorary appointed as a Colonel commandant of the Punjab Regiment.\n\nIn 1976, General Tikka Khan's retirement as a chief of army staff was due, and Lt-Gen. Sharif was the most senior army general in the Pakistani military. Initially, Lt-Gen, Sharif was in the race for the promotion of four-star rank alongside six other army generals.\n\nEventually, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto promoted and elevated the junior-most Lt-Gen, Zia-ul-Haq, to the four-star appointment and appointed him as nation's second army chief in 1976. Prime Minister Bhutto moved to create the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and promoted Lt-Gen. Shariff to the four-star rank, posting him as first Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee on 1 March 1976.\n\nHis relations with Gen. Zia remains officially business but seemed to have dislike General Zia personally. In 1974-75, Lt-Gen. Sharif had submitted a report to then-army chief General Tikka Khan that detailed the actions of Maj-Gen. Zia's actions bypassing the chain of command in the military but the report was overshadowed due Zia's dedication towards promoting the professionalism in the military. His duties as Chairman Joint Chiefs had been largely ineffective, and his deputy Admiral M.S. Khan had led the delegation to meet with Vice Chairman Li Xiannian paid a state visit to Pakistan on 22 January 1977.\n\nHis relations with Gen. Zia soured and was not supportive towards the actions by General Zia of military takeover of the civilian government, and regretted that this ultimate step had become inevitable. In July 1977, General Sharif prematurely seek retirement and he submitted his resignation to the President of Pakistan, asking him to relieve him of his duty.\n\nIn public circles, General Shariff privately made it clear that the martial law was in fact unconstitutional. Furthermore, the General Shariff was of the view of strengthening the Chairman joint chiefs' role more assertive and power than the army chief but before the system could evolve itself into a cohesive working structure the July 1977 coup disturbed the power balance totally, and tilted it heavily in favor of the army chief.\n\nIn 1977, General Shariff left the chairmanship of the joint chiefs to his deputy Admiral Mohammad Shariff but it was not until 1979 when his resignation actually went effective. After his retirement he faded from public life, refusing to accept any post in government, living off his pension and savings. He died in Lahore on 6 August 1999.\n\n"}

It resulted in the deaths of 3,000–4,000 civilians in the southern Bačka region of Hungarian-occupied Yugoslavia.\n\nThe Hungarian occupational authorities began raiding towns and villages in southern Bačka as early as 6 January 1942, ostensibly as a means of suppressing Partisan resistance, though the historical record shows that the Hungarian Government was attempting to improve its geopolitical standing vis-à-vis Germany. The first town to be raided was Čurug, followed by Gospođinci, Titel, Temerin, Đurđevo and Žabalj. The victims were seemingly detained at random while conducting everyday activities. On 20 January, the city of Novi Sad () was surrounded and placed on curfew; its telephone lines were cut. Over the next several days, the occupational authorities went about arresting \"suspicious\" individuals. More than 1,000 of the city's residents were killed by the time the raid ended. The victims in both Novi Sad and the wider region were mostly Serbs and Jews, though several Hungarians were killed as well. In Novi Sad, victims were forced to march across the frozen Danube, only to perish when the ice sheet was shattered by shelling from the shore. Some were pushed into holes in the ice sheet, causing them to drown or succumb to hypothermia, while others were shot in the street. \n\nThe Hungarian Government and news media condemned the raid, calling for an immediate investigation. In 1943, the Hungarians conducted a mass trial of those suspected of organizing the raid, handing down four death sentences. The four escaped to Germany before their executions. After the war, several trials were held in Hungary and Yugoslavia, resulting in the conviction and execution of a number of key organizers. The final court proceedings relating to the raid took place in 2011, when Sándor Képíró was tried and acquitted of murdering over 30 civilians in Novi Sad.\n\nThe raid has been fictionalized in literature and film in both Serbia and Hungary. The killings continue to strain relations between the two countries. In June 2013, Hungarian President President János Áder formally apologized for the war crimes that the Hungarian military had committed against Serbian civilians during the war.\n\nGermany, Italy and Hungary invaded Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, in response to a coup d'état that deposed the country's regent, Paul, and hastened the ascent of his underage nephew Peter to the throne. The country was overrun in less than two weeks, occupied and partitioned among its neighbours. The area that constitutes the present-day province of Vojvodina, in northern Serbia, was divided between Germany, Hungary and the Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia (; NDH), which was established shortly after the invasion. The Germans assumed direct control of the Banat, which became an autonomous district of the German-occupied territory of Serbia, primarily to satisfy the demands of the region's sizeable ethnic German (\"Volksdeutsche\") population. The Croatians occupied Syrmia and incorporated it into the NDH, stopping just short of Belgrade. The Hungarians occupied Bačka, which had been a part of Hungary until the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, when it was incorporated into the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). A large number of Hungarians and ethnic Germans had remained in the areas despite the cession. Hungarian-occupied Bačka consisted of that part of the former Danube Banovina once bounded by the Hungarian–Yugoslav border to the north, the Danube to the south and west, and the Tisza to the west. The total area of Hungarian-occupied Bačka was .\n\nThe Hungarian occupational authorities resolved to \"rebalance\" the ethnic makeup of Bačka while the invasion was still underway. Within days of the invasion, Serb and Jewish homes were attacked and looted. On 14 April 1941, as many as 500 Serbs and Jews were killed, likely in accordance with previously assembled lists of people marked for death. Legislation was soon passed requiring that all non-Hungarians and non-Germans who had moved to the area after 1918 be deported. The Hungarian occupational authorities expelled between 25,000 and 60,000 Serbs from Bačka, both colonists from the interwar period, as well as pre-World War I inhabitants. They were first interned in concentration camps before being deported to the German-occupied territory of Serbia. The Hungarians originally intended to expel as many as 150,000, but this plan was opposed by the German command in Belgrade, and subsequently fell through. More than 15,000 Hungarian colonists later settled the area, moving into the homes of the Serbs that were forced out. \n\nA policy of \"systematic magyarization\" was implemented within the occupied territories. \"Less-desirable elements\" of the population, such as Serbs, Croats and Jews, were discriminated against in matters of communication and education. Hungarian and German were the only languages permitted in almost all secondary schools, and Serbo-Croatian books, newspapers and periodicals were virtually banned. Despite this, most Serbs and Croats that had lived in the Hungarian-occupied territories prior to 1918 retained their citizenship rights as Hungarians, and some lower-level non-Hungarian public employees retained their jobs. On 14 December 1941, Bačka, along with the other Hungarian-occupied areas of Yugoslavia, referred to by Hungary as the \"Recovered Southern Territories\" (), were officially annexed and formally incorporated into Hungary.\n\nSmall-scale armed resistance broke out in Bačka in the second half of 1941 and the Hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures. More than 300 prisoners were executed in September 1941 alone. Thousands of Serbs and Jews were detained in concentration camps that had been established in Ada, Bačka Topola, Begeč, Odžaci, Bečej, Subotica and Novi Sad, as well as at Pécs and Baja, in Hungary-proper. The communist-led Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito was never strong in Bačka because the region's flat terrain did not lend itself to guerilla warfare, and because South Slavs, from which the Partisans drew most of their recruits, only made up one-third of the regional population. By the end of 1941, the Partisans of Bačka had largely been destroyed, as had their regional committee. The Chetniks, Serbian nationalist irregulars seeking to reinstate the Yugoslav monarchy, offered sporadic resistance during the invasion, but were largely inactive for much of the occupation, maintaining some covert activity only.\n\nBefore the war, Bačka was home to around 15,000 Jews. This constituted more than one-fifth of Yugoslavia's pre-war Jewish population. Moreover, more than 90 percent of the Jews living in the Hungarian-occupied territories of Yugoslavia hailed from the region. The Hungarian government had passed anti-Semitic laws in 1939, and following the outbreak of the war, these were applied in the occupied and annexed territories. After the violence of the initial occupation, no further massacres of Jews occurred in Bačka for the remainder of 1941, though the Jewish community was subjected to a string of discriminatory measures, such as the confiscation of property, arbitrary detention and forced labour.\n\nBy early 1942, the Hungarian military estimated that there were no more than 110 Partisans operating in all of Vojvodina, though in reality, the true figure was closer to 40. On 4 January 1942, several dozen Partisans from the Šajkaška Partisan detachment were found hiding at a farm near Žabalj. They were engaged by the Hungary military, and in the ensuing clash, 10 Hungarian soldiers and seven Partisans were killed. The remaining Partisans were arrested and deported to German-occupied Serbia. The Hungarian General Staff seized on the incident, using it as a pretext for launching attacks throughout the region that were intended to deter non-Hungarians from joining the resistance.\n\nOn 5 January, Ferenc Szombathelyi, the Chief of the Hungarian General Staff, ordered punitive raids against the Partisans of Bačka. The order coincided with German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop's visit to Budapest on 6 January. Several days later, \"Generalfeldmarschall\" (Field Marshall) Wilhelm Keitel, the chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces, arrived in Budapest requesting that the entire Royal Hungarian Army be moved to the Eastern Front. Hungarian Prime Minister László Bárdossy declined, and in order to justify this decision, sought to demonstrate that Hungarian troops were desperately needed in the occupied territories. The Hungarian General Staff requested that the occupational authorities provide proof of an imminent, large-scale Partisan revolt in Bačka to show the Germans. Hungary's leaders may also have been motivated to pursue a harsh response to demonstrate that they were strong enough to deal with Serb resistance and Jewish \"subversion\", and thus convince Germany that Hungary was competent enough to control the Banat, which had been part of the country before World War I. According to the Holocaust scholar Mark Levene, the raid \"may well have been intended as a dread signal from Budapest that Hungarian rule over non-Hungarians in the Balkans ... would be every bit as brutal as that of ... other occupying powers, or, for that matter, as it had previously been in Hungarian-occupied Serbia during the Great War.\" Accordingly, further guerrilla attacks were orchestrated by the occupational authorities in order to magnify the size of the Partisan resistance. Bandages were distributed to gendarmes, and they were instructed to wear them on their heads and hands to simulate the effects of being wounded. These events were staged primarily for public consumption.\n\nMore than 8,000 soldiers, gendarmes and border guards participated in the raid. It began in the town of Čurug on 6 January, with suspected Partisans, including women and children, being removed to barns, storage buildings, and municipal buildings. Although some suspects were released, between 500 and 1,000 people were killed and their bodies stripped of all valuables. The raid moved onto other local settlements such as Gospođinci and Titel the same day and continued the day after. Over the next three days, additional killings took place in the towns of Temerin and Žabalj. Civilians were rounded up at random and taken from their homes and businesses during their workday and while they were engaged in regular activities, even weddings.\n\nOn 20 January, Novi Sad was completely surrounded and placed on curfew. Its telephone and telegraph lines were cut. The city was divided into multiple areas of responsibility, with a different officer tasked with organizing the round-ups in each. Placards sprang up on buildings, warning citizens against going outdoors, except to buy food. Feketehalmy-Czeydner summoned the local authorities and announced that the Royal Hungary Army would \"take charge and clean things up\" over the next three days. The raid began the following day. Between 6,000 and 7,000 people that were considered \"suspicious\" were arrested and taken to have their papers examined. Others were detained on account that they had no papers. Most were released, but at least 40 were taken to the banks of the Danube and shot. \n\n\"The massacre was conducted systematically,\" the historian Leni Yahil writes, \"street by street.\" Many of the soldiers were visibly intoxicated. Survivor accounts, delivered after the war, attest to the brutality of the killings. A woman recalled how, on 23 April, a soldier entered her apartment, demanding to know her family's religious affiliation. The woman told him that she and her family were Orthodox Christians. Infuriated, the soldier called her a \"stinking Serb\" and killed her five sons. Thousands of men, women and children were imprisoned and interrogated at the Sokolski Dom, one of the city's main cultural centres. Many died during their interrogation. \n\nTemperatures reached . Victims were brought to an area known as the Štrand, along the Danube, and shot with machine guns. Their killers then broke up the frozen river's ice sheets with artillery fire and tossed the bodies into the water. According to another account, the victims were forced to tread the ice sheets, which were then shattered by shelling from the shore, causing them to fall into the freezing water and drown. The killings only ceased after four days, when the city's Lord Lieutenant, László Deák, bypassed the curfew and alerted the authorities in Budapest. He returned with orders that the massacre was to come to an immediate halt. Feketehalmy-Czeydner ordered that all executions be stopped by 9:00 p.m. Deák's mother was among the victims. \"The randomness and senselessness of the operation were evident especially by the fact that it hit not one single functionary of the Yugoslav Communist Party,\" the historian Krisztián Ungváry writes.\n\nIn Stari Bečej, the occupational authorities staged another \"rebellion\" and followed it up with further mass arrests. Around 200 people were detained and taken to the banks of the Tisza, where they were shot and their bodies thrown into the river. When the ice thawed, the corpses of those killed in the raid floated down the Danube and the Tisza. The Hungarian news media denounced the raid as unparalleled in the country's military history. The Hungarian government also condemned the killings, vowing that the perpetrators would be brought to justice.\n\nIn a contemporary correspondence, Hungary's Minister of the Interior, Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, wrote that 3,755 people lost their lives in the raid. The historian Rudolph Rummel places the number of deaths resulting from the raid at 3,200. The Holocaust scholar Leni Yahil writes that 4,116 individuals were killed – 2,842 Serbs, 1,250 Jews, 13 Russians and 11 Hungarians. The historian Zvonimir Golubović places the total number of civilians killed in the raid at 3,809. This figure is accepted by the Holocaust scholar Yehuda Bauer. The following table, composed by Golubović, lists the victims according to their gender, ethnicity and the place that they were killed: \n\nIn 1943, Hungarian leader Miklós Horthy ordered an investigation into the massacres and charges were brought against some of those that had conducted them. Those charged fled to Nazi Germany and returned only after German forces occupied Hungary in 1944. Horthy used the investigation as a method of distinguishing his regime from that of Nazi Germany.\n\nSome Serbian historians, such as Golubović and Aleksandar Veljić, have claimed that Horthy himself was aware of the raids and approved them being carried out. Horthy was a witness at the Nuremberg Trials after World War II but, despite strong demands from Yugoslavia, the Americans and the Soviets favored dropping any charges.\n\nAfter questions were raised in the Hungarian parliament the prime minister László Bárdossy sent a commission of inquiry to investigate. That investigation supported the story that the army had been battling partisans. A further investigation by Bárdossy's successor Miklós Kállay came to similar conclusions.\n\nIn 1943, Hungary organized a trial of several officers who were among those responsible for the raids leading to four death sentences. Four of those charged escaped to Germany before their sentencing. After the war, some of the individuals responsible for the raids were tried again by the new communist government of Hungary (which sentenced them to death or to life in prison) and again in Yugoslavia, where they were sentenced to death again, and executed. Horthy who was, according to Yugoslav/Serbian historians, among those responsible for the raids, was never indicted or tried. In September 2006, Efraim Zuroff of the Wiesenthal Center made public copies of a 1944 court verdict finding Sándor Képíró and 14 other Hungarian Army and police officers of taking part in 1942 raid in Novi Sad. In 1948, the government of Hungary retried him \"in absentia\" and sentenced him to 14 years. This verdict was based upon the testimony of János Nagy, a former Hungarian soldier of Képíró's platoon. However, the testimony was given after the communist secret service tortured Nagy. Képíró, however, stated that as a police officer, his participation was limited merely to arresting civilians, and he did not take part in the executions or any other illegal activity. War crimes charges were subsequently brought against Képíró in a federal court in Budapest, for murders of civilians committed under his command during the January 1942 raids. His trial on those charges commenced in May 2011. Képíró was acquitted on all counts in July 2011. He died of natural causes two months later.\n\nMass killings targeting Jews, such as those that occurred during the raid, were relatively uncommon in Hungary-proper and the occupied areas until October 1944, when the Germans assumed direct control of the country and the regions it had occupied, deporting hundreds of thousands of Jews to death camps.\n\nIn June 2013, Hungarian President János Áder apologised in Belgrade for the war crimes committed against civilian Serbs and Jewish people during the Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories. Some days earlier members of the Serbian Parliament adopted a declaration, which condemned the massacres and application of the principle of collective guilt against Hungarians in Vojvodina at the end of the Second World War.\n\nOf the massacres perpetrated by the Hungarian occupational authorities in Yugoslavia, the raid in southern Bačka remains the most infamous. The killings have been referred to as the Novi Sad massacre, the Újvidék massacre, or simply The Raid (). In its aftermath, the historian Deborah S. Cornelius writes, \"relations between Hungary and Serbia have never been the same.\" Decades hence, the raid continues to feature prominently in the Hungarian popular imagination, more so than most events from the war. It was depicted in Hungarian director András Kovács' 1966 film \"Cold Days\" (). It features prominently in Yugoslav writer Danilo Kiš's 1962 novel \"Psalm 44\" () and his 1972 novel \"Hourglass\" (). The massacre held special significance for Kiš as his father was nearly killed during it. The Yugoslav writer Aleksandar Tišma, who narrowly escaped being rounded up and killed in the massacre, explored the topic in his 1972 novel \"The Book About Blam\" (). It is also described in Tibor Cseres' 1991 book \"Blood Feud in Bačka\" (). In 1971, a commemorative statue by the sculptor Jovan Soldatović was erected in Novi Sad, on the spot where the bodies of victims were tossed into the Danube. The inscription at the base of the statue reads:\n\nSimilar statues, also created by Soldatović, exist in Žabalj and Čurug. Commemorative ceremonies are held annually in Novi Sad and the other massacre sites.\n\n\n\n\n"}

During that time, he became popular by routinely greeting the different regions and towns of Rwanda in the early morning, while farmers were waking to work in the fields. This broadcast segment emphasized both the importance of hard work, community and the nationalistic views of the ruling National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND).

{"id": "9049798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9049798", "title": "Portable collision avoidance system", "text": "Portable collision avoidance system\n\nA portable collision avoidance system (PCAS) is an aircraft collision avoidance system similar in function to traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS). TCAS is the industry standard for commercial collision avoidance systems but PCAS is gaining recognition as an effective means of collision avoidance for general aviation and is in use the world over by independent pilots in personally owned or rented light aircraft as well as by flight schools and flying clubs.\n\nSimply put PCAS allows pilots, particularly in single pilot VFR aircraft, a powerful additional instrument to augment their vision and situational awareness of other aircraft operating in their vicinity. A basic system will notify pilots of the nearest transponder equipped aircraft, its relative height and distance, and importantly if the distances are closing or increasing. More advanced systems can integrate with EFIS overlaying nearby aircraft on the GPS map with relative height information. This information not only reduces pilot work loads in busy airspace but also helps pilots to hone their ability to spot nearby aircraft by alerting them when an aircraft is within a range that it might normally go unnoticed.\n\nThe original PCAS technology was developed in 1999 by Zane Hovey, a pilot and flight instructor, who also patented a portable ADS-b version as well. Through this technology, transponder-equipped aircraft are detected and ranged, and the altitude is decoded. PCAS G4 technology has advanced to the point that highly accurate range, relative altitude, and 45 degree direction can be accurately detected in a portable cockpit device. PCAS gained notoriety with the growing popular TV series The Aviators (TV series) as a sponsor, and specifically in episode 6 airing on both PBS and the Discovery Channel Network. \n\nATC ground stations and active TCAS systems transmit interrogation pulses on an uplink frequency of 1,030 megahertz. Aircraft transponders reply on a downlink frequency of 1,090 megahertz. PCAS devices detect these transponder responses, then analyze and display conflict information.\n\nPCAS is passive and less expensive than active aircraft detection systems, such as TCAS. While TCAS operates with more precision than PCAS but is also more expensive and usually requires in-aircraft installation whereas Typical PCAS systems do not. Another important difference is that TCAS gives mandatory instructions where PCAS only alerts the pilot and may give a suggestion as to how to act. \n\nTo start the cycle, an interrogation is sent out from ground-based RADAR stations and/or TCAS or other actively interrogating systems in your area. This signal is sent on 1,030 MHz. For TCAS, this interrogation range can have a radius of 40 miles from the interrogation source. The Ground RADAR range can be 200 miles or more.\n\nThe transponder on any aircraft within range of the interrogation replies on 1090 MHz with their squawk code (known as mode A) and altitude code (or mode C). The altitude information is sent in an encoded format.\n\nMode S transponders also reply on this frequency, and encoded within the mode S transmission is the mode A (squawk) and mode C (altitude) information.\n\nMilitary aircraft also respond on this frequency but use a different transmission protocol (see Step 3).\n\nAn aircraft's transponder should also reply. However, the XRX unit watches for this signal and will not report it as a threat aircraft. The unit may use this information to establish base altitude for use in step 4.\n\nAny aircraft reply within the XRX detection window (maximum 6 miles) will be received. The range is computed based on the amplitude of the received signal, the altitude code is decoded, and the signal angle-of-arrival is determined to a resolution of \"quadrants\" (ahead, behind, left, or right) using a directional antenna array. XRX will recognize interrogations from TCAS, Skywatch, and any other \"active\" system, military protocols, and Mode S transmissions.\n\nThe altitude of the aircraft (in the example, 2,500 ft.) is compared to your local altitude (e.g., 1,500 ft.) and the relative altitude is calculated (e.g., 1,000 ft. above you). With relative direction, altitude and range determined, XRX displays this information and stores it in memory.\n\nIf additional aircraft are within detection range, the above process is repeated for each aircraft. The top threat is displayed on the left of the traffic screen and the second and third threats are displayed on the right.\n\nThe greatest threat is determined by looking at aircraft within the detection window you set up and comparing primarily the vertical separation (± relative altitude), and secondarily the range to the aircraft currently being displayed. XRX uses algorithms to determine which of two or more aircraft is a greater threat.\n"}

An emphasis is placed on prevention and early intervention. School-based health centers generally operate as a partnership between the school district and a community health organization, such as a community health center, hospital, or the local health department. Most SBHCs report that the majority of their student population is eligible for the National School Lunch program, a common indicator of low socioeconomic status.\n\nIn 1894, New York City officials initiated the first school health program in the U.S. Its purpose was to assess and, if needed, exclude children with contagious diseases from the classroom. In 1902, the program expanded and employed the nation’s first school nurse. As school health programs spread across the country, health screening and communicable disease control were their principal focus.\nPresident Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty in the mid-1960s is credited with bringing into focus the significance of health issues among impoverished school-age children.  The enactment of Medicaid in 1965 was indicative of a perception in the public policy community that there was a need to develop programs in service of better health care for low-income individuals, including children.\n\nIn 1967, Philip J. Porter, head of pediatrics at Cambridge City Hospital in Massachusetts and director of Maternal and Child Health for the city's health department, began to address this issue. He assigned a nurse practitioner to work on site in an elementary school to deliver primary medical care to enrollees. Four additional health clinics were opened in Cambridge schools in the years that followed.\n\nThe first school-based health centers opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1967), Dallas, Texas (1970), and St. Paul, Minnesota (1973). The first two were launched because their founders believed that school-based health care could provide accessible, affordable health care to poor children. In 1970, the West Dallas Youth Center at Pinkston High School was opened as an outreach center for a federally funded Children and Youth Program based in the University of Texas Health Sciences Center Pediatrics Department. Pinkston High School was the nation’s first high school to offer comprehensive care provided by nurse practitioners, physicians, social workers, nutritionists, and health educators. These early centers demonstrated that they were effective in increasing young people’s access to care.\nSchool nurses are an essential part of SBHC’s because they help prevent and reduce student absences in the educational institutions they are attending. The primary purpose of a school nurse is to ensure that students are healthy while maintaining good attendance. School nurses in SBHC’s display seven different characteristics that allow them to help students excel academically. A school nurse provides direct care to students, leadership for the facility of health services, screening and referral for health conditions, promotes health, and serves as a connection between parents, students, health care professionals and the larger community. The health services offered by the schools is determined by the different school districts. School nurses should provide certain services that meet the minimum requirement according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The minimum requirements include \n\nIn the past 40 years, school-based health centers have grown from a handful to 1,909 in 45 states. The initial survey in 1985, conducted by the Center for Population Options (now known as Advocates for Youth), reported 35 centers nationwide. Follow-up surveys by The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools (previously known as the Making the Grade National Program Office ) continued to document SBHC growth through the 1990s and early 2000s. Since the late 1990s, the National Assembly on School-Based Health Care (NASBHC) has conducted a nationwide census of individual centers tri-annually, every 3 years.\n\nSBHCs serve all school-levels: in elementary schools (20%), middle/junior high schools (15%), high schools (30%) and a mix of elementary, middle, and high schools (21%). They are located in urban (59%), rural (27%), and suburban (14%) communities in all regions of the country. The centers often tailor their services and outreach specifically to the school's student population. Seventy percent of the student body in schools with SBHCs are minorities. They include Hispanic/Latino (36.8%), Black (non-Hispanic/Latino) (26.2%), Asian/Pacific Islander (4.4%), Native American/Alaskan Native (1.7%) and “other” (1.4%) youth. Facilities are staffed by one or more different types of health care providers, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, substance abuse counselors, and mental health professionals.\n\nDespite the growing number of school-based health care during the past three decades, the issue of providing reproductive health care at school-based health centers continues to spark controversy. Data has demonstrated how these controversies about reproductive health may frame more general concerns about school-based care.  In response to these issues, in recent years SBHCs have begun requiring parents to sign written consents for their children to receive the full array of services the centers provide. Most facilities have an advisory board consisting of community representatives, parents, youth, and family organizations to provide planning and oversight.\n\nHistorically, federal funding for school-based health centers came primarily from the maternal and child health block grant and the Healthy Schools/Healthy Communities program. However, as SBHCs have begun to focus on third-party reimbursement, Medicaid has also become an important source of support. The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, a grant program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, assisted states over the past two decades in developing the long-term financing policies required to sustain school-based health centers.\n\nAbout 20 percent of SBHCs receive funding through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Health Center Program, a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  Other funding is derived from various sources such as community-based health centers, healthcare systems, foundation grants, and state and local funds.\n\nIn July 2011, $95 million was awarded to 278 school-based health center programs nationwide, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act(PPACA). This was the first award in a series of allocations to the School-Based Health Center Capital Program. PPACA's allocations for this program will ultimately total $200 million in funding for SBHCs over four years. The awards will enable recipients to expand their offerings and to increase their collective capacity by over 50 percent.\n\nResearchers have examined the impact of SBHCs across a number of health and education domains. \nAccess to care: Children with the greatest unmet need, including uninsured students, benefit most from SBHC services SBHCs appear to have a significant ability to reduce health care access disparities among African Americans and disabled students The Bienestar Health Program has strong evidence that supports its ability to increase positive health behaviors and reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes among Mexican-American and other at-risk youth. In Chicago, the Rush University College of Nursing operates health centers inside three public schools, providing convenient, comprehensive reproductive and sexual health services to students who are primarily African-American. Though recent research findings indicate that students with health and behavioral health needs are utilizing services, racial disparities exist; Asian students have been found to be less likely to access services than their Black and Latino peers.\n\nClinical services: School-based health centers facilitate immunization services for adolescents with greater efficiency than community health centers. Children living with asthma benefit greatly from school-based health center services, as evidenced by fewer emergency room visits and reduced activity restriction. Children with asthma served also have improved attendance in school. Research has also shown SBHCs to be effective in working with adolescents who demonstrate depressive symptoms, use substances, and engage in sexual activity.\n\nEducational Impact: SBHCs aid in reducing school absences and promoting healthy behaviors. In Connecticut, 96.7 percent of students using school-based centers return to class the same day. In a study of youth in the San Francisco Unified School District, results suggest students' use of SBHCs is associated with positive academic outcomes, particularly through the students’ self-reported perceptions of school assets and having a caring relationship with an adult SBHC employee.\n\nCost-savings: SBHCs result in cost-savings for Medicaid due to reduced emergency room use and hospitalizations.\n\n"}

Following the return of Louis XVIII to power, people suspected of having ties with the governments of the French Revolution or of Napoleon suffered arrest. Several hundred were killed by angry mobs, or executed after a quick trial at a drum head court-martial. \n\nHistorian John B. Wolf argues that Ultra-royalists—many of whom had just returned from exile—were staging a counter-revolution against the French Revolution, and also against Napoleon's revolution.\n\nThe period is named after the First White Terror that occurred during the French Revolution in 1795, when people identified as being associated with the Reign of Terror were harassed and killed.\n\nAfter the Hundred Days, Napoleon's brief return to power in 1815, the second White Terror focused mainly on the purging of a civilian administration which had almost completely turned against the Bourbon monarchy. About 70,000 officials were dismissed from their positions. The remnants of the Napoleonic army was disbanded after the Battle of Waterloo and its senior officers cashiered. Marshal Ney was executed for treason, Marshal Brune was killed in Avignon, and General Jean-Pierre Ramel was assassinated in Toulouse. Approximately 6,000 individuals who had rallied to Napoleon were brought to trial. There were about 300 mob lynchings In the south of France, notably in Marseille where his Mamelukes were massacred in their barracks.\n\nThese actions struck fear in the population, persuading liberal and moderate electors (48,000 of the 72,000 voters eligible under the franchise in force) to vote for the ultra-royalists. Of 402 members, the first Chamber of the Restoration was composed of 350 ultra-royalists; the king himself thus named it the \"Chambre introuvable\" (\"the Unobtainable Chamber\"), called as such because the Chamber was \"more royalist than the king\" (\"plus royalistes que le roi\"), in Louis XVIII's words. The Chamber voted, sentencing Marshal Ney and the Comte de la Bédoyère to death for treason, while 250 people were given prison sentences and some others exiled, including Joseph Fouché, Lazare Carnot, and Cambacérès. The surviving \"regicides\" who had voted for the execution of Louis XVI in 1792 were exiled.\n\n\n"}

He studied the potential to spark, guide, and maximize the power of sometimes short-lived mass uprisings, as he tried to understand how unarmed insurrections have been far more politically significant than observers focused on military warfare have cared to admit.\n\nAccording to Axel Kaiser, a Chilean lawyer member of the Mises Institute, soft coup is nothing but a conspiracy theory used by Latin American populists who seek the centralization of power, but do so under the pretense of improving democracy. Kayser argues that the Latin American leaders rationale is that democracy should be a system where the general will must be absolute, and that the populist leader describes himself as the representative of the general will by virtue of having been elected by the people. Kayser says that these leaders feel that the will of the leader equals the general will, and that any limits on the will of the leader would be also a limit to the general will itself. In this scenario, opposition to the leader is supposedly treated as an act against democracy, which would be used to justify persecution of the opposition, forced nationalizations and limits to the freedom of the press - a notion of democracy that is opposed to the one held in the United States, which considers instead that rulers must have limits to their power, but also conflicting with minority rights.\n\nAs several military coups took place in South America during the 20th century, in particular during the Cold War, there is a strong popular perception of those coups as highly negative events. The mere legacy of Operation Condor evokes great mistrust among the general population. Hence, as the supporters of the deposed leaders often attribute the old coups to generalized authors instead of specific ones (such as the press, the private sector of the economy, the judiciary and imperialism), they tend to argue that the alleged coups have been attempted by those same authors.\n\n"}

Tobacco 21 vigorously supports all of those efforts in addition to our focus on raising the legal minimum sales age to 21.\n\nThe major scientific publication in support of Tobacco 21 is the Institute of Medicine's report \"Public Health Implications of Raising the Minimum Age of Legal Access to Tobacco Products\", which concluded by saying:\" if the MLA were raised now to 21 nationwide, there would be approximately 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer, and 4.2 million fewer years of life lost for those born between 2000 and 2019.\"\n\nAn editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine called Tobacco 21 \"An idea whose time has come\".\n\nThe following organizations have endorsed Tobacco 21 at the national level, either through their own statements or through endorsement of Senate Bill 2100, the federal act to raise the tobacco age to 21:\n\n\nHawaii’s Tobacco 21 bill was signed by Governor David Ige and raised the legal age to purchase tobacco products, including electronic smoking devices, to 21, beginning on January 1, 2016.\n\nThe legislation of this bill arose after the Institute of Medicine released a report explaining that raising the age to 21 would have significant public health benefits. The report estimated that making the minimum age 21 would result in avoiding nearly 250,000 premature deaths and 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer among individuals born between 2000-2019.\n\nUnder the bill, anyone caught breaking the law faces a $10 fine for the first offense and a $50 fine or community service for a second offense. Retailers caught selling to individuals under the age of 21 pay penalties ranging from $500-$2,000.\n\nA press release on the governor’s website explained the decision by referencing that in the United States, 95 percent of adults smokers begin smoking before the age of 21. Almost half of those become regular smokers before the age of 18 and another 25% become regular smokers between the ages of 18-21.\n\nCalifornia became the second state to implement a statewide Tobacco 21 law. Governor Jerry Brown signed a group of bills on May 4, 2016. The pack of bills were described as the “most expansive” attempt to regulate tobacco use within the state of California in over a decade. The bills were supported by various organizations and medical groups including the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, and California Medical Association. The bill was approved in a special health care session and became effective on June 9, 2016.\n\nIn November 2013, New York City enacted legislation that raised the age to purchase tobacco products to 21, and also set a minimum price of $10.50 per pack of cigarettes, among other provisions. The law went into effect on May 18, 2014.\nThe bill came with significant penalties for those who do not comply with the law. Failure to post required signage can result in fines of up to $500. Sales of cigarettes, other tobacco products or electronic cigarettes to people under age 21 can result in New York City fines of up to $1,000 for the first violation and any other violation found that same day, and up to $2,000 for the second violation and any subsequent violation within three years. A second violation may result in revocation of the cigarette retail dealer license. New York State may impose additional fines and penalties for sales of these products to people under age 18.\n\nIn December 2015, Boston followed New York City by passing an ordinance to raise the tobacco sales age to 21. Boston's Tobacco 21 law went into effect on February 15, 2016.\n\nIn March 2016, Chicago passed its Tobacco 21 ordinance. The law will go into effect on July 1, 2016.\n\nKansas City approved its Tobacco 21 bill on November 19, 2015 and quickly put it into effect a week later on November 26.\n\nIn December 2015, Cleveland passed a local ordinance to ban the sale of tobacco and nicotine products to any persons under the age of 21. The law went into effect on April 14, 2016.\n\nIn March 2016, San Francisco joined the ranks of major American cities to pass an ordinance to raise the tobacco and nicotine sales age to 21. The ordinance went into effect on June 1, 2016. Eight days later, California's Tobacco 21 bill went into effect statewide\n\nA similar organization, named Tobacco21.ca, has the aim of increasing the legal age for buying tobacco products in Canada to 21.\n\n"}

The Vice President replaces the elected President in case of his death or absence. As long as the President is in his functions, the Vice President is the president of the Chamber of Senators and of the General Assembly.\n\nThe position of Vice-President of the Republic was established in the Constitution of 1934. Previously the President of the Senate assumed the Presidency in case of vacancy of the President. The Constitution of 1952 established a 9-member executive council, the National Council of Government, abolishing the figure of the Vice President. The Constitution of 1967 eliminates the National Council of Government and resumes the presidential system, maintaining the figure of the Vice President.\n\n\n"}

It is one of two (with Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble) popular music groups that were established by North Korea in the 1980s, both named after places where Kim Il-sung fought the Japanese in 1930s. It takes its name from Mount Wangjae in Onsong-gun, North Hamgyong Province, on the border with China, where Kim Il-sung is said to have held a meeting for anti-Japanese activities in 1933.\n\nThe band was established by the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il on 22 July 1983. Its music was often broadcast over Korean Central Broadcasting Station channels such as Radio Pyongyang. The Wangjaesan Dance Troupe is part of the group.\n\nOn 29 August 2013, \"The Chosun Ilbo\" reported that key members of the Wangjaesan Light Music Band were made to watch the execution by firing squad of other musicians and dancers from their band, as well as members of the Unhasu Orchestra and the singer Hyon Song-wol, on the orders of Kim Jong-un. The Wangjaesan Light Music Band was subsequently disbanded. Some experts however were dubious of this claim, such as Barbara Demick, author of \"Nothing to Envy\". Demick told \"Business Insider\" \"...it is hard to trust this stuff. A lot of deliberate misinformation out there.\" Chad O'Carroll of NK News, a North Korean analyst website, stated: \"You've got to remember that a lot of the time the source is South Korean and it's in their interest to distort or perhaps weave the truth every now and then\". John Delury from the Yonsei University in Seoul told \"The Guardian\": \"This stuff gets planted regularly in media outlets and then quickly goes viral. There's a global appetite for any North Korea story and the more salacious the better. Some of it is probably true — but a great deal of it is probably not\". Delury also added: \"The normal standards of journalism are thrown out of the window because the attitude is: 'It's North Korea — no one knows what's going on in there'\". Hyon Song-wol was later shown to be alive.\n\nThe South Korean reports came approximately a month after the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee had issued a message of anniversary congratulations to the troupe.\n\nIn 2015, the band reunited for the \"Songs Full of Memories\" concert series (February-March) and the joint performance \"Great Party, Rosy Korea\" in October.\n\n\n"}
