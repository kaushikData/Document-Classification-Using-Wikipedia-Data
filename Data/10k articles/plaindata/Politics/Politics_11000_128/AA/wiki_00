The movement was a collection of unassociated individuals and organizations.\n\nThe movement developed in the aftermath of the Panic of 1873 that led to a recession in the United States and parts of the western European economy. It assailed Jews and capitalism; along with this critique it opposed liberalism and it represented a fear of social democracy. Finally, the movement came out of a racial conception of national identity on the part of the German middle class.\n\nThe movement had several leaders.

By the time Kim Jong-il took over the country's film industry in 1968, Choe was the most experienced filmmaker of North Korea. Kim and Choe became close associates – Kim producing and Choe directing – a number of important North Korean films. \"Sea of Blood\" (1968) and \"The Flower Girl\" (1972) were \"Immortal Classics\" that, in addition to being popular successes, profoundly shaped the industry. By the end of the 1960s, Choe supervised film making in all of North Korea as the Propaganda and Agitation Department film section head. In 1972, his responsibilities covered other forms of North Korean propaganda as well after he was made the vice director of the Department.\n\nIn 1978, Kim had South Korea's famous director-actress couple Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee abducted to North Korea. Choe was tasked with aiding them to make films for North Korea. After Shin and Choi escaped in 1986 on a business trip in Vienna under Choe's watch, he was demoted. Kim Jong-il's trust in Choe would survive despite numerous incidents leading to the latter's dismissal from his posts. All in all, Choe has been sacked five times from the Propaganda and Agitation Department: first in 1969, then in 1977 as part of purges, in 1986 after the Vienna affair, in 1993, and finally 2010. He served as the country's Minister of Culture between 2003 and 2006. He finally became the head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department in 2009, but was replaced the following year. He remains a delegate to the Supreme People's Assembly.\n\nChoe remained part of Kim's inner circle until the latter's death in 2011. Choe supported Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong-un's, ascension to the leadership of the country at a time when he was still an uncertain heir.\n\nChoe Ik-gyu was born on 26 February 1934 to a poor family in Hwadae County, North Hamgyong Province, Korea. Choe graduated with a baccalaureate from the department of Russian literature of Kim Hyong-jik Teachers' College in 1954, and briefly became a lecturer of Russian at Kim Il-sung University's Pyongyang Labor Academy that same year. Choe also studied in the Soviet Union and graduated from the Red Flag Mangyongdae Revolutionary School in Pyongyang, at some point.\n\nChoe is married and has a son and three daughters. His eldest daughter Choe Il-sim is an aspiring scenario writer, having written scripts for the five-part movie series \"The Country I Saw\" (1988–).\n\nChoe began working at the Korea Film Studio, first as a deputy film director in 1955 and then as an independent director. He became the head of the studio in 1956 at the age of just 22. As a filmmaker, he was largely self-taught but aspiring. In addition to his formal education in arts, he now had much experience with the Stalinist model of making films in particular. Choe's breakthrough was the 1963 film \"A Garden Zinnia\".\n\nIn 1968, Kim Jong-il, the country's future leader, took control of the country's film industry. Kim lacked experience in the field and so he teamed up with Choe, who was much experienced by this time and was \"[a]rguably the single North Korean most knowledgeable about film, other than Kim\". Choe became Kim's closest partner in his activities related to film; his \"film tutor\". Their collaborations became immensely popular, Choe directing and Kim producing films that would become known as \"Immortal Classics\" and People's Prize winners.\nThe first film Choe and Kim made together was \"Sea of Blood\" (1968), followed by \"Five Guerilla Brothers\" the same year. By the end of the decade, Choe had been appointed as a supervisor of the film industry section of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.\nIn 1972, Choe and Kim released \"The Flower Girl\", The film augmented Choe's position as Kim's close confidant, making him responsible for propaganda spectacles beyond film. Choe was promoted as the vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department and elected a member of parliament in the fifth Supreme People's Assembly. Choe was now in charge of events like Day of the Sun celebrations and Liberation Day marches. He developed mass games that would evolve into the Arirang Festival, the organizing of which he is still overseeing. Choe would also give artistic guidance to Korean revolutionary operas and plays. For instance, he had directed an operatic adaption of \"Sea of Blood\" in 1971. Choe and Kim's relationship became a close and long one. Choe would be personally involved in the making of many more films and supervising the production of others, such as multi-part \"The Star of Korea\" (1980–1987).\n\nChoe Ik-gyu played a role in the abduction of Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee, a famous South Korean director-actress couple.\n\nIn a secret tape recorded by Shin and Choi, Kim Jong-il is heard confiding to the couple that he decided to kidnap them on the advice of Choe who considered Shin the best director of South Korea.\n\nAfter years of separation, when Shin and Choi were re-united by their captor, Kim Jong-il, on 6 March 1983, Choe was present. He would work with Shin from that point on to direct movies for Kim Jong-il. He would pass on messages between Kim, Shin and Choi; the latter two rarely met Kim in person.\n\nFirst, Choe accompanied Shin and Choi on a trip from Pyongyang to Moscow, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The purpose of the trip was to scout for locations for the first film Shin had agreed to make for Kim Jong-il: \"An Emissary of No Return\". Choe was discontent with the project. He had been an acclaimed film director in his own right, but now he had to mind his South Korean counterpart. Both Shin and Choi disliked Choe. Choe resorted to criticizing Shin's directing in front of the crew. Shin gained back control of the project by threatening to report to Kim Jong-il about Choe's behavior. The film was finished and would be played at the London Film Festival and Shin was to attend. Shin contemplated escaping there, but Choe and an entourage of bodyguards had traveled to London in advance.\n\nAfter Shin and Choi had managed to escape in Vienna, Choe was demoted from his position in the Propaganda and Agitation Department. He was sent into the countryside, his exact whereabouts unknown for years.\n\nChoe Ik-gyu was allowed to return as the vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department in 1988. He assumed full control of the theater and operatic fields. That year, he was involved in making \"The Life of Chunhyang\", an acclaimed folk opera. Choe guided performers \"as if he were a stage director\". Beginning with the early 1990s, Choe – credited under his pseudonym Choe Sang-geun – produced \"The Nation and Destiny\". Choe produced, directed and wrote scenarios throughout the production of the 50-part film series, which Kim Jong-il considered the last work made under his personal guidance. Choe briefly fell out of public life in 1993 when he was dismissed from his Propaganda and Agitation Department post again. Even during this period, Kim Jong-il allowed him to travel to Germany to treat his health problems, which reflects the amount of trust Kim had in Choe. All in all, Choe has been dismissed four times from the Propaganda and Agitation Department.\n\nChoe became the Minister of Culture in September 2003 but retired temporarily some two years later because of diabetes and other chronic health issues. He relinquished the position in 2006. Choe was elected to the 12th Supreme People's Assembly on 8 March 2009, representing Electoral District #73. He finally became the head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department in 2009. As the director of the Department, Choe was one of North Korea's propaganda chiefs. He was replaced by Kang Nung-su in early February 2010 for unknown reasons.\n\nChoe was often seen accompanying Kim Jong-il on formal occasions until the latter's death in 2011. When traveling outside North Korea, Choe uses the name Choe Sang-geun. Such was the case for instance when he visited Seoul in South Korea in 2000 in the capacity of the counsel to the National Orchestra of North Korea.\n\nChoe was among those who vouched for the succession of Kim Jong-un at a time when his ascension to power remained uncertain.\n\nIn addition to Kim Jong-il, Choe would aide Kim's third wife Ko Yong-hui, and Jang Song-thaek.\n\nPaul Fischer, the author of \"A Kim Jong-Il Production\", assesses that \"[t]he modern North Korean state, which is a production, a display performance of its own, owes as much to Choe Ik-Gyu's taste and talents as it does to Kim Jong-Il.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "411434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411434", "title": "Concordat", "text": "Concordat\n\nA concordat is a convention between the Holy See and a sovereign state that defines the relationship between the Catholic Church and the state in matters that concern both, i.e. the recognition and privileges of the Catholic Church in a particular country and with secular matters that impact on church interests.\n\nAccording to P.W. Brown the use of the term \"concordat\" does not appear \"until the pontificate of Pope Martin V (1413–1431) in a work by Nicholas de Cusa, entitled \"De Concordantia Catholica\"\". The first concordat dates from 1098, and from then to the beginning of the First World War the Holy See signed 74 concordats. Due to the substantial remapping of Europe that took place after the war, new concordats with legal successor states were necessary. The post-World War I era saw the greatest proliferation of concordats in history.\n\nAlthough for a time after the Second Vatican Council, which ended in 1965, the term 'concordat' was dropped, it reappeared with the Polish Concordat of 1993 and the Portuguese Concordat of 2004. A different model of relations between the Vatican and various states is still evolving in the wake of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Liberty, \"Dignitatis humanae\".\n\nThe Catholic church historically claimed not to be bound to one form of government over another, but was willing to work with any kind of government, so long as the rights of God and believers were maintained. Pius XI wrote in 1933: Universally known is the fact that the Catholic Church is never bound to one form of government more than to another, provided the Divine rights of God and of Christian consciences are safe. She does not find any difficulty in adapting herself to various civil institutions, be they monarchic or republican, aristocratic or democratic.\n\nFrom a Church–State perspective, the contentions regarding Concordats involves two perspectives.\n\nFrom a Catholic perspective, the Church has the moral and theological right to enter into diplomatic relations with states in order to reach agreements regarding the care of its members residing there. This is the concept of \"Libertas ecclesiae\" (freedom of the Church).\n\nHowever, from a non-Catholic perspective, Catholic church privileges pose certain concerns regarding religious freedom, such as:\n\n\nSome concordats guarantee the Catholic Church the tax-exempt status of a charity, being by fact the largest charitable institution in the world, either stating this explicitly, as in Brazil (2008, Article 15) and Italy (1984, Article 7.3), or phrasing it indirectly, as in Portugal (2004, art. 12).\n\nWhen the political will is present, such concordat privileges can be extended by domestic legislation. In 1992 the tax exemption granted the Church by the Italian concordat was interpreted by a law which permits the Catholic Church to avoid paying 90% of what it owes to the state for its commercial activities. Thus, a small shrine within the walls of a cinema, holiday resort, shop, restaurant or hotel is sufficient to confer religious exemption. In June 2007 Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for Competition announced an investigation of this. Then, in August, the deputy finance minister in Romano Prodi’s fragile center-left coalition said the issue needed to be tackled in the next year's budget. However, after that nothing more about this was heard from the Barroso Commission and a few months later the Prodi government fell.\n\nThe Slovak concordat (2000, art. 20.2) ensures that church offertories are \"not subject to taxation or to the requirement of public accountability\".\n\nThis is also the case in Côte d'Ivoire, where far larger sums are involved. The Basilica at Yamoussoukro, is estimated to have cost $300 million, and the additional running expenses for what is the largest church in the world are also shielded from scrutiny by the 1992 concordat concluded with the Ivorian dictator. Houphouët-Boigny claimed that these funds came from his private fortune. A Vatican official is reported to have called the agreement over the foundation set up to administer these funds \"a delicate matter\". Nevertheless, this concordat ensures that the foundation’s income and assets remain untaxed (art. 9.1), it holds these funds beyond the reach of both criminal and civil law (art. 7.1), it permits this money to be sent out of the country (art. 13.2) and it keeps all the foundation’s documents \"inviolable\", in other words, secret (art. 8).\n\nIn Colombia there was a crisis between state and church in 1994 when Attorney-General Gustavo de Greiff accused several Bishops of having illegal contacts with the FARC guerrillas. It turned out that under Colombia's concordat with the Holy See, members of the clergy could only be investigated by ecclesiastical courts which are ruled by canon law, and that the Bishops were therefore immune from investigation by the civil authorities on what many in Colombia considered to be a serious felony.\n\n\"Further information: Treaties of the Holy See, Multilateral Treaties signed by the Holy See and Concordats with individual states of Germany\"\n\nThere have been at least several hundred concordats over the centuries.\nThe following is a sortable list of the concordats and other bilateral agreements concluded by the Holy See.\n\n"}
{"id": "34829001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34829001", "title": "Corporate immune system", "text": "Corporate immune system\n\nThe term corporate immune system, or corporate immune response, refers to a process within corporations that demands organizations within the company accomplish activities in a certain way, a form of conformity tendencies. It is, in effect, the active form of groupthink, when the past outcome of groupthink processes forces itself on organizations that are otherwise different.\n\nThe term is most commonly used to describe such processes that drive out innovation and entrepreneurial activity within organizations. This is often found within in large multi-divisional companies, where it manifests itself as inter-divisional fighting, often subtle or unintended. Multinational corporations are particularly common examples, as divisional differences can be compounded by different corporate structures, languages and even time zones.\n\nThe term may refer to any organizational process that tends to drive out differences, or alternately demands conformity. The name refers to parallels with biological immune systems, which attempt to drive out \"foreign\" invaders and sometimes react negatively against the organism it is supposed to protect:\n\nThe essence of the term is the \"activity\" of driving out differences, as opposed to the natural \"tendency\" to do so.\n\nWithin any corporation, managers are presented with new projects and have to gain funding and staffing resources to implement them. These projects may be organizational in nature, implementing a new sales and inventory system for instance, or product related, like manufacturing and marketing a new toy. The process of introducing and implementing new ideas is a well studied area of business theory.\n\nAt any point in time, any particular manager might be presented with several new ideas, and has to choose which among these to promote. Implementation carries with it certain risks, both outright failure of the initiative, or through opportunity costs when some other initiative is not carried out due to conflicting needs or lack of resources. In larger companies, many managers will present ideas that have to compete for larger pools of resources, as decided on by upper management. Corporations normally have well-defined procedures for assessing these proposals, in order to decide among the many concepts so the most rewarding and viable projects gain support.\n\nIn an ideal corporation, the company would attempt to assess the proposal and decide whether or not to fund it based solely on its merits. Under these circumstances, it would be expected that most errors in this process would be the rejection of good ideas, rather than the approval of bad ones. This is because large corporations are typically dedicated to certain markets, and dedicate a large amount of their resources to improving the processes that address those markets in order to improve efficiency as well as competitiveness. Ideas for new products or markets are generally more risky, or at least more difficult to assess, than ideas that apply to the existing corporation, which is better understood. That is, corporations tend to focus on \"exploitation\", to the detriment of \"exploration\".\n\nReal-world companies rarely act in a manner that one might consider \"ideal\". Among the many problems that might cause a good idea to be rejected are a lack of resources, a lack of market understanding, and any number of external or internal factors. Corporate immune response may be one of these internal factors, manifesting itself as internecine fighting between divisions, or simply the rejection of ideas from divisions that are \"too different\" to be understood. In this context, it could be any of \"the set of organizational forces that suppress the advancement of creation-oriented activities such as initiatives.\"\n\nApple Computer has been a common example of the corporate immune response in action. During the late 1980s and the 1990s in particular, many ideas were promoted within the company, only to face severe attacks by other groups within the company. Many of these attacks were not based on real problems with the ideas, but more typically a perceived threat to the sales of an existing product. For instance, the Newton faced enormous problems within the company and almost caused its inventor to quit the company. Other frequently-cited examples in computing include Taligent, OpenDoc, Workplace OS, and the Star Trek project.\n\n\n"}

The show starred Linda Cullen and Bob Robertson, and focused primarily on the stars' voice impersonations of Canadian political and cultural figures. In addition CBC staff announcer Bob Sharples provided the introductions and conclusions to \"Double Exposure\" shows and provided narraration for many \"Double Exposure\" skits.\n\nIt played on CBC Radio (now known as CBC Radio One) at 11:33 a.m. on Saturday mornings, and on CBC Stereo (now known as CBC Radio 2) Saturday evenings at 6:32 p.m. (one half-hour later in Newfoundland). Unlike many previous CBC radio comedies, such as \"The Royal Canadian Air Farce\" or \"Frantic Times\", the show would be recorded wholly in a studio without a live audience. The duo made the jump to television with an initial satirical special in 1994, and became a television series in 1997.\n\nThe radio version of the show ran from 1986 to 1997 on CBC Radio. Prior to the launch of their own show, Robertson and Cullen were known as regular contributors of comedic sketches to Jack Farr's \"The Radio Show\".\n\nIt satirized contemporary Canadian politicians such as Brian Mulroney, Joe Clark, Preston Manning, Barbara McDougall, Bill Vander Zalm and others, as well as international figures such as Margaret Thatcher. Robertson specialized in such impersonations as Bill Clinton, Ross Perot, John Major, and Queen Elizabeth, and Cullen could do imitations of Sandie Rinaldo, Princess Diana, Julia Child and Sister Wendy, among others.\n\nTypical sketches on the radio show would include over-the-top impersonations of Brian Tobin rescuing frozen turbot from the dinner plate, or Preston Manning \"ee-lim-inating\" everything possible. Broadcaster Adrienne Clarkson was mocked by a dead-on parody of her precise diction and haughty demeanor with the recurring catchphrase \"I'm Adrienne Clarkson, and you're not\", derived from Chevy Chase's early \"Saturday Night Live\" refrain. (Clarkson subsequently became Governor General of Canada near the end of \"Double Exposure\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s television run.)\n\nIn 1994 the show was named the best weekly network program on CBC Radio and Stereo. They also occasionally did special radio shows targeting specific Canadian political events, such as the 2000 Canadian federal election. They also won an ACTRA Award for best comedy, and were the highest-rated radio comedy program of the time.\n\nThe duo did New Year's Eve television specials for several years beginning in 1994. In 1997, \"Double Exposure\" moved permanently to television, moving from CBC Television to the rival CTV until 2000. On radio, the show consisted of comedic sketches and monologues; on its CBC television specials, their voice impersonations were often set to actual film clips of the politicians being satirized. The weekly series on CTV featured the pair in live sketches as well.\n\nIn 2000, \"Double Exposure\" returned to CBC for a rare special radio program on the evening of the federal election.\n\nIn 2002, Cullen and Robertson joined with other comedians in the new satirical comedy series \"Point Blank\", which aired on The Comedy Network. In November 2004, Cullen and Robertson were inducted into the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame.\n\nOn December 16, 2005, the Double Exposure team appeared on Lorne Elliott's show \"Madly Off in All Directions\" on CBC Radio One. This was their first appearance on CBC Radio in five years.\n\nIn 2008, Cullen and Robertson launched Gross National Product, a website which features satirical Flash animations.\n\nIn May 2009, they started blogging and podcasting.\n\n"}

{"id": "1418775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1418775", "title": "Equal Access Act", "text": "Equal Access Act\n\nThe Equal Access Act is a United States federal law passed in 1984 to compel federally funded secondary schools to provide equal access to extracurricular student clubs. Lobbied for by Christian groups who wanted to ensure students the right to conduct Bible study programs during lunch and after school, it is also essential in litigation regarding the right of students to form gay–straight alliances; and to form groups focused on any religion or on secularism.\n\nThe Act provides that if a school receives federal aid and has a \"limited open forum,\" or at least one student-led \"non-curriculum\" club that meets outside of class time, it must allow additional such clubs to be organized, and must give them equal access to meeting spaces and school publications. Exceptions can be made for groups that \"materially and substantially interfere with the orderly conduct of educational activities within the school,\" and a school can technically \"opt out\" of the act by prohibiting all non-curriculum clubs.\n\nIt was ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court in 1990 in the case \"Westside Community Schools v. Mergens\", and the school was ordered to allow a student Christian group to meet.\n\nAt the college level, controversy arose over whether a university should pay for a publication by a religious student organization. The court ruled in \"Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia\" that if the university pays for other student organization publications, it must also pay for religious organization publications.\n\nThe Equal Access Act has also been used to fight opposition to gay-straight alliances in high schools across the nation. Administration in high schools who have opposed the formation of gay-straight alliances, and formally denied their organizers privileges and the right to assemble, found themselves being sued and caught in legal disputes. The State Supreme Courts have always ruled in favor of the gay-straight alliance, stating that the particular school must either allow the gay-straight alliance, or ban all non-curriculum groups from assembling on school property.\n\nThe Act requires that if a school permits any religious student group, then it must allow groups focused on any religion or on irreligion. This has been applied to stop schools from blocking Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, and other religious groups as well as Christian ones. The Secular Student Alliance and other secular groups have invoked the Act to stop public high schools from blocking students organizing secular student groups.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "263906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263906", "title": "Escrow", "text": "Escrow\n\nAn escrow is a contractual arrangement in which a third party receives and disburses money or documents for the primary transacting parties, with the disbursement dependent on conditions agreed to by the transacting parties, or an account established by a broker for holding funds on behalf of the broker's principal or some other person until the consummation or termination of a transaction; or, a trust account held in the borrower's name to pay obligations such as property taxes and insurance premiums.\nThe word derives from the Old French word \"\", meaning a scrap of paper or a scroll of parchment; this indicated the deed that a third party held until a transaction was completed.\n\nEscrow generally refers to money held by a third-party on behalf of transacting parties. It is mostly used regarding the purchase of shares of a company. It is best known in the United States in the context of real estate (specifically in mortgages where the mortgage company establishes an escrow account to pay property tax and insurance during the term of the mortgage). Escrow is an account separate from the mortgage account where deposit of funds occurs for payment of certain conditions that apply to the mortgage, usually property taxes and insurance. The escrow agent has the duty to properly account for the escrow funds and ensure that usage of funds is explicitly for the purpose intended. Since a mortgage lender is not willing to take the risk that a homeowner will not pay property tax, escrow is usually required under the mortgage terms. Escrow companies are also commonly used in the transfer of high value personal and business property, like websites and businesses, and in the completion of person-to-person remote auctions (such as eBay), although the advent of new low cost online escrow services has meant that even low cost transactions are now starting to benefit from use of escrow. In the UK, escrow accounts are often used during private property transactions to hold solicitors' clients' money, such as the deposit, until such time as the transaction completes. Other examples include purchases of a second hand car, where the money may be released at the end of a warranty period, deposits for a property rental, where the money is released after the tenant moves out, provision of construction services, where the money may be released when the building work is complete to a defined standard, or when defined parts of the work are complete, perishable food products, sold on live seafood auctions (such as Gfresh).\n\nAn unrelated type of escrow is when a purchaser of a complex system, such as bespoke process control software or a large industrial installation, may require the supplier to place the design into source code escrow, so that the purchaser remains in a position to maintain and modify the system in case of the demise of the supplier.\n\nInternet escrow has been around since the beginning of Internet auctions and commerce. It was one of the many developments that allowed for trust to be established in the online sphere.\n\nAs with traditional escrow, Internet escrow works by placing money in the control of an independent and licensed third party in order to protect both buyer and seller in a transaction. When both parties verify the transaction has been completed per terms set, the money is released. If at any point there is a dispute between the parties in the transaction, the process moves along to dispute resolution. The outcome of the dispute resolution process will decide what happens to money in escrow. With the growth of both business and individual commerce on the web traditional escrow companies have been supplanted by new technologies.\n\nIn the United States, the California Department of Business Oversight enacted Internet escrow companies as a licensed class effective 1 July 2001. The first Internet escrow company to be licensed was Escrow.com, founded by Fidelity National Financial in 1999.\n\nIn the European Union, the Payment Services Directive, which commenced on 1 November 2009, has for the first time allowed the introduction of very low-cost Internet escrow services that are properly licensed and government-regulated. The regulatory framework in the EU allows these web-based escrow services, which operate along the lines of expensive \"Letter of Credit\" service run by banks for international buyers and sellers, but at a cost in cents rather than thousands of Euros, the ability to enhance security in commercial transactions.\n\nBogus escrow methods have been employed online. In an effort to persuade a wary Internet auction participant, the perpetrator will propose the use of a third-party escrow service. The victim is unaware that the perpetrator has actually created an escrow site that closely resembles a legitimate escrow service. The victim sends payment to the phony escrow company and receives nothing in return. Alternatively, the victim sends merchandise to the subject and waits for his/her payment through the escrow site, which is never received because it is illegitimate. Genuine online escrow companies will be listed on a government register, and it is advised that users should never use an online escrow service without first verifying that it is genuine by independently viewing a government on-line register. Currently there is not a license offered by the US Federal Government for online escrow services. However, certain states offer their own license for online escrow services; such as the California Department of Business and the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions.\n\nEscrow is used in the field of automatic banking and vending equipment. One example is automated teller machines (ATMs), and is the function which allows the machine to hold the money deposited by the customer separately, and in case he or she challenges the counting result, the money is returned. Another example is a vending machine, where the customer's money is held in a separate escrow area pending successful completion of the transaction. If a problem occurs and the customer presses the refund button, the coins are returned from escrow; if no problem occurs, they fall into the coin vault of the machine.\n\nSource code escrow agents hold source code of software in escrow just as other escrow companies hold cash. Normally you do not own or have any rights to the software (including source code) that you are accessing, under the terms of a regular SaaS or desktop software agreement. This does not usually become an issue until technical problems start to arise, i.e. unexpected service interruptions, downtime, loss of application functionality and loss of data. This can add significant costs to your business and you remain reliant upon the software supplier to resolve these issues, unless you have an escrow agreement in place. Escrow is when the software source code is held by a third party – an escrow agent – on behalf of the customer and the supplier. Information escrow agents, such as the International Creative Registry, hold in escrow intellectual property and other information. Examples include song music and lyrics, manufacturing designs and laboratory notebooks, and television and movie treatments and scripts. This is done to establish legal ownership rights, with the independent escrow agents attesting to the information's ownership, contents, and creation date.\n\nEscrow is also known in the judicial context. So-called escrow funds are commonly used to distribute money from a cash settlement in a class action or environmental enforcement action. This way the defendant is not responsible for distribution of judgment moneys to the individual plaintiffs or the court-determined use (such as environmental remediation or mitigation). The defendant pays the total amount of the judgment (or settlement) to the court-administered or appointed escrow fund, and the fund distributes the money (often reimbursing its expenses from the judgment funds).\n\nIn the U.S., escrow payment is a common term referring to the portion of a mortgage payment that is designated to pay for real property taxes and hazard insurance. It is an amount \"over and above\" the principal and interest portion of a mortgage payment. Since the escrow payment is used to pay taxes and insurance, it is referred to as \"T&I\", while the mortgage payment consisting of principal and interest is called \"P&I\". The sum total of all elements is then referred to as \"PITI\", for \"Principal, Interest, Tax, and Insurance\". Some mortgage companies require customers to maintain an escrow account that pays the property taxes and hazard insurance. Others offer it as an option for customers. Some types of loans, most notably Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, require the lender to maintain an escrow account for the life of the loan.\n\nEven with a fixed interest rate, monthly mortgage payments may change over the life of the loan due to changes in property taxes and insurance premiums. For instance, if a hazard insurance premium increases by $120.00 per year, the escrow payment will need to increase by $10.00 per month to account for this difference (in addition to collection for the resulting escrow shortage when the mortgage company paid $120.00 more for the hazard insurance premium than what was anticipated). By RESPA guidelines the escrow payment must be recomputed at least once every 12 months to account for increases in property taxes or insurance. This is called an escrow analysis.\n\nThe escrow payment used to pay T&I is a long term escrow account that may last for years or for the life of the loan. Escrow can also refer to a shorter term account used to facilitate the closing of a real estate transaction. In this type of escrow, the escrow company holds onto all documents and money related to closing the transaction, rather than having the buyer and the seller deal directly with each other. When and if the transaction is ready to close, the escrow company distributes all funds and documents to their rightful recipients, and records the deed with the appropriate authorities.\n\nThe validity of an online escrow company's license can be checked with the regulating authority. Usually this is accessible through their official website, and should always be checked before dealing with an escrow company to ensure it is not a look-alike or fraud.\n\nThis service is offered by multiple bankers as an outsourced product.\n\nEscrow arrangement is often used as a part of mergers and acquisitions a supplement that warranties and indemnities offered by the seller(s). This will be particularly likely where the credit risk of the seller(s) is of a poor quality and therefore the buyer is concerned about their ability to recover any sums that may become due.\n\nUnlike many other forms of escrow, escrow arrangements in corporate transactions are often designed to last for extended periods rather than simply to complete the transfer of an asset. There is also commonly the requirement for an escrow agent to adjudicate on the validity of a claim on the escrow funds, which can lead to the risk of the dispute between the parties.\n\nDue to the length that the funds are held, the escrow arrangements need to take into account different considerations to those for other escrow arrangements, for example (i) information provision to the parties; (ii) application of interest earned on the funds; and (iii) credit worthiness of the financial institution.\n\nNot all escrow agreements impose the duties of a legal trustee on the escrow agent, and in many such agreements, escrow agents are held to a mere gross negligence standard and benefit from indemnity and hold harmless provisions.\n\nIf the escrow agent is licensed by governmental authority, then much higher legal standards may apply.\n\n\n"}

It is the result of the reunification of the Federalist Party of France and the Europe United Party which had a presence in several countries of the European Union. It is one of the first European-oriented political parties that openly defends European federalism and is not a coalition of pre-existing national parties.\n\nIn 2016, the office was composed of President Pietro De Matteis, Vice President Geogios Kostakos, Secretary General Emmanuel Rodary, Treasurer Mariarosaria Marziali, John Retetagos, Marco Marazzi and Michel Caillouet. Following the general assembly of December 6, 2016, the office of the European Federalist Party merges with the citizen movements Stand-up for the United States of Europe and USE Now to create Stand Up For Europe. For their part, the various national associations composing the PFE, decide to continue their political action under the banner European Federalists Party. Yves Gernigon, president of the Federalist party (France), then becomes leader of the PFE.\n\nThe European Federalist Party is made up of members from 12 European countries, from civil society, who face their professional life and political commitment.\n\nThe European Federalist Party, like the federalist model, leaves a great deal of autonomy to its national sections, which have a certain freedom of adaptation of the European program to the local culture. On the other hand, the European program whose primary goal is to build a European federation is common. The PFE thus seeks to differentiate itself from the current official formations of the European Parliament by proposing a real cohesion on the European level. The announced goal is to create a mass popular movement around the party and the idea of a federal Europe to respond to the current crisis. The European Federalist Party has participated in numerous elections, including the French presidential election and the European elections.\n\nThe goal of the European Federalist Party is to create a European Federation of voluntary member states of the European Union. It aims to present candidates at all elections across Europe. He was initially supported by prominent European personalities, such as Marco Pannella (former MEP, deputy, Italian senator and Altiero Spinelli collaborator), who was a member.\n\nThe members of the PFE campaign for the creation of a supranational European State with limited sovereign powers and political institutions: government, assembly, federal Senate representing the Member States.\n\nAs the name suggests, the party's goal is to make the European Union a true federal state.

That implies : \n\n\nThe PFE believes that most of the ills in the European Union today are due to old age and the shortcomings of an institutional scheme that was completed by the crisis. The European Federalist Party wants to go beyond the current Union, which according to him is \"bureaucratic and undemocratic\". \n\nThe federal Europe desired by the PFE has nothing to do with the current European Union, which would be too weak to defend French and European interests, and too far from the concerns of citizens.\n"}
{"id": "19283891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19283891", "title": "Executive compensation", "text": "Executive compensation\n\nExecutive compensation or executive pay is composed of the financial compensation and other non-financial awards received by an executive from their firm for their service to the organization. It is typically a mixture of salary, bonuses, shares of or call options on the company stock, benefits, and perquisites, ideally configured to take into account government regulations, tax law, the desires of the organization and the executive, and rewards for performance.\n\nThe three decades starting with the 1980s saw a dramatic rise in executive pay relative to that of an average worker's wage in the United States, and to a lesser extent in a number of other countries. Observers differ as to whether this rise is a natural and beneficial result of competition for scarce business talent that can add greatly to stockholder value in large companies, or a socially harmful phenomenon brought about by social and political changes that have given executives greater control over their own pay. Recent studies have indicated that executive compensation should be better aligned with social goals (e.g. public health goals). Executive pay is an important part of corporate governance, and is often determined by a company's board of directors.\n\nThere are six basic tools of compensation or remuneration:\n\n\nIn a modern corporation, the CEO and other top executives are often paid salary plus short-term incentives or bonuses. This combination is referred to as Total Cash Compensation (TCC). Short-term incentives usually are formula-driven and have some performance criteria attached depending on the role of the executive. For example, the Sales Director's performance related bonus may be based on incremental revenue growth turnover; a CEO's could be based on incremental profitability and revenue growth. Bonuses are after-the-fact (not formula driven) and often discretionary. Executives may also be compensated with a mixture of cash and shares of the company which are almost always subject to vesting restrictions (a long-term incentive). To be considered a long-term incentive the measurement period must be in excess of one year (3–5 years is common). The vesting term refers to the period of time before the recipient has the right to transfer shares and realize value. Vesting can be based on time, performance or both. For example, a CEO might get 1 million in cash, and 1 million in company shares (and share buy options used). Vesting can occur in two ways: \"cliff vesting\" (vesting occurring on one date), and \"graded vesting\" (which occurs over a period of time) and which maybe \"uniform\" (e.g., 20% of the options vest each year for 5 years) or \"non-uniform\" (e.g., 20%, 30% and 50% of the options vest each year for the next three years).\nOther components of an executive compensation package may include such perks as generous retirement plans, health insurance, a chauffeured limousine, an executive jet, and interest-free loans for the purchase of housing.\n\nExecutive stock option pay rose dramatically in the United States after scholarly support from University of Chicago educated Professors Michael C. Jensen and Kevin J. Murphy. Due to their publications in the Harvard Business Review 1990 and support from Wall Street and institutional investors, Congress passed a law making it cost effective to pay executives in equity.\n\nSupporters of stock options say they align the interests of CEOs to those of shareholders, since options are valuable only if the stock price remains above the option's strike price. Stock options are now counted as a corporate expense (non-cash), which impacts a company's income statement and makes the distribution of options more transparent to shareholders. Critics of stock options charge that they are granted without justification as there is little reason to align the interests of CEOs with those of shareholders. Empirical evidence shows since the wide use of stock options, executive pay relative to workers has dramatically risen. Moreover, executive stock options contributed to the accounting manipulation scandals of the late 1990s and abuses such as the options backdating of such grants. Finally, researchers have shown that relationships between executive stock options and stock buybacks, implying that executives use corporate resources to inflate stock prices before they exercise their options.\n\nStock options also incentivize executives to engage in risk-seeking behavior. This is because the value of a call option increases with increased volatility (see options pricing). Stock options also present a potential up-side gain (if the stock price goes up) for the executive, but no downside risk (if the stock price goes down, the option simply isn't exercised). Stock options therefore can incentivize excessive risk seeking behavior that can lead to catastrophic corporate failure.\n\nExecutives are also compensated with restricted stock, which is stock given to an executive that cannot be sold until certain conditions are met and has the same value as the market price of the stock at the time of grant. As the size of stock option grants have been reduced, the number of companies granting restricted stock either with stock options or instead of, has increased. Restricted stock has its detractors, too, as it has value even when the stock price falls. As an alternative to straight time vested restricted stock, companies have been adding performance type features to their grants. These grants, which could be called performance shares, do not vest or are not granted until these conditions are met. These performance conditions could be earnings per share or internal financial targets.\n\nThe levels of compensation in all countries has been rising dramatically over the past decades. Not only is it rising in absolute terms, but also in relative terms. In 2007, the world's highest paid chief executive officers and chief financial officers were American. They made 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965. In 2010 the highest paid CEO was Viacom's Philippe P. Dauman at $84.5 million The U.S. has the world's highest CEO's compensation relative to manufacturing production workers. According to one 2005 estimate the U.S. ratio of CEO's to production worker pay is 39:1 compared to 31.8:1 in UK; 25.9:1 in Italy; 24.9:1 in New Zealand.\n\nThe explosion in executive pay has become controversial, criticized by not only leftists but conservative establishmentarians such as Peter Drucker, John Bogle, Warren Buffett.\n\nThe idea that stock options and other alleged pay-for-performance are driven by economics has also been questioned. According to economist Paul Krugman, \n\"Today the idea that huge paychecks are part of a beneficial system in which executives are given an incentive to perform well has become something of a sick joke. A 2001 article in \"Fortune\", \"The Great CEO Pay Heist\" encapsulated the cynicism: You might have expected it to go like this: The stock isn't moving, so the CEO shouldn't be rewarded. But it was actually the opposite: The stock isn't moving, so we've got to find some other basis for rewarding the CEO.` And the article quoted a somewhat repentant Michael Jensen [a theorist for stock option compensation]: `I've generally worried these guys weren't getting paid enough. But now even I'm troubled.'\"\n\nRecently, empirical evidence showed that compensation consultants only further exacerbated the controversy. A study of more than 1,000 US companies over six years finds “strong empirical evidence” that executive compensation consultants have been hired as a “justification device” for higher CEO pay.\n\nDefenders of high executive pay say that the global war for talent and the rise of private equity firms can explain much of the increase in executive pay. For example, while in conservative Japan a senior executive has few alternatives to his current employer, in the United States it is acceptable and even admirable for a senior executive to jump to a competitor, to a private equity firm, or to a private equity portfolio company. Portfolio company executives take a pay cut but are routinely granted stock options for ownership of ten percent of the portfolio company, contingent on a successful tenure. Rather than signaling a conspiracy, defenders argue, the increase in executive pay is a mere byproduct of supply and demand for executive talent. However, U.S. executives make substantially more than their European and Asian counterparts.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked publicly traded companies to disclose more information explaining how their executives' compensation amounts are determined. The SEC has also posted compensation amounts on its website to make it easier for investors to compare compensation amounts paid by different companies. It is interesting to juxtapose SEC regulations related to executive compensation with Congressional efforts to address such compensation.\n\nSince the 1990s, CEO compensation in the US has outpaced corporate profits, economic growth and the average compensation of all workers. Between 1980 and 2004, Mutual Fund founder John Bogle estimates total CEO compensation grew 8.5% year, compared to corporate profit growth of 2.9%/year and per capita income growth of 3.1%. By 2006 CEOs made 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965. As a general rule, the larger the corporation the larger the CEO compensation package.\n\nThe share of corporate income devoted to compensating the five highest paid executives of (each) public firms more than doubled from 4.8% in 1993-1995 to 10.3% in 2001-2003.\nThe pay for the five top-earning executives at each of the largest 1500 American companies for the ten years from 1994 to 2004 is estimated at approximately $500 billion in 2005 dollars.\n\nAs of late March 2012 USA Today's tally showed the median CEO pay of the S&P 500 for 2011 was $9.6 million.\n\nLower level executives also have fared well. About 40% of the top 0.1% income earners in the United States are executives, managers, or supervisors (and this doesn't include the finance industry) — far out of proportion to less than 5% of the working population that management occupations make up.\n\nA study by University of Florida researchers found that highly paid CEOs improve company profitability as opposed to executives making less for similar jobs. However, a review of the experimental and quasi-experimental research relevant to executive compensation, by Philippe Jacquart and J. Scott Armstrong, found opposing results. In particular, the authors conclude that \"the notion that higher pay leads to the selection of better executives is undermined by the prevalence of poor recruiting methods. Moreover, higher pay fails to promote better performance. Instead, it undermines the intrinsic motivation of executives, inhibits their learning, leads them to ignore other stakeholders, and discourages them from considering the long-term effects of their decisions on stakeholders\" \nAnother study by Professors Lynne M. Andersson and Thomas S. Batemann published in the \"Journal of Organizational Behavior\" found that highly paid executives are more likely to behave cynically and therefore show tendencies of unethical performance.\n\nIn Australia, shareholders can vote against the pay rises of board members, but the vote is non-binding. Instead the shareholders can sack some or all of the board members. Australia's corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has called on companies to improve the disclosure of their remuneration arrangements for directors and executives.\n\nA 2012 report by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives demonstrated that the top 100 Canadian CEOs were paid an average of C$8.4 million in 2010, a 27% increase over 2009, this compared to C$44,366 earned by the average Canadian that year, 1.1% more than in 2009. The top three earners were automotive supplier Magna International Inc. founder Frank Stronach at C$61.8 million, co-CEO Donald Walker at C$16.7 million and former co-CEO Siegfried Wolf at C$16.5 million.\n\nIn 2008, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission's “Eurogroup” of finance ministers, called excessive pay a “social scourge” and demanded action.\n\nAlthough executive compensation in the UK is said to be \"dwarfed\" by that of corporate America, it has caused public upset. In response to criticism of high levels of executive pay, the Compass organisation set up the High Pay Commission. Its 2011 report described the pay of executives as \"corrosive\".\n\nIn December 2011/January 2012 two of the country’s biggest investors, Fidelity Worldwide Investment, and the Association of British Insurers, called for greater shareholder control over executive pay packages. Dominic Rossi of Fidelity Worldwide Investment stated, “Inappropriate levels of executive reward have destroyed public trust and led to a situation where all directors are perceived to be overpaid. The simple truth is that remuneration schemes have become too complex and, in some cases, too generous and out of line with the interests of investors.” Two sources of public anger were Barclays, where senior executives were promised million-pound pay packages despite a 30% drop in share price; and Royal Bank of Scotland where the head of investment banking was set to earn a \"large sum\" after thousands of employees were made redundant.\n\nSince the early 2000s, companies in Asia are following the U.S. model in compensating top executives, with bigger paychecks plus bonuses and stock options. However, with a great diversity in stages of development in listing rules, disclosure requirements and quality of talent, the level and structure of executive pay is still very different across Asia countries. Disclosures on top executive pay is less transparent compared to that in the United Kingdom. Singapore and Hong Kong stock exchange rules are the most comprehensive, closely followed by Japan's, which has stepped up its requirements since 2010.\n\nExecutive compensation in China still differs from compensation in Europe and the U.S. but the situation is changing rapidly. Based on a research paper by Conyon, executive compensation in China is mostly composed of salaries and bonuses, as stock options and equity incentives are relatively rare elements of a Chinese senior manager's compensation package. Since 2016 Chinese-listed companies were required to report total compensation of their top managers and board members. However, transparency and what information companies choose to release to the public varies greatly. Chinese private companies usually implement a performance-based compensation model, whereas State-owned enterprises apply a uniform salary-management system. Executive compensation for Chinese executives reached USD 150 000 on average and increased by 9.1% in 2017.\n\nThere are a number of strategies that could be employed as a response to the growth of executive compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9154042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9154042", "title": "High-deductible health plan", "text": "High-deductible health plan\n\nIn the United States, a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) is a health insurance plan with lower premiums and higher deductibles than a traditional health plan. Being covered by an HDHP is also a requirement for having a health savings account. Some HDHP plans also offer additional \"wellness\" benefits, provided before a deductible is paid. High-deductible health plans are a form of catastrophic coverage, intended to cover for catastrophic illnesses. Adoption rates of HDHPs have been growing since their inception in 2004, not only with increasing employer options, but also increasing government options. As of 2016, HDHPs represented 29% of the total covered workers in the United States; however, the impact of such benefit design is not widely understood. \n\nParticipation in a qualifying HDHP is a requirement for health savings accounts and other tax-advantaged programs. A qualifying plan must have a minimum deductible and out-of-pocket maximum which the Internal Revenue Service may modify each year to reflect change in cost of living. According to the instructions for IRS form 8889, \"this limit does not apply to deductibles and expenses for out-of-network services if the plan uses a network of providers. Instead, only deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses for services within the network should be used to figure whether the limit is reached.\"\n\nWhen a consumer purchases a health insurance policy, there is a moral hazard risk because the consumer may utilize too much medical care because the full cost of care is defrayed (i.e. he/she has a lower marginal cost for care than the open market). Advocates of Consumer-driven healthcare (CDHC) such as HDHPs operate on the premise that imprudent choices made by patients may be avoided if they are held financially responsible through high copayments and deductibles. However, in practice, studies show that HDHP may actually promote behavior such as avoiding preventive care visits and reducing much needed ambulatory care, especially for those with chronic conditions or low socioeconomic status.\n\nTo qualify for an HDHP, an individual plan must have a deductible of at least $1,300 and family plans must have a deductible of at least $2,600. An HDHP's total yearly out-of-pocket expenses (including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance) can't be more than $6,550 for an individual or $13,100 for a family (This limit doesn't apply to out-of-network services). Because of the relatively high cost of HDHPs, the increased out-of-pocket costs can be burdensome especially for low income families. As a way to try and offset the cost of care, HDHP policy holders may contribute to a health savings account (HSA) with pre-tax income. HSA contributions, unlike other tax-advantaged investment vehicles, offer a triple tax benefit – tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses. The maximum contribution limits policy holders may make to their HSA in 2018 are $3,450 (individual) and $6,900 (family) with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for people age 55 or older.\n\nThe number of people enrolled in HDHPs is increasing, but this is likely due to the rising cost of health care and cost-shifting to consumers – not due to the fact that HDHPs necessarily provide better care.\n\nThe proposed American Health Care Act of 2017 could result in higher deductibles (or total out-of-pocket cost) to consumers and leave 23 million Americans without insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Trump Administration is proposing to nearly double the maximum HSA contribution for a family from $6,750 to $13,100 annually. An increase in HSA contribution limits will provide little benefit to the low-income households, which already find HDHPs to be less affordable in the event of a catastrophic illness. One method to entice consumers to pursue HDHPs is low- or no-cost wellness benefits, which provides the insured with better access to preventive care visits and tools at lower cost. If successful, these plans may support the ongoing shift from curative to preventive health care.\n\nHigh deductible health plans (HDHPs) have much lower premiums but high deductibles, co insurance and out of pocket maximums. Due to low upfront costs HDHPs are increasing in popularity with employers, with 24% offering some form of HDHP in 2013 (up from 5% in 2007). In this model, the individual assumes all medical costs until the minimum deductible is met. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010, has led to a significant expansion of HDHPs. The proposed replacement of the ACA will continue with expansion of the cost sharing model while reducing the financial subsidies for the out of pocket expenses of low income patients. Specifically, the bill repeals ACA cost-sharing reduction provisions after 2019.\n\nThe economic principle behind HDHPs is 'cost–sharing', a \"method of financing health care that require some direct payments for services by patients.\" Increasing deductibles is one perceived way to cut health care costs by decreasing its overall usage. As out-of-pocket expenses shift from insurers and employers to individuals and employees, consumers will become more discriminant in their insurance products and engage in a higher degree of price shopping. Consumers will also compare the value of medical services provided at one site compared to another in deciding where to pursue health care services. Taken together, HDHPs should decrease health care utilization and stem the increase in national health care costs. Success of this theory depends on ability of patients to make informed decisions on their health care purchase similar to what they do for goods and services. With high deductibles, consumers face incentives to consider price when choosing health care providers and medical services. This economic model however remains unproven. A 2016 survey has shown members of HDHP and traditional plans to be equally likely to price shop for medical care. Consumers choose health care for a variety of reasons and not all of health services and amenities are amenable to price shopping. Researchers have defined five situations which are more suitable for effective price shopping than others.\n\nWhile HDHPs are useful vehicles for the right consumer, there are concerns that patients may delay care due to high costs, often to their own detriment. When patients postpone necessary or preventative care (outpatient visits, screening and diagnostic testing), they may end up in hospitals' emergency rooms or wards for treatment. The tradeoff of forgoing care early for acute, resource-intensive hospitalizations later ultimately increases overall health care costs. Up to 43% of insured patients said that they delayed or skipped physician-recommended tests or treatments because of high associated costs.\n\nAn additional economic principle commonly linked to HDHPs is a Health Savings Account (HSA). HSAs are tax-exempt accounts that individuals with HDHPs fund in order to pay for future medical expenses/costs for which they are now responsible. \"Introduced in 2003 as a part of the Medicare prescription drug benefit legislation, the HSA is a less-restrictive medical savings account, owned by the employee, and open to anyone enrolled in a [HDHP] and not already covered by public or private insurance\" . HSAs are designed to offset financial burden of increased cost-sharing related to HDHPs, but enrollment in HSA has been limited. A 2016 study showed 61.6% of enrollees in HDHP lacked an HSA.\n\nAs stated above, individuals with HDHPs often forgo or delay care due to increased cost sharing, and this often leads to patients presenting to health care providers and institutions later on in much worse condition. This pattern has a significant effect on the supply side of health care. Hospitals and health care institutions take on increasing amounts of bad debt with the advent of HDHP as patients exhaust their deductibles soon after being admitted for care and default on outstanding balances. With rise in cost sharing, hospitals are collecting more money directly from the patients; from 2011 to 2014, the number of consumer payments to health care providers increased 193 percent according to a study by to the \"Trends in Healthcare Payments Fifth Annual Report: 2014\" from InstaMed. From a physician/hospital supply, HDHP have forced institutions to become more consumer conscious as patients (due to price shopping) do their own research and understand their options. If patients with HDHPs forgo primary care, this lessens the volume and revenue they are able to generate. It also means that, later on, the burden and intensity of care per episode is much greater. The same goes for specialists as well who see less patients undergoing preventative screening and maintenance care (colonoscopies, mammograms, routine laboratory testing, etc.) and then end up with serious (and preventable) conditions. In the long term, the cost and burden is invariably greater. Physicians struggle with having cost become a greater reason for opting for or against a medical interaction or procedure than the health benefits for the individual.\n\n"}

{"id": "27974748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27974748", "title": "Hysteresis (economics)", "text": "Hysteresis (economics)\n\nIn economics, hysteresis (from Greek \"hysterēsis\", from hystereō, \"(I) lag behind, come later than\") refers to effects that persist after the initial causes giving rise to the effects are removed. Two of the main areas in economics where hysteresis effects are invoked to explain economic phenomena are unemployment and international trade.\n\nFor instance, in labor economics hysteresis refers to the possibility that periods of high unemployment tend to increase the rate-of-unemployment-below-which-inflation-begins-to-accelerate, commonly referred to as the natural rate of unemployment or non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).\n\nIf the unemployment rate exhibits hysteresis, then it follows a statistically non-stationary process, because the expected value of the unemployment rate now and in the future permanently shifts when the rate itself changes. The process with hysteresis is a unit root process, which in its simplest form can be characterized as\n\nwhere formula_2 is the unemployment rate at time \"t\" and formula_3 is a stationary error term representing outside shocks to the rate. According to this characterization, formula_4 for all formula_5, where formula_6 refers to an expectation conditional on values observed no later than time \"t\"–1; any temporary shock to unemployment, represented by a single non-zero value of formula_3, results in a permanent change to expected unemployment (even for formula_8 indefinitely large so the expectation is for indefinitely far into the future). A more elaborate model would allow formula_9 to go up positively but less than one-for-one with formula_3. In contrast, a non-hysteresis model of unemployment would have formula_2 following a stationary process, so that formula_9 for arbitrarily large formula_8 would always equal a permanently fixed natural rate of unemployment.\n\nWhen some negative shock reduces employment in a company or industry, there are fewer employed workers left. As the employed workers usually have the power to influence or set wages, their reduced number incentivizes them to bargain for even higher wages when the economy again gets better, instead of letting the wage stay at the equilibrium wage level, where the supply and demand of workers would match. This causes hysteresis, i.e., the unemployment becomes permanently higher after negative shocks.\n\nIt has also been argued that unemployed people lose their skills during unemployment, which makes them less likely to again get jobs.\n\nIf there is no hysteresis in unemployment, then for example if the central bank wishes to lower the inflation rate it may shift to a contractionary monetary policy, which if not fully anticipated and believed will temporarily increase the unemployment rate; if the contractionary policy persists, the unemployment rise will eventually disappear as the unemployment rate returns to the natural rate. Then the cost of the anti-inflation policy will have been temporary unemployment. But if there is hysteresis, the unemployment rise initiated by the contractionary policy will never completely go away, and in this case the cost of the anti-inflation policy will have been permanently higher unemployment, making the policy less likely to have greater benefits than costs.\n\nThe experience of the United Kingdom since the early 1980s counts against hysteresis as a determinant of the natural rate of unemployment, as unemployment fell much faster in the recovery from the early 1990s recession than after the early 1980s recession.\n\nAn econometric study of fourteen OECD countries rejected the hysteresis hypothesis, as did a study at the state level in the US.\n\n"}

The organization and its members jointly develop recommendations on, and practical solutions for, the political, economic and social problems confronting humanity. These efforts are focused on three main priority areas: peace and security, world economic revitalization and universal ethical standards.\n\nOne of its most well-known initiatives was the development of a draft Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities, which was an attempt to propose a set of responsibilities that were shared by all individuals to counterbalance the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This new \"global ethic\" would provide a foundation of freedom, justice and peace in order for universal rights to be meaningful. These agreed values and standards complements universal rights, as the maximization of personal freedom at the expense of others, without consideration of others, is as problematic as having no rights at all.\n\n\n\nThe InterAction Council released its first book in 2008 through the McGill-Queen's University Press in Canada, entitled \"Bridging the Divide: Religious Dialogue and Universal Ethics\".\n\nA second book, produced with the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation of Canada and the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health, was released in the fall of 2012, entitled: \"The Global Water Crisis: Addressing an Urgent Security Issue\".\n\nIn 2014, the InterAction Council again partnered with the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health on the release of Global Agenda 2013: Water, Energy, and the Arab Awakening.

Fedorowicz Publishing is a Canadian publishing house that specialises in literature on the German armed forces of the World War II era. Its authors are both popular history writers such as Paul Carell and Franz Kurowski, along with the war-time veterans (and post-war apologists), including Kurt Meyer of the SS Division Hitlerjugend and Otto Weidinger of the SS Division Das Reich. \n\nThe press has received praise from North American and German writers for professionally produced text and picture books. J.J. Fedorowicz has been profiled by the American historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies in their 2006 work \"The Myth of the Eastern Front\", where they describe Fedorowicz as a leading press of war-romancing literature and criticise it for providing a platform for authors who present an uncritical and ahistorical portrayal of the German war effort during the Soviet-German war of 1941–1945.\n\nFedorowicz Publishing was the first North American press to translate works by the German author Franz Kurowski, providing laudatory and fictionalised wartime chronicles of German units and their highly-decorated personnel. In early 1990s, Fedorowicz released Kurowski's two popular works, \"Panzer Aces\" and \"Infantry Aces\", in 1992 and 1994, respectively. The first two books were followed up by \"Panzer Aces II\", \"Panzer Aces III\", \"Luftwaffe Aces\" and similar works.\n\nIn addition to Kurowski, the publishing house printed works by authors such as Patrick Agte (closely associated with the post-war Waffen-SS lobby group HIAG), former Nazi propagandist Paul Carell and Marc Rikmenspoel, a leading apologist for the Waffen-SS. It brought to the English-speaking audiences multiple works by former Waffen-SS members, such as Hubert Meyer, Rudolf Lehmann, Kurt \"Panzer\" Meyer, Otto Weidinger, and Karl Ullrich, among others. Their publications included memoirs by former Wehrmacht \"Heer\" (army) personnel, such as Otto Carius, a famous \"panzer ace\", and Helmuth Spaeter of the Division Grossdeutschland. Many of the Fedorowicz titles were subsequently made available to a wider audience by mass market and specialty publishers such as Ballantine Books and Stackpole Books.\n\nHistorians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies in their work \"The Myth of the Eastern Front\" describe J.J. Fedorowicz as the leading publisher of war-romancing literature dedicated to the portrayal of the German war effort on the Eastern Front. The books include multiple photographs and are accompanied by cover art that, as with Kurowski's \"Panzer Aces\" series, \"evokes heroism, determination and might of the German soldier and his weapons\".\n\nAccording to \"The Myth of the Eastern Front\", J.J.Fedorowicz has played an important role in publicising the works of German World War II veterans, such as Otto Carius, alongside the authors who the book describes as \"gurus\". In Smelser and Davies's definition, the gurus are writers who specialise in the Wehrmacht and, in particular, the Waffen-SS and are popular among the readers who \"romanticise\" the Eastern Front, These authors present an uncritical and ahistorical portrayal of the military and paramilitary formations of Nazi Germany that is in stark contrast to the realities of the war of conquest and racial annihilation. The book describes Fedorowicz's web site as \"the heart of the romancing ethos\", among other similar publishers such as Schiffer Publishing and Merriam Press:\nIn some cases, as their [gurus'] appeal grows, they graduate up the scale of publishing importance from self-publishing to the myriad small presses (...), to the top, particularly to the Fedorowicz publishing house (...). To be published through Fedorowicz is to have arrived.\n\nIn contrast, the press has won praise from its authors for its portrayal of the German military. In a preface to the Fedorowicz translation of his \"Tigers in the Mud\", Carius thanks the publisher for enabling him and other German authors to reach a broader audience in the English-speaking world. He writes:\n\nThrough these publications, the defamation of the German soldier in film, television and the press has been countered and the picture of the Wehrmacht has been a more objective one by means of the help offered by many sources.\n\nSmelser and Davies conclude that Fedorowicz's position on the former members of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS hues closely to that of Carius, who condemns the deserters and traitors, along with \"lies\" and false \"claims\" about the German soldier. \"The Fedorowicz link provides romancers with reaffirmation of their sentiments toward the German soldiers and their field commanders\", the book finds. \n\nChris Evans, history editor at Stackpole Books, writes in an introduction to one of the Fedorowicz books reissued by Stackpole: \"J.J. Fedorowicz has a well earned reputation for publishing exceptionally high quality books on German World War II subjects\". Author Mark Healy in his work \"Zitadelle: The German Offensive Against the Kursk Salient 4–17 July 1943\" refers to Fedorowicz's publications on the Battle of Kursk as \"remarkable text and photo books\", highlighting the two volume works by Restayn and Moller, which contain new photographs and present an \"unforgettable image of the scale of the battle\". Favorably comparing Fedorowicz with Schiffer Publishing, author George Forty notes that the company has a \"worldwide reputation for the excellences in its military literature\".\n\nSample publications include:\n\n"}

The meeting was held in the city of Lausanne, Switzerland from September 2 to 8, 1867. It was attended by 71 delegates, representing the socialist and labor movements of Switzerland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, and Belgium.\n\nThe International Workingmen's Association (IWA), commonly known as the First International, was an international association of trade unionist and socialist political activists which attempted to coordinate labor activities across national boundaries. The organization is remembered for the active participation of many pioneer leaders of the modern socialist and anarchist movements, including Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin. Membership in the IWA was numerically small, its funding inadequate, and its institutional life short — lasting a mere 8 years from its establishment in 1864 until its termination at the Hague Congress of 1872.\n\nEstablishment of the IWA was related to ongoing efforts to coordinate the activities of the trade union movements in Great Britain and France, a project begun in connection with the 1862 London World's Fair. Economic crisis had led the imperial French government to concede the right to French workers to elect a delegation of 750 to the London exhibition. While in London certain members of this delegation headed by Henri Tolain (1828-1897) established contact with British trade union leaders and opened the door for a formal meeting in London the following summer in support of the Polish uprising of 1863.\n\nThe IWA first met in international session in the Swiss city of Geneva in September 1866 in an event remembered to history as the Geneva Congress.\n\nThe Lausannne Congress was called to order on September 2, 1867 in Lausanne, Switzerland. There were 71 delegates in attendance, of whom the majority (38) were affiliated with the local Swiss labor movement. Also in attendance were 18 representatives of the French labor movement, including Tolain and Karl Marx's future son-in-law Charles Longuet; 6 German delegates, including medical doctor Louis Kugelmann and philosopher Ludwig Büchner; 2 delegates each from Great Britain and Italy, and one from Belgium. In addition there were in attendance four members of the General Council of the IWA, headed by Johann Eccarius.\n\nEach delegate held one equal vote, regardless of the number of mandates of support he had received. Many of those participating derived their basic political ideas from the writings of French mutualist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.\n\nThe gathering dealt with the organizational structure of the IWA and approved a uniform rate of dues of one English penny per capita, to be paid quarterly to the General Council in London. It was decided that the General Council would in turn be obligated to issue reports on a quarterly basis to the central committees of its affiliated national organizations.\n\nThe Congress debated the issue of national banks and the investment of trade union funds, ultimately approving a resolution made by Eccarius urging members of the IWA to work to \"induce the trade unioins to devote their funds to cooperative production\" rather than tying up the same assets in bank accounts.\n\nAlso considered by the congress was the matter of education, opining in favor of the standard of free, compulsory, secular education.\n\nThe IWA, an international association of trade unionists from its creation, moved towards socialist advocacy at the Lausanne Congress, adopting a resolution calling for state ownership of transportation and exchange in order to break the hold of large companies on these institutions. This represented the first time that the organization had formally supported the principle of collective ownership.\n\n"}

{"id": "37176723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37176723", "title": "Macro and security", "text": "Macro and security\n\nA macro in computer science is a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to a replacement input sequence (also often a sequence of characters) according to a defined procedure.\n\nA macro is used to define variables or procedures, to allow code reuse, or to design domain-specific languages.\n\nMacros can be separated into several types: \n\nMacros can be very useful to software users. They simplify regularly used actions (repetitive code for a programmer, or a sequence of actions in a program) so that the productivity of the user is increased. However, many problems exist, they will be tackled subsequently.\n\nThere are a few dangers in text substitution macros, like C macros.\nThe C preprocessor is a powerful tool that can bring clarity to the code or on the contrary, obscure it.\n\nFirst, because there isn't any form of macros error checking (as there is for C or assembly language), it is possible to make macros which will not work.Indeed, for the C language, the syntax of each macro is replaced by what has been declared by the preprocessor. Only after that does the compiler check the code.\n\nExample :\n\n//file example.c\n\n\nint main()\n\nThis example compiles because the macro someString isn't used. But if this macro was used, there would be a compilation error.\n\n//file example.c\n\n\nint main()\n\ngcc -o example example.c\nexample.c: In function 'main':\nexample.c:6:26: erreur: 'foo' undeclared (first use in this function)\nexample.c:6:26: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in\n\nThis is just a simple example, but in some applications, when the count of code lines begins to be huge, it can be really important.\nIf the macro doesn't compile, you may have to change its syntax. In the previous example, quotation marks have to be added to foo. For the others, the whole syntax will be false, so you may have to change the macro and all calls to it.\nAs the case, this type of flaw can be minimal or can affect the maintenance of an application.\n\nIn this second point, we'll see that repetitive code can be found in some macros. And this can lead to wasted computing time.\nLet's illustrate this by the following code:\n\n// file example2.c\n\n\nint main()\n\nint whatMax()\n\nint getNumber()\n\nThere is a call of a macro called \"max\" between 2 values: the variable foo and the return value of the function getNumber().\nIt's just a basic macro calling a function which calculate the maximum between 2 values.\nWhen this code is executed, we obtain:\n\n./example2\nI am called !\nThe max ? 5\n\nFor the moment, there is nothing wrong but let's replace the value of getNumber by 6 for example, now the result is:\n\n./example2\nI am called !\nI am called !\nThe max ? 6\n\nThe function getNumber() is called two times, yet you only need to call it one time.\nThis is because of the macro. If you replace the call of the macro \"max\" by its syntax, then the return in whatMax is:\n\nreturn (((foo) > (getNumber()) ? (foo) : (getNumber()); \n\nWhen the value of getNumber is greater than the value of foo, it is called two times: one for the comparison and one for the return.\nAs you can see, it can slow down an execution of a program when the function, in this example, need to take time to calculate the return value.\n\nFor the last point of this section, we will see that macros can be potentially dangerous. In some programs, there is critical data on which some operations can be needed. In order to make those operations more legible, macros can be used, but it can be double-edged.Let's take an example in this code and its execution:\n\n// file example3.c\n\n #define cube(x) x*x*x\nint main()\n\n./example3\ny is 10\nz is 18\n\nNormally, the result expected was \"y is equal to 64 and z to 30\". But when the preprocessor replace the calls of the macros, we obtain:\n\n// y:\nx + 1*x + 1*x + 1 // equivalent to\nx + (1 * x) + (1 * x) + 1 // or\n3 + (1 * 3) + (1 * 3) + 1 // is equal to 10\n\n// z:\n5 * x+x // equivalent to\n(5 * x) + x // or 18\n\nMacros in C (and others languages like SMX, SAM76, assembly language, etc.) are just text substitution, they don't do anything more. It is the responsibility of the programmer to be careful about it, in this case, put parentheses.\nBut, in others cases, some effects cannot be instantly predicted, like this one:\n\n// file example4.c\n\nint main()\n\n8 is expected as the value of y, but the result at the execution is:\n\n./example4\ny is 10\n\nLet's see what happens if we decompose the execution stack:\n\ny = (++x) + (++x);\nthe stack is :\n\n- the first '+' is unstacked\n- the first '++x' is evaluated and unstacked => x = 4\n- the second '++x'is evaluated and unstacked => x = 5\n- then the '+' give x+x = 5+5 = 10*/\n\nThe result is logical when we look at the execution stack but was not very obvious instinctively.\n\nSo, users of macros have to be careful because without attention, errors can easily appear (in addition, instructions like '++x' in imbricated instructions are not very recommended either).\n\nThese flaws are completely different from the previous ones : the main problem in VBA-type macros is the viruses. Macro viruses are relatively recent, the first one named Concept, has been created in June 1995.\nThe main reason of that is that \"the high-level languages used to write macro code are powerful and easy to use, considerably increasing the pool of potential virus writers, and the documents containing the macros can be disseminated rapidly and widely by E-mail\".\nSo they can be spread quickly and be very destructive.\n\nSystem macro means macros that interact with the basic operators in a Word document (like often-used functionalities like FileSave, FileSaveAs which are macros).\nThe strength, but the weakness of a Word document is that such types of macros can be redefinied by users.\nThis allow a great flexibility for the user, but, this is a flaw too that hackers can exploit to take down the control of the document and the computer where the Word document is opened.\nSuch type of viruses use automatic and semi-automatic macros, they can be launched by any action or some events without the user’s knowledge or consent.\nFor example, a Word document have the following macros: AutoExec, AutoNew, AutoClose, AutoOpen, AutoExit, so it's easy for a hacker to replace these basic functionalities by a macro virus which have the same name as the original functionality.\nAlso, a combination of shortcut keys can be associated with a system command (like Ctrl+B to set up the bold font) and the user can change them, replacing them by customs macros. So a hacker can modify and create such macros that the user will activate by using the shortcut key.\nSuch macros can also be activated by a macro button, like a button \"Click here for further information\" which seems common and safely.\n\nA type of macro virus that cut and paste the text of a document in the macro. The macro could be invoked with the Auto-open macro so the text would be re-created when the document (empty) is opened. The user will not notice that the document is empty. The macro could also convert only some parts of the text in order to be less noticeable.\nRemoving macros from the document, manually or by using an anti-virus program would lead to a loss of the content of the document.\n\"Polymorphic viruses change their code in fundamental ways with each replication in order to avoid detection by anti-virus scanners.\"\nIn WordBasic (first name of the language Visual Basic), polymorphic viruses are difficult to do.\nIndeed, the macro's polymorphism relies of the encryption of the document. However, the hackers have no control of the encryption key.\nFurthermore, the encryption isn't really efficient : the encrypted macros are just in the document, so the encryption key too and when a polymorphic macro replicates itself, the key doesn't change (the replication affects only the macro not the encryption).\nIn addition to these difficulties, a macro can't modify itself, but another macro can.\nWordBasic is really a powerful language, it allows some operations to the macros :\n\nSo, in order to implement macros viruses which can change its contents, the hackers have to do another macro which fulfill the task to modify the content of the virus.\nHowever, this type of macros viruses isn't really widespread. Indeed, the hackers choose to do macros viruses because it's easy and quick to implement. Make a polymorphic macro need a lot of knowledge of the language WordBasic (it needs the advanced functionalities) and more time than a \"classic\" macro virus.\nEven if the hacker make a polymorphic macro, the polymorphism needs to be done, so, the document needs to be update and the update can be visible for a user.\n\nDuring the replication, a macro can create do-nothing macros. But this idea can be combined with polymorphic macros, so macros are not necessarily do-nothing, each macro invokes the next one so they can be arranged in a chain. In that case, if they are not all removed during a disinfection, some destructive payload is activated. Such attack can crash the winword processor with an internal error. Since Winword 6.0, the number of macros per template is limited to 150, so the attack is limited too but can still be very annoying.\nThe macro viruses can, in some cases, interact between them. If two viruses are executed at the same time, both of them can modify the source code of each other.\nSo, it results a new virus which can't be recognize by the anti-viruses software. But, the result is totally random : the macro virus can be more infectious or less infectious, it depends to what part of the virus has been changed.\nHowever, when the 'mating' is unintentional, the macro virus in result has more chances to be less infectious.\nIndeed, in order to replicate itself, it has to know the commands in the source code, but, if it's changed with a random scheme, the macro can't replicate itself.\nNevertheless, it is possible to do such macros intentionally (it is different from polymorphic macros viruses which have to use another macro to change their contents) in order to increase the infectivity of the two viruses.\nIn the example of the article, the macro virus \"Colors\" infected a document, but another infected the user's system before : the macro virus \"Concept\".\nBoth of these viruses use the command \"AutoOpen\", so, at first, the macro virus \"Colors\" was detected but the command \"AutoOpen\" in it was the command of the macro virus \"Concept\".\nMoreover, when \"Concept\" duplicate itself, it is unencrypted, but the command in the virus \"Colors\" was encrypted (Colors encrypt its commands).\nSo, the replicate of the macro virus \"Concept\" result of the hybridation of this macro virus (which infected the user's system first) and \"Colors\".\nThe \"hybrid\" could replicate itself only if \"AutoOpen\" wasn't executed, indeed this command comes from \"Concept\", but the body of the hybrid is \"Colors\", so that create some conflicts.\nThis example shows the potential of mating macro viruses : if a couple of mating macro viruses is created, it will make more difficult to detect both of the macro virus (in hypothesis, there is only two which mate) by the virus-specificscanners and may reinforce the virility of the viruses.\nFortunately, this type of macro virus is very rare (more than the polymorphic macro viruses, there may not exist one), indeed, create two (or more) which can interact with each other and not reduce the virlity (rather reinforce it) is complicated.\n\nOne of the worst scenarios in the world of viruses would be a tool allowing to create a new virus by modifying an existing one.\nFor executable files, it is hard to create this kind of tool. But it is very simple for macro viruses since sources of macros are always available. Based on the same idea of polymorphic macros, a macro can perform modifications to all macros present in the document. Considering this, there is just a few modifications to make to the macro in order to convert it in a macro virus mutator.\nSo it is quite easy to create macro virus generators, so it is possible to create quickly several thousands of the known viruses.\nMost macros viruses are stand-alone; they don’t depend on other macros (for the infectious part of the virus not for the replication for some viruses), but some macros viruses do. They are called parasitic macros.\nWhen they are launched, they check other macros (viruses or not), and append their contents to them. In this way, all of the macros became viruses.\nBut, this type of macro can’t be spread as quickly as stand-alone macros.\nIndeed, it depends on other macros, so, without them, the virus can’t be spread. So, parasitic macros often are hybrid: they are stand alone and they can infect other macros.\nThis kind of macro virus poses real problems to the virus-specific anti-virus; in fact, they change the content of other viruses, so the accurate detection isn't possible.\n\nThere are different types of anti-virus (or scanner), one of them is the heuristic analysis anti-virus which interpretes or emulates macros.\nIndeed, to examine all of the branches of macros require a NP-complete complexity (using backtracking), so in this case, the analysis of one document (which contains macros) would take too much time. Interpreting or emulating a macro would lead to either false positives errors or macro viruses not detected.\n\nAnother type of anti-virus, the integrety checker anti-virus, in some cases, doesn't work : it only checks all documents with extensions DOT or DOC (indeed, some anti-virus producers suggest to their users), but Word documents can reside in others extensions than those two and the content of the document tends to change often. So, like the heuristic analysis, this can lead to false positives errors, due to the fact that this type of anti-virus checks the whole document.\nThe last type of anti-virus seen will be the virus-specific scanner. It searches the signature of viruses, so, the type of anti-virus is weakest than the previous ones.\nIndeed, the viruses which are detected by virus-specific scanners are just the ones knew by the producers of the software (so, more updates are needed than others types of scanners). Moreover, this type of anti-virus is really weak against morphing viruses (cf.section above), if a macro virus change its content (so, its signature), it can no more be detected by the virus-specific scanners even if it's the same virus which do the same actions. Its signature doesn't match the one declare in the virus scanner.\n\nAdditional to the responsibility of the anti-virus, there is a responsibility of the users : if a potential macro virus is detected, the user can choose what to do with it : ignore it, quarantine it or destroy it, but the last option is the most dangerous.\nThe anti-virus can activate some destructives macro viruses which destroy some data when they are deleted by the anti virus.\nSo, both of the virus scanners and the users are responsible of the security and the integrity of the documents/computer.\nFurthermore, even if the anti-virus aren't optimal in the virus detection, most of the macro viruses are detected and the progression in the virus detection improve but with the creation of new macro viruses.\n\nText-substitutions macros can be separated of the compiler (like in C) but they will not be securised. Or they can be integrated in the compiler but this will limit their utilisation.\nMarco is a solution allowing macros with both advantage and so, improving the productivity of the programmer, in particular for multi-languages applications. Indeed, it is independent from the language, the only requirement is that the compiler of the target language produce descriptive error messages with location and cause of errors.\nMarco also needs a module and a plug-in to understand a language. The plug-in must contain three oracles: one that check for syntactic well-formedness, one to determine a fragment's free names and the last one to test whether a fragment captures a given name. For the moment, it is just a prototype and it will only support C++ and SQL. Marco proves that safe code using macros can be well-encapsulated and language-scalable at the same time.\n\nAn example of macro language allowing type-safe macros. MacroML is an expressive, typed language that supports generative macros.\nMacros are translated into the target language, MetaML and it gives a well-type program without runtime errors.\n\nThere will always be faults in the world of viruses. Fortunately, a lot of macro viruses can be countered with good anti-virus.\nThis section presents characteristics that anti-virus should have to protect from macro-viruses.\n\nFirst, specific anti-virus products will not really affect this kind of virus, anti-virus analyzing the content will be more efficient.\nAlso, there is something to notice: the modification process is relatively slow and is noticeable by the user.\nIn order to protect from these macros viruses, a scanner has to detect all elements of the chain and remove them properly.\nThe anti-virus has to detect all macros of the virus but also any remnants of them. In the example of \"Colors\", the anti-virus must not detect that Microsoft's ScanProt (macro virus protection tool) contains remnants of the virus but the problem is that ScanProt does contain parts of the virus.\nThere is another problem, if a virus B is created by modifying some macros of a virus A which consists in a set of macros, then the virus B could be detected as a remnant of A but the anti-virus would only identify (and remove) the non-modified macros.\nAfter that, in some cases, the replication of the virus (which does not contain original macros of A now) could be successful. In fact, the anti-virus would have created a new virus.\n\nAnti-virus have to be updated very easily and fast to counter these viruses. A lot of informations is added every day and the performance of the anti-virus must not drop while updates.\nThe problem here is that there is not an easily identifiable set of macros, the anti-virus have to parse the body of the macro and identify and cut parts added by the macro viruses (fortunately, this task is not difficult to achieve).\n\n"}

{"id": "146808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146808", "title": "Non-lethal weapon", "text": "Non-lethal weapon\n\nNon-lethal weapons, also called less-lethal weapons, less-than-lethal weapons, non-deadly weapons, compliance weapons, or pain-inducing weapons are weapons intended to be less likely to kill a living target than conventional weapons such as knives and firearms. It is often understood that unintended or incidental casualties are risked wherever force is applied, but non-lethal weapons try to minimise the risk as much as possible. Non-lethal weapons are used in policing and combat situations to limit the escalation of conflict where employment of lethal force is prohibited or undesirable, where rules of engagement require minimum casualties, or where policy restricts the use of conventional force.\n\nNon-lethal weapons may be used by conventional military in a range of missions across the force continuum. They may also be used by military police, by United Nations forces, and by occupation forces for peacekeeping and stability operations. Non-lethal weapons may also be used to channelize a battlefield, control the movement of civilian populations, or to limit civilian access to restricted areas (as they were utilized by the USMC's 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Somalia in 1995). When used by police forces domestically, similar weapons, tactics, techniques and procedures are often called \"less lethal\" or \"less than lethal\" and are employed in riot control, prisoner control, crowd control, refugee control, and self-defense.\n\nIn the past, military and police faced with undesirable escalation of conflict had few acceptable options. Military personnel guarding embassies often found themselves restricted to carrying unloaded weapons. National guards or policing forces charged with quelling riots were able to use only batons or similar club-like weapons, or bayonet or saber charges, or fire live ammunition at crowds. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Non-lethality Policy Review Group at U.S. Global Strategy Council in Washington and other independent think tanks around the world called for a concerted effort to develop weapons that were more life-conserving, environmentally friendly, and fiscally responsible than weapons available at that time. The U.S. Congress and other governments agreed and began an organized development of non-lethal weapons to provide a range of options between talking and shooting.\n\nRecognizing the need to limit the escalation of force, research and development of a range of non-lethal weapons has since been undertaken internationally by governments and weapons manufacturers to fill the need for such weapons. Some non-lethal weapons may provide more effective riot control than firearms, truncheons or bayonets with less risk of loss of life or serious injury. Before the general availability of early military non-lethal weapons in the mid 1990s, war-fighters had few or no casualty-limiting options for the employment of scalable force and were continually at risk whenever lethal force was prohibited during sensitive missions.\n\nIn 2001 the United States Marine Corps revealed its development of a less-than-lethal energy weapon called the Active Denial System, a focused high frequency microwave device said to be capable of heating all living matter in the target area rapidly and continuously for the duration of the beam, causing transient intolerable pain but no lasting damage. The skin temperature of a person subjected to this weapon can jump to approximately in as little as 2 seconds depending on the skin's starting temperature. The system is nonlethal (the penetration of the beam into human skin is only a few millimeters).\n\nIn 2004, author Jon Ronson cited an unclassified military report titled \"Non-Lethal Weapons: Terms and References\" 21 acoustic weapons were listed, in various stages of development, including the Infrasound (\"Very low-frequency sound which can travel long distances and easily penetrate most buildings and vehicles ... biophysical effects are projected to be: nausea, loss of bowels, disorientation, vomiting, potential internal organ damage or death may occur. Superior to ultrasound...)\", however no such effects had been achieved .\n\nIn 2011, the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Reference Book was created. The weapons in this book are currently in development.\n\nUntil the development of non-lethal weapons, police officers around the world had few if any non-lethal options for riot control. Common tactics used by police that were intended to be non-lethal or less lethal included a slowly advancing wall of men with batons, officers on horses trained to deal with policing situations, or a charge into a riot using the flats of sabers. Other reasonably successful approaches included shotguns with lower-powered cartridges, \"salt shells\", using bean-bag rounds and ricocheting the shot off of the ground. In the mid-20th century, with the integration of fire-control systems into major cities, police found that high-pressure fire hoses could be effective in dispersing a crowd (the use of water cannons and fire trucks has remained an effective nonlethal tactic to disperse riots). Trained police dogs were also commonly used to scare and disperse rioters and apprehend individuals. In the 1980s the development of the high-tensile plastics Kevlar and Lexan revolutionized personal armor and shields, and led to new tactics for riot squads and other special-purpose teams. Officers could now stand up against violent rioters throwing dangerous projectiles without having to resort to lethal methods to quickly disperse the danger. Coupled with the introduction of effective non-lethal chemical agents such as tear gas and offensive odor canisters, and non-lethal impact rounds such as rubber bullets and \"bean bag\" flexible baton rounds, riot tactics were modified to rely less on violent response to attacking rioters than on a return to the slowly advancing wall, with supporting officers firing non-lethal ordnance into the crowd to discourage advance.\n\nPolice officers on patrol were traditionally armed with a baton or pistol or both, and non-lethal methods of subduing an attacker centered on hand-fighting techniques such as jujutsu and baton use. In the 1980s and 1990s officers began deploying non-lethal personal sidearms such as pepper sprays, and eventually electroshock weapons such as Tasers, which were developed for use by police and also found a market in self-defense by private citizens. However, these weapons were developed for non-lethal resolution of a one-on-one conflict.\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s (decade) interest in various other forms of less-than-lethal weapons for military and police use rose. Amongst other factors, the use of less-than-lethal weapons may be legal under international law and treaty in situations where weapons such as aerosol sprays or gases defined as chemical are not. Less-than-lethal weapons are also useful in keeping the peace in the aftermath of violent conflict.\n\nBetween the years of 1987–1990 after a three-year field study by the FBI's Firearm's Training Unit; In 1990 the use of Oleoresin Capsicum was first issued and used by the FBI as the first official law enforcement agency.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) police began to adopt a new pepper spray delivery system based on the equipment used in paintballs. A specialized paintball, called a \"pepperball\", is filled with liquid or powdered capsaicin, the active ingredient in pepper spray, and is propelled by compressed gas using a paintball marker similar to those used for the sport but operating at higher pressure. The impact of the capsule is immediately painful (a pepperball's shell is thicker than a standard paintball and is fired at higher velocity), and it breaks open on impact, dispersing the capsaicin with similar effect to aerosol-delivered pepper spray. However, to be most effective, pepper spray must contact the eyes, nose, or mouth of the target; pepper spray on clothing or tougher skin has a much reduced effect.\n\nNon-lethal weapons' ability to incapacitate with minimal lasting effects has made them the weapon of choice for use in civilian populations. However, some analysts describe \"non-lethal\" as a misnomer and instead define them as \"less-lethal\".\n\nNon-lethal weapons are intended to minimize injury or death. While people are occasionally seriously injured or killed by these weapons, fatalities are relatively infrequent. Causes of death from non-lethal weapons are varied and occasionally uncertain. Misplaced or ricocheting shots, pre-existing medical conditions, inadequate user training, repetitive applications and intentional misuse have been implicated in different cases where death has occurred.\n\nAs different parts of the body differ in vulnerability, and because people vary in weight and fitness, any weapon powerful enough to incapacitate may be capable of killing under certain circumstances. Thus \"non-lethal force\" does have some risk of causing death: in this context \"non-lethal\" means only \"not \"intended\" to kill\".\n\nSeveral groups maintain there is great room for improvement in non-lethal weapons and procedures for their use. Claims for the relative safety of such weapons are usually contingent on their being used \"properly\". For example, the rubber bullets developed during the 1960s were supposed to be fired at the ground and hit the target only after ricochet, and other non-lethal bullets are designed to be fired at the lower body; they can be lethal if fired directly at the head, as commonly happens.\n\nNon-lethal rounds are firearm rounds which are designed to incapacitate, but not kill, a target. The rounds rely on the transfer of kinetic energy and blunt force trauma to accomplish this incapacitation. Rubber bullets, rubber buckshot, soft polymer rounds, wax bullets, plastic bullets, beanbag rounds, sponge grenades, ring airfoil projectiles (both kinetic and tear gas projectiles) and rubber bullets with electroshock effect (e.g. Taser XREP rounds) are less lethal than conventional metal bullets, and are also propelled at lower speed by using less propellant. \"Bean bag\" type bullets are sometimes referred to as flexible baton rounds. More recently, high-velocity paintball guns are also used to launch less-lethal rounds, including the FN 303 launcher and PepperBall commercial products. There is also the Variable Velocity Weapon Concept, for which a propulsion energy source may not yet have been clearly established and/or finalized. In any case, all of these technologies apply the same basic mechanism, which is to launch a mass at the target that interacts kinetically.\nHand grenades come in several less-lethal varieties, such as \"flashbang\" (stun) grenades, \"sting\" grenades with rubber shrapnel, and grenades designed to release chemical irritants (described below).\n\nIn 1972 stun grenades were used to capture the hijacked Sabena Flight 571, allowing the Israeli forces headed by Ehud Barak and including Benjamin Netanyahu to storm the plane and take it over within 10 minutes while capturing two terrorists and killing Ali Taha, the leader of the terrorist group and his aide, while rescuing all passengers (three were wounded, and one died of her injuries several days later).\n\nA stun grenade was apparently used by members of the IHH against the IDF soldiers during the Gaza flotilla raid at the beginning of the IDF storming of the Mavi Marmara.\n\nIn June 2010 in Kenya, a stun grenade was used to draw attention, and then a real grenade along with an explosive package were used, killing many people. In April during the 2010 Kyrgyzstani uprising police attempted to use stun grenades to stop a demonstration but the crowd overwhelmed the police. In March stun grenades were used by Belorussian police in Minsk against demonstrators, and again in September they were used by Greek police in Athens. In both cases the demonstrations were dispersed with no injuries.\n\nIn February 2011 stun grenades were seen used by Egyptian police against rioters.\n\nWater cannons are commonly used in crowd and riot control, for dispersal or to prevent movement on a particular position. These water cannons are like pressure washers, but not quite as strong. Water-filled rounds for small arms are in experimental stages.\nElectrified water cannon was in development but was abandoned.\n\nMalodorants produce smells so horrible they cause people to leave the affected area. In 2008, the Israeli Defence Forces began using Skunk for crowd control. It is a form of mist sprayed from a water cannon, which leaves a terrible odor of rot or sewage on whatever it touches, and does not wash off easily.\n\nThe active ingredient in pepper spray is oleoresin capsicum (OC), an acrid irritant chemical derived from cayenne pepper plants.\n\nA 1998 estimate by the Internet Association of Chiefs of Police suggested at least 113 pepper spray-related fatalities had occurred in the United States, all with aggravating factors such as intoxication, pre-existing health problems, or from the police use of airway-restrictive immobilizing holds that can cause positional asphyxia. The Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union recommends against maximal prone restraint techniques following pepper spray application, and they caution that anyone sprayed should be monitored to ensure effective breathing.\n\nThe use of chemical weapons such as tear gas (CS) and pepper spray (OC) has come under increasing scrutiny and criticism due to studies showing serious long term side effects. Many police forces are no longer exposing their members to the chemicals during training.\n\nJournalist Rubén Salazar was killed in Los Angeles in 1970 by an errant CS gas canister during the Chicano riots. Other serious injuries and fatalities have occurred from either tear gas itself or the projectiles it is delivered in, including the critical injury of veteran Scott Olsen from a tear gas canister during the 2011 Occupy Oakland protests.\n\nOften promoted for self-defense, mace is a spray of various formulations, that may include tear gas, pepper spray, and phenacyl chloride.\n\nPsychochemical weapons are psychoactive drugs, such as BZ, LSD, Kolokol-1, EA-3167, and 3-Methylamphetamine designed to have a disorienting effect when used during combat or interrogation.\n\nDuring the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis, Russian special forces used an unidentified gas (thought to be 3-methylfentanyl or another fentanyl variant dissolved in halothane gas) in an attempt to induce sleep in both hostages and terrorists. Many of the hostages and terrorists (including all of the suicide bombers) were anesthetized, but some terrorists donned gas masks and thus were able to avoid the effects of the gas. Because the agent used was a potent Fentanyl derivative (a synthetic opioid), it causes respiratory depression and ultimately respiratory failure if administered in high enough dosages. The central nervous system effects, such as anesthesia and respiratory depression could have been reversed by an opioid antagonist such as naloxone, which is stocked by hospitals and most ambulances. However, because the Russian authorities did not release any information regarding what type of agent was used, medical professionals were unaware that an opioid had been used during the rescue attempt and thus were unable to administer the antidote which could have saved most hostages. Approximately 700 hostages were rescued, while 130 died from exposure to the gas. All the terrorists were ultimately killed by Russian forces through some combination of gas exposure and gunfire.\n\nBlister agents, including CR gas, are less often used riot control agents. Other irritants include CS gas and nonivamide (PAVA).\n\nSticky foam was tried by the U.S. Marine Corps in the peacekeeping Operation United Shield in 1995 with some success, but as a result various complications in its field use were also discovered.\n\nArea denial weapons work by either incapacitating or deterring the enemy.\n\nVehicle stoppers include a wide range of methods and devices meant to disable a vessel or vehicle to prevent attack by an oncoming vessel or vehicle or to stop that vessel or vehicle for evaluation. Vessel and vehicle stoppers may include kinetic, chemical, or electromagnetic means.\n\nCaltrops are known to have been in use since Roman times and may have been used earlier: the concept was familiar to the 4th century BC Greeks, who used rocks, brush, nets and trees placed in the path of enemy conveyances on land or ensnarement devices hidden under water to achieve the same result: stop the enemy or suspected hostile in his tracks for examination or to prevent or limit incursions. Contemporary caltrops look something like large jacks from the childhood game. Placed in the path of oncoming wheeled or tracked vehicles, they are meant to foul wheels, destroy tires and tracks, and incapacitate vehicles.\n\nSimple rows or clusters of sharpened sticks (also known as punji sticks), and the use of small caltrops have been a feature of anti-infantry warfare for a long time. However, due to the difficulty of mass-producing them in the pre-modern age, they were rarely used except in the defense of limited areas or chokepoints, especially during sieges, where they were used to help seal breaches. Increasing ease of production still did not prevent these methods from slowly falling out of favor from the late Middle Ages onward.\nCaltrops are still sometimes used in modern conflicts, such as during the Korean War, where Chinese troops, often wearing only light shoes, were particularly vulnerable. In modern times, special caltrops are also sometimes used against wheeled vehicles with pneumatic tires. Some South American urban guerrillas as the Tupamaros and Montoneros called them \"miguelitos\" and used these as a tactic to avoid pursuit after ambushes.\n\nIn current usage a riot gun or less-lethal launcher is a type of firearm that is used to fire \"\"non-lethal\" or \"less-lethal\" ammunition for the purpose of suppressing riots. Less-lethal launchers may be special purpose firearms designed for riot control use, or standard firearms, usually shotguns and grenade launchers, adapted to riot control use with appropriate ammunition. The ammunition is most commonly found in 12 gauge (.729 inches) shotguns and 37mm and 40 mm (1.46 and 1.57 inches) grenade launchers.\n\nIn the United States, the term riot gun more commonly refers to a riot shotgun.\n\nElectroshock weapons are incapacitant weapons used for subduing a person by administering electric shock aimed at disrupting superficial muscle functions. One type is a conductive energy device (CED), an electroshock gun popularly known by the brand name \"Taser\", which fires projectiles that administer the shock through a thin, flexible wire. Other electroshock weapons such as stun guns, stun batons, and electroshock belts administer an electric shock by direct contact.\n\nDirected energy weapons are weapons that emit energy in an aimed direction without the means of a projectile. They are non-lethal and can immobilize people as well as machines (e.g. vehicles). Directed energy weapons include electromagnetic weapons, (including laser weapons) and microwave weapons, particle beam weapons, sonic weapons and plasma weapons.\n\nHSV Technologies, Inc. (Stood for the last names of the original founders, Herr, Schlesinger and Vernon; this is NOT the same company as Holden Special Vehicles), formerly of San Diego, California, USA, then Port Orchard, WA, designed a non-lethal device which was profiled in the 2002 \"TIME\" magazine article \"Beyond the Rubber Bullet\". It is an electrolaser using ultraviolet laser beams of 193 nm, and promises to immobilize living targets at a distance without contact. There is plan for an engine-disabling variation for use against the electronic ignitions of cars using a 248 nm laser. The lead inventor, Eric Herr, died in 2008 and the company appears to have been dissolved, with their website defunct as of September 2017.\n\nPulsed Energy Projectile or PEP is a technology of non-lethal directed energy weaponry currently under development by the U.S. military. It involves the emission of an invisible laser pulse which, upon contact with the target, ablates the surface and creates a small amount of exploding plasma. This produces a pressure wave that stuns the target and knocks them off their feet, and electromagnetic radiation that affects nerve cells causing a painful sensation. The technology can also be used as a lethal weapon, and indeed an early name was \"pulsed impulsive kill laser\".\n\nThe pulsed energy projectile is intended for riot control and is said to work over distances of up to 2 km. It weighs about 230 kg and will probably be mounted on vehicles. The weight could become lighter as laser production technology improves.\n\nThe system was developed by Mission Research Corporation (now owned by Orbital ATK). It uses a chemical deuterium fluoride laser device producing infrared laser pulses. The plasma (produced by the early part of the pulse) explodes because its electrons absorb the energy of the later part of the pulse.\n\nIn 2003, a US military review reported that the electromagnetic radiation produced by PEPs had been shown to cause pain and temporary paralysis in animal experiments.\n\nUnited States Special Operations Command FY 2010 plans included starting developmental work on a Counter UAV Pulsed Energy Projectile.\n\nThe Active Denial System (ADS) weapon system is a dish that projects electromagnetic radiation just powerful enough to penetrate human skin and make the nervous system think the victim is on fire, although no physical damage is done. Future combat vehicles such as the American GCV Infantry Fighting Vehicle will incorporate non-lethal weapons.\nThe Active Denial System is a non-lethal, directed-energy weapon developed by the U.S. military, designed for area denial, perimeter security and crowd control. Informally, the weapon has also been referred to as a heat ray, since it works by heating the surface of targets, such as the skin of targeted human subjects.\n\nIn 2011, the ADS was redesigned to make it smaller, more reliable, and able to be used on the move. ADS II is being designed to operate from moving aircraft, as well as moving ground vehicles. The redesign does not address problems in different environmental conditions.\n\nAir Force Special Operations Command is experimenting with mounting an ADS on the AC-130J Ghostrider gunship to target threatening crowds or individuals on the ground. This is to give the gunship a non-lethal option so the crew has more engagement options. Due to the increasing number of engagements in populated areas, the Air Force is aiming to field a system within 5–10 years to have enough aircraft available with non-lethal systems. The aircraft will apparently use the ADS II version.\n\nA Dazzler is a directed-energy weapon intended to temporarily blind or disorient its target with intense directed radiation. Targets can include sensors or human vision. Dazzlers emit infrared or invisible light against various electronic sensors, and visible light against humans, when they are intended to cause no long-term damage to eyes. The emitters are usually lasers, making what is termed a \"laser dazzler\". Most of the contemporary systems are man-portable, and operate in either the red (a laser diode) or green (a diode-pumped solid-state laser, DPSS) areas of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nInitially developed for military use, non-military products are becoming available for use in law enforcement and security.\n\nWeapons designed to cause permanent blindness are banned by the 1995 United Nations Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons. The dazzler is a non-lethal weapon intended to cause temporary blindness or disorientation and therefore falls outside this protocol.\nThe personnel halting and stimulation response rifle (PHASR) is a prototype non-lethal laser dazzler developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Directed Energy Directorate, U.S. Department of Defense. Its purpose is to temporarily disorient and blind a target. Blinding laser weapons have been tested in the past, but were banned under the 1995 UN Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, which the United States acceded to on 21 January 2009. The PHASR rifle, a low-intensity laser, is not prohibited under this regulation, as the blinding effect is intended to be temporary. It also uses a two-wavelength laser. The PHASR was tested at Kirtland Air Force Base, part of the Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate in New Mexico.\n\nSeveral nations developed blinding laser weapons and they were allegedly used during War in Donbass by Russia.\n\nThe LRAD is the round black device on top of the New York City police Hummer.\nThe Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) is an acoustic hailing device developed by LRAD Corporation to send messages and warning tones over longer distances or at higher volume than normal loudspeakers. LRAD systems are used for long range communications in a variety of applications including as a means of non-lethal, non-kinetic crowd control. Though they have been called \"sonic weapons\", LRADs are not inherently for military use.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer's specifications, the systems weigh from and can emit sound in a 30°- 60° beam at 2.5 kHz. The manufacturer also produces systems for public address and mass notification use that broadcast 360°.\n\nIn the United States, the University of Texas-Austin Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT) conducts basic research to advance electrodynamics and hypervelocity physics related to electromagnetic weapons.\n\nAlthough generally considered 'non-lethal weapons', electromagnetic weapons do pose health threats to humans. In fact, \"non-lethal weapons can sometimes be deadly.\"\n\nUnited States Department of Defense policy explicitly states that non-lethal weapons \"shall not be required to have a zero probability of producing fatalities or permanent injuries.\" Although a Human Effects Advisory Panel was established in 1998 to provide independent assessment on human effects, data, and models for the use of 'non-lethal weapons' on the general population, the TECOM Technology Symposium in 1997 concluded on non-lethal weapons: \"Determining the target effects on personnel is the greatest challenge to the testing community,\" primarily because \"the potential of injury and death severely limits human tests.\" However, \"directed energy weapons that target the central nervous system and cause neurophysiological disorders\" may violate the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons of 1980. And weapons that go beyond non-lethal intentions and cause \"superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering\" could violate the Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1977.\" Safety and evaluation of the physical and psychological effects of the long-term or repetitive uses of the pain-inducing non-lethal weapons on humans have not been well understood or studied in any great details. Any such studies require explicit consent of all participants so as not to violate the UN Convention against torture and other cruelties.\n\nPepper spray is one non-lethal weapon alleged to have been misused by American police. In two incidents in California in 1997, police swabbed pepper spray directly into the eyes of protesters. Amnesty International condemned these actions, and claimed that they were likely a violation of the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nLoren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute in Virginia states that: \"The relevant (electromagnetic weapon) technology is well within the grasp of some countries and transnational terrorist groups\", and further states that U.S. hardware is susceptible to microwave and other directed-energy weapons.\n\nSuitable materials and tools to create electromagnetic weapons are commonly available. \"The threat of electromagnetic bomb proliferation is very real.\"\n\n"}

When Louis II of Hungary was born in 1506, the Szeklers refused to pay this tax, therefore, king Vladislas II of Hungary sent Pál Tomori to Transylvania in order to collect the tax, but his troops were beaten at Marosvásárhely () by the Szeklers.\n"}
{"id": "32333286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32333286", "title": "PAMI", "text": "PAMI\n\nPAMI (; ) is a public health insurance agency in Argentina managed by the Ministry of Health.\n\nAdministered under the aegis of the \"Instituto Nacional de Servicios Sociales para Jubilados y Pensionados\" (National Institute of Social Services for Retirees and Pensioners, or INSSJP), PAMI serves senior citizens, and veterans of the 1982 Falklands War.\n\nPAMI maintains 37 regional offices and 550 local offices for its over 4 million enrollees. The agency provides free medicine to 650,000 pensioners and retirees, 87% of whom earn the minimum pension of around US$200 a month. Another 13% receive a benefit of the high cost of their treatment, in cases where this exceeds a retiree's income. The agency covers 100% of the cost of drugs to treat cancer, AIDS, and other chronic medical conditions. Medications for hypertension, which affects nearly nine of out of ten seniors in Argentina, are covered with an 80% discount, including prescription drugs for cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. The agency covers over 2,000 stent insertions annually, as well as over 6,000 pacemaker implants (70% of those provided in Argentina).\n\nPAMI covers around 25 million doctor's visits and nearly 2 million prescriptions annually. Surgical procedures covered by the agency in 2009 included over 55,000 for cataracts, 50,000 intraocular lenses, 20,000 hip and knee surgeries, and 700 organ transplants. Other benefits include kinesiology, legal aid, mental health, and funeral expense assistance. Benefits represent 10% of the total pension payments issued by ANSES, the national social security agency. The real market value of the medical services, medicine, and other services provided by PAMI, however, amount to 30% of retirees' income. the total expenditure on drugs for PAMI in 2010 was almost us$750 million; were retirees to pay the market price of these drugs, their cost would have approximated us$3 billion. Private health insurance is widely available in Argentina. The cost of premiums for those over age 60 would be unaffordable to most retirees, however, as these average around us$150 per person per month.\n\nHistorically, health expenses in Argentina were met on an out-of-pocket basis, or through a number of mutual aid societies and health care co-operatives established by guilds, as well as by immigrant associations. Health care co-operatives developed into employer and trade union sponsored \"obras sociales\" beginning in 1910. They expanded rapidly during the administration of President Juan Perón from 1946 to 1955, when unionization was fostered. Health coverage for senior citizens remained sparse, however, and those who could retain their \"obra social\" generally received less adequate care than younger enrollees.\n\nPAMI was thus established to absorb the growing number of seniors on the initiative of Social Welfare Minister Francisco Manrique, and was signed into law by President Alejandro Lanusse via Decree 19.032, on May 13, 1971. The insurer functioned only in Buenos Aires at its outset, though by 1976, it had opened offices in all the nation's provinces. PAMI established a network of affiliated general practitioners, and negotiated rates and prices with other \"obras sociales\", health care federations such as the Argentine Medical Association, and with local governments. It also financed other needs affecting seniors, notably a mortgage loan program benefiting thousands whose homes were slated for demolition in 1978, during the construction of new freeways in Buenos Aires by Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore.\n\nThe prolonged economic downturn of the 1980s affected the agency's finances, however. President Raúl Alfonsín placed PAMI under Federal intervention in March 1988, and appointed the former Governor of Buenos Aires, Dr. Alejandro Armendáriz, as head of the Crisis Management Commission. The agency's finances were stabilized by September, and the crisis commission was dissolved in favor of a panel presided by Argentina's two leading senior citizens' advocacy groups. PAMI was restored to solvency while adding spousal benefits and vacation subsidies for beneficiaries. Accordingly, Alfonsín signed Law 23.660 on January 5, 1989, which made affiliation in PAMI mandatory for all registered employees, and enacted a 6% payroll tax to that effect.\n\nThe agency's financial crisis was compounded by a series of administrative crises during the subsequent administration of President Carlos Menem. Menem's third appointee to the post, Matilde Menéndez, and most of her board of advisers would be indicted for fraud stemming from contracts signed during her 1992—94 tenure. The 1995 recession cut its revenues from US$3.1 billion to US$2.4 billion, and led to a US$1.2 billion debt. Alejandro Bramer Markovic was appointed in 1996 with a mandate to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse at the insurer, only to resign the following year amid accusations of excessive spending on outside auditing services. His successor, Víctor Alderete, remained at the post until the end of Menem's presidency in 1999. His tenure, however, was marked by subcontractor cost overruns, and he faced over 20 charges to that related to these.\n\nPAMI had entered a crisis stage. The agency's annual budget declined to US$900 million in 2003. Coverage, in addition, was managed through a system consisting of 72 intermediaries whose costs reached 50% of the agency's benefits spending, and the resulting deficits at PAMI prompted a reduction in prescription drug coverage to 40% by 2003. These developments led most retirees to opt out of the system, and membership declined from four million in 1992 to 900,000 by 2003, or fewer than one fourth of Argentine seniors.\n\nThe administrations of Presidents Néstor and Cristina Kirchner prioritized the agency in their budget policy, and from 2003 to 2010, budgets for PAMI increased from 2.6 billion pesos to 15.6 billion pesos, or 500%. Its related social assistance programs were expanded, and 800,000 seniors received nutritional, rent, and other assistance from PAMI. The agency's chronic deficits were reversed, and by 2010, it maintained a reserve fund of aroundUS$1.75 billion. Its enrollment also recovered, and services were provided to a total of 3.7 million patients in 2009, or 89% of the agency's members.\n\n"}

Officially incorporated on September 4, 1980, its co-founders included Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan and Time Inc. chairman and CEO Andrew Heiskell. PFAW began as a project of the Tides Foundation, a donor-advised fund that directs money to politically liberal causes.\n\nFormer presidents of PFAW include Tony Podesta and Ralph Neas.\n\nSoon after its founding, PFAW launched an affiliated 501(c)(3) organization, People for the American Way Foundation, for the purpose of conducting more extensive educational and research activities for left-wing causes. Later, the People for the American Way Voters Alliance was launched as a political action committee.\n\nPFAW has been active in battles over judicial nominations, opposing U.S. Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, Brett Kavanaugh and supporting the nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor.PFAW is also active in federal elections, donating $339,874 to oppose Republican candidates in the 2014 election cycle, and $351,075 to oppose Republican candidates in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nPFAW, a left-wing group, monitors what it characterizes as \"right-wing\" activities. Toward this end, the organization sponsors a website called \"Right Wing Watch\", which showcases video footage of groups and individuals who take conservative stances on social issues. The web site was founded in 2007, expanding on PFAW's earlier practice of VHS recording controversial clips from conservative television programs, such as Pat Robertson's \"700 Club\", for distribution to news media. The site has been repeatedly accused of copyright infringement for its practices. In 2013, evangelist and politician Gordon Klingenschmitt sent DMCA takedown notices for Right Wing Watch's using clips of his program, in which Right Wing Watch was defended by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nIn 2014, Jason and David Benham lost the opportunity to host their own HGTV television show after Right Wing Watch labeled the brothers as \"anti-gay, anti-choice extremists\" because of their statements at various events about homosexuality. In response, David Benham said, \"We love all people. I love homosexuals. I love Islam, Muslims, and my brother and I would never discriminate. Never have we – never would we.\"\n\nIn 2018, Jared Holt, a Right Wing Watch researcher was credited for getting conservative radio show host Alex Jones's \"InfoWars\" program removed from multiple content distribution sites, including Apple, Inc, YouTube, Facebook, and Spotify. Afterwards Holt says he received death threats.\n\nRight Wing Watch has been used as a source on the American right wing by NPR, \"Fortune\", The Daily Beast, The Huffington Post, and Fox News.\n\nMichael Keegan is the organization's president. Members of the group's board of directors included John Hall Buchanan, Jr., Alec Baldwin, Seth MacFarlane, Mary Frances Berry, Julian Bond, Bertis Downs IV, James Hormel, Dolores Huerta, Jane Lynch, Josh Sapan, Dennis Van Roekel, Howie Klein and Reg Weaver.\n\nMajor donors to PFAW include George Soros' Open Society Institute, the Miriam G. and Ira D.

{"id": "34147414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34147414", "title": "Policy experimentation", "text": "Policy experimentation\n\nPolicy experimentation points to political-administrative procedures and initiatives that allow to discover or test novel instruments of problem-solving and thereby propel broader-based policy innovation or institutional adaptation in a given polity, economy or society.\n\nAs compared to centralized legislation or national regulation, one of the major advantages of decentralized policy experimentation is seen in allowing spatially, sectorally or temporally limited policy trials that reduce the risks and costs of introducing major reform schemes to the national polity, economy and society. A major deficit of policy experimentation is seen in promoting policy heterogeneity, legal fragmentation and jurisdictional disparities.\n\nThe term has come to renewed prominence in the discussion about the political processes behind China's economic rise since the beginning of Chinese economic reform policies in 1978.\n\nPolicy experimentation often just paraphrases the cycles of policy reversals and policy re-prioritization that are characteristic of all political systems if established policies come to be seen as failing, too costly, or politically risky.\n\nIn a stricter definition policy experimentation implies a policy process in which experimenting units try out a variety of methods and processes to find imaginative solutions to predefined tasks or to new challenges that emerge during experimental activity. Policy experimentation is not equivalent to freewheeling trial and error or spontaneous policy diffusion. It is a purposeful and coordinated activity geared to producing novel policy options that are injected into official policymaking and then replicated on a larger scale, or even formally incorporated into national law.\n\nIn more technical terms, experimentation aims “to inform policy by using experiments with direct interventions and control groups instead of observational studies or theoretical analyses”\n\nIf policy experimentation is designed and evaluated by social scientists as part of government-sponsored pilot programs, it is usually limited to narrowly defined trial measures and preselected target groups. It often is confined to the fine-tuning of implementation technicalities (such as testing the suitability of a new social security card in a pilot site), but only very rarely to substantive policy formulation (such as the extent, focus, or budgeting of social policies) that are the object of complex bargaining processes in which tactical political considerations weigh much heavier than outside expertise.\n\nTransformative policy experimentation is much more comprehensive and ambitious since it strives to alter economic and administrative behavior and institutions. Such experimentation also opens up entirely new market segments and establishes new types of corporate organization, thereby regularly moving beyond the originally defined test groups and procedures and involving policymakers on different levels of the political system. Mosteller sees such “reorganization experiments” as the most difficult to carry out because they depend on a chain of complex interrelations, may require a great deal of time and resources, tend to provoke stiff political opposition, have to deal with ongoing contextual changes, and are subject to political-administrative interference and changes of the rules of the game in the middle of the experimental process. Transformative experimentation usually comes in the shape of demonstration projects taking place in a politically realistic—i.e., fluid, disturbed, and contested—context that escapes strict scientific controls, but can give a fuller view of the workings of novel policies and their impact on major social, market, or administrative actors.\n\nPolicy experimentation in this variant constitutes a distinct mode of governance that differs in one fundamental way from standard assumptions about policymaking. The conventional model of the policy process that is widely taken for granted by jurists, economists, and political scientists holds that policy analysis, formulation, and embodiment in legislation precede implementation. But policy experimentation means innovating through implementation first, and drafting universal laws and regulations later.\n\nAt first sight, policy experimentation displays commonalities with what Lindblom characterizes as the incremental method of successive limited comparisons in making public policy: the exploratory, reversible character of policymaking and the prior reduction of political antagonisms by avoiding drastic change at the outset. Yet, under certain conditions, experimentation can transcend incrementalist tinkering with existing practices and lead to drastic policy departures and transformative change marked by the emergence of new configurations of actors, interests, institutions, ideologies, and goals.\n\nIn democratic polities, policy experimentation comes as mostly small-scale explorative pilot projects, as pioneering legislation by individual states in federal systems (“states as laboratories”), as experimental or sunset clauses incorporated into formal legislation, or, very rarely, as a special dispensation for local administrative districts to be exempt from certain provisions of national law.\n\nFor the Chinese government, experimentation comes in three main forms as (1) experimental regulation (provisional rules made for trial implementation), (2) \"experimental points\" (model demonstrations and pilot projects in a specific policy domain), and (3) \"experimental zones\" (local jurisdictions with broad discretionary powers).\n\nHeilmann, Sebastian: Policy Experimentation in China’s Economic Rise, In: Studies in Comparative International Development (SCID), Vol. 43, No. 1 (Januar 2008): p. 1-26.\n"}

It was used by the provincial police between 1976 and 1979, during the Dirty War, to hold people with no formal charges and torture them, under the pretense of fighting radical left-wing political subversion and terrorism. Most of the detainees were in fact social activists, political dissidents, or merely relatives or acquaintances of people that were ideologically suspect in the eyes of the military junta of the self-styled National Reorganization Process.\n\nThe CPM occupies a corner of a large building that takes up a whole block in the city center, between Dorrego and Moreno and between Santa Fe and Córdoba St. It used to be the police headquarters, and during the Dirty War it was formally the home of an intelligence division of the provincial police (\"Servicio de Informaciones de la Unidad Regional II\").

{"id": "1928543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928543", "title": "Proliferation Security Initiative", "text": "Proliferation Security Initiative\n\nThe Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is a global effort that aims to stop trafficking of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), their delivery systems, and related materials to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern. Launched by United States President George W. Bush in May 2003 at a meeting in Kraków, Poland, the PSI has now grown to include the endorsement of 105 nations around the world, including Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Argentina, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, New Zealand, Republic of Korea and Norway. Despite the support of over half of the Members of the United Nations, a number of countries have expressed opposition to the initiative, including India, China and Indonesia.\n\nThe idea of the PSI is generally credited to John R. Bolton, former US Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, after 15 Scud missiles found on board an unflagged North Korean freighter, the \"So Sen\", heading towards Yemen had to be released when it turned out that international law did not allow them to be confiscated. Given this apparent gap in international law, several months later US President Bush announced the initiative with his counterpart, Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski at Wawel Castle in Kraków on May 31, 2003.\n\nInitially, the PSI included 11 \"core\" states (Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, the US and Poland). On September 4, 2003, in Paris, these countries detailed the principles governing the PSI in a document titled the \"Statement of Interdiction Principles\". The document defines the activities which are to be undertaken by the initiative, specifically \"to establish a more coordinated and effective basis through which to impede and stop shipments of WMD, delivery systems, and related materials flowing to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern, consistent with national legal authorities and relevant international law and frameworks, including the UN Security Council circumstances in which such operations may be carried out (at sea, on land, or in the air) including, most importantly, the requirement that any action taken must be consistent with international law.\" Since the initial core group of 2003, PSI has expanded to include an \"Operational Experts Group\" (OEG) of 21 nations as well as 84 other endorsing states. Key states who have endorsed the initiative since its initial founding include major actors in international trade such as Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, as well as countries such as Turkey and the Republic of Korea, who are geographically close to states designated by United Nations Security Council resolutions as proliferation threats.\n\nEleven nations have signed bilateral Mutual Shipboarding Agreements with the United States, allowing the mutual expedition of shipboarding requests for ships under those nations' flags. The Eleven are the Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Belize, Croatia, Cyprus, Liberia, Malta, the Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Panama and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Each of these nations maintains a large number of commercial vessels on their registries, and are often considered flag of convenience states.\n\nIn April 2009, at a speech in Prague, Czech Republic, newly inaugurated President Barack Obama announced that he planned to transform the PSI into a \"durable international institution\", indicating that US promotion of the initiative would remain non-partisan and cross over from the previous administration. Indeed, Obama had made the strengthening of the PSI one of his campaign promises in the Presidential election of 2008 and continued to promote the PSI through the 2010 White House Nuclear Security Strategy.\n\nThe 2013 PSI High Level Political Meeting facilitated the adoption of a set of four Joint Statements, advancing cooperation among PSI endorsing states toward:\n- Ensuring a Robust Initiative\n- Enhancing Critical Interdiction Capabilities and Practices\n- Strengthening Authorities for Action\n- Expanding Strategic Communications\n\nProgress on implementation was reviewed at the PSI Mid-Level Political Meeting in January 2016, hosted in Washington, DC. Another PSI High Level Political Meeting will be hosted in France in 2018. \n\nThe PSI has evolved considerably since 2003, embracing a much wider array of proliferation security issues, such as customs enforcement, export controls, proliferation finance, and intangible transfers of technology. Given its broad and flexible mandate, the PSI now plays a vital role in advancing proliferation security norms and standards of practice.\n\nThe primary role of PSI participants is to abide by the Statement of Interdiction Principles, with the primary purpose of interdicting subject weapons and materials. Additionally, participants are recommended to enact legal statutes to facilitate effective interdiction and seizure of such items. Finally, participants are to take measures to ensure that their national facilities are not utilized to transfer illicit weapon cargoes.\n\nThe PSI also supports the maintenance of an informal network of transgovernmental linkages that sustain cooperation outside of the formal PSI framework. \n\nIn the United States, the program is managed by the National Security Staff working out of the White House, with the United States Department of State and the United States Department of Defense playing lead roles; with other departments and agencies in supporting roles.\n\nParticipation in PSI activities generally include OEG meetings, live exercises, command post exercises, tabletop exercises, seminars, workshops, and other WMD Interdiction\ntraining. Current members include:\n\n\nEndorsing states are developing a formal set of tools called Critical Capabilities and Practices (CCP) for use by all PSI partners to aid in their ability to interdict WMD. An ongoing effort, the CCP is organized into four elements:\n\nElement 1. Prohibiting Proliferation-Related Conduct – Having in place appropriate legal authorities to prohibit and prevent proliferation activity within and across one’s border\n\nElement 2. Inspection and Identification – The ability to effectively inspect air, land, and sea cargos and to identify proliferation-related materials\n\nElement 3. Seizure and Disposition – The ability to undertake appropriate actions to seize and dispose of interdiction-related materials\n\nElement 4. Rapid Decision Making – The development of decision-making practices that facilitate timely government responses to interdiction scenarios\n\nExamples of these capacity building tools include:\n\n• Model Legislation\n\n• Commodity identification guides and associated training\n\n• Legal analyses of UN Security Council Resolutions\n\n• Expert briefings on inspection methodologies\n\n• Best practices associated with information sharing and decision-making procedures\n\nThe CCP effort is advanced by the CCP Review Team, launched in 2015. The Review Team seeks to enhance the resources available to PSI endorsing countries through compiling a library of tools and resources and through assisting in the coordination of capacity building events and exercises. Review Team members include: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia, and the United States.\n\nThe PSI has no central body or secretariat and is not a coordinator of real-world interdictions. It is a political commitment, a flexible arrangement of international cooperation and is consistent with domestic and international legal authorities. Endorsing states seek a robust capacity to conduct interdictions that usually involve only two or three governments.\n\nPSI activities include the regular holding of activities known as \"exercises,\" which aim to test the authorities and capabilities of endorsee nations to interdict WMD-related materials. Exercises can include \"live action\" events such as ship boardings or container searches, or be limited to \"tabletop\" activities where subject matter experts explore legal and operational interdiction questions related to a fictional scenario. Recent PSI exercises have included:\n\n•PHOENIX EXPRESS 2012 (May), a US-led maritime exercise, with a PSI inject, held in the Mediterranean Sea\n\n•PACIFIC SHIELD 2012 (July), a dedicated PSI exercise hosted by Japan, featuring an air scenario\n\n•PANAMAX 2012 (Aug), a joint U.S./Panama maritime exercise with a PSI inject\n\n•EASTERN ENDEAVOR 2012 (Sep), a dedicated PSI exercise hosted by South Korea, featuring a maritime scenario\n\n•Eastern European PSI Workshop (Nov 2012), hosted by Moldova, featuring a ground-based scenario\n\n•LEADING EDGE 2013 (Feb), a joint UAE/US dedicated PSI exercise featuring air, maritime and ground interdiction activities\n\n•SAHARAN EXPRESS 2013 (Mar), a US-led maritime exercise with a PSI inject, held off the West Coast of Africa\n\nCritics of PSI, such as China, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), argue that the declared intent of PSI members to stop ships on the high seas is a violation of international law guaranteeing freedom of the seas. In particular, it's argued that Article 23 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allows ships \"carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances\" the right of innocent passage through territorial seas. Opponents have asserted that the PSI gives states a license to carry out acts of \"piracy\" on the high seas. It has also been argued the PSI's intent to \"interdict nuclear materials and contraband\" is a broad enough charter to include any naval operation anywhere and for any actual purpose. There are concerns that such actions could lead to war. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda argued that the PSI \"initiative was not initiated through a multilateral process, but only a group of nations that have a common goal to conduct a certain initiatives.\" He also believed that PSI violates the UNCLOS. (Xinhua News Agency, March 17, 2006). Other critics have argued that PSI activities violate international laws regarding self-defense, Articles 19 and 88 of UNCLOS. A large proportion of criticisms of the legality of PSI come from Indian news sources. Criticism over the legality of PSI also focus around the fact that the initiative does not fall under any United Nations committee or body, and that doing so might legitimize it.\n\nMany of academic and news articles about the initiative state that the PSI is focused specifically on states such as Iran and the DPRK. North Korea has stated that it feels the PSI is an instrument for an aggressive war planned by the United States against the DPRK under the pretext of blockading ships and planes. Indian publications discouraging participation in PSI have defined PSI as being specifically directed towards Iran and have stated that \"India on no account should be a part of any anti-Iranian strategic initiative led by the United States.\" Other potential suggested targets of PSI have included Syria, Myanmar, and Pakistan.\n\nDespite these accusations and perceptions, all official PSI documentation and press releases state that PSI does not target any particular state, and that individual nations within the initiative are able to make self-determinations on what shipments are targeted. Several PSI-endorsee states have diplomatic and trade relationships with Iran, the DPRK, and other states suggested as likely targets.\n\nThe preponderance of news sources and academic analysis on the initiative often describe PSI as being a \"US-led\" initiative. Like the issue of whether PSI targets specific states, participants in the initiative itself explicitly deny that it is an effort \"led\" by the United States and that PSI is truly defined by the nonproliferation activities of endorsing nations.\n\nMuch early criticism of the initiative also explicitly linked PSI to other international activities of the globally controversial George W. Bush administration, including namely the War on Terror, invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and a general international perception of US unilateralism outside of United Nations frameworks. Domestically in the United States, liberal critics referenced the PSI and its links to Under-Secretary Bolton as an extension of the Bush Administration's \"Coalition of the willing.\" However, over time much of these criticisms have subsided as PSI activities grew to have large bipartisan support in the United States Congress and the PSI continued to be promoted under the Presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nWith President Obama's continued promotion of the initiative and commitment to expand and institutionalize it, many initial opponents of the initiative have reduced their negative comments and begun efforts to explore joining the initiative in order to be recognized as a player in global non-proliferation efforts.\n\nSome criticism of PSI has been pointed towards the \"secretive\" nature of the initiative. It has been argued that \"the secretiveness surrounding PSI interdictions and the methods employed make it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness or its legitimacy,\" and that the lack of formality and structure in the initiative are causes for concern.\n\nIn a June 2006 speech, then-Undersecretary of State Robert Joseph claimed that between April 2005 and April 2006 the United States had cooperated with other PSI participants on \"roughly two dozen\" occasions to prevent transfers of concern; and in May 2005 Ulrik Federspiel, Denmark’s ambassador to the United States, asserted that \"the shipment of missiles has fallen significantly in the lifetime of PSI.\" However, references such as these provide no actual information on or evidence of interdictions which have occurred, leaving critics to remain skeptical of such numbers or of any \"metrics\" that prove the effectiveness of the initiative.\n\nWhile these criticisms persist, many PSI events, such as annual Operational Experts Group meetings, contain a very high degree of civil society participation. Think tanks and industry representatives, for instance, participated in the 2016 Operational Experts Group meeting and were permitted to Tweet throughout.\n\nMuch of the criticism about the PSI have been faced with counter-arguments, given the inaccurate or outdated nature of much of the information about the initiative. The most common negative portrayal of PSI represents it as an illegal, US-led effort to interdict third party vessels on the high seas. PSI proponents have countered that:\n\n\n\nTimeline resources and general review of PSI at Biosecurity Commons, A Wiki Database \n\n"}

It is recognised in some national constitutions and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n\nThe right to housing is recognised in a number of international human rights instruments. Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living.\nIt states that:\n\nArticle 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) also guarantees the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living.\n\nIn international human rights law the right to housing is regarded as a freestanding right. This was clarified in the 1991 General Comment no 4 on Adequate Housing by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The general comment provides an authoritative interpretation of the right to housing in legal terms under international law.\n\nThe Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity affirm that \"everyone has the right to adequate housing, including protection from eviction, without discrimination and that States shall a) take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure security of tenure and access to affordable, habitable, accessible, culturally appropriate and safe housing, not including shelters and other emergency accommodation, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or material or family status; b) take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to prohibit the execution of evictions that are not in conformity with their international human rights obligations, and ensure that adequate and effective legal or other appropriate remedies are available to any person claiming that a right to protection against forced evictions has been violated or is under threat of violation, including the right to resettlement, which includes the right to alternative land of better or equal quality and to adequate housing, without discrimination.\"\n\nThe right to housing is also enshrined in Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 16 of the European Social Charter (Article 31 of the Revised European Social charter) and in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. According to UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, aspects of right to housing under ICESCR include: legal security of tenure; availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure; affordability; habitability; accessibility; location and cultural adequacy. As a political goal, right to housing was declared in F. D. Roosevelt's 1944 speech on the Second Bill of Rights.\n\nThe TENLAW project provided a more efficient opportunity to international and interdisciplinary research in the housing and property field. It created the first housing chair at the University Rovira i Virgili (Spain) on July 11, 2013, which opened up possibilities for research and dissemination in this area.\n\nThe right to adequate housing was a key issue at the 1996 Habitat meeting in Istanbul and a main theme in the Istanbul Agreement and Habitat Agenda. Paragraph 61 of the agenda identifies the steps required by governments to \"promote, protect and ensure the full and progressive realisation of the right to adequate housing\". The 2001 Habitat meeting, known as Istanbul +5, reaffirmed the 1996 Istanbul Agreement and Habitat Agenda and established the UN Human Settlement Programme to promote the right to housing in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Known as UN–HABITAT, the programme is the most important international forum for the right to housing. It is tasked with promoting housing rights through awareness campaigns, and to develop benchmarks and monitoring systems.\n\nIn South Africa, section 26 of Chapter Two of the Constitution establishes that \"everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing\". The Department of Human Settlements is tasked with implementing this mandate. Based on recent data, around 3.6 million South Africans still live in shacks or informal settlements (2013 data), while it is estimated that around 200,000 are homeless or living on the streets (2015 data).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25872759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25872759", "title": "The Daily Caller", "text": "The Daily Caller\n\nThe Daily Caller is a conservative American news and opinion website based in Washington, D.C. It was founded by political pundit Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel in 2010.\n\n\"The Daily Caller\" was founded by Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel. After raising $3 million in funding from businessman Foster Friess, the website was launched on January 11, 2010. The organization started with a reporting staff of 21 in its Washington office. It was launched as an alternative to the liberal \"The Huffington Post\", similarly featuring sections in broad range of subjects beyond politics.\n\nBy late 2012, \"The New York Times\" reported that the site had quadrupled its page view and total audience and had become profitable without ever buying an advertisement for itself.\n\nBy 2013, the site was receiving over 35 million views a month according to Quantcast, surpassing rival sites such as \"The Washington Times\", Politico, and Forbes. The site has an active community, with over 200,000 comments made each month.\n\nNotable figures have commented on \"The Daily Caller\". Karl Rove has said that \"\"The Daily Caller\" is necessary reading for anyone who wants to be up to speed with what's going on with politics in America.\" Larry Kudlow referred to the site as \"one of [his] faves.\"\n\n\"The Daily Caller\" is in the White House rotating press pool and has full-time reporters on Capitol Hill. Notable contributors include Ann Coulter.\n\nContributors to \"The Daily Caller\" include economist Larry Kudlow, Congressman Mark Sanford, sculptor Robert Mihaly, and diplomat Alan Keyes.\n\n\"The Daily Caller\" also hosts \"The Mirror\", a blog written by former FishbowlDC editor and \"The Hill\" columnist Betsy Rothstein. \"The Mirror\" covers media in Washington D.C., news related to journalism organizations, as well as political and media related gossip. The tagline is, \"Reflections of a self-obsessed city.\"\n\nWhen it first launched in January 2010, Mercedes Bunz, writing for \"The Guardian\", said \"The Daily Caller\" was \"setting itself up to be the conservative answer to \"The Huffington Post\"\". According to Bunz, a year before the website launched, Carlson promoted it as \"a new political website leaning more to the right than \"Politico\" and \"TalkingPointsMemo\"\". However, at launch, he wrote a letter to readers that said it was not going to be a right-wing site.\n\nDuring a January 2010 interview with \"Politico\", Carlson said \"The Daily Caller\" was not going to be tied to his personal political ideologies and that he wanted it to be \"breaking stories of importance\". In a \"Washington Post\" article about \"The Caller\"s launch, Howard Kurtz wrote, \"[Carlson's] partner is Neil Patel, a former Dick Cheney aide. His opinion editor is Moira Bagley, who spent 2008 as the Republican National Committee's press secretary. And his $3 million in funding comes from Wyoming financier Foster Friess, a big-time GOP donor. But Carlson insists this won't be a right-wing site\". Kurtz quoted Carlson as saying, \"We're not enforcing any kind of ideological orthodoxy on anyone\". In an interview with \"The New York Times\", Carlson said that the vast majority of traditional reporting comes from a liberal point of view and called \"The Daily Caller\"s reporting \"the balance against the rest of the conventional press\".\n\nIn a 2012 \"Washingtonian\" article, Tom Bartlett said Carlson and Patel developed \"The Daily Caller\" as \"a conservative news site in the mold of the liberal \"Huffington Post\" but with more firearms coverage and fewer nipple-slip slide shows\".\n\n\"The Daily Caller\" has published a number of articles that dispute the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2017, \"The Daily Caller\" published a story saying that a \"peer-reviewed study\" by \"two scientists and a veteran statistician\" found that recent years have not been the warmest ever. The alleged \"study\" was a PDF file on a WordPress blog, and was not peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal. Also in 2017, \"The Daily Caller\" uncritically published a bogus \"Daily Mail\" story which claimed that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) manipulated data to make climate change appear worse; at the same time, legitimate news outlets debunked the \"Daily Mail\" story. Also in 2017, \"The Daily Caller\" published a story claiming that a study found no evidence of accelerating temperatures over a 23-year period, which climate scientists described as a misleading story. In 2016, \"The Daily Caller\" published a story claiming that climate scientist Michael Mann (director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University) had asserted that data was unnecessary to measure climate change; Mann described the story as \"egregiously false\". In 2015, \"The Daily Caller\" wrote that NOAA \"fiddle[d]\" with data when the agency published a report concluding that there was no global warming hiatus.\n\nIn 2011, \"The Daily Caller\" was the first news outlet to disseminate a video by conservative provocateur James O'Keefe which purportedly showed an NPR fundraiser deriding Republicans. The video was later proven to have been misleadingly edited.\n\nIn March 2013 \"The Daily Caller\" posted interviews with two women claiming that New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez had paid them for sex while he was a guest of a campaign donor. The allegation came five days before the 2012 New Jersey senate election. News organizations such as ABC News, which had also interviewed the women, the \"New York Times\", and the \"New York Post\" declined to publish the allegations, viewing them as unsubstantiated and lacking credibility. Subsequently, one of the women who accused Menendez stated that she had been paid to falsely implicate the senator and had never met him. Menendez's office described the allegations as \"manufactured\" by a right-wing blog as a politically motivated smear.\n\nA few weeks later, police in the Dominican Republic announced that three women had claimed they were paid $300–425 each to lie about having had sex with Menendez. Dominican law enforcement also alleged that the women had been paid to lie about Menendez by an individual claiming to work for \"The Daily Caller\". \"The Daily Caller\" denied this allegation, stating: \"At no point did any money change hands between \"The Daily Caller\" and any sources or individuals connected with this investigation\". Describing what it saw as the unraveling of \"The Daily Caller's\" \"scoop\", the Poynter Institute wrote: \"The Daily Caller\" stands by its reports, though apparently doesn't feel the need to \"prove its allegations right\"\".\n\nIn March 2015 \"The Daily Caller\" columnist Mickey Kaus quit after editor Tucker Carlson refused to run a column critical of Fox News coverage of the immigration policy debate. Carlson, who also works for Fox, reportedly did not want \"The Daily Caller\" publishing criticism of a firm that employed him. Journalist Neil Munro quit two weeks later and Carlson said he was not going to go to work for Breitbart. However, He started writing for Breitbard four months later and has remained there, as of November 2018.\n\nAccording to a study by Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, \"The Daily Caller\" was among the most popular sites on the right during the 2016 presidential election. The study also found that \"The Daily Caller\" provided \"amplification and legitimation\" for \"the most extreme conspiracy sites\", such as Truthfeed, Infowars, Gateway Pundit and Conservative Treehouse during the 2016 presidential election. \"The Daily Caller\" also \"employed anti-immigrant narratives that echoed sentiments from the alt-right and white nationalists but without the explicitly racist and pro-segregation language.\" \"The Daily Caller\" also played a significant role in creating and disseminating stories that had little purchase outside the right-wing media ecosystem but that stoked the belief among core Trump followers that what Clinton did was not merely questionable but criminal and treasonous. In a campaign that expressed deep anti-Muslim sentiment, a repeated theme was that Hillary Clinton was seriously in hock to Muslim nations. In one of its most frequently shared stories, \"The Daily Caller\" falsely asserted that Morocco's King Mohammed VI flew Bill Clinton on a private jet, and that this had been omitted from the Clinton Foundation's tax disclosures. \"The Daily Caller\" also made the \"utterly unsubstantiated and unsourced claim\" that Hillary Clinton got Environmental Protection Agency \"head Lisa Jackson to try to shut down Mosaic Fertilizer, described as America’s largest phosphate mining company, in exchange for a $15 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from King Mohammed VI of Morocco, ostensibly to benefit Morocco’s state-owned phosphate company.\"\n\nIn January 2017, \"The Daily Caller\" posted a video which encouraged violence against protesters. The video in question showed a car plowing through protesters, with the headline \"Here's A Reel Of Cars Plowing Through Protesters Trying To Block The Road\" and set to a cover of Ludacris' \"Move Bitch.\" The video drew attention in August 2017 when a white supremacist plowed his car through a group of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. After the video attracted attention, \"The Daily Caller\" deleted it from its website.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center subsequently criticized \"The Daily Caller\", saying that it had a \"white nationalist problem\". SPLC also said that two other contributors to \"The Daily Caller\" had ties to white nationalist groups. It later retracted its claim that Richard Pollock, a devout Jew, was a white nationalist, saying \"Pollock was initially included in this story\" but \"there is no evidence to suggest Mr. Pollock is otherwise a white nationalist.\"\n\nIn August 2018, \"The Atlantic\" reported that Scott Greer, then deputy editor of \"The Daily Caller\", had written pieces under a pseudonym in the white supremacist publication \"Radix Journal\" from 2014 to 2015\".\" In articles for \"Radix Journal\", Greer expressed white nationalist views, as well as racist anti-black and antisemitic views. While in his emails and messages, he expressed anti-Christian and antisemitic theories, as well his relationship with Richard Spencer. Upon being confronted with his past white supremacist writings, Greer resigned from any affiliation with \"The Daily Caller\". In 2017, it had been revealed, Scott Greer had ties to members of the white nationalist movement, including friendships with Devin Saucier, assistant to Jared Taylor of American Renaissance, and anti-immigrant activist Marcus Epstein, who pled guilty to assaulting an African American woman two years prior to the relationship with Scott Greer. Greer had later deleted parts of his Facebook page, but is seen photographed with nationalists such as Tim Dionisopoulos and Richard Spencer, Wolves of Vinland and appears wearing clothes belonging to the group Youth for Western Civilization. The Daily Caller itself subsequently stated, about why he had not been fired in 2017: “We had two choices: Fire a young man because of some photos taken of him at metal shows in college, or take his word. We chose to trust him. Now, if what you allege is accurate, we know that trust was a mistake, we know he lied to us. We won’t publish him, anyone in these circles, or anyone who thinks like them. People who associate with these losers have no business writing for our company.” \n\n\"The Daily Caller\" has posted articles by Jason Kessler, a white supremacist who organized a rally of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville. Before Kessler posted his article, he had spoken at white supremacist gatherings. After Kessler received attention for his organizing of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally, \"the Daily Caller\" removed his articles from its website, but \"The Daily Caller\" executive editor defended Kessler's articles.\n\nThe website has also published pieces by Peter Brimelow, founder of the white supremacist website VDARE.\n\nIn 2012, \"Daily Caller\" reporter Neil Munro interrupted Barack Obama during one of the President's press conferences, while Obama was giving remarks. Obama said, \"The next time I prefer you let me finish my statements before you ask a question.\" Cutting off Munro's reply, Obama said, \"I didn't ask for an argument.\" Munro's interruption of remarks by the president was widely considered a startling breach of etiquette. Editor-in-chief Tucker Carlson defended Munro's hectoring, saying \"As a general matter, reporters are there to ask [questions]\" and that he was \"proud\" of Munro.\n\nMunro later said in a statent that his intention was to ask questions after the president made his remarks but misjudged when the president was closing. \"I timed the question believing the president was closing his remarks, because naturally I have no intention of interrupting the President of the United States. I know he rarely takes questions before walking away from the podium. When I asked the question as he finished his speech, he turned his back on the many reporters, and walked away while I and at least one other reporter asked questions.\"\n\n\"The Daily Caller\" was the first news outlet to report on Stefan Halper, a confidential FBI source, and his interactions with Trump campaign advisors Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about campaign matters. Page became the subject of surveillance warrants issued by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding his alleged contacts with Russian intelligence officials. Other news outlets confirmed Halper's identity but did not report his identity because US intelligence officials warned that it would endanger him and his contacts.\n\nAccording to Callum Borchers of \"the Washington Post\", \"the Daily Caller\" has \"a peculiar business structure that enables it to increase revenue while reducing its tax obligation.\" The organization, a for-profit company, does this by relying on its charity arm, \"the Daily Caller\" News Foundation, to create the majority of its news content.\n\nAccording to Lisa Graves, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration, the situation is “a huge rip-off for taxpayers if \"the Daily Caller\" News Foundation is receiving revenue that it doesn't pay taxes on, to produce stories that are used by the for-profit enterprise, which then makes money on the stories through ads.”\n\n\"The Daily Caller\" kept conspiracy theories surrounding Imran Awan alive with aggressive coverage. Imran Awan was an IT worker for Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. \"The\" \"Daily Caller\" sought to tie Awan to a wide range of alleged criminal activity, including unauthorized access to government servers. The reporter behind the aggressive coverage of Awan told Fox News that the affair was \"straight out of James Bond.\" An 18-month investigation by federal prosecutors found no evidence of wrongdoing in Awan's work in the House and no support for the conspiracy theories about Awan. In the announcement of the conclusion of the investigation, investigators rebuked a litany of right-wing conspiracy theories about Awan.\n\nIn August 2018, \"The Daily Caller\" ran a story alleging that a Chinese-owned company hacked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and successfully obtained nearly all of her emails. The Daily Caller cited “two sources briefed on the matter.” After publishing the story, President Trump tweeted the allegations made in \"Daily Caller\"'s reporting. The FBI rebutted the allegations. According to \"The Washington Post\", the claims are without evidence.\n\n\n"}

Starting in 1973, the story begins when Herer takes the advice of his friend, \"Captain\" Ed Adair, and begins compiling tidbits of information about the \"Cannabis\" plant and its numerous uses, including as hemp and as a drug. After a dozen years of collecting and compiling historical data, Herer first published his work as \"The Emperor Wears No Clothes\", in 1985. The twelfth edition was published in November 2010, and the book continues to be cited in Cannabis rescheduling and re-legalization efforts.\n\nThe book, backed by H.E.M.P. (United States), Hanf Haus (Germany), Sensi Seeds/Hash, Marihuana & Hemp Museum, Amsterdam, (Netherlands), and T.H.C., the Texas Hemp Campaign (United States), offers $100,000 to anyone who can disprove the claims made within. Quoting from the book's back cover:\n\nThe title of the book alludes to Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy tale \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" (1837). Herer uses Andersen's story as an allegory for the current prohibition of Cannabis.\n\nEuropean expert on hemp and author of the doctoral thesis \"Crop physiology of fibre hemp\" (1994), Dr. Hayo M.G. van der Werf criticized the book for containing some inaccuracies, stating, \"Although most of the information contained in the book is valid, some of its claims are clearly incorrect.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "44497504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44497504", "title": "Townpark", "text": "Townpark\n\nIn the history of land use in Ireland, a townpark or town park was a smallholding near a town and farmed by someone resident in the town. Typically, a major landowner provided a contiguous area near the town which was subdivided into multiple townparks, each rented on a short-term lease, for a higher rent than that paid by a full-time resident farmer.\n\nThe Boundary Survey of 1825–44, associated with Griffith's Valuation and the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, set down the names and denominations of subdivisions of land. Griffith often erected a contiguous block of townparks into a single townland named \"Town Parks\" or \"Town Parks of [name of town]\". The 1901 townland index recorded such townlands by the following towns: Ballycastle, Larne, Ballymena, Antrim, Ballymoney, Ballyhaise, Cavan, Cloyne, Midleton, Lifford, Ballyshannon, Newtownards, Skerries (Holmpatrick civil parish), Swords, Ballinasloe, Galway, Portumna, Castledermot, Athy, Birr, Daingean (then Philipstown), Carrick on Shannon, Longford, Newtown Forbes, Ardee, Dundalk, Navan, Athboy, Kells, Borris-in-Ossory, Mountmellick, Roscrea, Carrick-on-Suir, Cahir, Lismore, Delvin, Wexford, Lismore, Tallow, Tuam, Donaghadee, and Killeshandra. There were also \"Town Fields\" (Borrisokane), \"Town Lands\" (Clonakilty), \"Town Lot\" (Tipperary), \"Town Lots\" (Bantry), and \"Townplots\" (Kinsale and Killala). Town Parks was also the townland containing the centre of Belfast; it is listed in the 1861 index, but was entirely within the county borough boundary by 1901. Thurles Townparks is the townland, now almost entirely urbanised, around the historic centre of Thurles.\n\nThe Irish Land Acts of 1870 and 1881, which were designed to enable tenant farmers to purchase their holdings from landlords, specifically excluded townparks from their terms. This led to case law interpreting the Acts' definition of \"townpark\", which had three components:\n\nA \"town\" need not be a municipality with town commissioners or other government, and conversely a place within the municipal boundary might yet be too far from the built-up area to be considered a townpark. Population was suggestive but not definitive: Portglenone with 800 people was held not to be a \"town\", whereas Timoleague was, with only 366.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39188568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39188568", "title": "Transshipment (information security)", "text": "Transshipment (information security)\n\nIn information security, transshipment is a technique for protecting software services and applications by ensuring they only receive data that they are known to be able to handle safely. The term is analogous to that in the logistics industry where cargo is offloaded from one means of transport and on to another at a port of entry. With transshipment, information is extracted from the data used to send it and then encoded as data that can be handled safely.\n\nWith transshipment, messages are intercepted and the business information they carry is extracted. This information is then encoded in a new message using a data format that the receiving application can safely handle.\n\nFor example, an email client may be known to handle messages with a simple structure without failure but not the full generality allowed by the standards. Transshipment can then be used to protect the mail client from attackers who can exploit weaknesses in its ability to handle the general case. The transshipment process extracts the business information in the email messages and creates a new message that conveys the same information but using simple structures. So the mail client is protected without knowing details of any weaknesses in its implementation.\n\nThe transshipment function must handle any and all data sent to it by potential attackers. To be useful the function must be implemented without it being vulnerable to attack. This can be achieved by using Guard technology that separates the implementation into three parts - a destination proxy that interacts with the message originator and extracts the business information from messages, a verifier and a source proxy that creates a new message to carry the business information and interacts with the message recipient. The verifier's role is to ensure that the source proxy is only presented with the business information using the simple data format it is expecting. As a result, the attack surface is limited to the verifier's interface and that part of the source proxy's interface which is visible through the verifier.\n\nUnlike antivirus software the use of transshipment defends against unknown attacks, and hence zero-day attacks, and does not require routine updates to signatures or Heuristics.\n"}

It involved scamsters including politicians, senior and junior officials and businessmen systematically employing imposters to write papers, manipulate exam hall seating arrangements and supply forged answer sheets by bribing officials.\n\nThe scam involved 13 different exams conducted by Vyapam, for selection of medical students and state government employees (including food inspectors, transport constables, police personnel, school teachers, dairy supply officers and forest guards) where the final results were rigged. The exams were taken by around 3.2 million students each year, many of whom were actually paid proxies for other undeserving students. It also included an \"engine-bogie\" system wherein seating arrangements were manipulated so that a paid smarter student was seated between two others to allow the latter to copy answers from the former.\n\nMadhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB), popularly known by its Hindi acronym \"Vyapam\" (Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal), is a self-financed and autonomous body incorporated by the state government responsible for conducting several entrance tests in the state. These entrance exams are held for recruitment in government jobs and admissions in educational institutes of the state. The scam involved a collusion of undeserving candidates, who bribed politicians and MPPEB officials through middlemen, to get high ranks in these entrance tests. The scam also led to between 23 and 40 'unnatural' deaths of involved individuals, though unofficial figures run well into more than a 100 custodial deaths including the erstwhile MP Governor's son and deaths in staged road accidents.\nCases of irregularities in these entrance tests had been reported since the mid-1990s, and the first FIR was filed in 2000. However, until 2009, such cases were not thought to be part of an organized ring. When major complaints surfaced in the pre-medical test (PMT) in 2009, the state government established a committee to investigate the matter. The committee released its report in 2011, and over a hundred people were arrested by the police. However none of the accused have been convicted as most of them either suspiciously died in custody or were released on bail.\n\nThe sheer scale of the scam came to light in 2013, when the Indore police arrested 20 people who had come to impersonate candidates for PMT 2009. The interrogation of these people led to the arrest of Jagdish Sagar, the leader of an organized racket involved in the scam. The state government established a Special Task Force (STF) on 26 August 2013. Subsequent interrogations and arrests uncovered the involvement of several politicians, bureaucrats, MPPEB officials, racket leaders, middlemen, candidates and their parents in the scam. By June 2015, more than 2000 people had been arrested in connection with the scam. These included the state's ex-education minister Laxmikant Sharma and over a hundred other politicians. In July 2015, the Supreme Court of India issued an order to transfer the case to the country's premier investigating agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). In the same year, the Wikipedia page of Vyapam scam became the 19th most viewed page on Wikipedia globally.\n\nMany senior personnel including Justice Bhushan who heads the Special Investigative team and Indian doctors including Anand Rai (the whistle blower in this case) are of the opinion that the Vyapam scam was functional since the 1990s when they themselves gave their medical exams. They also believe that Vyapam is just the tip of the iceberg, and similar \"systems\" of proxies giving medical exams are operational in other states of India as well.\n\nVyapam was entrusted with the responsibility of conducting large-scale competitive tests for admission to various professional courses and for recruitment to government jobs.\n\nThe Vyapam scam involved collusion among exam candidates, government officials and middlemen: undeserving candidates were offered high marks in the exams, in exchange for kickbacks. The following tricks were used by those involved in the scam:\n\n\n\n\n\nCases of malpractice in Vyapam scam had been reported since 1995, and the first FIR was found in 2000 in Chhatarpur district. In 2004, seven cases were registered in Khandwa district. However, such reports of malpractice were seen as isolated cases.\n\nA report by the Madhya Pradesh Local Fund Audit office for 2007-08 found several financial and administrative irregularities in MPPEB, including unauthorized disposal of application forms. It was suspected that the application forms were being destroyed so that they could not be compared to exam admit cards and other records. In 2009, fresh complaints of irregularities in the pre-medical test (PMT) surfaced. Indore-based activist Anand Rai filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) requesting investigation into the scam. In 2009, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan set up a committee headed by the State Joint Director of Medical Education to probe the allegations.\n\nIn July 2011, MPPEB monitored 145 suspects during the Pre-Medical Test (PMT). Most of the suspects did not turn up, but 8 were caught for impersonating others. This included Kanpur-based Satyendra Varma, who had accepted 4 lakh to appear in place of Ashish Yadav, in Indore. 15 exam toppers from the previous year appeared for the exam. Suspecting that these people were called in to impersonate others or to help candidates cheat by sitting adjacent to them, MPPEB asked them to explain their reasons for re-taking the exams. MPPEB also started using biometric technology: thumb impressions and photographs of all the persons appearing for the exam were taken to be matched during the post-results counselling.\n\nThe committee set up by Chouhan in 2009 submitted its report to the government in November 2011. It mentioned that 114 candidates had passed PMT using impersonation. The candidates, mostly from rich families, had been impersonated by practicing doctors and talented medical students, some of whom had come from neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The middlemen had charged each candidate 1-4 million. The findings raised concern that several fake doctors admitted through PMT in earlier years might have graduated as practitioners. The possibility of government officials being involved in the scam was also mentioned.\n\nIn December 2011, the MP Government announced that all the students who had gained admissions by fraudulent means would be asked to quit their courses. This included those who had already spent some years taking the course.\n\nIn 2012, Indore police arrested four people who had come to impersonate candidates in the PMT exam. The arrested had been promised sums ranging from 25,000 to 50,000 each.\n\nThe massive scale of the Vyapam scam came to light in 2013. On the night of 6–7 July, the Indore police arrested 20 people from various city hotels. These people, 17 of whom were from Uttar Pradesh, had come to impersonate local candidates in the PMT exam scheduled on 7 July 2013. The impersonators had been promised sums ranging from 50,000 to 100,000. Based on information collected during the interrogation of these 20 impersonators, Indore police found out that an organized racket headed by Jagdish Sagar was involved in the scam. After the arrests and the revelation, Dr. Anand Rai submitted a complaint to the local Superintendent of Police (economic offence wing), seeking a detailed investigation. He sought probe into the role of MPPEB's chairman, exam controller, assistant controller and deputy controller.\n\nOn 13 July 2013, Jagdish Sagar was arrested in Mumbai. A list containing names of 317 students was confiscated from him. MPPEB's exam controller Pankaj Trivedi, who was not a suspect in the scam at that time, tried to protect these students. He sent a letter to various government departments and the deans of medical colleges, insisting that these students should be allowed admission once they sign an affidavit. The affidavit would state that they didn't use any unfair means, and that their admissions would be canceled if they were found guilty in the police investigations. On 28 September 2013, Trivedi was also arrested, based on Jagdish Sagar's interrogation. On 5 October, the Special Task Force (STF) of the police chargesheeted 28 people, including Jagdish Sagar. In December 2013, the STF produced a 23,000-page supplementary chargesheet against 34 accused in the Indore district court. Out of these 34 accused chargesheeted, 30 were students and their guardians. Four others included Pankaj Trivedi, Dr. Sanjeev Shilpkar and Dr. Jagdish Sagar's accomplice Gangaram Pipliya.\n\nIn November 2013, the STF found that the scamsters had rigged five recruitment tests: Pre-PG, Food Inspector Selection Test, Milk Federation test, Subedar-Sub Inspector and Platoon Commander Selection Test and Police Constable Recruitment Test - all held during 2012 for government jobs in the state. For Pre-PG Test of 2012, MPPEB's former examination controller Dr Pankaj Trivedi and its system analyst Nitin Mahindra provided model answer keys to candidates through photocopies. For the other four exams, the Vyapam officials manipulated the OMR answer sheets by taking them out of the strong room. Different FIRs against 153 people, including Sudhir Sharma, were filed. Sharma had earlier been interrogated by CBI in mining scam of Madhya Pradesh. In March 2014, the government announced that the STF was investigating rigging of nine examinations, and 127 people had been arrested.\n\nThe previous years' PMT exams were also investigated. The STF found that 286 candidates had cleared PMT-2012 through fraudulent means. On 29 April 2014, 27 students of MGM Medical College in Indore were expelled for having used fraudulent means to clear PMT-2012.\n\nIn June 2014, the High Court asked the police why several of the accused in the case had not been arrested yet. Following this, the STF made several arrests. On 15 June, the STF arrested the state's former technical education minister and BJP leader Laxmikant Sharma for his alleged involvement in the contractual teachers recruitment scam. On 18 and 19 June 2014, the police arrested over 100 medical students from different parts of the state, for their involvement in the PMT scam.\n\nIn September 2014, the STF revealed that Jagdish Sagar's racket had also rigged the entrance exams for recruitment in SBI and other nationalized banks. These entrance exams included the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection's exams and the SBI Probationary Officer's exam.\n\nInitial investigations into the irregularities were conducted by the various city units of the state police. During 2009-11, a committee established by the state government and headed by the State Joint Director of Medical Education, probed the irregularities in the PMT exam.\n\nAfter the role of organized crime rackets and politicians in the scam came to light, the state government formed a Special Task Force (STF) of the police on 26 August 2013, to investigate the scam. Several activists and politicians, including members of the major opposition Indian National Congress party, demanded a CBI probe in the scam under the supervision of the Supreme Court of India. Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan did not entertain the suggestion of a CBI inquiry to the probe initially. On November 5, 2014, Madhya Pradesh High Court also rejected the Congress leader Digvijay Singh's petition for CBI probe and instead ordered setting up of a special investigation team (SIT) to act as a watchdog for the court. The SIT is a three-member team chaired by Justice Chandresh Bhushan, a retired Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court. During 2014-2015, the scam was investigated by the STF under the supervision of SIT.\n\nOn 7 July 2015, after controversy about increasing number of allegedly suspicious deaths, Chouhan informed media that he will write to High Court of Madhya Pradesh requesting to order a CBI probe into the scam. On the same day, the opposition National Congress Party requested for resignation of Chouhan to allow fair probe into the scam. Application was filed before the High Court to transfer the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which however ordered to await the decision of the Supreme Court on similar applications. On 9 July 2015, the Attorney General for India told Supreme Court that State of Madhya Pradesh had no objection whatsoever for transferring the investigation to the CBI, upon which the Supreme Court ordered to transfer the 'criminal cases related to the scam and also the cases related to deaths allegedly linked with scam to the CBI, country's premier investigating agency. However who will monitor the investigation process was not announced.\n\nBy June 2015, more than 2000 people had been arrested in connection with the scam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral organized rackets were involved in the Vyapam scam. These included the gangs led by Dr. Jagdish Sagar, Dr. Sanjeev Shilpakar and Sanjay Gupta, who were described as \"kingpins\" of the PMT scam. For PMT 2013, Dr. Sagar had given 317, Shilpakar 92 and Sanjay Gupta 48 names. Mahendra had recorded the details of these candidates in his computer and destroyed the list. While allotting roll numbers to these candidates, the slots immediately before or after them were left blank. These roll numbers were then allotted to fake candidates. The roll numbers were set at their homes and brought to office in a pen drive. After reaching the office, Mahendra uploaded the roll numbers to the computers. He then used to telephone the middlemen and provide a confirmation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiyush Trivedi is the brother of the tainted and the main accused of the Vyapam scam, Pankaj Trivedi. He was removed the post of VC of RGPV due to his alleged involvement in the scam and disproportionate assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe STF also found evidence against the state Governor Ram Naresh Yadav. On February 24, 2015, Yadav was charged for criminal conspiracy in rigging the MPPEB forest guard recruitment examination. His son Shailesh was an accused in the contractual teachers' recruitment and later found dead in mysterious circumstances in March, 2015. His former officer-on-special-duty Dhanraj Yadav was arrested by STF in 2013 in connection with the scam. The Governor petitioned the High Court arguing that no criminal proceedings could be initiated against him, as the Constitution of India grants him immunity while he is in office. The High Court agreed and stayed his arrest, but ordered the investigations against him to proceed. The SIT chief declared that the investigators will act against Yadav after his retirement in September 2016. Three advocates petitioned the Supreme Court to order removal of Yadav as Governor. A bench comprising Chief Justice of India H. L. Dattu and Justices Arun Kumar Mishra and Amitava Roy has agreed to hear the petition on July 9. Now,\nThe CBI will investigate the Vyapam scam and more than 30 deaths allegedly linked to the job recruitment scandal, the Supreme Court ruled on 9 July 2015.\n\nIn 2014, Prashant Pandey (aka \"Mr. X\"), an IT consultant hired by the STF, was arrested for trying to use the team's information to blackmail the Vyapam accused. Pandey then approached the Indian National Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, and claimed that he was a whistleblower who was being harassed for exposing the role of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the scam. He alleged that the investigating agencies had tampered with the contents of the Excel sheet recovered from hard disk of the scam accused Nitin Mohindra's computer. Mohindra maintained a record of the candidates' names, their roll numbers and the names of those who had recommended them. Hundreds of people were arrested based on the information in this sheet. Pandey claimed that the investigators had modified the original version of the sheet by removing the names of senior BJP leaders, including Chouhan, from the sheet.\n\nDigvijaya Singh then submitted a 15-page affidavit before the SIT, alleging that the investigators were shielding the Chief Minister. SIT took cognisance of Singh's complaint, and sent both versions of the Excel sheet for forensic analysis. The forensic laboratory reported that the Excel sheet available with STF was genuine, while Pandey's version was forged. Accordingly, Singh's submission was rejected as a forgery by Justice Khanwilkar in the MP High Court.\n\nPandey stood by his version, and stated that it had been authenticated by Truth Labs, a private forensic lab. He approached the Delhi High Court for protection as a whistleblower, claiming persecution by the MP Police. He claimed that he first sent the documents to the BJP minister Kailash Vijayvargiya and the Prime Minister's Office; he approached Congress leaders only when he did not receive any response. Pandey also stated that he was getting threat calls from influential people. The Delhi court therefore ordered police protection for him in February 2015. However, it was withdrawn in mid May 2015. \n\nChouhan hit back at his critics, saying that his government should be credited for the exposing the scam. He stated that only 228 out of 350,000 appointments made during his tenure had been affected by the recruitment scam, and unlike previous governments, he had conducted a thorough probe. Replying to Congress' allegations that his wife had got jobs for 17 of her relatives from Gondia, he pointed out that not a single candidate from Gondia had got the job in the question.\n\nA number of people connected to the scam and its investigation, died during the course of investigation. The opposition parties and activists alleged that several of these deaths happened under suspicious circumstances. In 2015, the Special Task Force (STF) submitted a list to High Court, naming 23 people who are believed to have died \"unnatural death\". According to the STF, most of these deaths took place before it took over the investigation in July 2013. Some media reports claimed that 40+ people associated with the scam had died under mysterious circumstances.\n\nThe State Government dismissed the allegations, arguing that Vyapam conducts very large-scale examinations and thousands of people are admitted or recruited through these exams every year. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan insisted that death of every person linked with Vyapam exams should not be linked to the Vyapam scam. The state's Home Minister Babulal Gaur claimed that the deaths were \"natural\".\n\nAccording to whistleblower Anand Rai, 10 of these deaths are suspicious, while the rest might be coincidences. The deaths considered as suspicious by him include the deaths of Akshay Singh, Namarata Damor, Narendra Tomar, D K Sakkale, Arun Sharma, Rajendra Arya and four middlemen who died in road accidents.\n\nAccording to the High-Court Special Investigation Team (SIT), 32 people in 25-30 age-group identified as 'racketeers' during the investigation, died in suspicious circumstances since the investigation started in 2012. The SIT officials raised concerns that the arrested people were naming those who were already dead, in order to mislead the probe.\n\nThe following is a list of \"unnatural deaths\" mentioned in the STF and SIT records, plus other deaths alleged to be \"suspicious\" by the opposition parties and the media.\n\nOther accused declared dead in SIT's report include the following:\n\n\nThe mysterious deaths of people linked to Vyapam scam triggered dark humour on various social media platforms across India. People compared it to the fictional television series \"Dexter\" and termed it as India's version of \"Game of Thrones\". The untimely and sudden death of a journalist soon after interviewing the family members of another dead accused was considered inauspicious. An online perception was created that any sort of link to the scam could bring trouble or even mysterious death.\n\nVarious hashtags such as #KhooniVyapam (Bloody Vyapam), #killervyapamscam, #vyapam, #VyapamGenocide, and #shivrajisteefado (Shivraj, resign) were used by people to post their reactions.\n\nOn February 13, 2017, the Supreme Court of India delivered an 83-page judgement and cancelled the degrees of 634 doctors. The court said:\n\n\n"}

It aims at highlighting the benefit of the European Union for an average citizen in their daily lives by adopting an innovative communication style. Since September 2017, WhyEurope e.V. is an officially registered association based in Tübingen, Germany. It has approximately 30 members from over 10 European states.\n\nThe initiative was founded by the three students Hans-Christoph Schlüter, Benedikt Erasmus Kau and Mirko Moser-Abt. All three shared a concern about the rise of euroscepticism and right-wing-populism. The outcome of the Brexit referendum was the trigger for them to become active. They decided to publish pictures with simple pro-European messages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nWhyEurope has adopted a communication style they refer to as “Positive Populism”. The founders describe the approach as simple, emotional and personal. They refrain from including difficult, political or legal terms in their slogans and make their messages as catchy and short as possible. Furthermore, WhyEurope aims to trigger positive emotions by connecting political issues to every-day topics such as love or happiness. The initiative aims at pointing out the concrete advantages complex benefits of European integration have in people's daily lives. The founders have repeatedly stated that \"Positive Populism\" is to be seen as a simple and emotional communication style, but sustains a foundation of hard facts and evidence. In contrary to actual ‘negative’ populists, they want to provide factual evidence and explanations for their claims.\n\nWhyEurope considers Positive Populism an approach to oppose current populist and extremist movements. According to them, the technical communication of the European Union might have contributed to the lack of support those institutions have received during the past years. Adopting a more appealing communication approach might help the Union to regain confidence.\n\nSince their foundation, WhyEurope has always emphasized their character as a non-partisan and independent initiative. Despite being in contact with actors of the European Union, they have repeatedly stated their distance to the EU institutions. They refuse to accept any financial support in any form from the European Union and other political institutions or actors.\n\nWhyEurope has had a number of cooperations with other pro-European initiatives. Since beginning of 2016, Benedikt Kau and Hans-Christoph Schlüter were in contact with and Sabine Röder when they launched the demonstrations under the name Pulse of Europe. Pulse of Europe adopted the campaign and the slogan of the campaign “Blijf bij ons” focusing on the . Together, the initiatives mobilized ten thousands of people joining pro-European demonstrations.\n\nFurther cooperations included projects with the Young European Federalists and Laute Europäer.\nOn 31 January, Marine Le Pen (Front National) filed a parliamentary request in the European Parliament asking about the funding of WhyEurope through the European Commission. Commissioner Günther Oettinger, then responsible person for the EU budget, replied that the Commission has not funded WhyEurope in any way and the name were not found within the central accounting system.\n\nNovember 2017, WhyEurope has been awarded \"European Public Communication Award\" by the European Committee Of The Regions. The prize was received during the EuroPCom in the hemicycle of the European Parliament.\n\nIn May 2018, WhyEurope has been awarded the by the Association of Liberal Academics in Germany.\n"}
