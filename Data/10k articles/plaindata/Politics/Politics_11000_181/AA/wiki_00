The convenor of the organization's UK steering committee is Philip Giddings.\n\nIt brings together Anglicans in the British Isles who are concerned to maintain a traditional position on controversial issues. Participating organisations include evangelical groups in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, such as Reform, Church Society, the Church of England Evangelical Council, the New Wine network, the Scottish Anglican Network and mission agencies. It has close links with similar groups in North America and South Africa.\n\nAnglican Mainstream is also involved in partnering with growing churches in the developing world through Anglican International Development (AID). It has strong links with the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans, and supports the Anglican realignment and the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON).\n\nAnglican Mainstream is concerned about a number of social issues including abortion and end of life issues, the status of marriage and family, evangelism, the cultural challenge of secular society and general Anglican church life in Britain and overseas. Of all the issues with which it is concerned, its stance on issues of sexuality has drawn controversy, particularly its support for sexual abstinence for homosexual people and the ex-gay movement, which it considers to be a minority group often ignored or silenced. Liberal pro-homosexuality groups such as Changing Attitude have been particularly opposed to Anglican Mainstream, especially over their view that homosexual orientation is an unalterable fact of human nature.\n\nIn 2012, Anglican Mainstream was part of a coalition of Christian groups intending to run a two-week campaign in which some London buses would carry an advertisement reading “Not gay! Post-gay, ex-gay and proud. Get over it!” in the same style as adverts produced by Stonewall, the gay rights group. The intention was to draw attention to the existence of ex-gays and the possibility of change, a claim which is contradicted by some mainstream psychologists). After receiving appropriate permissions the campaign was then prohibited by London's mayor, Boris Johnson, because of the offence he believed it would cause.\n"}
{"id": "24286766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24286766", "title": "Bellum se ipsum alet", "text": "Bellum se ipsum alet\n\nThe Latin phrase bellum se ipsum alet () or bellum se ipsum alit (, ), and its German rendering \"Der Krieg ernährt den Krieg\" describe the military strategy of feeding and funding armies primarily with the resources of occupied territories. The phrase, coined by Ancient Roman statesman Cato the Elder, is primarily associated with the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648).\n\nThe phrase \"bellum se ipsum alit\" was first mentioned in \"Ab urbe condita libri\" XXXIV,9,12, written by Roman historian Titus Livius (Livy) (59 BC-17 AD), who attributed it to Cato Marcus Porcius (\"the Elder\", 234–149 BC), a statesman in Ancient Rome. According to Livy, Cato in 195 BC used the phrase during the conquest of Hispania when he refused to buy additional supplies for his army in Iberia (Hispania, modern Spain and Portugal).\n\nThe slogan became prominent in reference to the Thirty Years' War. Friedrich Schiller in his retrospect, semi-historical drama Wallenstein (I/2, \"The Piccolomini\"), has Johann Ludwig Hektor von Isolani, a general in Albrecht von Wallenstein's army, say these words in a conversation with other commanders:\n\nPrior to the Thirty Years' War, the laws of the Holy Roman Empire provided for funding armies by raising special war taxes. The funds needed for the large armies raised during the war however exceeded the income of the respective warlords from those taxes, and forced them to resort to additional, unfavourable measures such as borrowing of money and currency depreciation. In the course of the war, the principle of \"bellum se ipsum alet\" was applied in two phases: First, the food supplies needed for the army were derived directly from the territory occupied by this army. Later, the pay for the soldiers was derived from the occupied territory as well.\n\nIn 1623, the principle was implemented by the Upper Saxon Circle on its own territory, and by Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, commander of the Catholic League's army, on occupied enemy territory. The Upper Saxon Circle had raised an army for its defense, and dispersed it over its territory. The territory was divided into \"Kontributionsbezirke\" (\"contribution districts\"), each of which had to provide certain amounts of food for the soldiers as well as the horses. The soldiers were quartered in the houses of ordinary people, who had to provide shelter, food and \"Servisgeld\", a defined sum to allow the soldier to buy firewood and salt. \n\nThese measures were self-imposed by the circle's nobility, and the local authorities were given the task of their implementation. In contrast, Tilly imposed analogous measures in the same year on a territory he had just conquered, Hersfeld. The contributions he demanded were unreasonably high, and were collected with military means.\n\nIn 1625, Albrecht von Wallenstein had promised Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II to raise an army and fund it himself. Ferdinand II allowed Wallenstein to exploit occupied territory with the caveat that money should not be collected by force without his approval. This caveat was however neglected, and the army was fed and paid entirely by contributions and war loot. Subsequently, all armies participating in the war adapted the \"bellum se ipsum alet\" principle. \n\nContributions from occupied territories, divided into \"Kontributionsbezirke\", were collected by military force and by local authorities forced to cooperate. The affected territories were thereby ruined. The need to borrow money to satisfy the military demands during the Thirty Years' War resulted in an indebtedness that many German communities bore until the 18th century.\n\nDuring World War II Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. The conquered territories did not return as many resources as the Nazis had expected, due to previous shortfalls of the Soviet planned economy and the devastations during the conquest. Thus, \"Reichsmarschall\" Hermann Göring implemented restrictions on the local population to prevent the Altreich and the army from falling short of food supplies. \n\nAware of the consequences of these measures, Göring in September 1941 foretold \"the largest starvation since the Thirty Years' War\" in the occupied areas. In 1942, he explicitly described the Nazi strategy in these territories as \"bellum se ipsum alet\".\n\n\n"}

The reception of the book has itself raised further controversy, occasioning Carter's own subsequent responses to such criticism.\n\nCritical response to \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\" has been mixed. Some journalists and academics have praised what they regard as Carter's courage for speaking honestly about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in a media environment which is hostile to opponents of Israel's policies. Others, however, have been more negative. According to Julie Bosman, criticism of the book \"has escalated to a full-scale furor\", much of which has focused on Carter's use of the word \"apartheid\" in the subtitle. Some of the book's critics, including several leaders of the Democratic Party and of American Jewish organizations, have interpreted the subtitle as an allegation of Israeli apartheid, which they believe to be inflammatory and unsubstantiated.\n\nIn his review published on October 15, 2006, Brad Hooper, editor at \"Booklist\", concludes: \"The former president's ideas are expressed with perfect clarity; his book, of course, represents a personal point of view, but one that is certainly grounded in both knowledge and wisdom. His outlook on the problem not only contributes to the literature of debate surrounding it but also, just as importantly, delivers a worthy game plan for clearing up the dilemma.\"\nIsraeli historian and author Tom Segev believes his principal argument is \"well-founded\".\n\nRaja Shehadeh, a lawyer and author, including of \"Occupier’s Law: Israel and the West Bank\", regards \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\" as a \"fresh debate\" on Israel's policies in the West Bank. Shehadeh believes that \"With his well documented book and its provocative title, Carter is working to achieve 'one of the major goals of [his] life' as he makes clear at the outset of his book: 'to help ensure a lasting peace for Israelis and others in the Middle East.'\"\n\nRobert Fisk declares that the book is \"a good, strong read by the only American president approaching sainthood\", adding: \"Needless to say, the American press and television largely ignored the appearance of this eminently sensible book – until the usual Israeli lobbyists began to scream abuse at poor old Jimmy Carter, albeit that he was the architect of the longest lasting peace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour – Egypt – secured with the famous 1978 Camp David accords.\"\n\nCarl L. Brown in \"Foreign Affairs\" writes: \"This book offers a historical overview in the form of a personal memoir, tracing developments since the 1970s as Carter experienced and understood them. He may thus be said to be both a source for the historian and himself a historian of the Israeli–Palestinian confrontation. This little book merits a reading on both counts. Carter concludes that \"Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land.\" That statement, so out of line with the way mainstream American political figures (even those retired from public office) frame the issue, ensures that the book will be attacked by many. Perhaps it will be read as well.\"\n\nIan Black, Middle East editor at \"The Guardian\", writes \"Controversy about the book flows largely from the word \"apartheid\" in the title: it is wrong if applied to Israel within its pre-1967 borders, where there is discrimination but not institutionalised racism. In the West Bank, with its confiscated land, unequal allocation of water resources, fortress-like settlements, security fence and segregated roads, it is fitting enough. No one who has seen subjugated Palestinians struggling with everyday life alongside armed Jewish settlers can quarrel with it\".\n\nIn his blog, Tony Karon, a senior editor at TIME.com and a former anti-apartheid activist for the ANC, states \"The point being that Jimmy Carter had to write this book precisely because Palestinian life and history is not accorded equal value in American discourse, far from it. And his use of the word apartheid is not only morally valid; it is essential, because it shakes the moral stupor that allows many liberals to rationalize away the daily, grinding horror being inflicted on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza\".\n\nIn an article published on the website of the Institute for Middle East Understanding, Lena Khalaf Tuffaha finds that Carter's book \"eloquently describes the situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip\" and that \"his book challenges Americans to see the conflict with eyes wide open.\"\n\nWriting in \"The Nation\", Michael F. Brown, a fellow at The Palestine Center of The Jerusalem Fund, characterizes the book's title as \"extraordinarily bold—and apt\" and suggests: \"Perhaps President Carter should send copies of his book to members of Congress. . . . [so that] they might learn a thing or two about the long-festering conflict at the heart of so many of our current troubles in the region.\"\n\nIn \"The Arab American News\", Sherri Muzher, Palestinian-American director of Michigan Media Watch, writes: \"Nobody expects instant miracles to come from Carter’s book, but hopefully, it will spark the sort of robust discussions that even Israeli society and media already engage in.\"\n\nRabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of \"Tikkun\", calls Carter \"the only president to have actually delivered for the Jewish people an agreement (the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt) that has stood the test of time.\" He continues: \"We know that critique is often an essential part of love and caring. That is precisely what Jimmy Carter is trying to do for Israel and the Jewish people in his new book\". He further stresses that \"Carter does not claim that Israel is an apartheid state. What he does claim is that the West Bank will be a de facto apartheid situation if the current dynamics continue.\"\n\nCanadian labour union leader Sid Ryan writes: \"Former U.S. president Carter is just the latest world figure to openly challenge the policies of Israel in Gaza and the West Bank. He joins Rev. Desmond Tutu, another Nobel Prize winner. Each time a trade union or church group or world leader steps forward to break the cone of silence around this issue, the more difficult it becomes for the lobby groups to spew their propaganda.\"\n\nAli Abunimah, editor of the \"Electronic Intifada\", writing in \"The Wall Street Journal\", concludes \"President Carter has done what few American politicians have dared to do: speak frankly about the Israel–Palestine conflict. He has done this nation, and the cause of peace, an enormous service by focusing attention on what he calls \"the abominable oppression and persecution in the occupied Palestinian territories, with a rigid system of required passes and strict segregation between Palestine's citizens and Jewish settlers in the West Bank.\" Calling Carter \"the most successful Arab-Israeli peace negotiator to date\", Abunimah praises him for having \"braved a storm of criticism, including the insinuation from the pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League that his arguments are anti-Semitic.\"\n\nIsraeli Knesset member Yossi Beilin, the current leader of Meretz-Yachad, writes in \"The Forward\" that, while he \"disagreed mostly with the choice of language, including his choice of the word 'apartheid' what Carter says in his book about the Israeli occupation and our treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories—and perhaps no less important, how he says it—is entirely harmonious with the kind of criticism that Israelis themselves voice about their own country. There is nothing in the criticism that Carter has for Israel that has not been said by Israelis themselves.\"\n\nSouth African professor of international law John Dugard observes that while Carter's book \"is igniting controversy for its Israel and the apartheid analogy\" he understands the deeper rationale for Carter's analogy as follows:\nSince 1967 Israel has imposed its control over the Palestinian territories in the manner of a colonizing power, under the guise of occupation. It has permanently seized the territories' most desirable parts—the holy sites in East Jerusalem, Hebron and Bethlehem and the fertile agricultural lands along the western border and in the Jordan Valley—and settled its own Jewish \"colonists\" throughout the land. Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories has many features of colonization. At the same time it has many of the worst characteristics of apartheid. ... Many aspects of Israel's occupation surpass those of the apartheid regime. Israel's large-scale destruction of Palestinian homes, leveling of agricultural lands, military incursions and targeted assassinations of Palestinians far exceed any similar practices in apartheid South Africa. No wall was ever built to separate blacks and whites.\nZbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security Adviser to President Carter, agrees with the main thesis of the book: President Carter, in my judgement, is correct in fearing that the absence of a fair and mutually acceptable resolution of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is likely to produce a situation which de facto will resemble apartheid: i.e., two communities living side by side but repressively separated, with one enjoying prosperity and seizing the lands of the other, and the other living in poverty and deprivation. That is an outcome which must be avoided and I interpret his book as a strong plea for accommodation, which needs to be actively promoted by morally responsible engagement especially by America. Brzezinski also condemns the \"abusive reactions directed at Carter, including some newspaper ads\" for being \"objectionable and designed to intimidate an open public discussion.\"\n\nUCLA professor of English literature Saree Makdisi writes in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" that \"Carter's apartheid charge rings true\", observing: \"Israel maintains two sets of rules and regulations in the West Bank: one for Jews, one for non-Jews. The only thing wrong with using the word 'apartheid' to describe such a repugnant system is that the South African version of institutionalized discrimination was never as elaborate as its Israeli counterpart—nor did it have such a vocal chorus of defenders among otherwise liberal Americans.\"\n\nIn an essay published in \"The Nation\", Henry Siegman, former executive director of the American Jewish Congress, and visiting professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, begins by observing that the \"book's title more than its content\" caused an \"uproar\" even prior to publication, because it \"seemed to suggest that the avatar of democracy in the Middle East may be on its way to creating a political order that resembles South Africa's apartheid model of discrimination and repression, albeit on ethnic-religious rather than racial grounds\" and provoked such controversy due to \"the ignorance of the American political establishment, both Democrat and Republican, on the subject of the Israel-Palestine conflict\"; in Siegman's view: \"Carter's harsh condemnation of Israeli policies in the occupied territories is not the consequence of ideology or of an anti-Israel bias.\"\n\nNorman Finkelstein, an assistant professor of political science at DePaul University, defends Carter's analysis in \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\" as both historically accurate and non-controversial outside the United States: \"After four decades of Israeli occupation, the infrastructure and superstructure of apartheid have been put in place. Outside the never-never land of mainstream American Jewry and U.S. media[,] this reality is barely disputed.\"\n\nGeorge Bisharat, a professor at the University of California, Hastings College of Law, begins his \"Commentary\" on the book in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" of January 2, 2007: \"Americans owe a debt to former President Jimmy Carter for speaking long hidden but vital truths. His book \"Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid\" breaks the taboo barring criticism in the United States of Israel's discriminatory treatment of Palestinians. Our government's tacit acceptance of Israel's unfair policies causes global hostility against us.\"\n\nMichael Scheuer, the former head of the Central Intelligence Agency's Alec Station and professor of security studies at Georgetown University, criticized the negative response to the book, writing, \"By God, even former American presidents like Carter are viciously attacked in public if they make negative comments about Israel.\" Scheuer pointed to Deborah Lipstadt, Jacob Olidort, and Mona Charen as examples of the \"American takfiris' attack on President Carter for his book.\"\n\nIn \"It's Not Apartheid\", published in \"The Washington Post\", columnist Michael Kinsley states that Carter \"makes no attempt to explain [the use of the word 'apartheid']\" which he calls \"a foolish and unfair comparison, unworthy of the man who won – and deserved – the Nobel Peace Prize.\" To start with, no one has yet thought to accuse Israel of creating a phony country in finally acquiescing to the creation of a Palestinian state. Palestine is no Bantustan. Furthermore, Israel has always had Arab citizens. No doubt many Israelis have racist attitudes toward Arabs, but the official philosophy of the government is quite the opposite, and sincere efforts are made to, for example, instill humanitarian and egalitarian attitudes in children.\n\"National Review\" editor Rich Lowry says that \"Carter always finds a way to point a finger at Israel.\" Yes, there are two sides to every dispute, and heaven knows the Palestinian people have suffered throughout the past six decades, but Carter apes the Palestinian position and calls it evenhandedness. Lowry feels the \"book marks Carter's further disgraceful descent from ineffectual president and international do-gooder to apologist for the worst Arab tendencies\", citing a passage from the book. Mona Charen writes in the \"National Review\" that \"awkward phrasing is found throughout this slapdash work.\"Charen presents examples of what she regards as \"simplistic, naïve, or tendentious\" ideas in the book about the Six-Day War, Hezbollah, and Oslo Accords.\n\nIn \"Jews, Arabs and Jimmy Carter\", deputy foreign editor of \"The New York Times\" Ethan Bronner draws attention to what he describes as \"the narrowness of Carter’s perspective\" and argues that Carter fails to highlight legitimate objections to Israel's current policies in the course of \"simply offer[ing] a narrative that is largely unsympathetic to Israel\" while engaging in some \"misrepresentations ... [which] are a shame because most of what Carter focuses on is well worth reading about.\" To Bronner, \"Carter's picture feels like yesterday's story, especially since Israel's departures from southern Lebanon and Gaza have not stopped anti-Israel violence from those areas. ... This book has something of a Rip van Winkle feel to it, as if little had changed since Carter diagnosed the problem in the 1970s.\" Despite his own disagreements with aspects of the book and his acknowledgment that Carter overstates his case in it, Bronner finds that others have criticized the book \"unfairly\": \"Their biggest complaint against the book—a legitimate one—is the word \"apartheid\" in the title, with its false echo of the racist policies of the old South Africa. But overstatement hardly adds up to anti-Semitism.\"\n\n\"The Economist\" reviewed \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\" and found it to be \"a weak one, simplistic and one-sided ... Israeli expansionism gets the drubbing it deserves; Arab rejectionism gets off much too lightly.\"\n\nIn \"What Would Jimmy Do?\", published in \"The Washington Post\" Book World, Jeffrey Goldberg describes Carter as a \"partisan of the Palestinians\" who has offered a \"notably benign view of Hamas\" and who, he alleges, creates \"sins to hang around the necks of Jews when no sins have actually been committed\" as Carter \"blames Israel almost entirely for perpetuating the hundred-year war between Arab and Jew.\"\n\nIn \"The Question of Carter's Cash\", Claudia Rosett writes, \"Even in Carter's long history of post-presidential grandstanding, this book sets fresh standards of irresponsibility. Purporting to give a balanced view of the Palestinian–Israeli conflict, Carter effectively shrugs off such highly germane matters as Palestinian terrorism. The hypocrisies are boundless, and include adoring praise of the deeply oppressive, religiously intolerant Saudi regime side by side with condemnations of democratic Israel.\n\nPrior to the book's publication, during the U.S. midterm election campaign period in the third week of October 2006, several prominent Democrats criticized both the book and the author, a fellow Democrat. Specifically, Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean issued a statement: \"While I have tremendous respect for former President Carter, I fundamentally disagree and do not support his analysis of Israel and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. On this issue President Carter speaks for himself, the opinions in his book are his own, they are not the views or position of the Democratic Party. I and other Democrats will continue to stand with Israel in its battle against terrorism and for a lasting peace with its neighbors.\" Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated: With all due respect to former President Carter, he does not speak for the Democratic Party on Israel. Democrats have been steadfast in their support of Israel from its birth, in part because we recognize that to do so is in the national security interests of the United States. We stand with Israel now and we stand with Israel forever.\n\nIn an \"Op-Ed\" published on December 4 in \"The Jerusalem Post\", David A. Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), says that he finds it \"startling that a former president who prides himself on his ongoing contribution to world peace would write a crude polemic that compromises any pretense to objectivity and fairness\": \"Carter leaves out what any reasonable observer, even those that share his basic views of the conflict, would consider obvious facts, but does include stunning distortions\".; Harris \"cite[s] just two of the numerous examples\" of what he calls \"such mendacity.\" The first of these, Harris says, is that \"Carter discounts well-established claims that Israel accepted and Arafat rejected a generous offer to create a Palestinian state.\" The second \"manifest distortion,\" according to Harris, is that \"Carter states that Israel plans to build a security fence 'along the Jordan River, which is now planned as the eastern leg of the encirclement of the Palestinians'\"; whereas well-informed observers know that \"Israel has modified the projected route of the security fence on numerous occasions (the current route roughly tracks the parameters that Clinton advanced to the parties in negotiations) and that there is no plan to hem the Palestinians in on the eastern border.\" In omitting \"these well-known developments,\" Harris argues, Carter is \"leaving readers to think that a route that was once contemplated in proposed maps but never adopted or acted upon represents current reality.\"\n\nIn an unsolicited handwritten letter replying to Harris, former President Bill Clinton expresses gratitude for Harris' articles on behalf of the American Jewish Committee critiquing the book: \"Dear David, Thanks so much for your articles about President Carter's book. I don't know where his information (or conclusions) came from, but Dennis Ross has tried to straighten it out, publicly and in two letters to him. At any rate, I'm grateful. Sincerely, Bill Clinton.\"\n\nOn January 11, 2007, according to the Associated Press, \"Fourteen members of an advisory board to Jimmy Carter's human rights organization,\" the Carter Center, \"resigned ... to protest his new book.\" In their \"letter of resignation,\" as reported by the AP, the \"departing members of the Center's Board of Councilors told Carter ... 'You have clearly abandoned your historic role of broker in favor of becoming an advocate for one side'.\" The Carter Center's Board of Councilors, from which the fourteen members resigned, consists of over 200 members. Prior to those fourteen resignations, Kenneth W. Stein had already resigned from the board in protest against what he states are the book's \"errors\".\n\nThe Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), canceled a planned visit to Carter’s human rights center, stating that \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\" unfairly criticizes Israel: \"The book contains numerous distortions of history and interpretation and apparently, outright fabrications as well. Its use of the term 'apartheid' to describe conditions in the West Bank serves only to demonize and de-legitimize Israel in the eyes of the world.\" Representatives of the CCAR assert that President Carter's \"attempted rehabilitation of such terrorist groups as Hezbollah and Hamas demonstrated either a clear anti-Israel bias and criticizes him for implying that there has been \"a 'Jewish conspiracy' at work to discourage conversation about the Palestinians' plight.\"\n\nOn December 11, 2006, National Public Radio reported that \"Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, says his organization has received over 20,000 letters of complaint, so far, against President Carter.\"\n\nSteve Sailer wrote that \"The Soweto-like conditions imposed by Israel on the West Bank might well remind disinterested observers of the old South African regime. Many Israelis themselves are sick of being drafted to perform, in effect, outdoor prison guard duties in the Occupied Territories,\" and that \"to his critics, Carter's actual argument seemed less important than the fact that he would dare make it.\n\nDennis Ross said in an interview on \"The Situation Room\" on CNN that Carter's interpretation of the maps in \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\" is \"just simply wrong.\" Whereas in his book Carter presents the maps as an \"Israeli interpretation of the Clinton idea,\" according to Ross, who played a key role in shaping the Clinton administration's efforts to bring peace to the region, the maps in fact represented Clinton's proposals exactly. Responding to a question posed by \"CNN\" anchor Wolf Blitzer, Ross stated that Carter was also \"wrong\" to suggest that Israel had rejected the American proposals at Camp David: \"[T]his is a matter of record. This is not a matter of interpretation.\" Ross concluded: \"President Carter made a major contribution to peace in the Middle East. That's the reality. I would like him to meet the same standard that he applied then to what he's doing now.\"\n\nAlan Dershowitz, a professor of law at Harvard Law School, claims that Carter's book is \"riddled with errors and bias.\" Dershowitz argues that there are factual inaccuracies in \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\", including its statement that \"Israel launched a preemptive attack on Jordan\", observing that, in the 1967 Six-Day War, \"Jordan attacked Israel first, Israel tried desperately to persuade Jordan to remain out of the war, and Israel counterattacked after the Jordanian army surrounded Jerusalem, firing missiles into the center of the city.\"\n\nIn an open letter published in \"The New York Sun\", Kenneth W. Stein, Director of the Institute for the Study of Modern Israel of Emory University, who was the founder of the Middle East program at the Carter Center and the Center's first director (February 1984 – 1986), presents criticisms of the book as follows: \"President Carter's book on the Middle East, a title too inflammatory to even print, is not based on unvarnished analysis; it is replete with factual errors, copied materials not cited, superficialities, glaring omissions, and simply invented segments.\" In his letter sent to President Carter and others, Stein also observes: \"Aside from the one-sided nature of the book, meant to provoke, there are recollections cited from meetings where I was the third person in the room, and my notes of those meetings show little similarity to points claimed in the book.\" He adds: \"Being a former President does not give one a unique privilege to invent information or to unpack it with cuts, deftly slanted to provide a particular outlook. Having little access to Arabic and Hebrew sources, I believe, clearly handicapped his understanding and analyses of how history has unfolded over the last decade.\" At the end of the first week of December, Karen DeYoung reported that Stein had not yet provided a full outline of such alleged factual errors in the book.\n\nRebecca Trounson reports in the \"Los Angeles Times\": Stein presented details of the book's perceived errors; among the most serious, Stein says that Carter misrepresented UN Resolution 242 and gave a false account of a meeting held with former Syrian President Hafez Assad in 1990, which Stein attended and has the transcript of.\n\nGil Troy, professor of history at McGill University, opines: \"[I]f Carter is so innocent as to be unaware of the resonance that term has [apartheid], [then] he is not the expert on the Middle East or world affairs he purports to be.\" He elaborates:\nSadly, Israelis and Palestinians do not enjoy the kind of harmony the Israeli Declaration of Independence envisioned. Carter and his comrades use \"Apartheid\" as shorthand to condemn some of the security measures improvised recently. ... Israel built a security fence to protect its citizens and separate Palestinian enclaves from Israeli cities. Ironically, that barrier marks Israel's most dramatic recognition of Palestinian aspirations to independence since Israel signed the Oslo Accords in 1993. ... Applying the Apartheid label tries to ostracize Israel by misrepresenting some of the difficult decisions Israel has felt forced to make in fighting Palestinian terror.\n\nIn an article published on January 20, 2007, in \"The Washington Post\", Deborah Lipstadt, the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University, criticized Carter for what she calls his \"Jewish Problem\", complaining that, now \"facing a storm of criticism, he has relied on anti-Semitic stereotypes in defense.\" In a more-recent public appearance at a rally in London, in the first week of February 2007, Lipstadt charged that, in this book, Carter engages in what she terms \"soft-core denial\". According to Paul, \"She received huge applause when she asked how former US President Jimmy Carter could omit the years 1939–1947 from a chronology in his book\"; referring to him and to \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\", she said: \"'When a former president of the United States writes a book on the Israeli–Palestinian crisis and writes a chronology at the beginning of the book in order to help them understand the emergence of the situation and in that chronology lists nothing of importance between 1939 and 1947, that is soft-core denial.'\"\n\nCarter has responded to negative reviews in the mainstream news media in an op-ed published in the \"Los Angeles Times\" (which was excerpted in the British newspaper \"The Guardian\" and elsewhere): Book reviews in the mainstream media have been written mostly by representatives of Jewish organizations who would be unlikely to visit the occupied territories, and their primary criticism is that the book is anti-Israel. Two members of Congress have been publicly critical. Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for instance, issued a statement (before the book was published) saying that \"he does not speak for the Democratic Party on Israel.\" Some reviews posted on Amazon.com call me \"anti-Semitic,\" and others accuse the book of \"lies\" and \"distortions.\" A former Carter Center fellow has taken issue with it, and Alan Dershowitz called the book's title \"indecent.\"\n\nOut in the real world, however, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. I've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN said that I was an anti-Semite. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.\n\nAs Greg Bluestein of the Associated Press observes, Carter replied generally to charges by Ross, Dershowitz, Stein, and others that his book contains errors and inaccuracies by pointing out that the Carter Center staff as well as an \"unnamed 'distinguished' reporter\" fact-checked it. On \"Larry King Live\" in late November 2006, Larry King quoted Alan Dershowitz's saying that Carter's \"use of the loaded word 'apartheid'[,] suggesting an analogy to the hated policies of South Africa[,] is especially outrageous\" and asked the former president: \"What's the analogy? Why use the word apartheid?\" Carter replied:\n\nWell, he [Dershowitz] has to go to the first word in the title, which is \"\"Palestine\",\" not \"\"Israel\".\" He should go to the second word in the title, which is \"\"Peace\".\" And then the last two words [are] \"\"Not Apartheid\".\" I never have alleged in the book or otherwise that Israel, as a nation, was guilty of apartheid. But there is a clear distinction between the policies within the nation of Israel and within the occupied territories that Israel controls[,] and the oppression of the Palestinians by Israeli forces in the occupied territories is horrendous. And it's not something that has been acknowledged or even discussed in this country. ... (Italics added.)\n\nWith regard to the criticisms of Kenneth W. Stein, Carter has also pointed out \"that Stein hadn't played a role in the Carter Center in 13 years and that his post as a fellow was an honorary title. 'When I decided to write this book, I didn't even think about involving Ken, from ancient times, to come in and help.'\" Carter's biographer Douglas Brinkley has observed that Stein and Carter have a \"passionate, up-and-down relationship\" and that Stein has criticized some of Carter's previous statements about Israel. In response to Professor Stein's current criticism of the book, representatives of its publisher, Simon & Schuster, state: \"We haven't seen these allegations, we haven't seen any specifics, and I have no way of assessing anything he [Stein] has said. ... This is all about nothing. We stand behind the book fully, and the fact that there has been a divided reaction to it is not surprising.\"\n\nAs cited in various news accounts, \"Carter has consistently defended his book's accuracy against Stein and other critics\"; in a prepared statement, Carter's press secretary Deanna Congileo responds \"that Carter had his book reviewed for accuracy throughout the writing process\" and that \"[a]s with all of President Carter's previous books, any detected errors will be corrected in later editions.\"\n\nIn response to the Associated Press's request for a comment on the aforementioned resignations of Stein and fourteen other members of the Center's Board of Councilors, speaking on behalf of both Carter and the Carter Center, Ms. Congileo also provided a statement from its executive director John Hardman, who, according to Zelkowitz, \"also fact checked \"Palestine\", saying that the members of that board \"'are not engaged in implementing the work of the Center.'\"\n\nAfter receiving 25,000 petitions against his book presented to him by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, former President Carter sent a hand-written one-sentence note dated January 26, 2007, to the Center's dean and founder, Rabbi Marvin Hier, which the organization posted on its website, in which Carter states: \"I don't believe that Simon Wiesenthal would have resorted to falsehood and slander to raise funds.\" \nThe Associated Press reports that, \"facing continuing controversy over his new book on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict,\" former President Jimmy Carter \"issued a letter ... to American Jews explaining his use of the term 'apartheid' and sympathizing with Israelis who fear terrorism.\" Jimmy Carter's \"A Letter to Jewish Citizens of America\" is posted on the website of the Carter Center.\" Further commentaries based on this letter are quoted by John Kelly in his article \"The Middle East: Are Critics of Israel Stifled?\" in \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" of December 17, 2006.\n\nIn an op-ed published on December 20, 2006, in \"The Boston Globe\", Carter rejects critics of his book as not actually having addressed the major points contained in it:\nNot surprisingly, an examination of the book reviews and published comments reveals that these points have rarely if ever been mentioned by detractors of the book, much less denied or refuted. Instead, there has been a pattern of ad hominem statements, alleging that I am a liar, plagiarist, anti-Semite, racist, bigot, ignorant, etc. There are frequent denunciations of fabricated \"straw man\" accusations: that I have claimed that apartheid exists within Israel; that the system of apartheid in Palestine is based on racism; and that Jews control and manipulate the news media of America. Carter concludes:As recommended by the Hamilton-Baker report, renewed negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians are a prime factor in promoting peace in the region. Although my book concentrates on the Palestinian territories, I noted that the report also recommended peace talks with Syria concerning the Golan Heights. Both recommendations have been rejected by Israel's prime minister.\nIt is practically impossible for bitter antagonists to arrange a time, place, agenda, and procedures that are mutually acceptable, so an outside instigator/promoter is necessary. Successful peace talks were orchestrated by the United States in 1978–79 and by Norway in 1993. If the American government is reluctant to assume such a unilateral responsibility, then an alternative is the International Quartet (United States, Russia, the United Nations, and the European Union)—still with American leadership. An overwhelming majority of citizens of Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, and Palestine want peace, with justice for all who live in the Holy Land. It will be a shame if the world community fails to help them reach this goal.\n\n"}
{"id": "331987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331987", "title": "Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)", "text": "Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)\n\nThe Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee) is a political group which publishes the \"Weekly Worker\" newspaper. The party claims to have \"an internationalist duty to uphold the principle, 'One state, one party'. To the extent that the European Union becomes a state then that necessitates EU-wide trade unions and a Communist Party of the EU.\" In addition it is in favour of the unification of the entire working class under a new Communist International.\n\nIt is not to be confused with the former Communist Party of Great Britain, the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist), or the current Communist Party of Britain.\n\nThe origins of the CPGB (PCC) lie in the New Communist Party of Britain which split from the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1977. Under the influence of a faction of the Communist Party of Turkey, a handful led by NCP youth section leader John Chamberlain (who uses the pseudonym Jack Conrad) attempted to rejoin the then CPGB.\n\nFew actually regained party cards but the grouping began to publish \"The Leninist\", first as a journal, then as a more or less monthly paper. Initially \"The Leninist\" appeared to some to be a Stalinist publication in its politics, but over time it mutated into something very different. This may be due to their interaction with various Trotskyist groups including a series of exchanges with the Spartacist League. The faction developed a critique of the Stalinist states as well as the bureaucratism and political liquidationism of the old CPGB.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the 'official' CPGB in 1991, and its relaunch as the Democratic Left, the group declared their intention to reforge the party on what they declared to be \"firm Leninist principles\". They organised an \"emergency conference\", at which they claimed the CPGB name, but not its assets. They also changed the name of their paper, increasing its regularity to weekly.\n\nBy the early 1990s the group was working closely with the tiny Trotskyist Revolutionary Democratic Group and the discussion magazine \"Open Polemic\". It also sought to deepen its links with a group of recent ex-members of other Trotskyist groups such as the Socialist Workers Party who called themselves the International Socialist Group. The CPGB (PCC) described this process as \"Communist rapprochement\". The attempt failed as the ISG collapsed and \"Open Polemic\" briefly enrolled a few of its supporters in the CPGB (PCC), only for them to quit in a row over money.\n\nDuring the general election campaign in 1992 Ken Livingstone claimed that the members of the CPGB (PCC) were \"MI5 agents\".\n\nThe group was for a short while embedded in the Socialist Labour Party, but left to join the Socialist Alliance, in which they came to work closely with the Alliance for Workers' Liberty, and proposed a merger of their papers, rejected by the AWL. The two have since politically drifted apart.\n\nIn 2004 the group affiliated to the Respect Coalition. A minority disagreed with the tactic of working within Respect and formed a faction called the Red Platform. The new faction called instead for the CPGB (PCC) to rejoin a Socialist Alliance reform current called the Socialist Alliance Democracy Platform. The Red Platform won their aim but the CPGB (PCC) majority continued to work within Respect. Members of the Red Platform subsequently left to create the Red Party in August 2004 over a disagreement about their views being published in the paper.\n\nThe group was active in the Campaign for a Marxist Party (2006 - 2008) and is critical of the Campaign for a New Workers' Party and the Convention of the Left. The CPGB (PCC) was heavily involved in founding the Hands Off the People of Iran (HOPI) campaign; Mark Fischer, formerly National Organiser of the CPGB (PCC), is HOPI secretary. The CPGB (PCC) also enjoys close links with Communist Students.\n\nThe CPGB (PCC) endorsed the Labour Party in the June 2009 European Parliament elections and criticised the No to EU – Yes to Democracy coalition as \"left-wing nationalist.\"\n\nNon-members such as former Soviet dissident Boris Kagarlitsky, Matzpen founder Moshé Machover and Professor Hillel Ticktin — editor of \"Critique\" and chairman of the \"Centre for the Study of Socialist Theory and Movements\", University of Glasgow — have spoken at CPGB (PCC) events.\n\nThe Campaign for a Marxist Party was a campaign (founded 4 November 2006) run by the CPGB-PCC and other organisations on the British left for a political party with explicitly Marxist goals as part of a rebuilt workers' international. Its members were \"Critique\" (who proposed the campaign initially), Communist Party of Great Britain (PCC), and the Democratic Socialist Alliance. The Irish Socialist Democracy group welcomed the CMP. Similar socialist campaign groups include Campaign for a New Workers' Party and Convention of the Left.\n\nThe Campaign agreed three founding political principles at the founding conference: 1. We are in favour of a planned, democratic socialist society and against the market; 2. Socialism will be achieved in a single step when the working class seizes power over society, there are no intermediate “democratic” or other stages; 3. The Campaign is against the destructive incubus of Stalinism and will seek to make clear the counter revolutionary and anti-human nature of the Stalinist regimes and Parties. Stalinism was responsible for mass slaughter, brutal incarceration and the atomisation of the people of the countries under its control. In addition the Stalinists were responsible for the most cynical and costly betrayals of the working class everywhere from Germany to South Africa – no Party which has as its aim the liberation of humanity can do other than condemn the Stalinist current and seek to undo the damage done to Marxism by it.\n\nIts seven-member executive mainly consisted of members of the CPGB (PCC) and the \"Democratic Socialist Alliance\" criticised the party for its \"hijacking\" of the campaign. A group of members became known as the Trotskyist Tendency. The campaign published \"Marxist Voice\".\n\nIn November 2008 it was announced that the CPGB would move to wind up the campaign at its December AGM. Having done so, it claimed it will establish a new committee to promote \"unity of Marxists as Marxists\". A minority of members objected to the dissolution of the campaign including in published articles by Dave Spencer, Phil Sharpe and Steve Freeman.\n\nIn 2013, the CPGB (PCC) intervened in the campaign for a new left party initiated by film director Ken Loach. They accused the campaign's initial appeal of making \"Keynesian platitudes\" and called for a new formation on the left to have an explicitly Marxist programme. The CPGB (PCC) described the \"politically decrepit\" Socialist Resistance as \"the one 'insider' group\" in the campaign and accused the group of attempting \"to relive old Labour-style Keynesian welfarism.\"\n\nIn the run up to the Left Unity (LU) founding conference in November 2013, the CPGB (PCC) launched the Communist Platform in response to the Socialist Platform \"[obscuring] the differences between Marxism and a left reading of clause four-type politics.\" They launched the Communist Platform as a permanent tendency in Left Unity on 8 February 2014. On 29 March 2014, CPGB member Yassamine Mather was elected to Left Unity's National Council at the party's first policy conference.\n\nIn February 2016, the CPGB (PCC) dissolved their Platform and left LU.\n\nIn 2015, the CPGB (PCC) supported Jeremy Corbyn in his successful campaign to be elected leader of the Labour Party. The CPGB (PCC) has been a supporter of Labour Party Marxists (LPM), which promotes many of the ideas of the \"Weekly Worker\" to a Labour Party audience through its website and occasional print bulletins. Stan Keable, secretary of Labour Party Marxists, was expelled from the Labour Party in June 2017 for his association with LPM. The CPGB (PCC) has also promoted the work of another Labour Party organisation, Labour against the witch-hunt, in the \"Weekly Worker\".\n\nThe party has been involved in a rethinking of the class nature of the former USSR. Despite its origins in the NCP, \"The Leninist\" advanced sharp criticisms of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc countries, while strongly opposing movements it considered to be in support of capitalism. Today, leading member Jack Conrad calls these societies forms of \"bureaucratic socialism\", in a view strongly influenced by Hillel Ticktin and the \"Critique\" journal, while Mike Macnair argues that the USSR was a peasant based society frozen in transition from feudalism to capitalism. However, the CPGB (PCC) does not formally endorse any particular theoretical analysis of the USSR.\n\nDuring the Kosovo War of the late 1990s, the party supported the ethnic-Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and supports the complete secession of Kosovo from Serbia. The party refers to the Serbian province as \"Kosova\", the Albanian and Ottoman Turkish name for Kosovo.\n\nThe party lists abolition of age-of-consent laws among its immediate demands as well as alternative legislation to protect children from sexual abuse.\n\n"}

{"id": "1657953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1657953", "title": "Dacke War", "text": "Dacke War\n\nThe Dacke War () was a peasant uprising led by Nils Dacke in Småland, Sweden, in 1542 against the rule of Gustav Vasa. Dacke and his followers were dissatisfied with the heavy tax burden, the introduction of Lutheranism and the confiscation of Church property (the confiscation and taxes were introduced to pay for the Swedish War of Liberation that had brought Gustav Vasa to power). In 1543 the uprising was defeated, and Nils Dacke was killed.\n\nNils Dacke and his peasants were dissatisfied with the policies of the Swedish king Gustav Vasa. In his effort to modernize Sweden and gain more power, the king had instituted a more efficient system for tax collection. The heavy tax burden angered many peasants.\n\nGustav Vasa had also broken relations with Rome and promoted Lutheranism instead of Catholicism in order to confiscate the property of the church (including land), effected by the laws of the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden. In 1541 the king's men had confiscated many of the belongings of the churches in Småland, such as the church silver and even the church bells, to finance the army. Dacke criticized the new church order and promoted the old faith. He was also supported by many local priests.\n\nThe rebellion was one of many rebellions during the rule of Gustav Vasa. In contrast with other contemporary rebellions in Sweden, this one was led by peasants, and not supported by the local nobility.\n\nThe uprising began in the summer of 1542 when the king's bailiffs were attacked and killed when they came to collect taxes. Gustav Vasa responded by sending a military force led by his own father-in-law . He was defeated by Dacke's constantly growing army of peasants. Other attempts to defeat Dacke militarily also failed.\n\nNext, the Swedish government stopped all supplies of provisions and other necessities to the region. This weakened the rebellions considerably. Defaming propaganda about Dacke was also spread by the government, labeling him a traitor and a heretic.\n\nIn March 1543 Gustav Vasa ordered his army of Swedish recruits and German landsknecht mercenaries to attack Småland. This time larger forces were deployed, and Dacke's forces were attacked from two directions - from Östergötland and Västergötland. The uprising was defeated, and Dacke was wounded but managed to flee.\n\nThe king's revenge on the instigators of the rebellion was hard. The leaders that were caught were executed together with the priests who had supported Dacke. Peasants who had supported the rebellion were deported to Finland, where they had to serve in the army, and the counties where the rebellion had taken place had to pay a large fine to the king.\n\nDacke himself was caught and killed in August 1543 when trying to escape the country. According to legend, his body was taken to Kalmar, where his head was publicly displayed wearing a crown of copper, as a warning to others.\n\nThe rebellion was the most serious threat to the rule of Gustav Vasa, but after having defeated it he managed to consolidate his power, concentrating more and more power in the hands of the monarch.\n\nIn the Swedish language, the idiom \"[something] hasn't happened since the Dacke War\" is used to mean \"[something] hasn't happened for a long time\". This expression is especially common in the southern parts of Sweden but is also used elsewhere.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5857453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5857453", "title": "Die Gerd-Show", "text": "Die Gerd-Show\n\nDie Gerd-Show (en: The Gerd Show) was a German satirical radio show broadcast by Eins Live (WDR). Reaching over nine million listeners at its peak, it generated several Top 20 hits in the music charts in Germany, thanks to the impressionist talents of its creator, Elmar Brandt, as well as enough controversy over the show's good taste for it to receive newspaper coverage around the globe, despite the limited international appeal of German political humour.\n\nThe programme began in 1999, and was broadcast as a short daily comedy on various radio programmes. The most famous segments of these programmes were Elmar Brandt's rewrites of well-known tunes with new, satirical lyrics, which he sang in an imitation of the voice of Gerhard Schröder, who at that time was Chancellor of Germany. These parodies generated six hits in the Top 20 in Germany, and were also popular in Switzerland and Austria. \n\nThe most successful of these was \"Der Steuersong\" (en: \"The Tax Song\"), which reached the number one spot in Germany and Austria in 2002, and went double platinum in 2004, having sold over a million copies. Based on Las Ketchup's summer dance hit \"Aserejé\", the song lampooned Schröder's tax policy, listing a number of perceived absurd indirect taxes (such as an tax on dogs) and suggesting new ones on breathing and bad weather, and depicting the Chancellor as a cheat and a promise breaker. The song was accompanied by a video, in which an unflattering \"Spitting Image\" style puppet of Schröder stole coins from a charity collection tin, and medicine from the sick.\n\nThe song generated political controversy. Reports suggested that Schröder might take legal action, as he notoriously did—successfully—to stop a news agency printing claims that he dyed his hair, with a spokesman for Schröder's Social Democrats saying \"There are limits even to political satire... We will take a look at the video, and the chancellor will have to examine what steps to take.\" \n\nSchröder did not in the end take legal action, but did call Brandt a \"parasite\" and \"freeloader\" for building a career on someone else's voice, to which Brandt rebutted \"Freeloaders usually attach themselves to people who are successful\". The German tabloid \"Bild\" voiced indignation, asking \"Can the chancellor be mocked like this?\", though most thought that the song reflected genuine discontent with Schröder's tax policies and that Schröder took the song too seriously.\n\nIn 2003, Brandt took part in the German auditions for the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 with the song \"Alles wird gut\" (en: \"Everything's Going To Be Alright\"). The act, which featured another puppet of Schröder simulating sex with the four backing singers, the \"Gerdnerinnen\" (Gerdettes, a word play on the German word for gardener), received 30% of the German vote, taking third place and losing out to Lou's feel good anthem \"Let's Get Happy\" with 38%.\n\nFrom 2005, Anne Onken imitated Angela Merkel on \"The Gerd Show\", who would later beat Schröder to become chancellor. During the run-up to the 2005 German federal elections, a duet was released between Brandt as Schröder and Onken as Merkel, entitled \"Im Wahlkampf vor mir (Zonenmädchen)\" (en: \"Ahead of Me in the Polls (Girl from the East\")) and set to the tune of \"Im Wagen vor mir fährt ein junges Mädchen\" by Hans Blum. Despite speculation that it would reach the top spot as \"Der Steuersong\" did before it, it only reached 25th place in the German charts.\n\nIn October 2005, \"The Gerd Show\" was cancelled with 1,300 episodes. Its place was taken by the radio serial \"Schicksalsjahre einer Kanzlerin – Angela – eine Frau geht seinen Weg\" (en: \"A Female Chancellor's Years of Destiny – Angela – A Woman Follows His Path\", alluding to the Sissi film trilogy), with Angela Merkel played by Anne Onken, and her male colleagues played by Elmar Brandt.\n\n\n"}

The FAP began at Fresno State College, as a way to address gender inequities in art education, and the art world in general. In 1971, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro brought the FAP to the newly formed California Institute of the Arts, leaving Rita Yokoi to run the Fresno FAP until her retirement in 1992. The FAP at California Institute of the Arts was active until 1976. The students in the Feminist Art Program read women writers, studied women artists, and made art about being a woman based on group consciousness raising sessions. Often, the program was separate from the rest of the art school to allow the women to develop in a greenhouse-like environment and away from discerning critiques. While the separatist ideology has been critiqued as reinforcing gender, the FAP has made a lasting impression on feminist art which can be seen in retrospectives, group exhibitions, and creative re-workings of the original projects.\n\nThe original Feminist Art Program was developed by artist Judy Chicago. The first such program was launched in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College, now California State University, Fresno. In the spring of 1971, It became a full 15-unit program. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art.\n\nThe Fresno Feminist Art Program served as a model for other feminist art efforts, such as Womanhouse, a collaborative feminist art exhibition and the first project produced after the Feminist Art Program moved to the California Institute of the Arts in the fall of 1971. Sheila de Bretteville and Arlene Raven also taught in that program. Womanhouse, like the Fresno project, also developed into a feminist studio space and promoted the concept of collaborative women's art.\n\nAfter Chicago left for CalArts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.\n\nLater, Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program (FAP) at California Institute of the Arts.\n\nThe Feminist Art Program (FAP) was created by Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California, in 1971. Building on the \"radical educational techniques\" that she had first tried out in her classes for women in 19701971, when she worked at Fresno State, Chicago and Schapiro made the program, the first of its kind accessible to women only. Chicago in particular felt she had to \"redo\" her education as an art historian, since she had been taught by men exclusively and considered that this background forced a male perspective on her as an artist and disallowed her from developing her \"own forms, artistic language, and subject matter\".\n\nThe Feminist Studio Workshop was founded in Los Angeles in 1973 by Judy Chicago, Arlene Raven, and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville as a two-year feminist art program. Women from the program were instrumental in finding and creating the Woman's Building, the first independent center to showcase women's art and culture.\n"}
{"id": "4638069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4638069", "title": "Fragile state", "text": "Fragile state\n\nA fragile state is a developing country characterized by weak state capacity or weak state legitimacy leaving citizens vulnerable to a range of shocks. The World Bank, for example, deems a country to be ‘fragile’ if it (a) is eligible for assistance (i.e., a grant) from the International Development Association (IDA) (b) has had a UN peacekeeping mission in the last three years, and (c) has received a ‘governance’ score of less than 3.2 (as per the Country Performance and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index of The World Bank).\n\nWhile many countries are making progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, a group of 35 to 50 countries (depending on the measure used) are falling behind. It is estimated that out of the world's seven billion people, 26% live in fragile states, and this is where one-third of all people surviving on less than US$1.25 per day live, half of the world's children who die before the age of five, and one-third of maternal deaths occur.\n\nNot only are they falling behind, but the gap with other developing countries is widening since the 1970s. In 2006, per capita GDP grew only at 2% in fragile states, whereas it reached 6% in other low-income countries. Projections (for example, World Bank, 2008) that fragile states will constitute an even larger share of low-income countries in the future given that many better performing low-income countries graduate to middle-income status. This is a major challenge for development efforts and it has been argued by the Overseas Development Institute that fragile states require fundamentally different approaches from the development models exercised in more resilient countries, because of the different context of risk.\n\nOne common measure of state fragility is to use the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment index, but more complex indexes, for example including the security dimension, are increasingly being used.\n\nCountry contexts vary widely in this group of countries ranging from Haiti to Nepal, from Uzbekistan to Burundi. Some are trapped in a vicious cycle of violent conflict and poverty or suffer from a natural resource \"curse\"; others face a legacy of poor governance; many emerging from crisis cannot deliver even the most basic services to their citizens, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. In terms of dynamics, fragile states include:\n\n\nA fragile state is significantly susceptible to crisis in one or more of its sub-systems. It is a state that is particularly vulnerable to internal and external shocks and domestic and international conflicts. In a fragile state, institutional arrangements embody and perhaps preserve the conditions of crisis: in economic terms, this could be institutions (importantly, property rights) that reinforce stagnation or low growth rates, or embody extreme inequality (in wealth, in access to property and land ownership, in access to the means to make a living); in social terms institutions may embody extreme inequality or lack of access altogether to health or education; in political terms, institutions may entrench exclusionary coalitions in power (in ethnic, religious, or perhaps regional terms), or extreme factionalism or significantly fragmented security organisations. In fragile states, statutory institutional arrangements are vulnerable to challenges by rival institutional systems be they derived from traditional authorities, devised by communities under conditions of stress that see little of the state (in terms of security, development or welfare), or be they derived from warlords, or other non-state power brokers.\n\nThe opposite of a \"fragile state\" is a \"stable state\" one where dominant or statutory institutional arrangements appear able to withstand internal and external shocks and contestation remains within the boundaries of reigning institutional arrangements. With the right conditions, some countries such as Mozambique and Burundi have so far demonstrated a remarkable turn-around. To address the challenge of these countries falling behind, the international spotlight must be kept on countries where the Millennium Development Goals are hardest to achieve, using common principles for action; making the international aid architecture more rational; improving the organisational response of the wide range of actors involved (including \"the 3Ds\": diplomacy, defense and development); and measuring results.\n\nWhile there are no universal criteria to determine state fragility, the World Bank, through its LICUS programme (Low Income Countries Under Stress) and its Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Index, has been able to establish a preeminent frame of reference for donor countries and other institutional partners. Based on four clusters (including economic management, structural policies, policies for social inclusion/equity and Public Sector Management and institutions) as well as 16 indicators, the CPIA index rates state performance, with those countries scoring under 3.2 out of a total of 6 qualifying as \"fragile\". Such low performing countries may then be, in turn, suitable for the allocation of financial assistance from a variety of international actors such as the International Development Association and other, similar bodies.\n\nFragile states, similar to failed, weak or collapsed states, is an analytical category that gained prominence from the mid 1990s onwards and gained further traction after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Background is the belief held by many policy-makers and academics alike that the potential for contemporary conflict is harboured within, not between, states. Low capacity and low-income states of the Global South are thought to pose direct threats not only to their own populations, but by extension also to their neighboring Western countries. Following this logic, fragile states are in need of development in order to be able to provide security and basic services to its citizens, decreasing vulnerability and increasing resilience to internal and external shocks.\n\nFollowed by many donor countries and international organisations and institutions, this approach has led to a spirited debate within academia and beyond. While on the one hand, some scholars deem the categorisation of states as fragile as useful, highlighting the potential to predict state collapse and assess the many possibilities to prevent it, a more critical-minded literature disputes this. Two main criticisms emerge, challenging on one side the potential of abuse of the category of state fragility, legitimising external intervention at the expense of the local agency. On the other, the analytical utility of the categorization effort itself is disputed; the state-centric grouping together of a wide range of diverse countries leads to highly standardised development responses that cannot take into account often highly divergent political, economic and social conditions.\n\nThe following factors are used by Fund For Peace to ascertain the status of a country. \n\n\n\n\nFragile states and post-conflict countries have participated in many intergovernmental groups and associations since the Second World War, including the Group of 77 and regional groups such as ASEAN and the African Union. However until recently countries affected by conflict had no dedicated international platform. In 2010 the g7+ was founded by a group of post-conflict countries to better represent their interests on the international stage. The g7+ is an intergovernmental organisation bringing together countries that have recent experience of conflict. The group aims to draw attention to the special challenges faced by fragile states, provides a platform for conflict-affected countries to come together to discuss their shared development challenges, and advocates for better international policies to address the needs of conflict-affected countries. The g7+ has embarked on its very own index for measuring state fragility, identifying five clusters (political legitimacy, justice, security, economic foundation, revenue and services), which are located on a fragility- ”spectrum” containing five stages. Main differences to other indices are constituted by privileged role of individual, state-specific characteristics and self- rather than external assessment. There are currently 20 member countries: Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Papua New Guinea, São Tomé e Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo and Yemen. Sierra Leone's Minister of Finance and Development, Dr Kaifala Marah, is the current Chair, taking over the role in May 2014. The role of Chair was previously held by Minister Emilia Pires of Timor-Leste who oversaw the development of the forum in its earliest years. The g7+ Secretariat was established in 2010 and is based in Dili, Timor-Leste.\n\nThough governments for most of the countries seem to be functioning well and representing their people on the world stage, Joel Migdal looked into the relationship between state and society, where there is a disparity between the officially announced policies and the actual distribution of state resources. The list of countries included India, Mexico, Egypt and Sierra Leone etc. He traced this disparity to the lack of social control by the government - “the actual ability to make the operative rules of the game for people in the society.\" This not only includes existence of government agencies over the territory and extraction of resources but also the ability to appropriate resources and to regulate people's behavior.\n\nMigdal stated the expansion of European economy and world trade in the 19th century led to drastic changes in people's strategies of survival in countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. State policies enforced by Europeans, including land tenure laws, taxation and new modes of transportation, changed people's life situation and needs in these countries rapidly and deeply. Old rewards, sanctions and symbols became irrelevant under the new situation and previous social control and institutions were eroded.\n\nHowever, unlike western Europe in the earlier centuries, these countries did not establish a new concentration of social control as the base of a strong and capable state. This is because although these countries had the necessary condition for creating a strong state - old social control weakened by the world trade before World War I - they did not have the sufficient conditions: 1) world historical timing that encourages concentrated social control; 2) military threat either from outside or within the country; 3) the basis for an independent bureaucracy; 4) skillful top leadership that would take advantage of all the above conditions.\n\nThere is a relationship between state fragility and service delivery and they are both seen as interrelated and mutually reinforcing, yet some also suggest that the provision of basic services can reduce state fragility. In fragile states service delivery may be impacted by financial constraints, limited expertise and a lack of information Long and protracted violence leads to the neglect and subsequent decay of the infrastructure required for provision. Governance and the breakdown of social order can also heighten the social exclusion of specific groups along ethnic, religious, political and gender lines. Such violence can be political, including conflict and terrorism, but can also be social or criminal, leading to a broad combination of security-based obstacles to effective service provision.\n\nEducation, health, access to water and adequate sanitation are important not only for survival, but are also recognised human rights whose provision is demonstrated to be necessary for a transition away from conflict. States can develop trust and legitimacy over the long term through the provision of these basic services (known as the \"peace dividend\"). Education, for instance, can protect children and non-combatants during conflict, facilitate intergenerational change and lead to the socialisation of children and youth, be a catalyst for broader transformation, as well as provide a sense of normalcy and continuity. Furthermore, the delivery of some of these services can be seen as more neutral, such as immunisation, and can lead to conflicting groups uniting on specific issues and further result in increased legitimacy.\n\nHowever, how support is given to fragile states to provide these services is not so simple. Aid agencies who act independently of the state and provide parallel services risk undermining state legitimacy and capacity. On the other hand, supporting the state's own provision can be problematic as the state itself may be the cause of social divisions and a source of conflict.\n\nLimited evidence of varying quality on basic services and social protection in conflicted affected situations has been found. Research into the gaps in provision, delivery and access of basic services has queried whether social protection interventions have contributed to state-building processes. It highlighted that this assumption has already significantly begun shaping policy and programmes and that state-building outcomes in policy may outweigh other outcomes like better water, healthcare and education.\n\nWhether or not to provide services in parallel is often framed as a debate between state building and peacebuilding. State building is argued to lead to peace when it involves seeking to develop an inclusive state, where legitimacy is built as the result of the state responding to the demands of all of society and providing public goods and services. However, supporting the state in this direction is not a simple task, especially for the following reasons:\n\n\nEqually, peacebuilding efforts that do not include the state can undermine its ability to function. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute emphasise the need for NGOs and other development actors to deepen knowledge of the context and maintain a constant awareness of the relationship between state- and peace-building.\n\nThe correct balance of state-building and peacebuilding has been argued to be highly elusive, even when peacebuilding and security have been achieved through the development of the state's own capacity. The UK government supported reforms in Sierra Leone along the principle of \"security first\" over the last decade, which is believed to have improved security, increased access to and the quality of justice, decreased corruption and positively reformed public service. Since the end of the civil war in 2002, there has been no major violence, peaceful elections were held in 2007 and there has been enough stability to help build sustainable institutions. Yet Sierra Leone suffers severe underdevelopment and ranked third to last on the UN Human Development Index for 2010. This in turn has created frustration and disappointment amongst the younger generation and poses a significant risk of a return to violence.\n\nDebates have been among scholars if post-conflict reconstruction intervention is the best strategy for state-building in fragile states. It is widely believed that multilateral intervention can interrupt the conflict trap of fragile states and set countries on a path toward postwar economic and political development. Responding to the failure of governance in fragile states, scholars have proposed new models of intervention, including neo-trusteeship and shared sovereignty. Supporters of International intervention encourage interventions led by the major powers or regional actors with the greatest national security or economic interest in restoring stability and democracy to the fragile state. They support developing agreements that authorize international intervention whereby the costs of third-party peacekeeping and state-building would increasingly be borne by the state being reconstructed.\n\nAnother kind of opinion has been the autonomous recovery - fragile states can recover from a conflict in the absence of intervention and may be able to develop effective institutions of government out of warfare. Supporters of autonomous recovery argue that international assistance and external support undermines the self-sustaining nature of the compact between rulers and constituents. Examples of Uganda, Eritrea, and Somalia support the theory of autonomous recovery, where these weak states successfully achieved a lasting peace, a systematic reduction in violence, and post-war political and economic development in the absence of international intervention.\n\nAccording to Samuel Huntington, “The most important political distinction among countries concerns, not their form of government but their degree of government.” The purpose of democratization and institutional development in fragile states is to help them improve both state capacity and development of inclusive institutions. Knutsen and Nygard (2015) emphasize that semi-democracies (fragile states in our discussion) are less stable than both autocracies and democracies. In other words, once the process of democratization begins, it is dangerous to stop midway.\n\nThe purpose of democratization itself though is of concern before thinking about the means to achieve it. Ake (2000) says that democracy has mostly been analyzed in the context of its propensity to foster economic development. But in the context of its feasibility in Africa, the utility of democracy as measured by the “values, concerns and priorities of African peoples”, will determine to a considerable extent how far they will accept democracy. In general, the process of democratization is strongly mediated by normative values of the population of concern.\n\nIn order to design interventions aimed at promoting inclusive institutions when the status quo witnesses prevalently weak state structures, tractability of theoretically analyzing regime transitions is critical. But according to Geddes (1999), this is because different kinds of authoritarianism differ from each other as much they differ from democracy. To facilitate the analysis of these differences, she classifies authoritarian regimes as 'personalist', military, single-party, or amalgams of the pure types. It is important to note that all of them can be conceptualized from the perspective of “Limited Access Order” societies (North 1999).\n\nAccording to Larry Diamond, in many of the fragile states promoting democracy is difficult simply because they lack the classic facilitating conditions for democracy—more developed levels of per capita income, civil society, independent mass media, political parties, mass democratic attitudes and values, and so on—but because they lack as well the more basic conditions of a viable political order. In these states, the challenge is not only (or in some cases, even at all) to pressure authoritarian state leaders to surrender power but rather to figure out how to regenerate legitimate power in the first place. The imperative is not only to empower citizens and their independent organizations but to endow state institutions as well with resources, training, organization, and a sense of a common mission.\n\nOne point of caution is that progress in democratization in fragile states are vulnerable. According to Samuels (2013), history has witnessed regime changes from democracy to autocracy during the periods of 1925-1945 [e.g. Germany (1933) ] and 1960-1974 [e.g. Brazil (1964), Chile (1973)]. What he identifies as domestic causes of regime change are also the factors to be mitigated through institutional design. Some of these factors are civic culture, class conflicts arising from the unequal distribution of economic gains and military identity. Some of the international causes are the foreign policy of superpowers, the degree of participation in multilateral institutions, the extent of globalization and supranational impact of religious institutions on domestic political institutions.\n\nIndividuals in fragile states often rely on non-state actors such as chiefs, tribal elders, secret societies, gangs, militias, insurgents or religious leaders to meet their justice and security needs. Lisa Denney, of the Overseas Development Institute, therefore stresses the need for development donors to engage with these non-state actors when attempting to reform justice and security services in fragile states. She suggests four rules of engagement:\n\n\nResearchers found little evidence in literature on the impact of private sector development on state society relations and whether PSD and state relations meet public expectations. They thought one reason could be the lack of empirical data gathered from interviews and public surveys on the ground. The interlinkage of PSD on state society relations therefore definitely remain an area for further exploration and should receive greater attention in academic circles and among practitioners in respective publications. Key findings include:\n\n\nA 2012 study by EPS-PEAKS investigated the relationship between state fragility, conflict and economic performance. It describes a large degree of variation among countries' experiences of conflict and foreign direct investment (FDI), with conflict accompanied by high levels of FDI in some countries and low levels of FDI in others. The study suggests that the majority of FDI in fragile states is driven by the motives of resource-seeking multinationals. While this investment can lead to economic growth, this potential is often not realised, and receiving investment solely for resource extraction can lead to further conflict: a phenomenon known as the resource curse.\n\nIf a state cannot tax reasonably or spend responsibly a key element of statehood is missing, claim researchers at the Overseas Development Institute and World Bank. They explain that substantial progress can be made in public financial management in fragile states, with most progress made on budget execution, though critical gaps remain in knowledge of the relationship between PFM, statehood and development progress.\n\nAn important economic component for failed states is reintegrating ex-fighters into society and the economy. Blattman and Annan conducted a study on how employment reduced risk of returning to violence for high-risk men after the Second Liberian Civil War. The study was on a program that provided agricultural training and capital inputs to the ex-fighters who still own rubber plantations or participated in illicit mining for precious minerals or logging. They found that the men responded well to agricultural training, reduced their illicit extraction of materials by roughly 20%, and about a quarter were less likely to be willing to fight in the election crisis in Côte d'Ivoire. However, the illicit activity did not stop completely. They also found that a promise of future returns was crucial in deterring men from fighting.\n\nA 2015 study, commissioned by the G7 member states, identifies seven climate-fragility risks that pose threats to the stability of states and societies in the decades ahead. The report finds that in fragile regions, where inequality persists and the government is unable to respond to stresses, the impacts of climate change on water, food and land will multiply existing pressures. It suggests that dynamics of state fragility, social and political fragility, may be exacerbated by climate change impacts and that the consequence of this is reduced adaptation capacity. A downward spiral of fragility or 'vicious climate-fragility cycle' begins. The report also describes how one can measure the capacity of states and societies to meet the challenges of environmental change along a 'spectrum of fragility', from 'most fragile' to 'most resilient'. In fragile situations, where the government lacks ability to carry out basic functions, the state is more vulnerable to and less able to cope with climate change pressures such as natural resource scarcity, land use change, extreme weather events or volatile food prices, and hence more at risk from further instability.\n\n\n\n"}

He was charged with sedition during World War II.\n\nHe was born on March 7, 1900 to Mable E. (1881–1971), originally from Illinois, and John W. Winrod (1873–1945), originally from Missouri.\nHis father, John, was a former bartender whose saloon was attacked by Carrie Nation.\n\nIn 1918 he was the chief clerk at the Kansas Gas and Electric Company in El Dorado, Kansas. By 1925 he formed the Defenders of the Christian Faith, a fundamentalist Christian organization that opposed teaching evolution in public schools and supported Prohibition and racial segregation.\n\nWinrod professed strongly antisemitic views, earning him the nickname \"The Jayhawk Nazi\" (\"Jayhawk\" being a nickname for a Kansan). Winrod offered the following defense of his views in the introduction to his book \"The Truth About the Protocols\" which proclaimed the veracity of \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\": \"After observing the title of this book, some will accuse me of being anti-Semitic. If by this they mean that I am opposed to the Jews as a race or as a religion, I deny the allegation. But if they mean that I am opposed to a coterie of international Jewish bankers ruling the Gentile world by the power of gold, if they mean that I am opposed to international Jewish Communism, then I plead guilty to the charge.\" Winrod believed the United States to be the chosen land of God and, when the Great Depression struck, publicly stated that it was the work of Satan. He believed Franklin D. Roosevelt was a \"devil\" linked with the Jewish-Communist conspiracy and that Hitler would save Europe from Communism.\n\nWinrod spread these views through his newspaper, \"The Defender\", which by 1937 achieved a 100,000 monthly circulation. Some of the articles reproduced materials from the pro-Nazi and virulently antisemitic international \"Welt-Dienst\"/\"World-Service\"/\"Service Mondial\" news agency founded in 1933 by Ulrich Fleischhauer.\n\nWinrod ran for a U.S. Senate seat from Kansas in the 1938 elections, but was defeated in the Republican primary when a popular former governor, Clyde M. Reed, was lured out of retirement by the party establishment to run against him. With 21.4% of the vote, Winrod was a distant third after Reed and Dallas Knapp of Coffeyville, Kansas.\n\nWinrod developed a strong following among German-speaking Kansas Mennonites who identified with his religious, anti-World War II, and pro-Germany views. \"The Defender\" was printed by Mennonite-owned Herald Publishing Company of Newton, Kansas from 1931-42. Winrod found support in Bethel College and Tabor College and from editors of local Mennonite papers, and some Mennonite precincts voted predominantly for Winrod in the 1938 Senate primary.\n\nAccording to the 1941 \"Theologue\", the yearbook of Practical Bible Training School (now Davis College) located just outside Binghamton, New York, Winrod was a member of the school's administration. No details are given as to what Winrod's duties were. In 1942 the federal government indicted Winrod for sedition, alleging conspiracy against the U.S. government. The political aspect in attempting to suppress free speech troubled civil libertarians in what critics derided as the Great Sedition Trial. The death of the judge ended the trial in 1944. The government decided not to renew the prosecution, so Winrod and his fellow defendants were freed.\n\nHe died on November 11, 1957 in Wichita, Kansas of pneumonia and was buried in that city's White Chapel Memorial Gardens.\n\nIn 1940 Winrod's wife sued for divorce. Their son, Gordon (born 1926), is a Christian Identity minister and convicted kidnapper.\n"}
{"id": "21858302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21858302", "title": "Haldane Reforms", "text": "Haldane Reforms\n\nThe Haldane Reforms were a series of far-ranging reforms of the British Army made from 1906 to 1912, and named after the Secretary of State for War, Richard Burdon Haldane. They were the first major reforms since the \"Childers Reforms\" of the early 1880s, and were made in the light of lessons newly learned in the Second Boer War.\n\nThe major element of the reforms was the creation of an expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for intervening in a major war. This had existed before, but it had not been well-prepared for overseas service, and the newly organised force would have a permanent peacetime organisation and a full complement of supporting troops. At the same time, the reserve forces were restructured and expanded to ensure that the overseas forces could be efficiently reinforced and supplied with new recruits. To ensure that home defence would not suffer from sending the regular forces overseas, the Militia formed the Special Reserve and the Volunteer Force and the Yeomanry were reorganised into a new Territorial Force; these latter two reforms were grouped together in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907. To encourage the development of military skills, an Officer Training Corps was established in public schools and universities. Military strategy was revitalised by a new Imperial General Staff, which would ensure a common doctrine and common strategic aims among the various military forces of the British Empire, including the Dominions as well as British India. Finally, the Regular Army itself would be reformed by the development of a new operational and training doctrine, laid down in Douglas Haig's new \"Field Service Pocket Book\".\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 saw the bulk of the changes put to the test; the Expeditionary Force was quickly sent to the Continent, whilst the Territorial Force and Reserves were mobilised as planned to provide a second line.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the British Army had seen two major operations in close succession - the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny - and it had become apparent that the existing organisation of the forces was not sufficient for large-scale modern warfare. The first wave of reforms was from 1858 to 1860. This period saw the creation of the Staff College, which helped to turn officers in the upper reaches of the Army into professional soldiers; the transformation of the old East India Company army into the Indian Army to better control the forces in India; and the creation of the Volunteer Force to help with home defence whilst the Regular Army was overseas.\n\nThe second wave was from 1868 to 1872, comprising a collection of administrative changes popularly known as the \"Cardwell Reforms\" after the then Secretary of State for War, Edward Cardwell. The purchase of commissions by officers was abolished, and recruits were now taken on for a short enlistment in a specified regiment or corps rather than the (unpopular) system of twenty-one-year general service enlistments. These measures at a stroke increased the quality of the manpower of the Army, and provided for a trained and efficient reserve of veterans which could be recalled to the colours in an emergency. A further part of the reforms was the reorganisation of the regimental system, linking \"territorial\" (line) regiments in paired regimental depots with a territory based recruiting area for simplified recruitment and training.\n\nThe third set of reforms was the \"Childers Reforms\" (again named after the Secretary of State who carried them out) of the early 1880s, which carried through the Cardwell regimental reorganisations to their logical end by completing the amalgamation of linked regiments into single two-battalion regiments along with the local units of militia and volunteers.\n\nThe result of these reforms was to provide a sizable, well-trained force in the British Isles, which could be sent overseas in time of crisis, with a system of reservists and home-service volunteers to support it. However, with the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899, the system immediately began to show some strain; by the end of the first year of fighting, the reserves had been entirely exhausted. Various novel measures, including the extensive use of auxiliary forces, were experimented with for the remainder of the war; the Militia provided garrison units to free up regulars, the Volunteers sent service companies to be attached to regular battalions, and the Imperial Yeomanry was created to supply much-needed mounted infantry.\n\nA number of half-hearted attempts were made at reform during the war and in its immediate aftermath, but with little effect. Two important Royal Commissions were established in 1902 - the Esher Committee and the Norfolk Commission - and reported in 1904. The Esher Report called for wide-ranging reforms in the administration of the Army and the War Office, whilst the Norfolk Commission, which had studied the auxiliary forces, declared them \"unfit for service\" and recommended various practical reforms alongside the much more sensational suggestion of universal military service. Some of these reforms were instituted under the Conservative Secretary of State for War, Hugh Arnold-Forster, in 1904-5, but the broad thrust of his reform plans were strongly opposed. Attempts to reorganise the home forces into six Army Corps had begun, but only one of these had actually been organised, and even that lacked many of its support units and staff.\n\nIn December 1905, the Balfour government collapsed, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman became Prime Minister, leading a minority Liberal government. Richard Haldane was appointed Secretary of State for War, an almost accidental selection — he himself had been aiming to be Lord Chancellor, whilst Campbell-Bannerman offered him the post of Attorney-General, then the Home Office, and had offered the War Office to two other men before Haldane offered to take it. Despite this inauspicious beginning, he would become, in the words of Douglas Haig, \"the greatest Secretary of State for War England has ever had\". Haldane took the post with well hidden preconceived ideas as to the role of the Army having realised that the reform-weary Generals in the War Office, after St John Brodrick, would not want another Secretary of State for War who was intent on changing things yet again. Haldane's success was that he got the Generals on side having gained their trust and respect, then expunged the War Office of those officers who did not support his reforms and with the support of Lord Esher, Maj Gen Haig and Colonel Ellison, finally designed and implemented a set of reforms that would go some way to preparing the British Army for the opening salvos of the First World War.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus during the 1906 general election, which the Liberals won by a landslide, obtaining a majority of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane turned his attention to the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.\n\nAs the Army was now geared to a specific purpose, it could be reorganised to fit this role; any elements which did not fit could be discarded to help pay for the changes; this was to include the disbandment of ten infantry battalions and a number of surplus artillery batteries, and the withdrawal of some overseas garrisons. The Army at home was reorganised into six divisions by a Special Army Order dated 1 January 1907, with one \"heavy\" four-brigade Cavalry Division and two mounted brigades for reconnaissance, along with some Army troops. In February 1907, Haldane announced the coming year's spending estimates; despite the creation of the new force, the disbanded units and other minor efficiencies had managed to reduce overall spending by two to three million pounds.\n\nOnce the Regular Army had been organised as a continental Expeditionary Force, it would be necessary to provide forces for home defence. Haldane's proposal anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Army - the Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militia - should be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force administered by County Territorial Associations.\n\nThese changes were embodied in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, which passed the Commons with little opposition save for a dispute over the future status of Militia regiments. It essentially abolished the existing Volunteers and Yeomanry, and used them to create a new Territorial Force of fourteen infantry divisions, fourteen cavalry brigades, and a large number of support units, all raised, organised and financed by local organisations but liable for service under War Office command. The Militia provided the Special Reserve, which would contain men who had not served in the regular Army but agreed to be liable for service with the regular forces in wartime.\n\nIn November 1906, Douglas Haig was appointed Director of Staff Duties at the War Office, and took up the task of providing a new training doctrine for the Army. The Esher Report had suggested a new scheme for two sets of training manuals, but these had not been fully implemented. In 1907, the new provisional \"Field Service Pocket Book\" was produced, revised the following year, and finally standardised as \"Field Service Regulations, Part I - Operations\" in 1909. This was to serve as the training manual for all branches of the service, and was the synthesis of the generally agreed tactical and strategic principles which had emerged from the South African War.\n\nPart II, \"Administration\", however, was more contentious. Haig was strongly in favour of an entirely new system, where the manual would cover the whole organisation of a field army, including base and lines-of-communication troops as well as field units. This was strongly opposed by the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General staff, who felt that it was unnecessary, and resented such an imposition on their 'territory' by what they saw as an outsider. However, with Haldane's support, Haig was able to push this through and ensure its adoption.\n\nOne issue that was foreseen as a potential problem was the supply of skilled officers to the Army in wartime, and a committee was established in 1906 under Sir Edward Ward to study the matter. It issued two reports, one focusing on university and school corps, and one on the Special Reserve. The main recommendation of the former was to reorganise the existing school Cadet Corps and university Rifle Corps, which had been formed on an ad-hoc basis as part of the broader Volunteer movement, into a uniform force, administered and supported by the War Office.\n\nUnder Army Order 160 of 1908, contingents of the \"Senior Division\" were established in universities, and contingents of the \"Junior Division\" in public schools. Army Order 178, later the same year, provided a standard set of regulations, stating that the scheme was intended to provide \"a standardized degree of elementary military training with a view to providing candidates for commissions\".\n\nThe scheme was popular; by the end of 1910, there were 19 contingents of the \"Senior Division\" and 152 of the \"Junior Division\", and one year later, at the start of 1912, this had risen to 55 and 155 respectively. A total of 23,700 cadets were enrolled as of 1 January 1912, with 630 officers, and 830 former cadets had already gone on to take commissions in the auxiliary forces.\n\nIn the later part of the nineteenth century, the emphasis of Imperial defence policy had shifted from a single centralised Army and Navy to an approach whereby the self-governing Dominions began to provide forces for their own defence, and to begin to take responsibility for strategic interests and bases in their own geographic areas. The culmination of this was the South African War, where contingents from the Dominion militaries had played a significant role.\n\nHowever, whilst the forces were developing locally, the goals of a comprehensive Imperial defence policy remained constant. A proposal was made to a conference of Dominion leaders in 1907, which recommended that all Imperial forces be organised along a standard model, similar to the recent divisional reorganisation of the British Army and the Army in India (the combined British Army units in India and the Indian Army units). The conference approved this concept, but carried the idea further, and recommended the creation of a general staff drawn from the forces of the entire Empire. This Imperial General Staff would serve as a common link between the national forces, and could oversee the development of a single uniform defence scheme. It would also be able to help ensure greater consistency between the forces, though it was carefully laid down that the Imperial General Staff could only offer \"guidance\" to the local government and General Staff, and would not have any binding authority over the national forces.\n\nThe new system was approved by an Imperial conference in July 1909, which confirmed the support for the new structure, and the principle of standardisation, as well as emphasising that it was not to limit \"the autonomy of the self-governing Dominions\".\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 saw the bulk of the changes put to the test; the Expeditionary Force of six divisions was quickly sent to the Continent, whilst a Territorial Force of 14 divisions and Reserves were mobilised as planned to provide a second line. The mobilisation was carried out punctually and the divisions were armed.\n\n"}

Although the membership of the organisation never exceeded forty, it played a significant role in mobilizing Jewish labour activism during its short span of existence. It was the first Jewish socialist organisation in England and its journal \"HaEmes\" ('The Truth') was the first Jewish socialist periodical.\n\nThe association was founded by ten Jewish immigrants from Russia on May 9, 1876. The founding meeting took place at 40, Gun Street, Spitalfields. The group was led by Aaron Liebermann, who became the secretary of the organisation. Other founding members included Lazar Goldenberg (who, along with Liebermann, had worked with the Russian publication \"Vpered!\") and Isaac Stoune.\n\nIn total the Hebrew Socialist Union held 26 meetings during 1876. Meetings were held in Yiddish. The statues of the organisation, edited by Liebermann, were published in Hebrew.\n\nLiebermann, who himself was a former orthodox Jew and a drop-out of the rabbinical college of Vilna, adopted a staunchly internationalist and anti-religious approach. He sought to build a movement which would unite Jewish workers around a socialist, not religious, identity. Furthermore, the Hebrew Socialist Union sought to propaganize for socialism amongst non-Jews as well. For example, Liebermann hoped to build unity between Irish and Jewish immigrant workers.\n\nThe group began holding public meetings across Spitalfields in the year of its foundation. Hundreds of workers attended a meeting held at Goodman's Fields on August 26, 1876. After the August 26 meeting, a Jewish tailors union was formed as an offshoot of the Hebrew Socialist Union. This was the second time a Jewish tailors' union had been formed in London. The tailors' union had 80 members at its peak.\n\nSome demands of the Hebrew Socialist Union, such as a call for a ten-hour working day, were well received amongst the Jewish community. But the organisation found itself at loggerheads with the leaders of the Jewish community once it had begun to protest high fees for synangogue marriages. The \"Jewish Chronicle\", an organ of the Anglo-Jewish establishment, called the representatives of the Hebrew Socialist Union as non-Jews, 'missionaries' and 'enemies'.\n\nIn September 1876 tensions between its socialist core and religious minded workers erupted inside the tailors' union. The union declared itself independent from the Hebrew Socialist Union. At the a meeting of the union, Liebermann was physically assaulted by the religious unionists. Later, the treasurer of the tailors' union disappeared, along with the union funds. Verbal attacks against the Hebrew Socialist Union on behalf of local rabbis persisted, and splits emerged between the founders of the organisation. In December 1876, Liebermann left England. By that time the organisation had disappeared.\n\n"}

The local police did not intervene in the massacre, pursue a First information report filed by survivors or help resettle the survivors. The mass graves at the massacre were rediscovered in January 2011. A similar massacre occurred in nearby Pataudi.\n\nDuring the Partition of India, Hondh village was settled by 16 families who migrated from Pakistan. Hondh was a \"dhani\", or cluster of farmhouses, outside the main village of Chillar. The families were influential and prior to the massacre the Sarpanch, or mayor, of Chillar had been one of the residents of Hondh.\n\nAfter the October 1984 Assassination of Indira Gandhi, thousands of Sikhs were killed in the 1984 Anti-Sikh pogroms by Indian National Congress mobs being aided by government officials who provided \"trucks and state busses\" as well as \"weapons-including oil, kerosene, and other flammable materials\".\n\nThe attack happened in two waves. On 1 November 1984 a Hindu attempted to storm the village but the Sikh villagers were able to fend them off. However, at 10 AM on 2 November, a truck and a bus carrying \"200-250\" Congress young men arrived at the village. They began attacking the Sikhs armed with rods, lathis, diesel, kerosene, and matches as well as chanting slogans in favor of the Congress (I) party. For four hours the Congress members mob beat to death and burned alive 31 Sikh villagers. They continued to burn down the Sikhs' bungalows and Gurdwara until the villagers who were able to escape the initial attack tried to find shelter in three different houses. The mob then set two of the houses on fire by pouring kerosene through the roof. One villager, Balwant Singh, retaliated by killing one of the rioters with a sword and another group of villagers ran out of their burning house to fight back. Once the villagers started fighting back the massacre \"came to an abrupt halt\".\n\nOn the night of 2 November, the 32 surviving Sikhs found shelter in a nearby village. Under the cover of night they escaped to Rewari in a tractor trolley. Once the villagers started fighting back the massacre \"came to an abrupt halt\". The survivors now reside in Ludhiana and Bathinda in Punjab \n\nA FIR was filed by Dhanpat Singh, the then sarpanch, or mayor, of Chillar at police station Jatusana in Mahendragarh district, which is now in Rewari district. It reveals the killers first came from Hali Mandi around 11 AM but were persuaded by the villagers to turn around. When they came in the evening they had several more trucks of reinforcements and a group of three Hindus had tried to persuade the killers to leave the village but were intimidated into leaving. It reports that 20 of the dead Sikh villagers' bodies were burned beyond recognition.\n\nOn 23 February 2011, the local police claimed to have lost the First information report, however \"The Times of India\" was able to find a signed copy of the report which had been obtained from the same police station just days earlier.\n\nAt 6 PM on 1 November 1984 after Indira Gandhi was shot, a mob under the guidance of Congress leader Lalit Maken set fire to Pataudi's Gurdwara which created a panic in the city. As the armed mob rampaged through the town and set fire to Sikh homes in the city, one group of Sikhs escaped to the outskirts while another found shelter in local Hindu Ashram.\n\nOn 2 November, the Sikhs returned to the city to see the damage done to their homes. Left tired and crying in front of their homes, they became separated from each other, and at 10 AM the mob returned and began burning people alive. Many of the Sikhs were able to escape but the Congress mob captured 17 of them, murdered them, and burned their remains to remove evidence.\n\nAlthough the survivors filed multiple FIRs with the police, none of the assailants were captured or prosecuted. After the massacre many Sikh families fled and only five families remain out of thirty that were settled prior to the massacre.\n\nOn 22 January 2011, an engineer in Gurgaon, Haryana, Manwinder Singh Giaspur, struck up a conversation with a delivery boy who talked about a \"deserted village of Sardars\" near his own village. When the boy began talking about arson, Giaspur realized he was talking about the 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms. The boy further told him that recently people had begun to steal wood and bricks from the site so on 23 January Giaspur drove to Chillar and found the site of the massacre. After seeing bones inside a building and quotations from the Guru Granth Sahib on the walls he realized the building was a Gurdwara. Giaspur then uploaded \"50-60\" pictures of the village onto Facebook and sent appeals to various Punjabi language newspapers to investigate and preserve the site. After not receiving help from the SGPC, Giaspur contacted the All India Sikh Students Federation and Sikhs for Justice. On 13 March, the man who discovered the site of the massacre was asked to resign from his position as general manager of V&S International Pvt Ltd, allegedly for his role in exposing the massacre.\n\nOn 2 March 2011 members of Akali Dal, the main Sikh political party in India, demanded that the Lok Sabha, India's parliament, form a probe to look into the massacre.\n\nDal Khalsa (International) is attempting to appeal to United Nations officials in Delhi to send a team to investigate. The American Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee organized a meeting with the US State Department to discuss related human rights violations and legal action.\n\nSikhs for Justice has maintained that the 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms were an organized attempt at genocide and that government commissions set up to investigate them have purposely not investigated violence outside of Delhi to cover up systematic patterns of violence against Sikhs throughout India. In response to this discovery the AISSF and Sikhs for Justice have established a trust to find other sites like Hondh-Chillar throughout India.\n\nOn 4 March, an Ardās was held at the Akal Takht for the victims of the massacre.\n\nOn 12 March, Sikhs for Justice met with UNESCO director general Irina Bokova in New York to discuss preserving the ruins as a heritage site. They also consulted with archeologists who had worked on Holocaust sites for advice.\n\n\n"}

Their goal was to free the peasants from the bondages of feudalism, but currently they are regarded as one of the main causes for the rise of the Sicilian Mafia.\n\nUnder feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land. They enforced law and order through their private armies, which were also used to keep unruly workers and tenants in line.\n\nIn 1773, in the Palermo revolt, guilds (maestranza) urged peasants to apply for the nationalized lands of the Jesuits. in 1781-1786, Viceroy Caracciolo ruled that the fiefs of nobles now belong to the king. He also declared that private armies are illegal. Peasant obligations to lords were reduced.\n\nIn 1789, an edict called for enclosure of common lands, to be distributed to the poor in copyhold in exchange for yielding some of their feudal rights. However, most peasants were too poor to buy their rights, and the laws could be interpreted and enforced only by local magistrates. As a result, the rich became richer and the poor became poorer. A rural proletariat was created.\n\nAfter 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. Primogeniture was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land was to become private property of the peasants.\n\nIn the 1860s, After Italy annexed Sicily in the Italian unification wars, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens.\n\nSome scholars claim that the unification forces did not favor land reform, and with little benefit to them, the peasants rebelled. The insurrection was put down in 1865, killing 5000 peasants.\n\nOther scholars claim that, on the contrary, the redistribution resulted in a huge boom in landowners: from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861.\n\nWith this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism. Lack of manpower was also a problem: there were often less than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity from the law in the interim. Compounding these problems was banditry: rising food prices, the loss of public and church lands, and the loss of feudal commons pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors. These extralegal protectors would eventually organize themselves into the first Sicilian Mafia clans.\n"}

{"id": "9220580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9220580", "title": "Literary inquisition", "text": "Literary inquisition\n\nThe literary inquisition () or speech crime () refers to official persecution of intellectuals for their writings in China. The \"Hanyu Da Cidian\" defines it as \"the ruler deliberately extracts words or phrases from intellectual's writings and arbitrarily accuse him in order to persecute him\" (\"旧时谓统治者为迫害知识分子，故意从其著作中摘取字句，罗织成罪\"). The Inquisition took place under each of the dynasties ruling China, although the Qing was particularly notorious for the practice. In general, there are two ways a literary inquisition could be carried out. First is that the conviction came from the writing itself. That is, the writing was the direct cause of the persecution. The second is that the writing was used as a tool to provide legitimate evidence for a predetermined conviction. Such persecutions could owe even to a single phrase or word which the ruler considered offensive. Some of these were due to naming taboo, such as writing a Chinese character that is part of the emperor's personal name. In the most serious cases, not only the writer, but also his immediate and extended families, as well as those close to him, would also be implicated and killed.\n\nThe earliest recorded literary inquisition occurred in 548 BC in the state of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period. Recorded in the \"Zuo zhuan\", the powerful minister Cui Zhu (崔杼), who had murdered the ruler Duke Zhuang, killed three court historians (Taishi, 太史) because they insisted on recording the event in the official history. The Burning of books and burying of scholars in Qin dynasty is also considered a form of literary inquisition by some Chinese scholars. It is uncertain how frequently the persecutions occurred. However, compared to Ming and Qing dynasty, literary inquisition before Song dynasty happened less frequently due to the lack of printing.\n\nOne major case in Han dynasty was the case of Yang Yun (杨恽). Emperor Xuan first discharged him from his position in the government under the accusation of defamation. In 54 BC, he was sentenced to death through waist chop because of his complaints on his unfair treatment written in a letter for his friend Sun, which was considered disrespectful and outrageous to the Emperor. Affected by this, his friends who were still in court, were also discharged from their positions. Kong Rong, a lead figure of the Seven Scholars of Jian'anin late Eastern Han dynasty, was killed by warlord Cao Cao for his letters to Cao disagreeing and criticizing his rule and practice, including Cao's ban on alcohol for its potential negative impact on the nation. His wife and two sons were also killed. In Three Kingdomsperiod, the death of Ji Kang was also related to his writing. In response to Sima Zhao's offer of a position as civil official, Ji Kang wrote a letter (“与山巨源绝交书”) expressing his refusal of pursuing any political career. This letter, however, later provided justification for the advice of Zhong Hui, the official who conveyed the offer for Sima Zhao to Ji Kang, to sentence Ji Kang to death.\nDuring Northern Wei dynasty, prime minister Cui Hao carved \"Guo Shu\"(\"国书\"), which records the history of the ruling Tuoba clan and of which he was assigned as the lead editor, into stone monuments and located them on the side of a major road in suburb of the capital. The Xianbei bureaucrats found exposing their ancestor's history to the public was offensive and inappropriate. Thus, Cui Hao was accused of defaming the state and thus sentenced to death in 450. Along with Cui Hao, his whole clan, his wives' clans and 128 officials participated in the editing work were all sentenced to death.\n\nIn 609, Xue Daoheng, the grandfather of Xue Yuanchao, was sentenced to death Emperor Yang of Sui Dynasty. In response to Emperor Yang's attempt to keep Xue from retiring, Xue wrote an essay praising the previous Emperor Wen. Emperor Yang considered this response as a mockery and found it offensive. The direct cause of Xue's death was his saying in reminiscence of Gao Jiong (高熲), who supported Emperor Yang's competitor and was sentenced to death. However, there is also evidence for that the underlying cause of his death was Emperor Yang's jealousy of his talent on poetry as the author of the famous poem \"XiXiYan\" (“昔昔盐”) from Sui dynasty. In this case, Xue's death could also be considered as a literary inquisition on poem (诗祸, shihuo).\n\nDuring Song dynasty, the concept of literary inquisition started to take formal shape. Unlike isolated cases in previous dynasties, literary inquisition in Song dynasty became a tool in political struggles, consciously and purposefully used by opposing political parties to suppress and eliminate opponents. However, because the founding emperor of Song dynasty, Emperor Taizu, vowed to not kill any scholar or intellectuals who wrote to comment or address on political issues, intellectuals involved in literary inquisition in Song dynasty were often exiled instead of sentenced to death.\n\nIn 1079, the poet Su Shi of Song dynasty was jailed for several months and later exiled by the Emperor Shenzong due to an accusation of writing and disseminating poems alleged to slander the court. This case was also related to the political context at that time. The state was undergoing socioeconomic reform, New Policies, led by Chancellor Wang Anshi. Su Shi as a conservative at the time, however, had expressed his disagreement with certain practices of this reform. Such action triggered the anger of people in support of the reform, which included several persons from the Censorate (yushitai, 御史台) responsible for surveilling officials and fact-finding in the case of legal procedure. One of the censorates, Li Ding, initiated the case by writing to the Emperor and accusing Su Shi for defamation. Under his effort, the Censorate pointed out more than 60 spots of evidence across more than 10 of Su Shi's poems and identified more than 20 people who have communicated with Su Shi through writings.\n\nSouthern Song, especially during Qin Hui's tenure as the Chancellor, marked the rise of extensive and systematic use of literary inquisition for political purposes. In face of invasion from Jurchen Jin Dynasty to northern part of China, the debate in the court was between the \"pro-war party\" led by Yue Fei and \"anti-war party\" advocating peace treaties with Jin. As the leader of \"anti-war party\", Qin Hui used literary inquisition as a tool to intimidate or eliminate his political opponents in order to reach political conformity on the threat of Jin invasion. Qin Hui targeted specifically on the leading figures of \"pro-war party\", Zhao Ding (赵鼎), Hu Quan (胡铨) and Li Guang (李光). In 1138, in response to Jin's humiliating terms in their peace negotiation that would render Song as subservient state, both Zhao Ding and Hu Quan expressed strong objections. As a result, Zhao Ding was removed by Qin Hui from his position as Great Councilor in the fall of 1138. He was later exiled to todays Hainan where he committed suicide in 1147 when Qin Hui took action against his writing declaring again his determination against peace negotiation with Jin. Meanwhile, Hu Quan wrote in his memorial in 1138 that accepting these terms would be \"[taking] the Empire of Your ancestors and [turning] it into the Empire of these dog barbarians\". While these phrases spoke out for the public sentiment toward the peace negotiation, Qin Hui took it as rebellious and called for severe punishment of Hu as an example to stop other officials from doing the same. Therefore, Hu was dismissed from office, exiled to Zhaochou (昭州) and forbidden from reinstatement.\n\nLi Guang was also punished for his outspoken criticism of Qin Hui being a traitor. Qin Hui thus accused Li of resentment and ill will, and exiled him to today's Guangxi province in 1141. In 1150, he was further exiled to Hainan because of his attempt to compose a \"private history\" (野史), which was forbidden and alleged slanderous by the Emperor and Qin Hui due to their fear of potential negative record of their doings. Li Guang's case involved several other officials associated to him. One of them was Wu Yuanmei (吴元美), who was demoted as a result of Li's case. He then wrote \"Tale of Two Sons of Xia\" (\"夏二子传\") expressing his feelings toward his current situation. In this writing, Wu used words \"Xia\" (夏) and \"Shang\" (商), which could be seasons as well as dynasties, and thus could be interpreted as the change of seasons from summer to autumn or the decay of dynasty. Wu also mentioned \"flies and mosquitos\", which were insects active in the season yet also often served as allegory with despicable person in Chinese culture. Therefore, these words provided evidence for Qin Hui to accuse him of defamation and further exiled Hu to today's Guangdong province, where Hu died. \n\nThere are records of literary persecutions during the Ming dynasty and the beginning of the period saw the most severe persecutions. Before he became emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), the Ming dynasty's founder, was illiterate and had been a beggar. While he established his empire, he surrounded himself with scholars, treating them with respect while he learnt to read and familiarise himself with history. He sent out requests to scholars for their presence, and while many agreed others declined for fear of the repercussions if they made a mistake. On occasion the emperor, who was learning to read, would order the execution of someone who had written something he misunderstood.\n\nThe rulers of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty are particularly notorious for their use of literary inquisitions. The Manchus were an ethnic minority who had defeated the Han Chinese-led Ming dynasty; as such, they were sensitive to public sentiments towards them. Writers and officials usually took the stance of drawing distinctions between the Han Chinese and the Manchus; the latter were traditionally viewed as barbarians in Han Chinese culture. However, while the Manchus were in charge, writers resorted to veiled satire. According to Gu Mingdong, a specialist in Chinese literature and intellectual thought, the Manchus became almost paranoid about the meanings associated with the Chinese characters for 'bright' and 'clear', 'Ming' and 'Qing' respectively.\nOne inquisition was the \"Case of the \"History of the Ming Dynasty\"\" (明史案) in 1661–1662 under the direction of regents (before the Kangxi Emperor came in power in 1669) in which about 70 were killed and more exiled.\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty, literary inquisition began with isolated cases during the reigns of the Shunzhi and Kangxi emperors, and then evolved into a pattern. There were 53 cases of literary persecution during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. Between 1772 and 1793, there was an effort by the Qianlong Emperor to purge \"evil\" books, poems, and plays. He set out to get rid of works by Ming loyalists who he believed were writing subversive anti-Qing histories of the Manchu conquest. The scale of the destruction cause by this \"literary holocaust\" is uncertain due to gaps in the imperial archives, however as many as 3,000 works may have been lost. An estimated 151,723 volumes were destroyed by the inquisition in this period. Amongst the works subject to this treatment were books considered disrespectful towards the Qing emperors or previous ethnic minority dynasties that could be viewed as analogous to the Qing. From 1780 onwards, plays could also be destroyed if they were vulgar or contained anti-Manchu material. Writers who criticised the Qing dynasty could expect to have their entire work erased, regardless of content. The inquisition was often used to express local ambitions and rivalries that had little to do with the ruler's own political interests. It thus generated interclass, as well as intraclass, warfare. For example, commoners could lay charges against scholars.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Make-work jobs are similar to workfare, but are publicly offered on the job market and have otherwise normal employment requirements (workfare jobs, in contrast, may be handed out to a randomly selected applicant or have special requirements such as continuing to search for a non-workfare job).\nSome consider make-work jobs to be harmful when they provide very little practical experience or training for future careers. \n\nAs a part of the New Deal, the CWA (Civil Works Administration) was created as a stopgap measure to boost the economic relief provided by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and Public Works Administration. At its peak, the CWA employed 4,230,000 people; however, President Roosevelt was wary of the specter of corruption and accusations of boondoggling, and shut the CWA down after less than a year. Economists like Milton Friedman considered the programs like the CCC and WPA as justified as a temporary response to an emergency. Friedman gave Roosevelt considerable credit for relieving immediate distress and restoring confidence.\n\nIn a socialist nationalized economy, several of the nationalized sectors of work can be considered as make-work jobs, such as when an industry does not make a profit, but is considered essential by the state to the national interest.\n\nMake-work jobs have been introduced during periods of high unemployment to provide as substitutes for regular jobs. In many European countries, social welfare systems provide cash transfers to those who are unable to secure employment. These programs often require the recipient to undertake job training, internships, or job rotations. Make-work jobs can have the benefit of giving workers the chance of meeting new people and learning how to work with others. Such jobs can also help workers learn the importance of coming to work on time and taking responsibility for their actions.\n\nMany of the skills learned while doing make-work jobs help workers when applying for and doing regular jobs. Several make-work jobs that were created in Denmark in 2014 were gardening, cleaning up beaches and sidewalks, reading to the elderly or disabled, washing toys at day cares, working with local bike programs, and counting cars.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26079122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26079122", "title": "Micromega rule", "text": "Micromega rule\n\nIn voting theory, the micromega rule holds that, when political parties choose electoral systems, \"the large prefer the small and the small prefer the large\". The term \"micromega\" references \"Micromégas\", a tale by Voltaire in which dwarfs and giants dialogue.\n\nFor electoral rules, it is postulated that a few large parties tend to prefer small assemblies, small district magnitudes (the smallest being one), and rules based on small quotas of votes for allocating seats (the smallest being simple plurality, which does not require any specific threshold), while multiple small parties tend to prefer large assemblies, large district magnitudes, and large quotas (like those of proportional representation: within proportional representation systems, given the same number of seats, systems with a higher quota such as Hare or Sainte-Laguë favour smaller parties, while systems with a lower quota such as Droop or D'Hondt favour larger parties). Large parties may prefer small institutions in order to exclude others from competition, while small parties prefer large institutions able to include them within. More specifically, political configurations in which there is a single dominant party or two rather balanced parties tend to produce choices in favor of rather restrictive or exclusionary electoral systems, such as those based on plurality rule in single-member districts, while settings with multiple parties tend to support choices in favor of more inclusive electoral formulas, such as those using rules of proportional representation.\n\nThis has been seen as an upside-down reading of Duverger's laws holding that a plurality rule election systems tend to favor a two-party system, while proportional representation tends to multipartism. By suggesting, in contrast, that electoral systems are an effect of party systems rather than a cause, it has been shown that changes from a plurality system to a proportional system are typically preceded by the emergence of more than two parties, and are typically not followed by a substantial increase in the number of parties. Existing parties tend, thus, to choose electoral systems that are able to crystallize or consolidate the previously existing party configurations and systems. More generally, electoral systems and other prominent political institutions can be seen as a consequence of already existing political party systems in assemblies and governments, each of which tends to prefer those institutional formulas and procedures that can consolidate, reinforce or increase their relative strength. \n\nInspired by the micromega rule, Rein Taagepera presented the seat product of simple electoral systems, which is obtained by multiplying some transformation of the assembly size by the number of seats in the average district magnitude, in order to predict the number of parties in the system. As he acknowledges, the relationship between party systems and electoral systems accepts two-direction lines of causality. A relevant implication of Taagepera’s equation for political practitioners of institutional design is that if the size of the assembly is rather stable and depends on the country's size, for a small country with a small assembly just a few parties can be sufficient to produce a change of electoral system in favor of proportional representation, while, for a large country and a large assembly, many parties would be necessary to produce such a result.\n\n"}

The disadvantage of the continued existence of the Service Boards had been one that the one Service could still express its views to the Minister independently of the other Services. Policy formation and planning, logistics and supply, personnel, administration, finance, civil management, and management services were transferred to the central Defence Headquarters. Each Chief of Staff and their separate Headquarters were now only concerned with operational matters.\n\nIn 1989 Defence was separated into two separate bodies – the Ministry of Defence headed by the Secretary of Defence, the senior civilian officer and the New Zealand Defence Force headed by the Chief of Defence Force (CDF), the senior military officer.

{"id": "38880048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38880048", "title": "National Defense Mediation Board", "text": "National Defense Mediation Board\n\nThe National Defense Mediation Board (NDMB) was a United States federal agency established by Executive Order 8716 on March 19, 1941, that settled disputes between labor and management during the prewar defense period. The executive order established the NDMB as a tripartite agency of eleven representatives, four each from labor and industry and three from the public. The order vested in the agency the power to “exert every possible effort to assure that all work necessary for national defense shall proceed without interruption and with all possible speed.” The Board could use either mediation or voluntary arbitration to resolve disputes between management and labor in defense industries. If these methods failed, the Board was empowered to investigate controversies, conduct fact-finding, and formulate recommendations.\n\nDuring the ten months of its existence, the Board received a total of 118 cases of labor disputes. Since strikes were usually in progress when the Board received its cases, the NDMB’s basic policy was to persuade unions to call off strikes in return for wage retroactivity and a promise of a hearing. This was successful in most cases, but, in the rare instances when parties did not heed Board recommendations, the Board forwarded matters to the White House. The NDMB ultimately collapsed because of a dispute involving the “captive mines,” during which the Board refused to grant union shop to the United Mine Workers (UMW).\n\nThe NDMB was created largely in response to the high incidence of strikes during the defense-related production boom, which began in 1940. In 1941, more than two million workers participated in more than 4,000 work stoppages, some of which directly disturbed defense production. In response, several antistrike bills were pending in Congress. Sidney Hillman, a member of the National Defense Advisory Commission, recommended a tripartite mediation board to President Franklin D. Roosevelt because it might be more acceptable to union leaders than antistrike legislation. Although the American Federation of Labor (AFL) quickly endorsed the proposal, labor’s second major arm, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), was reluctant to support the creation of the tripartite board. CIO’s president, Philip Murray, realized that in preventing and ending strikes, the mediation board would “find its attention directed against labor in order to maintain the status quo.” Nevertheless, Murray did not oppose the proposal. Shortly thereafter, President Roosevelt issued an executive order creating the NDMB.\n\nThe powers of the NDMB were severely limited by its inability to issue “directive orders” with regard to labor disputes. Under Roosevelt’s executive order, only the secretary of labor could certify the NDMB to rule on disputes threatening defense production. Such certification only occurred during disputes that the federal conciliation service could not resolve. Thus, partly because of its inability to render final decision, the NDMB emphasized collective bargaining and voluntarism, rather than federal determination, in settling labor disputes. In the two cases where voluntary arbitration and mediation had failed and management refused to accept Board recommendations, the president seized the plants by executive order. Therefore, although the NDMB was often criticized for lacking formal powers of arbitration, the threat of governmental seizure and public pressure to comply with its recommendations gave the Board substantial authority in dispute mediation.\n\nThe Defense Mediation Board also established precedents in union security agreements. Union security agreements are contracts between labor and industry that determine to what extent unions may compel employees to join unions as a requirement for working. As James B. Atleson writes, mediation is a difficult model to apply unless parties can reach a compromise on conceptual principles. Thus arose the need for the NDMB to create common ground between labor and industry on union security. The NDMB enacted the “maintenance of membership clause,” a compromise between labor and management that would be adopted by its successor, the National War Labor Board (1942–1945)National War Labor Board. Under the clause, employees who were already union members were required to maintain membership with the union for the life of the contract. Because employees were not forced to join unions, the policy prevented a closed shop but also avoided the complete disintegration of unions in the wartime economy.\n\nThe NDMB successfully mediated labor disputes for eight months but broke down during the “captive mines” conflict between the steel industry and the United Mine Workers. At the heart of the conflict were labor’s demands for union shop in the commercial mines. After the UMW called out 50,000 miners in its first strike, the NDMB convinced workers to go back to work while it mediated a settlement. However, these attempts at mediation were unsuccessful, and the UMW called a second strike in spite of Roosevelt’s exhortations to not strike again. On November 10, 1941, the NDMB voted nine-to-two against union shop. Two labor members of the NDMB, both from the CIO, resigned from the Board, resulting in its collapse. However, shortly following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt created the National War Labor Board, a similar tripartite agency with expanded powers.\n\n"}

The mirrors were built in the late 1920s and early 1930s as an experimental early warning system for incoming aircraft, developed by Dr William Sansome Tucker. Several were built along the south and east coasts, but the complex at Denge is the best preserved, and are protected as scheduled monuments.\n\nThere are three acoustic mirrors in the complex, each consisting of a single concrete hemispherical reflector.\n\n\nAcoustic mirrors did work, and could effectively be used to detect slow moving enemy aircraft before they came into sight. They worked by concentrating sound waves towards a central point, where a microphone would have been located. However, their use was limited as aircraft became faster. Operators also found it difficult to distinguish between aircraft and seagoing vessels. In any case, they quickly became obsolete due to the invention of radar in 1932. The experiment was abandoned, and the mirrors left to decay. The gravel extraction works caused some undermining of at least one of the structures.\nThe striking forms of the sound mirrors have attracted artists and photographers. British artist Tacita Dean created a film inspired by the complex. The band Turin Brakes featured the mirrors on some of their album covers.

By the time of the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement, he was a low-ranking officer. In 1983, when Dr John Garang joined an army mutiny he had been sent to put down, Kiir and other Southern leaders joined the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) in the second civil war. Dr. Garang De Mabior had advanced military knowledge and experience from both the United States and the Sudan. Kiir was his Deputy. Kiir eventually rose to head the SPLA, the SPLM's military wing when Dr. John Garang was killed in a helicopter crash. Rumours to remove Kiir from his post as SPLA Chief of Staff in 2004 nearly caused the organization to split.\n\nFollowing the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement formally ending the war in January 2005, Dr. John Garang was sworn in as the Vice President of the Republic of Sudan. After the death of Dr. John Garang in a helicopter crash on 30 July 2005, Kiir was chosen to succeed to the post of First Vice President of Sudan and President of Southern Sudan. Before independence, Kiir was popular among the military wing of the SPLA/M for his loyalty to the vision of the SPLA/M throughout the liberation struggle and among those who do not trust the successive governments that have come and gone in the Sudan.\n\nComments by Kiir in October 2009 that the forthcoming independence referendum was a choice between being \"a second class in your own country\" or \"a free person in your independent state\" were expected to further strain political tensions. Reports in January 2010 that Kiir would not contest April elections for Sudanese president, but would focus on re-election as president of Southern Sudan were interpreted to mean that the SPLM priority was independence.\n\nKiir was re-elected with 93% of the vote in the 2010 Sudanese election. Although the vote on both the national and sub-national level was criticized by democratic activists and international observers, the overwhelming margin of Kiir's re-election was noted by some media as being \"Step One\" in the process of secession. Following his re-election, Omar al-Bashir reappointed Kiir as the First Vice President of Sudan in accordance with the interim constitution.\n\nSouth Sudanese voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence from Sudan in January 2011, with 98.83% of voters reportedly preferring to split from the North. On 9 July 2011, South Sudan became an independent state, with Kiir as its first president. Kiir positioned himself as a reformer, using his inaugural address to call for the South Sudanese people \"to forgive, though we shall not forget\" perceived injustices at the hands of the northern Sudanese over the preceding decades and announce a general amnesty for South Sudanese groups that had warred against the SPLM in the past. A few weeks later, he publicly addressed members of the military and police to warn them that rape, torture, and other human rights violations carried out by armed personnel would be considered criminal acts and prosecuted aggressively by the Ministry of Justice. His presidency was characterized as a period of reconstruction, albeit one marred by with internal and foreign disputes. Among these were the Heglig Crisis, which caused a border war with Sudan, and an internal political crisis in which attempts were made to overthrow him.\n\nOn 18 June 2013, Kiir issued an order lifting the immunity of two ministers in the national government pending investigations into an alleged corruption case in which they appeared to be implicated. He also issued an order suspending Cabinet Affairs Minister Deng Alor Kuol and Finance Minister Kosti Manibe Ngai from their duties during the entire duration of the probe. In July 2013, Kiir sacked his entire cabinet, including his vice president, Riek Machar, ostensibly to reduce the size of government. However, Machar said that it was a step towards dictatorship and that he would challenge Kiir for the presidency. He also dismissed Taban Deng Gai as Governor of Unity State.\nKiir told Radio Netherlands Worldwide that homosexuality is not in the \"character\" of Southern Sudanese people. \"It is not even something that anybody can talk about here in southern Sudan in particular. It is not there and if anybody wants to import or to export it to Sudan, it will not get the support and it will always be condemned by everybody,\" he said. He then went on the refer to homosexuality as a \"mental disease\" and a \"bastion of Western immorality\" \n\nAfter rumors about a planned coup surfaced in Juba in late 2012, Kiir began reorganizing the senior leadership of his government, party and military on an unprecedented scale. In January 2013, he replaced the inspector general of the national police service with a lieutenant from the army, and dismissed six deputy chiefs of staff and 29 major generals in the army. In February 2013 Kiir retired an additional 117 army generals but this was viewed\nas troublesome in regards to a power grab by others. Kiir had also suggested that his rivals were trying to revive the rifts that had provoked infighting in the 1990s.\n\nMoi Peter Julius, who was a political reporter for a South Sudanese newspaper The Corporate, was found murdered late on the night of August 19, 2015 in a residential area of Juba after being shot twice from behind. His murder was committed three days after Kiir publicly and officially threatened journalists, stating that “freedom of the press does not mean that you work against your country. If anybody does not know that this country will kill people, we will demonstrate on them.” Earlier in 2015, five journalists by the names of Musa Mohamed (the director of the state-run radio station Raja FM), Adam Juma (reporter and presenter for Raja FM), Dalia Marko and Randa George (reporters for Raja FM), and Boutros Martin (a cameraman for the Western Bahr el Ghazal of South Sudan Television) had been murdered while traveling as part of a convoy, along with six other people. Tom Rhodes of the Committee to Protect Journalists stated after the murders that \"The murder of five journalists is a devastating attack on South Sudan's already beleaguered press corps,\" and that \"We urge Western Bahr el Ghazal authorities to do their utmost to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice, and to ensure journalists are allowed to carry out their duties safely.\" At present, none of the parties responsible for ordering the murders or perpetrators of the crimes have been arrested, charged, or convicted.\n\nIn mid-October 2011, Kiir announced South Sudan had applied for accession to the East African Community. He declared the EAC to be \"at the centre of our hearts\" due to its members' support of the South during the Sudanese civil wars.\n\nOn 20 December 2011, Kiir visited Israel to thank it for its support during the First Sudanese Civil War in 1956–1972, and met with Israeli president Shimon Peres to discuss establishing an embassy in Jerusalem, which would make South Sudan the only country to have one in that city.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the South Sudanese civil war, Salva Kiir delivered a speech in January 2014 lashing out at the United Nations and “so-called humanitarian organizations,” accusing them of supporting Riek Machar to try to overthrow him. He accused the UN of sheltering his enemies on their bases adding, “There is a problem with the international community, and it is something that people will have to thrash out with them.”\n\nIn March 2014, Kiir's government organized a rally accusing the United Nations of colluding with anti-government forces. Protesters carried signs accusing the UN of arming anti-government forces.\n\nRelations between Kiir's government and some erstwhile supporters deteriorated since the start of the civil war. He disclosed in an op-ed published in his name in the Washington Times in October 2015 that unnamed \"international partners in peace\" had threatened his government with sanctions, the withdrawal of aid support, and referrals to the International Criminal Court.\n\nOn 26 March 2012, the South Sudanese army attacked the Heglig oilfield, which is known also to the Dinka of the Unity state as Panthou a Dinka word for Heglig in Arabic, located between the border of the Sudanese state of South Kordofan and the South Sudanese state of Unity, triggering the Heglig Crisis. On 27 September, Kiir met Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and signed eight agreements in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which led the way to resume important oil exports and create a demilitarised zone along their border. The agreements allow for the return of of South Sudanese oil to the world market. In addition, the agreements include an understanding of the parameters to follow in regards to demarcating their border, an economic cooperation agreement and a deal to protect each other's citizens. Certain issues remain unsolved and future talks are scheduled to resolve them.\n\nOn 25 November 2012, South Sudan launched a formal complaint to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) against Sudan in the wake of aerial bombings carried out by the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) in parts of South Sudan's northern Bahr el Ghazal state, killing at least eight people and injuring an equal number. South Sudan treated the attack as a gross violation of the cooperation agreement the two country's leaders signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 27 September.\n\nTensions rose between Kiir and his former vice president Riek Machar in December 2013 in the lead-up to a meeting of the National Liberation Council (NLC) of the ruling SPLM party. After two days of NLC meetings, on the night of 15 December 2013 shooting erupted within Salva Kiir's Presidential Guards. The next day, Kiir denounced Machar and other senior SPLM officials for staging a failed coup against his government, a claim later denied by Machar and others. These events marked the start of the South Sudanese Civil War.\n\nIn a politically charged social issue, it has been claimed that Kiir secretly married the daughter of former comrade, the late William Nyuon Bany, an ethic Nuer and former leader of the SPLA. Allegedly, a traditional Dinka ceremony was conducted by his brothers. This led to strife between Kiir's eldest daughter and Aluel William Nyuon Bany. Kiir has not publicly commented on the allegation. According to media reports in Kenya, \"Kiir's in-laws\" have requested privacy.\n\nAccording to a Saudi Arabian diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks in June 2015, the Saudi Arabian embassy in Khartoum had previously alerted the Saudi government of an assassination plot against President Kiir by members of the Egyptian and Sudanese intelligence agencies.\n\nKiir is reported to be the owner or part-owner of ABMC Thai-South Sudan Construction Company Limited. According to a report by Radio Tamazuj, however, Kiir's shares are not held directly but may be concealed in the name of a close associate. Ties between Kiir and the company were denied by Kiir's spokesman Ateny Wek. The company was awarded at least $161 million in government roads contracts. The president's wife previously held shares in Yanyyom Mineral Water and Beverage Factory located in Juba. The factory took its name from Lake Yanyyom, located near the president's hometown Akon in Warrap State. Another owner of the factory was Garang Deng Aguer, a business magnate and former Governor of Northern Bahr al Ghazal State.\n\nIn 2006, when visiting the White House, Kiir received a black stetson as a gift from the then-U.S. President George W. Bush. He reportedly liked it so much that he purchased several. He now seldom makes public appearances without his hat.\n\n"}

{"id": "1178286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1178286", "title": "Socialist feminism", "text": "Socialist feminism\n\nSocialist feminism rose in the 1960s and 1970s as an offshoot of the feminist movement and New Left that focuses upon the interconnectivity of the patriarchy and capitalism. Socialist feminists argue that liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Socialist feminism is a two-pronged theory that broadens Marxist feminism's argument for the role of capitalism in the oppression of women and radical feminism's theory of the role of gender and the patriarchy. Socialist feminists reject radical feminism's main claim that patriarchy is the only or primary source of oppression of women. Rather, socialist feminists assert that women are unable to be free due to their financial dependence on males. Women are subjects to the male rulers in capitalism due to an uneven balance in wealth. They see economic dependence as the driving force of women's subjugation to men. Further, socialist feminists see women's liberation as a necessary part of larger quest for social, economic and political justice. Socialist feminists attempted to integrate the fight for women's liberation with the struggle against other oppressive systems based on race, class or economic status.\nSocialist feminism draws upon many concepts found in Marxism; such as a historical materialist point of view, which means that they relate their ideas to the material and historical conditions of people's lives. Socialist feminists thus consider how the sexism and gendered division of labor of each historical era is determined by the economic system of the time. Those conditions are largely expressed through capitalist and patriarchal relations. Socialist feminists, thus reject the Marxist notion that class and class struggle are the only defining aspects of history and economic development. \nMarx asserted that when class oppression was overcome, gender oppression would vanish as well. According to socialist feminists, this view of gender oppression as a sub-class of class oppression is naive and much of the work of socialist feminists has gone towards specifying how gender and class work together to create distinct forms of oppression and privilege for women and men of each class. For example, they observe that women's class status is generally derivative of her husband's class or occupational status, e.g., a secretary that marries her boss assumes his class status.\n\nIn 1972, \"Socialist Feminism: A Strategy for the Women's Movement\", which is believed to be the first publication to use the term \"socialist feminism\", was published; it was by the Hyde Park Chapter of the Chicago Women's Liberation Union (Heather Booth, Day Creamer, Susan Davis, Deb Dobbin, Robin Kaufman, and Tobey Klass).\n\nOther socialist feminists, notably two long-lived American organizations Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party, point to the classic Marxist writings of Frederick Engels (\"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\") and August Bebel (\"Woman and Socialism\") as a powerful explanation of the link between gender oppression and class exploitation.\n\nIn the decades following the Cold War, feminist writer and scholar Sarah Evans says that the socialist feminist movement has lost traction in the West due to a common narrative that associates socialism with totalitarianism and dogma. \n\nAnarcha-feminism (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism. It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralized free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. L. Susan Brown claims that \"as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist\". Bakunin opposed patriarchy and the way the law \"subjects [women] to the absolute domination of the man\". He argued that \"[e]qual rights must belong to men and women\" so that women can \"become independent and be free to forge their own way of life\". Bakunin foresaw the end of \"the authoritarian juridical family\" and \"the full sexual freedom of women\".\n\nAnarcha-feminism began with late 19th and early 20th century authors and theorists such as anarchist feminists Emma Goldman, Voltairine de Cleyre and Lucy Parsons. In the Spanish Civil War, an anarcha-feminist group, (\"Free Women\") linked to the , organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas, while the prominent Spanish anarchist and feminist leader Federica Montseny held that the \"emancipation of women would lead to a quicker realization of the social revolution\" and that \"the revolution against sexism would have to come from intellectual and militant 'future-women.' According to this Nietzschean concept of Federica Montseny's, women could realize through art and literature the need to revise their own roles.\"\n\nIn Argentina Virginia Bolten is responsible for the publication of a newspaper called \"\" (), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901. A similar paper with the same name was reportedly published later in Montevideo, which suggests that Bolten may also have founded and edited it after her deportation. \"La Voz de la Mujer described itself as \"dedicated to the advancement of Communist Anarchism\". Its central theme was that of the multiple nature of women's oppression. An editorial asserted, \"We believe that in present-day society nothing and nobody has a more wretched situation than unfortunate women.\" Women, they said, were doubly oppressed—by bourgeois society and by men. Its feminism can be seen from its attack on marriage and upon male power over women. Its contributors, like anarchist feminists elsewhere, developed a concept of oppression that focused on gender oppression. Marriage was a bourgeois institution which restricted women's freedom, including their sexual freedom. Marriages entered into without love, fidelity maintained through fear rather than desire, oppression of women by men they hated—all were seen as symptomatic of the coercion implied by the marriage contract. It was this alienation of the individual's will that the anarchist feminists deplored and sought to remedy, initially through free love and then, and more thoroughly, through social revolution.\"\n\nIn the past decades two films have been produced about anarcha-feminism. \"Libertarias\" is a historical drama made in 1996 about the Spanish anarcha-feminist organization Mujeres Libres. In 2010 the Argentinian film \"Ni dios, ni patrón, ni marido\" was released which is centered on the story of anarcha-feminist Virginia Bolten and her publishing of the newspaper \"La Voz de la Mujer\" (English: The Woman's Voice).\n\nMarxist feminism is a sub-type of feminist theory which focuses on the social institutions of private property and capitalism to explain and criticize gender inequality and oppression. According to Marxist feminists, private property gives rise to economic inequality, dependence, political and domestic struggle between the sexes, and is the root of women's oppression in the current social context.\n\nMarxist feminism's foundation is laid by Friedrich Engels in his analysis of gender oppression in \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State\" (1884). He argues that a woman's subordination is not a result of her biological disposition but of social relations, and that men's efforts to achieve their demands for control of women's labor and sexual faculties have gradually solidified and become institutionalized in the nuclear family. Through a Marxist historical perspective, Engels analyzes the widespread social phenomena associated with female sexual morality, such as fixation on virginity and sexual purity, incrimination and violent punishment of women who commit adultery, and demands that women be submissive to their husbands. Ultimately, Engels traces these phenomena to the recent development of exclusive control of private property by the patriarchs of the rising slaveowner class in the ancient mode of production, and the attendant desire to ensure that their inheritance is passed only to their own offspring: chastity and fidelity are rewarded, says Engels, because they guarantee exclusive access to the sexual and reproductive faculty of women possessed by men from the property-owning class.\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, both Clara Zetkin and Eleanor Marx were against the demonization of men and supported a proletariat revolution that would overcome as many male–female inequalities as possible. As their movement already had the most radical demands in women's equality, most Marxist leaders, including Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai, counterposed Marxism against bourgeois feminism, rather than trying to combine them.\n\nOrthodox Marxists argue that most Marxist forerunners claimed by feminists or \"Marxist feminists\" including Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai were against capitalist forms of feminism. They agreed with the main Marxist movement that feminism was a bourgeois ideology counterposed to Marxism and against the working class. Instead of feminism, the Marxists supported the more radical political program of liberating women through socialist revolution, with a special emphasis on work among women and in materially changing their conditions after the revolution. Orthodox Marxists view the later attempt to combine Marxism and feminism as a liberal creation of academics and reformist leftists who want to make alliances with bourgeois feminists. \n\nFor what reason, then, should the woman worker seek a union with the bourgeois feminists? Who, in actual fact, would stand to gain in the event of such an alliance? Certainly not the woman worker. —Alexandra Kollontai, 1909\nA pioneering Marxist and feminist, Mary Inman of the Communist Party USA challenged the party's orthodox position by arguing that the home is a center of production and housewives carry out productive labor. Her writings include \"In Woman's Defense\" (1940) and \"Woman-Power\" (1942). Inman's work was at first warmly received by several top Communist women leaders, including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Ella Reeve Bloor, but the CPUSA leadership began an official attack on Inman's work for purported ideological deviation in 1941. A series of articles written against Inman's ideas appeared in the party's literary monthly, \"The New Masses,\" and the polemic was extended with the publication of a pamphlet by A. Landy, \"Marxism and the Woman Question.\"\n\nRadical Women, a major Marxist-feminist organization, bases its theory on Marx' and Engels' analysis that the enslavement of women was the first building block of an economic system based on private property. They contend that elimination of the capitalist profit-driven economy will remove the motivation for sexism, racism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression.\n\n\"Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism\" was a collection of essays assembled and anthologized by Zillah R. Eisenstein in 1978.\nSociologist and academic Rhonda F. Levine cites Eisenstein's work as a \"superb discussion of the socialist-feminist position\" in her anthology \"Enriching the Sociological Imagination: How Radical Sociology Changed the Discipline\". Levine goes on to describe the book as \"one of the earliest statements of how a Marxist class analysis can combine with a feminist analysis of patriarchy to produce a theory of how gender and class intersect as systems of inequality\".\n\n\"Eisenstein defines the term 'capitalist patriarchy' as descriptive of the 'mutually reinforcing dialectical relationship between capitalist class structure and hierarchical sexual structuring.\"\n\nShe believes that \"The recognition of women as a sexual class lays the subversive quality of feminism for liberalism because liberalism is premised upon women's exclusion from public life on this very class basis. The demand for real equality of women with men, if taken to its logical conclusion, would dislodge the patriarchal structure necessary to a liberal society.\"\n\nIn 1985, Donna Haraway published the essay \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\" in \"Socialist Review\". Although most of Haraway's earlier work was focused on emphasizing the masculine bias in scientific culture, she has also contributed greatly to feminist narratives of the twentieth century. For Haraway, the Manifesto came at a critical juncture at which feminists, in order to have any real-world significance, had to acknowledge their situatedness within what she terms the \"informatics of domination\". Feminists must, she proclaims, unite behind \"an ironic dream of a common language for women in the integrated circuit\". Women were no longer on the outside along a hierarchy of privileged binaries but rather deeply imbued, exploited by and complicit within networked hegemony, and had to form their politics as such.\n\nAccording to Haraway's \"Manifesto\", \"there is nothing about being female that naturally binds women together into a unified category. There is not even such a state as 'being' female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices\" (p. 155). A cyborg does not require a stable, essentialist identity, argues Haraway, and feminists should consider creating coalitions based on \"affinity\" instead of identity. To ground her argument, Haraway analyzes the phrase \"women of color\", suggesting it as one possible example of affinity politics. Using a term coined by theorist Chela Sandoval, Haraway writes that \"oppositional consciousness\" is comparable with a cyborg politics, because rather than identity it stresses how affinity comes as a result of \"otherness, difference, and specificity\" (p. 156).\n\nLeopoldina Fortunati is the author of \"The Arcane of Reproduction: Housework, Prostitution, Labor and Capital\" (\"L'arcano della riproduzione: Casalinghe, prostitute, operai e capitale\"), a feminist critique of Marx. Fortunati is the author of several books, including \"The Arcane of Reproduction\" (Autonomedia, 1995) and \"I mostri nell'immaginario\" (Angeli, 1995), and is the editor of \"Gli Italiani al telefono\" (Angeli, 1995) and \"Telecomunicando in Europa\" (1998), and with J. Katz and R. Riccini \"Mediating the Human Body. Technology, Communication and Fashion\" (2003). Her influences include Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Antonio Negri, and Karl Marx.\n\nSilvia Federici is an Italian scholar, teacher, and activist from the radical autonomist feminist Marxist tradition. Federici's best known work, \"Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body and Primitive Accumulation\", expands on the work of Leopoldina Fortunati. In it, she argues against Karl Marx's claim that primitive accumulation is a necessary precursor for capitalism. Instead, she posits that primitive accumulation is a fundamental characteristic of capitalism itself—that capitalism, in order to perpetuate itself, requires a constant infusion of expropriated capital.\n\nFederici connects this expropriation to women's unpaid labour, both connected to reproduction and otherwise, which she frames as a historical precondition to the rise of a capitalist economy predicated upon wage labor. Related to this, she outlines the historical struggle for the commons and the struggle for communalism. Instead of seeing capitalism as a liberatory defeat of feudalism, Federici interprets the ascent of capitalism as a reactionary move to subvert the rising tide of communalism and to retain the basic social contract.\n\nShe situates the institutionalization of rape and prostitution, as well as the heretic and witch-hunt trials, burnings, and torture at the center of a methodical subjugation of women and appropriation of their labor. This is tied into colonial expropriation and provides a framework for understanding the work of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and other proxy institutions as engaging in a renewed cycle of primitive accumulation, by which everything held in common—from water, to seeds, to our genetic code—becomes privatized in what amounts to a new round of enclosures.\n\nMaterial feminism highlights capitalism and patriarchy as central in understanding women's oppression. The theory centers on social change rather than seeking transformation within the capitalist system. Jennifer Wicke, defines Materialist Feminism as \"a feminism that insists on examining the material conditions under which social arrangements, including those of gender hierarchy, develop... materialist feminism avoids seeing this gender hierarchy as the effect of a singular... patriarchy and instead gauges the web of social and psychic relations that make up a material, historical moment\". She states that \"...materialist feminism argues that material conditions of all sorts play a vital role in the social production of gender and assays the different ways in which women collaborate and participate in these productions\". Material feminism also considers how women and men of various races and ethnicities are kept in their lower economic status due to an imbalance of power that privileges those who already have privilege, thereby protecting the status quo.\n\nThe term Material feminism was first used in 1975 by Christine Delphy. The current concept has its roots in socialist and Marxist feminism; Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham, editors of \"Materialist Feminism: A Reader in Class, Difference, and Women's Lives\", describe material feminism as the \"conjuncture of several discourses—historical materialism, Marxist and radical feminism, as well as postmodernist and psychoanalytic theories of meaning and subjectivity\". he term materialist feminism emerged in the late 1970s and is associated with key thinkers, such as Rosemary Hennessy, Stevi Jackson and Christine Delphy. Rosemary Hennessy traces the history of Materialist Feminism in the work of British and French feminists who preferred the term materialist feminism to Marxist feminism. In their view, Marxism had to be altered to be able to explain the sexual division of labor. Marxism was inadequate to the task because of its class bias and focus on production. Feminism was also problematic due to its essentialist and idealist concept of woman. Material Feminism then emerged as a positive substitute to both Marxism and feminism. Material Feminism partly originated from the work of French feminists, particularly Christine Delphy. She argued that materialism is the only theory of history that views oppression as a basic reality of women's lives. Christine Delphy states that this is why women and all oppressed groups need materialism to investigate their situation. For Christine Delphy \"to start from oppression defines a materialist approach, oppression is a materialist concept.\" She states that the domestic mode of production was the site of patriarchal exploitation and the material basis of the oppression of women. Christine Delphy further argued that marriage is a labor contract that gives men the right to exploit women. \"The Grand Domestic Revolution\" by Dolores Hayden is a reference. Hayden describes Material feminism at that time as reconceptualizing the relationship between the private household space and public space by presenting collective options to take the \"burden\" off women in regard to housework, cooking, and other traditional female domestic jobs.\n\nSocialist feminists believe that women's liberation must be sought in conjunction with the social and economic justice of all people. They see the fight to end male supremacy as key to social justice, but not the only issue, rather one of many forms of oppression that are mutually reinforcing.\n\nThe Chicago Women's Liberation Union, known colloquially as CWLU, was formed in 1969 after a founding conference in Palatine, Illinois. Naomi Weisstein, Vivian Rothstein, Heather Booth, and Ruth Surgal were among the founders of it. The main goal of the organization was to end gender inequality and sexism, which the CWLU defined as \"the systematic keeping down of women for the benefit of people in power\". The purpose statement of the organization expressed that \"Changing women's position in society isn't going to be easy. It's going to require changes in expectations, jobs, child care, and education. It's going to change the distribution of power over the rest of us to all people sharing power and sharing in the decisions that affect our lives.\" The CWLU spent almost a decade organizing to challenge both sexism and class oppression. The group is best known for the 1972 pamphlet \"Socialist Feminism: A Strategy for the Women's Movement\". Nationally circulated, the publication is believed to be the first to use the term socialist feminism.\n\nThe CWLU was organized as an umbrella organization to unite a wide range of work groups and discussion groups. A representative from each work group went to monthly meetings of the Steering Committee to reach consensus on organizational policy and strategy. They addressed a myriad of issues including women's health, reproductive rights, education, economic rights, visual arts and music, sports, lesbian liberation, and much more.\n\nWomen's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.) was the name of many related but independent feminist groups formed in the United States during 1968 and 1969 and who were important in the development of socialist feminism. The name W.I.T.C.H. was also sometimes expanded as \"Women Inspired to Tell their Collective History\", \"Women Interested in Toppling Consumer Holidays\", and many other variations.\n\nThere was no centralized organization; each W.I.T.C.H. group was formed independently by women inspired by the ideas and example of previous actions. Their activism mainly took the form of \"zaps\", a form of guerrilla theater mixing street theatre and protest, where they used attention-catching and humorous public actions to highlight political and economic complaints against companies and government agencies, frequently involving the use of witch costumes and the chanting of hexes. Witches often appeared as stock characters in feminist Left theatre, representing the misogynist crone stereotype.\n\nOn Halloween 1968, women from W.I.T.C.H. staged a \"hex\" of Wall Street at a branch of Chase Manhattan Bank, wearing rags and fright makeup; Robin Morgan stated that the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined sharply the next day. The DJIA did not decline sharply, and experienced a rise over the next several days and weeks. In December 1968 W.I.T.C.H targeted both the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Chicago Eight, saying that they conspired to treat only men as \"leaders\" of the antiwar movement. In 1969, W.I.T.C.H. held a protest at a \"Bridal Fair\" at Madison Square Garden. Members wore black veils. They handed out pamphlets titled \"Confront the Whoremakers\", chanted \"Here come the slaves/Off to their graves\", and had a mock \"unwedding\" ceremony. The protests also involved turning loose several white mice at the event, which Fair attendees began scooping up off the ground. The event resulted in negative media coverage for W.I.T.C.H., and some dissention among members over goals and tactics. In February 1970, the Washington coven (W.I.T.C.H. chapters were called \"covens\") held a protest during a Senate hearing on population control. They interrupted Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough's testimony by chanting and throwing pills at panel members and people in the audience galleries. Spin-off \"covens\" were founded in Chicago, Illinois and Washington, D.C., and W.I.T.C.H. zaps continued until roughly the beginning of 1970. The \"zap\" protests used by W.I.T.C.H. may have helped inspire the zap action protest tactics adopted shortly afterwards by LGBT activists, and still in use.\n\nBig Flame was \"a revolutionary socialist feminist organisation with a working-class orientation\" in the United Kingdom. Founded in Liverpool in 1970, the group initially grew rapidly, with branches appearing in some other cities. Its publications emphasised that \"a revolutionary party is necessary but Big Flame is not that party, nor is it the embryo of that party\". The group was influenced by the Italian Lotta Continua group.\n\nThe group published a magazine, \"Big Flame\", and a journal, \"Revolutionary Socialism\". Members were active at the Ford plants at Halewood and Dagenham. and devoted a great deal of time to self-analysis and considering their relationship with the larger Trotskyist groups. In time, they came to describe their politics as \"libertarian Marxist\". In 1978 they joined the Socialist Unity electoral coalition, led by the Trotskyist International Marxist Group. In 1980, the anarchists of the Libertarian Communist Group joined Big Flame. The Revolutionary Marxist Current also joined at about this time. However, as more members of the group defected to the Labour Party, the journal ceased to appear in 1982, and the group was wound up in about 1984. Ex-members of the group were involved in the launch of the mass-market tabloid newspaper the \"News on Sunday\" in 1987, which folded the same year. The name of the group was taken from a television play, \"The Big Flame\" (1969), written by Jim Allen and directed by Ken Loach for the BBC's \"Wednesday Play\" season. It dealt with a fictional strike and work-in at the Liverpool Docks.\n\nFeminist historian Linda Gordon asserts that socialist feminism is inherently intersectional, at least to a certain degree, because it takes into account both gender and class. Gordon says that because the foundation of socialist feminism rests on multiple axes, socialist feminism has a history of intersectionality that can be traced back to a period decades before Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw first articulated the concept of intersectionality in 1989. According to Gordon, socialist feminism of the 1980’s expanded upon the concept of intersectionality by examining the overlapping structures that instantiate oppression. Feminist scholar and women’s studies professor Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy says that this broader analysis of societal structures began with socialist feminism and served as a catalyst for feminist scholarship. Kennedy says that many of the first women’s studies programs were established by socialist feminist theorists.\n\nDespite the supposed presence of intersectionality in socialist feminism, many feminists, particularly women of color, critique the movement for perceived deficiencies in regards to racial equity. In Kennedy’s account of socialist feminism’s impact on women’s studies, she says that a lack of Black voices in feminist academia contributed to whitewashing of women’s studies programs and courses. Kum-Kum Bhavani, a professor at University of California Santa Barbara, and Margaret Coulson, a socialist feminist scholar, assert that racism in the socialist feminist movement stems from the failure of many white feminists to recognize the institutional nature of racism. According to Bhavani and Coulson, race, class, and gender are inextricably linked, and the exclusion of any one of these factors from one’s worldview would result in an incomplete understanding of the systems of privilege and oppression they say constitute our society. Kathryn Harriss, a feminist scholar from the United Kingdom, describes what she sees as the shortcomings of the socialist feminist movement of the 1980s in the United Kingdom. Harriss describes marginalized women’s grievances with the Women’s Liberation Movement, a large socialist feminist group. She says many lesbian women criticized the movement for its domination by heterosexual feminists who perpetuated heterosexism in the movement. Similarly, Black women asserted that they were deprived a voice due to the overwhelming majority of white women in the WLM advocating widely held views regarding violence against women, the family, and reproductive rights that failed to account for the distinct struggles faced by women of color. \n\nSocialist feminists highlight how motherhood and the gendered division of labor many assert grows \"naturally\" from women's role as mothers is the source of women's exclusion from the public sphere and creates women's economic dependence on men. They assert that there is nothing natural about the gendered division of labor and show that the expectation that women perform all or most reproductive labor, i.e., labor associated with birthing and raising children but also the cleaning, cooking, and other tasks necessary to support human life, deny women the capacity to participate fully in economic activity outside the home. \nIn order to free themselves from the conditions of work as a mother and housekeeper, socialist feminists such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman saw the professionalization of housework as key. This would be done by hiring professional nannies and housekeepers to take the load of domestic work away from the woman in the house.\nPerkins Gilman also recommended the redesign of homes in ways that would maximize their potential for creativity and leisure for women as well as men, i.e., emphasizing the need for rooms like studios and studies and eliminating kitchens and dining rooms. These changes would necessitate the communalization of meal preparation and consumption outside the home and free women from their burden of providing meals on a house-by-house scale.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This act demonstrates the special connection that exists between Socialist states.\n\nThe \"socialist fraternal kiss\" consisted of an embrace, combined with a series of three kisses on alternate cheeks. In rare cases, when the two leaders considered themselves exceptionally close, the kisses were given on the mouth rather than on the cheeks.\n\nThe \"socialist fraternal embrace\" consists of a series of three deep hugs, alternating between the left and right sides of the body, without kissing. This modified greeting was adopted by Communist leaders in Asia, which lacks a tradition of cheek kissing as greeting. During the Cold War, Communist leaders in Asia consented to receive kisses from Europeans and Cubans, but they themselves omitted the kiss.\n\nSince the end of Communism in eastern Europe, the socialist fraternal kiss has died out. However, the socialist fraternal embrace continues to be exchanged between Communist leaders in Asia. In addition, Cuba has also adopted the Asian form of the ritual.\n\nThis ritual originated in the European practice of cheek kissing as a greeting between family members or close friends. It has also been associated with the Eastern Orthodox Fraternal- or Easter Kiss, which through its entrenchment in the rites of the Orthodox Church carried a substantial strength of expression and so found use in daily life.\n\nAs a symbol of equality, fraternity and solidarity, the socialist fraternal kiss was the expression of the pathos and enthusiasm of the emergent Workers' movement between the middle and end of the 19th century. In the years after the October Revolution and the subsequent Communist International, a ritualisation of the so far spontaneous gesture succeeded into an official greeting between Communist comrades. The symbolic reinforcement of the feeling of camaraderie also gained success through the fact that many Communists and Socialists had to make long, arduous and dangerous trips to then the isolated Bolshevik Russia. That way the much-experienced international Solidarity found expression in stormy embraces and kisses.\n\nWith the expansion of Communism after World War II, the Soviet Union was no longer isolated as the only Communist country. The fraternal socialist kiss became a ritualised greeting among the leaders of Communist countries. The greeting was also adopted by socialist leaders in the Third World, as well as the leaders of socialist-aligned liberation movements such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the African National Congress.\n\nSome Kremlinologists studying the USSR paid close attention to whether the fraternal embrace was exchanged between Communist leaders. The omission of the customary embrace is taken to indicate a lower level of relations between the two countries.\n\nFor example, after the Sino-Soviet split, the Chinese refused to embrace their Soviet counterparts or to address them as \"comrade.\" Even with the normalization of relations in 1989, the Chinese continued to omit the fraternal embrace when greeting Soviet leaders, even as they exchanged the fraternal embrace with leaders from other Communist countries. This was done to emphasize that Sino-Soviet relations were not returning to the level that they were in the 1950s, prior to the split; Chinese protocol specifically insisted on \"handshake, no embrace.\"\n\nBecause of its symbolic significance, Communist leaders will often exchange the fraternal embrace even if serious disagreements exist, to avoid giving the public impression that relations are strained. For example, although China and Vietnam dispute the ownership of the Spratly Islands, Chinese and Vietnamese leaders continue to exchange the socialist fraternal embrace.\n\nThe socialist fraternal kiss should not be confused with ordinary cheek kissing between world leaders. For example, it is traditional for the President of France to greet world leaders by kissing them on both cheeks. This is not a socialist fraternal kiss because there are only two kisses, and it carries no ideological meaning. It is practiced by Gaullist presidents as well as Socialist presidents.\n\nThe fraternal kiss became famous via Erich Honecker and Leonid Brezhnev, who were photographed exercising the ritual. The photograph became widespread and it was subsequently transformed into a graffiti painting on the Berlin Wall named \"My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love.\"\n"}

Phraya Songsuradet (Thai: พระยาทรงสุรเดช) actually did not instigate the rebellion or coup in any way yet it was named after him. The coup was in truth carried out by Luang Phibulsonggram (Thai: หลวงพิบูลสงคราม) or \"Phibul\" on 29 January 1939 to purge the country of his political enemies and former rivals (one of whom happened to be Songsuradet).\n\nBorn in 1892 as Thep Panthumasen (Thai: เทพ พันธุมเสน), Songsuradet was commissioned in the Royal Thai Army as an artillery lieutenant after graduating from the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy and furthering his studies in Germany where he studied at the engineer school. He returned to Thailand in 1915. From then on he was given many responsibilities, especially in the construction of railways. In 1932 he was given the title of Phraya Songsuradet by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII). He played a crucial role in the Revolution of 1932 and subsequently became an important member of the new Thai constitutional government.\n\nThe roots of the rebellion began during the coup d'état of June 1933, when Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena ousted Phraya Manopakorn Nititada and replaced him as prime minister. Phraya Songsuradet a supporter of Phraya Mano, and many of his companions were barred from politics for life by the new premier. Songsuradet was exiled to Sri Lanka for two years. \n\nDuring, before, and after the coup, conflicts arose between Songsuradet and Phibulsonggram, who were both ministers of state and members of the People’s Committee.\n\nWhen Luang Phibulsonggram succeeded Phraya Phahon as Prime Minister of Thailand on 11 September 1938, there was much resistance to his premiership due to his dictatorial style and cronyism. This, coupled with his role in suppressing the Boworadet Rebellion, resulted in three assassination attempts, two by gunmen and one by poisoning.\n\nIn 1938, Songsuradet, by then having retired from politics for five years (but not yet from the army) was commander of the military school in Chiang Mai. On 16 December he was commanding a military exercise by his students in Ratchaburi Province, west of the capital. On that date he received orders from Bangkok stripping him of his command of all units as well as his rank and titles and forcing him to retire from the army without pension. He was also expelled from the country. Fearing death, Songsuradet complied, and with his aide-de-camp, Captain Samruad Kanjonsit (Thai: ร้อยเอกสำรวจ กาญจนสิทธิ์), he escaped to Cambodia.\n\nThe \"rebellion\", however, did not end there. In the early hours of 29 January 1939 Phibul, with the help of his minister of the interior and director of the Royal Thai Police, ordered the arrest of a further 51 suspects (suspected of being Songsuradet sympathizers). The persons arrested included \"inter alia\" Prince Rangsit, Prince of Chainat (Thai: พระองค์เจ้ารังสิตประยูรศักดิ์) (a son of King Chulalongkorn), General Phraya Thepahatsadin (Thai: พระยาเทพหัสดิน) (a 62-year-old former commander of the Siamese Expeditionary Force during the First World War), and Phraya Udom Pongphensawad (Thai: พระยาอุดมพงศ์เพ็ญสวัสดิ์ ), a former minister of state. Others arrested included politicians such as members of the People's Assembly and many were military officers and aristocrats. A further 20 suspects were arrested by the end of the day, including one of Phibul's servants. \n\nA special tribunal was created by Phibul to try those purportedly involved in the so-called \"rebellion\" and the assassination attempts on Phibul. Seven were released for lack of evidence, 25 were imprisoned for life, and 21 were to be executed by firing squad. However, three were pardoned due to their honorable records and services to the nation. The three included Prince Rangsit and Phraya Thepahatsadin, who were instead imprisoned for life. The other 18, however did not share that fate. They were incarcerated at Bang Kwang Central Prison. Eventually they were executed by firing squad in installments of four prisoners a day.\n\nSongsuradet, having escaped to Cambodia, lived the rest of his life in abject poverty, making a living by selling confectionery in the streets of Phnom Penh. He died in 1944. Many of the other suspects who were imprisoned by Phibul were eventually pardoned by Khuang Abhaiwongse when he became prime minister in 1944.\n\nThe rebellion was in effect Phibul's own version of the Night of the Long Knives. By 1938 he had consolidated his power to such an extent that he had become virtual dictator of the country, changing the name of the country from \"Siam\" to \"Thailand\" in June 1938. He was able to accomplish this using brutal tactics and the absence of any credible opposition. Prajadhipok had by then been succeeded to the throne by Ananda Mahidol, who was only 13 years old and studying in Switzerland. The tribunal which Phibul had set up to try the suspects was packed with judges appointed by he and his government. There were no lawyers present and no witnesses were called. Historians agree today that the men executed were mostly innocent and were not a part of real plot to kill Phibul or overthrow his government. Phibul was eventually removed in 1944. Four years later he returned as prime minister from 1948–1957. He died in 1964.\n\n\n"}

A diplomat for the government of the United Kingdom, Coltman had been appointed to the position of British ambassador to Cuba from 1991 through to 1994, during which time he got to know Castro personally. He died shortly before his biography's publication.\n\nThe biography looks at Castro's life from its beginning up until the start of the 21st century, when Castro was in his final years of the presidency, a position that he would relinquish in 2008. The book is accompanied by anecdotes about Castro and his relationship with other politicians, supplied by Coltman from his years in the diplomatic service.\n\n\"The Real Fidel Castro\" was reviewed in the mainstream press in both the United Kingdom and United States.\n\nIn a review published in the British magazine \"New Statesman\", the journalist and historian Richard Gott noted that Coltman \"has a good eye for detail and the telling anecdote\" but at the same time, Gott felt that he \"devotes rather too much space to Castro's early life, galloping though the 1990s about which his personal experience and insights might have been better deployed at greater length.\" Believing that the \"stock-in-trade\" of diplomats like Coltman was gossip, Gott felt that Coltman's work \"repeats more stories about the love-lives of senior revolutionaries than I found interesting\". Gott went on to compare Coltman's biography with one published around the same time, written by the German reporter Volker Skierka; he notes that \"For the first time, we now have two full-length studies of the Cuban leader that reflect a European view. It makes a salutary change, and both diplomat and reporter have original things to say. Coltman's book is more measured, Skierka's more timely, yet neither strays far outside their specialist expertise.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "13938316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13938316", "title": "Upward Spiral", "text": "Upward Spiral\n\nUpward Spiral is a term used by Paul Kennedy in his book \"The Rise and Fall of Great Powers\" to describe the continually rising cost of military equipment relative to civilian manufactured goods. According to Kennedy there is an upward spiral at work in \"all areas\" of military production which is \"becoming increasingly divergent from the commercial\". The desire for state-of-the-art weaponry is meant to be pushing up the cost.\n\nWriting in the late 1980s he said it was reasonable to assume that the next few decades would witness \"the spiralling cost of the arms race, which is fuelled by the sheer expensiveness of newer weapons systems as well as by international rivalries.\" Quoting the comment of Peter Mathias that \"One of the few constancies in history... is that the scale of commitment on military spending has always risen\" Kennedy argues that this has become more important with time. According to Kennedy, \"if that was true for the wars and arms races of the eighteenth century, when weapons technology changed only slowly, it is much truer of the present century [20th], when each new generation of aircraft, warships and tanks is vastly more expensive than preceding ones, even when allowance is made for inflation.\" Kennedy uses several examples. While a pre-1914 battleship cost the British admiralty 2.5 million pounds ( Taking inflation into account this would be approximately 56 million pounds in 1980 terms), by the 1980s 120 million pounds was needed to buy a replacement frigate. Another is that of the American B-2 Spirit Stealth bomber whose cost rose into the 1990s.\n\nVarious possible reasons exist why military technology continues to rise in price. As military technologies are seldom if ever shared, each generation of technology requires each nation or group of nations to undertake long-term research programs independent of each other with no concrete knowledge of the weapons systems they will be expected to compete against, but with the knowledge that completing a project before competing nations will provide a considerable advantage, while falling behind could be disastrous. These factors combine to encourage very extensive research spending, even if results are never delivered. \n\nSecondly, military technologies are expected to have a long service life and to remain technologically competitive over the course of a decade or more. To achieve 'cutting-edge' technology at time of delivery (and thus technology that will still be relevant in some years time), the advances used are rarely mature technologies; this necessitates the use of custom-machined parts instead of off-the-shelf solutions. Within a few years, formerly cutting-edge solutions mature to become readily available at greatly reduced cost, but by this stage a system has already been delivered, and the next iteration of a system seeks to be more advanced than the currently available off-the-shelf systems. \n\nThirdly, there are numerous technologies that are extremely expensive to develop and deploy, but once they are deployed by all nations, the relative value of the technology is significantly lowered. Advancements are extremely valuable when only one nation or power block possesses them, but once all nations have access to similar technologies, there is a requirement to deploy weapons that can defeat the original advance. This leaves the parties in much the same position as they were initially, while the cost of the platform will nevertheless have increased. This forms a cyclical arms race where unit prices continue to increase but the balance of power remains the same. Reactive tank armor resulted in a number of different advanced anti-tank munition (top attack, tandem charge, deplete uranium penetrators) with the end result that all new tanks are required to have both advanced armor and advanced munitions, but relative to each other are no more powerful.\n\nFinally, many advancements increase the cost of a system but reduce the risk to platform and human lives. This increases costs in monetary terms, but provides very significant value that is not seen by observers. Technologies like stealth aircraft have been extremely expensive to develop and they only deploy the same munitions as conventional aircraft, which to observers can imply that the system cost is wasted. However, as they allow for missions to be successfully flown with far reduced risk to the aircraft, the net result can be better overall value even at higher cost.\n\n\n"}
