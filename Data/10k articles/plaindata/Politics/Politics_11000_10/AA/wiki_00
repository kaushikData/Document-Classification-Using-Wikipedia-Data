The Austro-Hungarian government had discredited the Croat-Serb Coalition and created an internal discussion accusing Serbs of massive conspiracy. The Pure Party of Rights, led by Josip Frank, participated in attacks on the accused Serbs (most supporters of the Serb Independent Party) and also the Croat-Serb Coalition, with government directives. Arrests were made during the Bosnian crisis, made to justify the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some of the accused were held under bad circumstances, until the trial began in March 1909. The trial caused sensation across Europe, and was viewed as a blatant attempt to crush Serb minority politics in Croatia-Slavonia. Austria-Hungary pursued Trialism, which clashed with the popular Yugoslavism. Minister János Forgách forged documents against the accused Serbs. 31 were convicted and given 184 years in October 1909. The obvious bias and unreliable evidence led to the defendants' later release after appeal.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32718", "title": "Condorcet paradox", "text": "Condorcet paradox\n\nThe Condorcet paradox (also known as voting paradox or the paradox of voting) in social choice theory is a situation noted by the Marquis de Condorcet in the late 18th century, in which collective preferences can be cyclic, even if the preferences of individual voters are not cyclic. This is paradoxical, because it means that majority wishes can be in conflict with each other: Majorities prefer, for example, candidate A over B, B over C, and yet C over A. When this occurs, it is because the conflicting majorities are each made up of different groups of individuals.\n\nThus an expectation that transitivity on the part of all individuals' preferences should result in transitivity of societal preferences is an example of a fallacy of composition.\n\nSuppose we have three candidates, A, B, and C, and that there are three voters with preferences as follows (candidates being listed left-to-right for each voter in decreasing order of preference):\n\nIf C is chosen as the winner, it can be argued that B should win instead, since two voters (1 and 2) prefer B to C and only one voter (3) prefers C to B. However, by the same argument A is preferred to B, and C is preferred to A, by a margin of two to one on each occasion. Thus the society's preferences show cycling: A is preferred over B which is preferred over C which is preferred over A. A paradoxical feature of relations between the voters' preferences described above is that although the majority of voters agree that A is preferable to B, B to C, and C to A, all three coefficients of rank correlation between the preferences of any two voters are negative (namely, –.5), as calculated with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient formula designed by Charles Spearman much later.\n\nNote that in the graphical example, the voters and candidates are not symmetrical, but the ranked voting system \"flattens\" their preferences into a symmetrical cycle. Cardinal voting systems provide more information than rankings, allowing a winner to be found. For instance, under score voting, the ballots might be:\n\nCandidate A gets the largest score, and is the winner, as A is the nearest to all voters.\n\nSuppose that \"x\" is the fraction of voters who prefer A over B and that \"y\" is the fraction of voters who prefer B over C. It has been shown that the fraction \"z\" of voters who prefer A over C is always at least (\"x + y\" – 1). Since the paradox (a majority preferring C over A) requires \"z\" < 1/2, a necessary condition for the paradox is that\n\nFor formula_2 voters providing a preference list of three candidates A, B, C, we write formula_3 (resp. formula_4, formula_5) the random variable equal to the number of voters who placed A in front of B (respectively B in front of C, C in front of A). The sought probability is formula_6 (we double because there is also the symmetric case A> C> B> A). We show that, for odd formula_2, formula_8 where formula_9 which makes one need to know only the joint distribution of formula_3 and formula_4.\n\nIf we put formula_12, we show the relation which makes it possible to compute this distribution by recurrence: formula_13.\n\nThe following results are then obtained:\n\nThe sequence seems to be tending towards a finite limit.\n\nUsing the Central-Limit Theorem, we show that formula_14 tends to formula_15 where formula_16 is a variable following a Cauchy distribution, which gives formula_17 (constant ).\n\nThe asymptotic probability of encountering the Condorcet paradox is therefore formula_18 which gives the value 8.77%.\n\nIn are some results for the case of more than three objects.\n\nWhen a Condorcet method is used to determine an election, the voting paradox of cyclical societal preferences implies that the election has no Condorcet winner: no candidate who can win a one-on-one election against each other candidate. The several variants of the Condorcet method differ on how they resolve such ambiguities when they arise to determine a winner. Note that using only rankings, there is no fair and deterministic resolution to the trivial example given earlier because each candidate is in an exactly symmetrical situation.\n\nSituations having the voting paradox can cause voting mechanisms to violate the axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives—the choice of winner by a voting mechanism could be influenced by whether or not a losing candidate is available to be voted for.\n\nOne important implication of the possible existence of the voting paradox in a practical situation is that in a two-stage voting process, the eventual winner may depend on the way the two stages are structured. For example, suppose the winner of A versus B in the open primary contest for one party's leadership will then face the second party's leader, C, in the general election. In the earlier example, A would defeat B for the first party's nomination, and then would lose to C in the general election. But if B were in the second party instead of the first, B would defeat C for that party's nomination, and then would lose to A in the general election. Thus the structure of the two stages makes a difference for whether A or C is the ultimate winner.\n\nLikewise, the structure of a sequence of votes in a legislature can be manipulated by the person arranging the votes, to ensure a preferred outcome.\n\nThe structure of the Condorcet paradox can be reproduced in mechanical devices demonstrating intransitivity of relations such as \"to rotate faster than\", \"to lift and be not be lifted\", \"to be stronger than\" in some geometrical constructions.\n\n\n"}

The bill was referred to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary and on October 4, 2007 was referred to the Senate, although it never received a vote.\n\nA similar version of this bill was introduced by Obama in the 109th Congress on November 16, 2006 () \"to protect Americans from tactics that intimidate voters and prevent them from exercising their right to vote on Election Day.\"\n\nDuring the 2006 mid-term elections, material was distributed by Republicans in predominantly African American counties in Maryland falsely claiming that prominent African-American Democrats had endorsed the Republican candidates.

According to a calculation on an NBC blog, of the candidates that were backed by a Tea Party group, or identified themselves as a Tea Party member, 50% were elected to the Senate and 31% to the House. In addition, research by economists Andreas Madestam of Stockholm University, Daniel Shoag and David Yanagizawa-Drott of Harvard University, and Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute estimated that the Tea Party movement protests generated 2.7–5.5 million additional votes nationwide for the Republican Party in the 2010 House elections.\n\nOn February 19, 2009, in a broadcast from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CNBC Business News Network editor Rick Santelli loudly criticized the government plan to refinance mortgages as \"promoting bad behavior\" by \"subsidizing losers' mortgages\", and raised the possibility of putting together a \"Chicago Tea Party in July\". A number of the traders and brokers around him cheered on his proposal, to the apparent amusement of the hosts in the studio. It was called \"the rant heard round the world\". Santelli's remarks \"set the fuse to the modern anti-Obama Tea Party movement\", according to journalist Lee Fang.\n\nThe following day after Santelli's comments from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 50 national conservative leaders, including Michael Johns, Amy Kremer and Jenny Beth Martin, participated in a conference call that gave birth to the national Tea Party movement. In response to Santelli, websites such as ChicagoTeaParty.com, registered in August 2008 by Chicago radio producer Zack Christenson, were live within twelve hours. About 10 hours after Santelli's remarks, reTeaParty.com was bought to coordinate Tea Parties scheduled for the 4th of July and within two weeks was reported to be receiving 11,000 visitors a day. However, on the contrary, many scholars are reluctant to label Santelli's remarks the \"spark\" of the Tea Party considering that a \"Tea Party\" protest had taken place 3 days before in Seattle, Washington In fact, this had led many opponents of the Tea Party to define this movement as \"astroturfed,\" but it seems as if Santelli's comments did not \"fall on deaf ears\" considering that, \"the top 50 counties in foreclosure rates played host to over 910 Tea Party protests, about one-sixth of the total\"\n\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, \"The New York Times\" identified 138 candidates for Congress with significant Tea Party support, and reported that all of them were running as Republicans—of whom 129 were running for the House and 9 for the Senate. \"The Wall Street Journal\" – NBC News poll in mid October showed 35% of likely voters were Tea-party supporters, and they favored the Republicans by 84% to 10%. The first Tea Party candidate to be elected into office is believed to be Dean Murray, a Long Island businessman, who won a special election for a New York State Assembly seat in February 2010.\n\nAccording to a calculation on an NBC blog, 32% of the candidates that were backed by the Tea Party, or identified themselves as a Tea Party member, won the election. In the primaries for Colorado, Nevada and Delaware the Tea-party backed Senate Republican nominees defeated \"establishment\" Republicans that had been expected to win their respective Senate races, but went on to lose in the general election to their Democratic opponents. The three Senate nominees were seen by many in America and the media as either amateurs or too far-out there to be electable as their positions on certain aspects were viewed as extreme. Several of the Tea Party-endorsed candidates won victories against established Republicans in primaries, such as Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Nevada, New York, South Carolina, and Utah.\n\n\nThere were allegations of Democratic candidates planting \"fake\" Tea Party candidates in Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\n\nFor the 2012 election, four of the 16 Tea Party candidates won a seat on the Senate, and Tea Party Caucus founder Michele Bachmann was re-elected to the House. The media, such as ABC and Bloomberg, commented that Tea Party candidates had less success in 2012 than in 2010.\n\nIn February 2011, the Tea Party Patriots organized and hosted the American Policy Summit in Phoenix, Arizona. The 1,600 attendees were polled regarding their preference for a 2012 presidential candidate. Herman Cain, the first of the 2012 candidates to form a presidential exploratory committee, won the poll with 22%. Runners up were Tim Pawlenty (16%), Ron Paul (15%) and Sarah Palin (10%). Ron Paul won the Summit's online poll.\n\nIn September 2011, CNN and Tea Party Express co-hosted a Republican primary debate among presidential candidates that featured questions from various Tea Party groups.\n\n\n\"The Washington Post\" said in July 2012 that the Tea Party \"is no longer the rising tsunami it appeared to be in 2010. Largely gone are the disorderly rallies, colonial-era costumes and fixations on fringe issues, such as the provenance of the president's birth certificate. Instead, the movement has retooled into a loosely organized network of field operations that, as in Texas, pushes Republicans toward more strident conservative positions and candidates, while supplying ground troops across the country for candidates and big-money conservative groups, such as the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity.\"\n\nTea Party members now tell stories of mailing literature from their laundry rooms, manning phone banks, knocking on doors, and driving over 34,000 miles in their cars to build support for legislation. The Tea Party Patriots now offer free, on-demand, online grassroots training programs. The Tea Party has partnered with seemingly unlikely groups, such as the NAACP and the Sierra Club.\n\nIn the 2014 elections in Texas, the Tea Party made large gains, with numerous Tea Party favorites being elected into office, like Dan Patrick as Lieutenant Governor, Ken Paxton as Attorney General, in addition to numerous other candidates.\n\nIn the 2015 Kentucky gubernatorial election, Matt Bevin, a Tea Party favorite who challenged Mitch McConnell in the Republican primary in the 2014 Kentucky Senate election, won with over 52% of the vote, despite fears that he was too extreme for the state. Bevin is the second Republican in 44 years to be Governor of Kentucky.\n\nThe 2016 Republican presidential primary featured three U.S. Senators, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, whose elections to the U.S. Senate were broadly attributed to Tea Party movement support. The ultimate winner of the Republican presidential primary, Donald Trump, praised the U.S. Tea Party movement throughout his 2016 campaign. In August 2015, Trump told a Tea Party gathering in Nashville that \"The tea party people are incredible people. These are people who work hard and love the country and they get beat up all the time by the media.\" In a January 2016 CNN poll at the beginning of the 2016 Republican primary, Trump led all Republican candidates modestly among self-identified Tea Party voters with 37 percent supporting Trump and 34 percent supporting Ted Cruz.\n\nTea Party activists nationwide made a mass pilgrimage to the Bay State to support Scott Brown's unlikely campaign and ultimate win over Democrat Martha Coakley. Democrats have said as late as September 2010 that the Tea Party could not match their ground game and was mostly hype. The Democrats have the advantage in better organization, an older volunteer organization and personal connections between volunteers and voters.\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Fox News reported that the Democrats did not dispute expectations that they would lose the House, and that their vaunted campaign operation faced a less polished ground game infused with the energy of the new Tea Party. The Tea Party helped deliver to Democrats what President Obama called a \"shellacking\" in the mid-term elections. On November 10, 2010, FreedomWorks announced the national rollout of \"FreedomConnect\", which they touted as a \"grassroots action center that will revolutionize the ways in which FreedomWorks members, 9/12ers and tea party groups across the country communicate and organize in 2011 and beyond\".\n\nThe ground game was considered to be a major challenge for Tea Party candidates in several important contests in 2012, including Wisconsin's recall election of Gov. Scott Walker and the Texas GOP Senate primary race between \"establishment\" candidate Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and Tea Party favorite Ted Cruz.\n\nEarly in the election cycle, Democratic allies had expressed confidence in the strength of their own ground game. In September 2011, Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa delivering a speech to introduce President Obama to the gathered crowd, said \"We got to keep an eye on the battle that we face: The war on workers. And you see it everywhere, it is the Tea Party... We're going to win that war... President Obama, this is your army... We are ready to march. Let's take these sons of bitches out and give America back to an America where we belong.\" Similarly, Organized Labor in Wisconsin hoped its ground game would give it the edge. According to Karl Rove, Democratic Party Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz also boasted on CNN in May that the Wisconsin recall would be the \"dry run we need of our massive, significant dynamic grass-roots presidential campaign\".\n\nWhen challenging GOP \"establishment\" opponents, the Tea Party faced opposing ground games of various size and sophistication. In Texas, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst hired \"ground game expert\" Kevin Lindley, who had run Gov. Rick Perry's campaigns, while in Indiana Richard Lugar no longer lived in the state and developed a reputation for being out of touch with voters there.\n"}

So-called Big Oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Total S.A., Chevron Corporation, and ConocoPhillips are amongst the largest corporations associated with the fossil fuels lobby. General Electric, Southern Company, First Energy, and the Edison Electric Institute are also among the most influential electric utilities corporations. However, electric companies and big oil and gas companies are consistently not among the ten highest-spending lobbyists – the United States Chamber of Commerce is currently #1. By sector, \"Energy/Nat Resource\" comes fifth, behind \"Misc Business\", \"Finance/Insur/RealEst\", Health and \"Communic/Electronics\".\n\nIn the 2000 elections, over $34 million was contributed, with 78% of that money going to Republicans. In 2004, oil and gas companies contributed over $25 million to political campaigns, donating 80% of that money to Republicans. In the 2006 election cycle, oil and gas companies contributed over $19 million to political campaigns. 82% of that money went to Republican candidates, while the remaining 18% went to Democrats. Electric utilities also heavily favor Republicans; their contributions have recently ranged between $15–20 million. From 2003–06, the energy lobby also contributed $58.3 million to state-level campaigns. By comparison, alternative energy interests contributed around half a million dollars in the same time period. \n\nDuring the United States elections in 2012 which includes the presidential election there was much spending by the lobbies.\n\nMany of the most influential members of the energy lobby are among the top polluters in the United States, with Conoco, Exxon, and General Electric ranking in the top six. According to the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization established in March 2002 by former attorneys at the Environmental Protection Agency, “Companies like ExxonMobil and Sunoco keep reporting record profits while increasing emissions or more cancer causing chemicals from their refineries.” The energy lobby is criticized for using its influence to block or dilute legislation regarding global climate change.\n\nVarious scandals involving prominent politicians have drawn attention to the close links between the energy lobby and the U.S. government, particularly the influence wielded by the energy lobby in the Bush administration. Lobbying continued after the Bush administration. In June 2005, documents emerged that revealed that the Bush administration had consulted Exxon regarding its stance on the Kyoto Protocol. According to \"The Guardian\", \"In briefing papers given before meetings to the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs, Paula Dobriansky, between 2001 and 2004, the administration is found thanking Exxon executives for the company's ‘active involvement’ in helping to determine climate change policy, and also seeking its advice on what climate change policies the company might find acceptable.\" In November 2005, documents revealed that Vice President Dick Cheney’s Energy Task Force met with executives from large oil companies, although chief executives of those companies denied involvement before the Senate Energy and Commerce committees. Environmentalists were not allowed access to the Energy Task Force’s activities, which was responsible for developing a national energy policy. Oil companies also participated with Dick Cheney's task force in a discussion of Iraqi oilfields, refineries and other energy infrastructure, and two charts detailing Iraqi oil and gas projects, and “Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oilfield Contracts.” The documents are dated two years before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and six months before the September 11 attacks (9/11).\n\nThe energy lobby has a history of conflict with international interests and democratic global governance. According to the International Sustainable Energy Organization for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency the second World Climate Conference \"was sabotaged by the USA and oil lobbies\" whereupon UNISEO proceeded to set up a Global Energy Charter \"which protects life, health, climate and the biosphere from emissions.\" According to the organization, these same \"reactionary energy lobby groups tried to boycott this Charter with the help from oil- and coal-producing nations and succeeded to keep energy out of the Rio Conference on Environment & Development (Earth Summit) in 1992, to continue this game in all Climate Conferences in Berlin, Kyoto, The Hague and Marrakech, where the USA boycotted the Kyoto protocol and still ignores the Charter.\"\n\nDuring the 14th session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, according to the International Institute for Sustainable Development \"Bulletin\", \"One minister is said to have challenged the North’s renewable energy lobby with the words: why not “light up” the dark zones of the world by “extinguishing some of the candles” in yours?\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7004415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7004415", "title": "Giustizia e Libertà", "text": "Giustizia e Libertà\n\nGiustizia e Libertà (; ) was an Italian anti-fascist resistance movement, active from 1929 to 1945. The movement was founded by Carlo Rosselli. Ferruccio Parri – who later became Prime Minister of Italy, and Sandro Pertini – who later became President of Italy were among the movement's leaders.\n\nThe anti-fascist organisation \"Giustizia e Libertà\" was founded in Paris in 1929 by the Italian refugees Carlo Rosselli, Emilio Lussu, Alberto Tarchiani, and Ernesto Rossi. They began to organise the resistance against Italian Fascism, forming clandestine groups in Italy and setting up an intense propaganda campaign, publishing under Lussu's maxim: \"Insorgere! Risorgere!\" (Rebel! Revive!). Carlo Levi was named a director of the Italian branch along with Leone Ginzburg, a Russian Jew from Odessa who had emigrated with his parents to Turin.\n\n\"Giustizia e Libertà\" was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime; the movement saw Benito Mussolini as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment. Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on Piazza Venezia where Mussolini resided.\n\nAfter a series of arrests and trials, (including the conviction of Carlo Levi) the movement was forced in 1930 to curb this activity. In 1931 the organisation joined the \"Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana\" (Anti-Fascist Concentration), and in 1932 began promoting a plan that aimed not for the restoration of the pre-fascist political order but for a new social democracy centered around a Republican state. It called for economic rights and administrative decentralisation. The group produced its own journal, on which Salvatorelli, De Ruggiero and others collaborated. This journal reflected the politics of the group's leaders, who sought to distance themselves from communism and the Italian Communist Party. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, the organisation formed its own volunteer brigades to support the Spanish Republic.\n\nCarlo Rosselli and Camillo Berneri headed a mixed volunteer unit of anarchist, liberal, socialist, and communist Italians on the Aragon front, whose military successes included a victory against Francoist forces in the Battle of Monte Pelato. They popularised the slogan: \"Oggi in Spagna, domani in Italia\" (Today in Spain, tomorrow in Italy). In 1937, Camillo Berneri was killed by communist forces during a purge of anarchists in Barcelona. With the fall of the Spanish Republic in 1939, \"Giustizia e Libertà\" partisans were forced to flee back to France.\n\nSeveral members of Giustizia e Libertà, including Aldo Garosci, Alberto Cianca, and Alberto Tarchiani, then emigrated to the United States, where they helped form the antifascist Mazzini Society to promote a liberal democratic republic for Italy. They sailed to England in 1943 and set in operation the clandestine Giustizia e Libertà radio to denounce both Fascism and the monarchy for its complicity in Fascism.\n\n\"Giustizia e Libertà\" was forced to cease public operations when German troops occupied France in 1940. Its members were dispersed, but largely reconstituted themselves as the Action Party (\"Partito d'Azione\") in German-occupied Italy following the Armistice of 1943. The military arms of the organisation, the partisan brigades, were still referred to as \"Giustizia e Libertà\".\n\nAfter 8 September 1943, partisan units under the \"Giustizia e Libertà\" banner formed after the Italian capitulation to Allied forces and the creation of the Italian Social Republic puppet state of Nazi Germany. As the largest non-Communist partisan groups, they benefited from provisions and training that were denied to other units by the western Allies. Among the group's best known commanders was Ferruccio Parri, who, using the nom-de-guerre \"Maurizio,\" represented the Action Party in the Military Committee of the National Liberation Committee of Northern Italy (CLNAI). Centres of activity included Turin, Florence, and Milan, where a resistance cell was headed by Ugo La Malfa, Ferruccio Parri, and Adolfo Tino. Parri was arrested in Milan and turned over to the Germans, but he was later exchanged for German officials imprisoned by the partisans. He returned in time to take part in the conclusive phase of the resistance and in the Milan uprising.\n\nThe writer Primo Levi was a member of the Action Party partisan group in Aosta Valley. He was captured by fascist forces in 1943, handed over to the Germans in 1944, and deported to Auschwitz III (Monowitz).\n\n\"Giustizia e Libertà\" brigades were regarded as professional military units, which drew fighters from every social class. In the twenty months of the war, their units sustained 4,500 overall casualties, among them the greater portion of their leaders.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21627479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21627479", "title": "Globalisation in India", "text": "Globalisation in India\n\nGlobalization is a process that encompasses the causes, courses, and consequences of transnational and transcultural integration of human and non-human activities. India had the distinction of being the world's largest economy in the beginning of the Christian era, as it accounted for about 32.9% share of world GDP and about 17% of the world population. The goods produced in India had long been exported to far off destinations across the world; the concept of globalisation is hardly new to India.\n\nIndia currently accounts for 2.7% of world trade (as of 2015), up from 1.2% in 2006 according to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Until the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated from the world markets, to protect its fledgling economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while foreign direct investment was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200M annually between 1985 and 1991; a large percentage of the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of non-resident Indians.\n\nIndia's exports were stagnant for the first 15 years after independence, due to the predominance of tea, jute and cotton manufactures, demand for which was generally inelastic. Imports in the same period consisted predominantly of machinery, equipment and raw materials, due to nascent industrialisation. Since liberalisation, the value of India's international trade has become more broad-based and has risen to 63,0801 billion in 2003–04 from 12.50 billion in 1950–51. India's trading partners are China, the US, the UAE, the UK, Japan and the EU. The exports during April 2007 were $12.31 billion up by 16% and import were $17.68 billion with an increase of 18.06% over the previous year.\n\nIndia is a founding-member of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) since 1947 and its successor, the World Trade Organization. While participating actively in its general council meetings, India has been crucial in voicing the concerns of the developing world. For instance, India has continued its opposition to the inclusion of such matters as labour and environment issues and other \"non-tariff barriers\" into the WTO policies.\n\nDespite reducing import restrictions several times in the 2000s, India was evaluated by the World Trade Organization in 2008 as more restrictive than similar developing economies, such as Brazil, China, and Russia. The WTO also identified electricity shortages and inadequate transportation infrastructure as significant constraints on trade.\nIts restrictiveness has been cited as a factor which isolated it from the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 more than other countries, even though it experienced reduced ongoing economic growth.\n\nSince independence, India's balance of payments on its current account has been negative. Since liberalisation in the 1990s (precipitated by a balance of payment crisis), India's exports have been consistently rising, covering 80.3% of its imports in 2002–03, up from 66.2% in 1990–91. Although India is still a net importer, since 1996–97, its overall balance of payments (i.e., including the capital account balance), has been positive, largely on account of increased foreign direct investment and deposits from non-resident Indians; until this time, the overall balance was only occasionally positive on account of external assistance and commercial borrowings. As a result, India's foreign currency reserves stood at $285 billion in 2008, which could be used in infrastructural development of the country if used effectively. In September 2017 India's foreign exchange reserves crossed $400 billion.\n\nIndia's reliance on external assistance and commercial borrowings has decreased since 1991–92, and since 2002–03, it has gradually been repaying these debts. Declining interest rates and reduced borrowings decreased India's debt service ratio to 4.5% in 2007.\n\nIn India, external commercial borrowings (ECBs) are being permitted by the government for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The Ministry of Finance monitors and regulates these borrowings (ECBs) through ECB policy guidelines.\n\nIndia's economy has grown drastically since it integrated into the global economy in 1991. It has drastic impact on India's economical condition. Its average annual rate has grown from 3.5% (1950–1980) to 7.7% (2002–2012). That rate peaked at 9.5% from 2005–2008. Economic growth has also led to increases in the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), from $1,255 in 1978 to $3,452 in 2005, and finally to $3,900 in 2012.\n\nJobs in the technology and business sectors have many benefits. However, only people in those sectors are benefiting. The overall employment rate for the country has decreased, while the number of job seekers is increasing at a yearly rate of 2.5%. Despite those statistics, the GDP is increasing every year. Growth is limited to some states, including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. Other states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Orissa, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Assam, and West Bengal remain poverty-stricken.\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) in India has reached 2% of GDP, compared with 0.1% in 1990, and Indian investment in other countries rose sharply in 2006.\n\nAs the third-largest economy in the world in PPP terms, India is a preferred destination for FDI; India has strengths in information technology and other significant areas such as auto components, chemicals, apparels, pharmaceuticals, and jewelry. Despite a surge in foreign investments, rigid FDI policies resulted in a significant hindrance. However, due to some positive economic reforms aimed at deregulating the economy and stimulating foreign investment, India has positioned itself as one of the front-runners of the rapidly growing Asia-Pacific region. India has a large pool of skilled managerial and technical expertise. The size of the middle-class population stands at 50 million and represents a growing consumer market.\n\nIndia's liberalised FDI policy as of 2005 allowed up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy access to foreign technology and FDI. The upward moving growth curve of the real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalised FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100 per cent FDI in the construction business. This automatic route has been permitted in townships, housing, built-up infrastructure and construction development projects including housing, commercial premises, hotels, resorts, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure.\n\nA number of changes were approved on the FDI policy to remove the caps in most sectors. Fields which require relaxation in FDI restrictions include civil aviation, construction development, industrial parks, petroleum and natural gas, commodity exchanges, credit-information services and mining. But this still leaves an unfinished agenda of permitting greater foreign investment in politically sensitive areas such as insurance and retailing. FDI inflows into India reached a record US$19.5bn in fiscal year 2006/07 (April–March), according to the government's Secretariat for Industrial Assistance. This was more than double the total of US$7.8bn in the previous fiscal year. The FDI inflow for 2007-08 has been reported as $24bn and for 2008-09, it is expected to be above $35 billion. A critical factor in determining India's continued economic growth and realising the potential to be an economic superpower is going to depend on how the government can create incentives for FDI flow across a large number of sectors in India.\nIn September 2012 the government approved 51% FDI in multi-brand retails despite a lot of pressure from coalition parties.\n\nRemittances to India are money transfers from Indian workers employed outside the country to friends or relatives in India. Since 1991, India has experienced sharp remittance growth, and it is now is the world's leading receiver of remittances. In, 1991 Indian remittances totaled 2.1 billion USD; in 2006, they were estimated at between $22 billion and $25.7 billion, about 3% of India's GDP. India claimed more than 12% of the world's remittances in 2007.\n\nThe integration of technology in India has transformed jobs which required specialized skills and lacked decision-making skills to extensively-defined jobs with higher accountability that require new skills, such as numerical, analytical, communication and interactive skills. As a result of this, more job opportunities are created for people. Technology has also influenced many firms to give their workers more freedom inworkplace. For instance, workers who perform non-routine tasks benefit more than workers who do not.\n\nOne event that helped India immensely was when Netscape went public on 9 August 1995. Netscape provided globalization through technology in three major ways. First, Netscape made it possible for the browser to display images from websites. Second, the investment of billions in fiber-optic telecommunications influenced by the dot-com boom and the dot com bubble poured a great deal of hard currency into the Indian economy. Last, the over-investment in technology made it cheaper by creating a global fiber network, which made it easier and faster to transmit data (5).\n\nAs a result of the Netscape IPO, more job opportunities were created for Indians, including ones outsourced from other countries. One of the milestones in job opportunities was when thousands of Indian engineers were hired to fix the Y2K bug. The job could have been given to many other companies, but it was outsourced to India. India was now seen in a different light, as being ready to join the workforce as well as able to compete against first-world countries for jobs.\n\nAlthough India has had immense economic growth, not all sectors of the country have benefited. The funds that should have been directed to the agriculture sector were directed to private-sector enterprises. For instance, growth in the agricultural sector dropped from 3.8% in 2007 to 2.6% in 2008. This decline in growth has greatly affected farmers because production costs are very high, while commodity costs are low. This has resulted in over 150,000 peasant suicides since 1997.\n\nAnother way globalization has affected the agricultural sector is through biofuel and medicinal cultivation. There is a food security crisis in India because a significant portion of the land has been designated to grow crops for biofuel. Crops like rice and wheat are often harvested in large quantities. However, the amount of crops that are used for biofuel is largely unregulated, with an inadequate amount going to the poor and needy.\n\nTechnology has also increased access to education in India, especially to women. This has decreased the gap between men and women which was created by stratified gender roles. It has also empowered women in two ways. Technology has influenced more women to pursue advanced degrees in computer science and engineering instead of their traditional degrees in social sciences and the humanities. This has resulted in an increase in the number of women in competitive professions.\nGlobalization expanded the need for higher education for both men and women. This, in turn, has had a tremendous impact on the life of the single woman in India.\n\nThe stigmatization and expectations on single women have decreased. For example, it is easier for single women to find living accommodations in cities like Kolkata. Society then puts less pressure on women to marry at a certain age because higher education is now more acceptable. India is promoting higher education for youth as well. New universities are being built, and advertisements on billboards have gone up around Kolkata to attract the growing population of high school graduates.\n\nIndia has also promoted higher education through the propagation of universities; however, funding to elementary education has declined. Sixty-three million children age 6 to 14 are out of school due the reduced education budget.\n\nThe Indian government has invested a lot in promoting higher education in the country, but more progress could be made with the help of private interests. The private sector has more than enough financial power to increase the literacy rate and access to higher education. It can be done through private universities and learning centers. In addition, global universities might be established in India so the global perspective can be fixed into the curriculum. Four aspects of global education that universities in India might focus on are a global curriculum, global faculty, global degrees, and global interaction. These aspects would not only help promote higher education, but would help prepare India for the growing global competition that globalization is creating.\n\nAnother sector the government has neglected is public health. India has one of the lowest ratios of public to private health expenditure. The infant mortality rate for the richest 20% of the population is only 38 per 1000 live births, while the rate for the poorest 20% is 97 per 1000. In addition, the rate of epidemics among the poor is increasing; it is common for outbreaks of contagious diseases like human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and malaria to occur.\n\nThomas Friedman, an American journalist, columnist, and author of \"It's a Flat World After All\" separates globalization into three stages; globalization 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. According to Friedman, globalization 1.0, which dates to 1492, involved countries globalizing for natural resources. In globalization 2.0 (1800–2000), companies globalized for labor and markets. In 3.0, the current stage, companies are seeking to globalize down to small groups of people, or even individuals.\n\nFriedman first described the world's economy as being macroscopic. He explains that only countries interacted with each other, not individuals or small groups. Friedman then focused on how this has changed and improved within globalization 3.0. Under globalization 3.0, the world turned flat and individuals now had the opportunity to work and collaborate with other individuals from varying and diverse backgrounds. In addition, Friedman discussed how countries like India are using globalization to their advantage. The economies of countries similar to India are now blooming as the world is flattening and shrinking due to globalization.\n\nFifty years ago, countries such as India did not have a say in the global market and trade. America and other European powers who were once top players in the international market are now getting competition from countries like India, which is experiencing tremendous economic growth. Technology has played a major role in the advancement of globalization within India.\n\n"}
{"id": "1076695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1076695", "title": "György Dózsa", "text": "György Dózsa\n\nGyörgy Dózsa (or \"György Székely\", ; 1470 – 20 July 1514) was a Székely man-at-arms (and by some accounts, a nobleman) from Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary who led a peasants' revolt against the kingdom's landed nobility. He was eventually caught, tortured, and executed along with his followers, and remembered as both a Christian martyr and a dangerous criminal. During the reign of king Vladislas II of Hungary (1490–1516), royal power declined in favour of the magnates, who used their power to curtail the peasants’ freedom.\n\nDózsa was born in Dálnok (today Dalnic). During the wars against the Ottoman Empire, he was a soldier of fortune who won a reputation for valour.\n\nIn 1514, the Hungarian chancellor, Tamás Bakócz, returned from the Holy See with a papal bull issued by Leo X authorising a crusade against the Ottomans. He appointed Dózsa to organize and direct the movement. Within a few weeks, Dózsa had gathered an army of some 40,000 so-called \"hajdú\", consisting for the most part of peasants, wandering students, friars, and parish priests - some of the lowest-ranking groups of medieval society. They assembled in their counties, and by the time he had provided them with some military training, they began to air the grievances of their status. No measures had been taken to supply these voluntary crusaders with food or clothing. As harvest-time approached, the landlords commanded them to return to reap the fields, and, on their refusing to do so, proceeded to maltreat their wives and families and set their armed retainers upon the local peasantry.\n\nThe volunteers became increasingly angry at the failure of the nobility to provide military leadership (the original and primary function of the nobility and the justification for its higher status in the society.) The rebellious, anti-landlord sentiment of these \"Crusaders\" became apparent during their march across the Great Hungarian Plain, and Bakócz cancelled the campaign. The movement was thus diverted from its original object, and the peasants and their leaders began a war of vengeance against the landlords.\n\nBy this time, Dózsa was losing control of the people under his command, who had fallen under the influence of the parson of Cegléd, Lőrinc Mészáros. The rebellion became more dangerous when the towns joined on the side of the peasants. In Buda and elsewhere, the cavalry sent against the \"Kuruc\" were unhorsed as they passed through the gates.\n\nThe rebellion spread quickly, principally in the central or purely Magyar provinces, where hundreds of manor houses and castles were burnt and thousands of the gentry killed by impalement, crucifixion, and other methods. Dózsa's camp at Cegléd was the centre of the \"jacquerie\", as all raids in the surrounding area started out from there.\n\nIn reaction, the papal bull was revoked, and King Vladislaus II issued a proclamation commanding the peasantry to return to their homes under pain of death. By this time, the uprising had attained the dimensions of a revolution; all the vassals of the kingdom were called out against it, and soldiers of fortune were hired in haste from the Republic of Venice, Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire. Meanwhile, Dózsa had captured the city and fortress of Csanád (today's Cenad), and signaled his victory by impaling the bishop and the castellan.\n\nSubsequently, at Arad, Lord Treasurer István Telegdy was seized and tortured to death. In general, however, the rebels only executed particularly vicious or greedy noblemen; those who freely submitted were released on parole. Dózsa not only never broke his given word, but frequently assisted the escape of fugitives. He was unable to consistently control his followers, however, and many of them hunted down rivals.\n\nIn the course of the summer, Dózsa seized the fortresses of Arad, Lippa (today Lipova) and Világos (now Şiria), and provided himself with cannons and trained gunners. One of his bands advanced to within 25 kilometres of the capital. But his ill-armed ploughmen were outmatched by the heavy cavalry of the nobles. Dózsa himself had apparently become demoralized by success: after Csanád, he issued proclamations which can be described as millenarian.\n\nAs his suppression had become a political necessity, Dózsa was routed at Temesvár (today Timişoara, Romania) by an army of 20,000 led by John Zápolya and István Báthory. He was captured after the battle, and condemned to sit on a smouldering, heated iron throne, and forced to wear a heated iron crown and sceptre (mocking his ambition to be king). While he was suffering, a procession of nine fellow rebels who had been starved beforehand were led to this throne. In the lead was Dózsa's younger brother, Gergely, who was cut in three despite Dózsa asking for Gergely to be spared. Next, executioners removed some pliers from a fire and forced them into Dózsa's skin. After tearing his flesh, the remaining rebels were ordered to bite spots where the hot pliers had been inserted and to swallow the flesh. The three or four who refused were simply cut up, prompting the others to comply. In the end, Dózsa died from the ordeal, while the rebels who obeyed were released and left alone.\n\nThe revolt was repressed but some 70,000 peasants were tortured. György's execution, and the brutal suppression of the peasants, greatly aided the 1526 Ottoman invasion as the Hungarians were no longer a politically united people. Another consequence was the creation of new laws, an effort in the Hungarian Diet led by István Werbőczy. The resulting Tripartitum elaborated the old rights of peasants, but also greatly enhanced the status of lesser nobility (gentry), erecting an iron curtain between Hungarians until 1848 when serfdom was abolished.\n\nToday, on the site of the martyrdom of the hot throne, there is the statue of The Virgin Mary, built by architect László Székely and sculptor György Kiss. According to the legend, during György Dózsa's torture, some monks saw in his ear the image of Mary. The first statue was raised in 1865, with the actual monument raised in 1906. Hungarian opera composer Ferenc Erkel wrote an opera, \"Dózsa György\", about him.\n\nHis revolutionary image and Transylvanian background were drawn upon during the Communist regime of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. The Hungarian component of his movement was downplayed, but its strong anti-feudal character was emphasized.\n\nIn Budapest, a square, a busy six-lane avenue, and a metro station bear his name, and it is one of the most popular street names in Hungarian villages. A number of streets in several cities of Romania were named \"Gheorghe Doja\". Also, a number of streets in serval cities of Serbia were named \"Ulica Doža Đerđa\".\nTwo Postage stamps were issued in his honor by Hungary on 12 June 1919 and on 15 March 1947, the latter in the \"social revolutionists\" series.\n\n"}
{"id": "372031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=372031", "title": "Hoplophobia", "text": "Hoplophobia\n\nHoplophobia is a political neologism coined by retired American military officer Jeff Cooper as a pejorative to describe an \"irrational aversion to weapons.\" It is also used to describe the \"fear of firearms\" or the \"fear of armed citizens.\" \n\nHoplophobia is listed simply as a phobia in some medical dictionaries as a fear of weapons or firearms. \n\nAmerican firearms expert and retired Marine colonel Jeff Cooper coined the word in 1962 to denigrate and anger proponents of gun control by implying that their thoughts were \"aberrant\" and unreasoning:\n\nI coined the term \"hoplophobia\" in 1962 in response to a perceived need for a word to describe a mental aberration consisting of an unreasoning terror of gadgetry, specifically, weapons. The most common manifestation of hoplophobia is the idea that instruments possess a will of their own, apart from that of their user. This is not a reasoned position, but when you point this out to a hoplophobe he is not impressed because his is an unreasonable position. To convince a man that he is not making sense is not to change his viewpoint but rather to make an enemy. Thus hoplophobia is a useful word, but as with all words, it should be used correctly.\n\nThe term was constructed from the Greek ὅπλον – \"hoplon\", meaning, amongst other things, \"arms,\" and φόβος – \"phobos\", meaning \"fear.\" Cooper employed the term as just another alternative to other slang terms, stating: \"We read of 'gun grabbers' and 'anti-gun nuts' but these slang terms do not [explain this behavior].\" Cooper's conjecture was that \"the most common manifestation of hoplophobia is the idea that instruments possess a will of their own, apart from that of their user.\" Writing in an opinion piece, \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\" columnist Dimitri Vassilaros said that the term was intended by Cooper as tongue-in-cheek to mock those who think guns have free will.\n\n"}
{"id": "857264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857264", "title": "Inclosure Acts", "text": "Inclosure Acts\n\nThe Inclosure Acts were a series of Acts of Parliament that empowered enclosure of open fields and common land in England and Wales, creating legal property rights to land that was previously held in common. Between 1604 and 1914, over 5,200 individual enclosure acts were passed, covering .\n\nPrior to the enclosures in England, a portion of the land was categorized as \"common\" or \"waste\" or not in use. \"Common\" land was under the control of the lord of the manor, but a number of rights on the land (such as pasture, pannage, or estovers) were variously held by certain nearby properties, or (occasionally) held \"in gross\" by all manorial tenants. \"Waste\" was land without value as a farm strip – often very narrow areas (typically less than a yard wide) in awkward locations (like cliff edges, or inconveniently shaped manorial borders), but also bare rock, and so forth; \"waste\" was not officially used by anyone, and thus was often cultivated by landless peasants.\n\nThe remainder of the land was organised into a large number of narrow strips, with each tenant possessing a number of disparate strips throughout the manor, as would the manorial lord. Called the open field system, it was administered by manorial courts, which exercised some kind of collective control. Thus what might now be considered a single field, would under this system have been divided among the lord and his tenants; poorer peasants (serfs or copyholders, depending on the era) would be allowed to live on the strips owned by the lord, in return for cultivating his land. This system facilitated common grazing and crop rotation. \n\nAny particular individual might possess several strips of land within the manor, often separated by some distance from one another. In search of better financial returns, landowners looked for more efficient farming techniques; enclosure Acts for small areas had been passed sporadically since the 12th century, but with the rise of new agricultural knowledge and technology in the 18th century, they became more commonplace. Because tenants (even copyholders) had legally enforcable rights on the land, substantial compensation was provided to extinguish them; as a result, many tenants were active supporters of enclosure, but the Acts enabled landlords to force reluctant tenants to comply with the process.\n\nWith legal control of the land, landlords utilised innovations in methods of crop production, increasing profits and supporting the Agricultural Revolution; the higher productivity also enabled landowners to justify higher rents for the people working the land. In 1801, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act was passed to tidy up previous acts. In 1845, another General Inclosure Act allowed for the appointment of Inclosure Commissioners who could enclose land without submitting a request to Parliament.\n\nThe tenants displaced by the process often left the countryside to work in the towns. This contributed to the industrial revolution – at the very moment new technological advances required large numbers of workers, a concentration of large numbers of people in need of work had emerged; the former country tenants and their descendants became workers in industrial factories within cities.\n\n\nThe Enclosure Acts 1845 to 1882 means:\n\n\n\n"}

Independent India’s most revolutionary land policy was perhaps the abolition of the Zamindari system (feudal land holding practices). Land-reform policy in India had two specific objectives:\n\"The first is to remove such impediments to increase in agricultural production as arise from the agrarian structure inherited from the past…The second object, which is closely related to the first, is to eliminate all elements of exploitation and social injustice within the agrarian system, to provide security for the tiller of soil and assure equality of status and opportunity to all sections of the rural population.” (Government of India 1961 as quoted by Appu 1996)\n\nThere are four main categories of reforms: \n\nSince its independence in 1947, there has been voluntary and state initiated/mediated land reforms in several states with dual objective of efficient use of land and ensuring social justice. The most notable and successful example of land reforms are in the states of West Bengal and Kerala. Other than these state sponsored attempts of reforming land ownership and control, there was another attempt to bring changes in the regime which achieved limited success; famously known as Bhoodan movement (Government of India, Ministry of Rural Development 2003, Annex XXXIX). Some other research has shown that during the movement, in Vidarbha region, 14 percent of the land records are incomplete, thus prohibiting transfer to the poor. 24 percent of the land promised had never actually become part of the movement. The Gramdan which arguably took place in 160,000 pockets did not legalise the process under the state laws (Committee on Land Reform 2009, 77, Ministry of Rural Development).\n\nAfter promising land reforms and elected to power in West Bengal in 1977, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) kept their word and initiated gradual land reforms, such as Operation Barga. The result was a more equitable distribution of land among the landless farmers, and enumeration of landless farmers. This has ensured an almost lifelong loyalty from the farmers and the communists were in power till 2011 assembly election.\n\nIn land reform in Kerala, the only other large state where the CPI(M) came to power, state administrations have actually carried out the most extensive land, tenancy and agrarian labour wage reforms in the non-socialist late-industrialising world. Another successful land reform program was launched in Jammu and Kashmir after 1947.\n\nAll in all, land reforms have been successful only in pockets of the country, as people have often found loopholes in the laws that set limits on the maximum area of land that is allowed to be held by any one person.\n\nThe following table shows land ceilings for each state in India.\n"}

Until 1933 the term was used in Prussia for the head of government of a province, in the modern-day states of Germany the counterpart to \"Landeshauptmann\" (governor) is the \"Ministerpräsident\" (minister-president).\n\nSince the early modern period, a \"Landeshauptmann\" originally served as governor under either a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire or the Emperor himself, mainly in the territories of the Habsburg Monarchy (as for the Lands of the Bohemian Crown), later also in the Kingdom of Prussia. In the Austrian Empire, according to the 1861 February Patent, the title referred to the president of the \"Landtag\" assembly of a Habsburg crown land (called \"\" in Lower Austria, Bohemia, and Galicia), who also served as head of the provincial administration. The Imperial-Royal government in Vienna was represented by a \"Statthalter\" or \"Landespräsident\" (governor).\n\nWith the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the proclamation of the Republic of German-Austria in 1918, provisional state assemblies and state governments were established, headed by a \"Landeshauptmann\". The 1920 constitution of the First Austrian Republic (\"Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz\") unified the office of a Federal Government representative and head of the state government. The title is today used in modern Austria as well as in South Tyrol and Trentino, autonomous provinces in Italy with strong linguistic and cultural ties to the neighbouring Austrian state of Tyrol. In the Czech Republic, a \"hejtman\" (German: \"Hauptmann\") represents each of the 13 self-governing regions (Czech \"kraj\", pl. \"kraje\"). The title was also used by the German Empire for governors during the early stages of its colonial rule over German South-West Africa (1893–1898), Togoland (1893–1898) and German New Guinea (1886–1889, 1892–1899).\n\nIn modern Austria, the title is used for the head of the executive of the nine Austrian states, equivalent to the position of a \"Ministerpräsident\" in German states. Outside of Austria, the title is usually translated as \"governor,\" though as mentioned above the function corresponds more to that of minister-president or premier. \n\nThe \"Landeshauptmann\" is elected by the \"Landtag\" state parliament of the respective state and sworn in by the President of Austria. In practice, he or she is almost always the leader of the majority party in the Landtag, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. As representative of the federated state on state level, he or she is also responsible for the enforcement of federal laws.\n\nThe Mayor of Vienna also serves as a \"Landeshauptmann\", elected by the municipal assembly (\"Wiener Gemeiderat und Landtag\"). When Waltraud Klasnic (ÖVP) became governor of Styria in 1996, she preferred to be addressed as \"Frau Landeshauptmann\", whereas Gabi Burgstaller (SPÖ), governor of Salzburg from 2004 to 2013, preferred \"Frau Landeshauptfrau\". Since 1 July 1988, the Constitution of Austria allows for, but does not prescribe, office designations to be gender-specific \n\nAccording to the 1946 Gruber–De Gasperi Agreement and the Second Autonomy Statute of 1972, the chief executives of the provincial governments () of South Tyrol and Trentino are called \"Landeshauptleute\" in German.\n\nThe head of government of South Tyrol is elected by the provincial \"Landtag\" legislature. The \"Landeshauptmann\" represents the province to the outside and in meetings of the regions with the Italian government. He is also entitled to attend the sessions of the Council of Ministers as far as South Tyrolean issues are discussed. His two deputies have to represent the Italian and German language group.\n\nDespite the German terms \"Landeshauptmann\" and \"Landtag\", South Tyrol and Trentino according to Italian conception are no federated states (\"Länder\") but merely subnational administrative divisions (\"enti territoriali\"), though with considerable self-government responsibilities and legislative powers.\n\nFrom 1875 the territorial authority of the estates in the twelve administrative provinces of Prussia were re-organised as \"Provinzialverbände\". Each of these self-governing bodies were represented in a \"Provinziallandtag\" assembly, whose members were delegated by the rural and urban districts within the province. The districts organised through their elected deputees their utilities, such as construction and maintenance of provincial roads, hospitals, schools, public savings banks, waste disposal etc., in self-rule.\n\nThe provincial administration was initially headed by a \"Landesdirektor\", who was elected by the assembly for six-year terms (in Pomerania: five years) and maximally two terms. The holder of the office presided over the \"Provinzialausschuss\", i.e. provincial government of self-rule, whereas the \"Oberpräsident\" was the king-appointed representative for the province, busy with implementing and supervising central prerogatives of the Prussian government.\n\nIn the following decades, \"Landeshauptmann\" gradually replaced the earlier expression \"Landesdirektor\" in all but one of Prussia's provinces. When the kingdom turned into a free state in 1920, only the \"Landtag\" of Brandenburg had decided to keep the traditional expression. With the abolition of democratic self-rule on all government levels in the course of the \"Gleichschaltung\" process after the Nazi takeover in 1933, the office-holders were furloughed or retired and the offices remained vacant.\n\nThe Klaipėda Region (), which was dissected from East Prussia after World War I and annexed by Lithuania in the Klaipėda Revolt of 1923, continued the usage of the terms \"Landesdirektor\" (i.e. government member) and Landesdirektorium (; i.e. government). The head of government was given the title Landespräsident (state president).\n"}
{"id": "17575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17575", "title": "Limousine liberal", "text": "Limousine liberal\n\nLimousine liberal and latte liberal are pejorative American political terms used to illustrate purported hypocritical behavior by political liberals of upper class or upper middle class status; for example, calling for the use of mass transit while frequently using privately-owned luxury transportation, especially by limousines or private jets in the case of the extremely affluent, claiming environmental consciousness but driving fuel inefficient sports cars or SUVs, attacking income inequality while being wealthy themselves, or ostensibly supporting public education while actually sending their children to private schools.\n\n\"Limousine liberal\" is also a reference to celebrities who use their fame to influence others into agreeing with their political and societal points of view. Such celebrities' critics (including proponents of the pejorative) assert that their wealth and status keeps them out of touch with the American middle and lower middle classes they purport to support, and that they are typically blind to this disconnect.\n\nDemocratic New York City mayoral hopeful Mario Procaccino coined the term \"limousine liberal\" to describe incumbent Mayor John Lindsay and his wealthy Manhattan backers during a heated 1969 campaign.\n\nIt was a populist and producerist epithet, carrying an implicit accusation that the people it described were insulated from all negative consequences of their programs purported to benefit the poor, and that the costs and consequences of such programs would be borne in the main by working class or lower middle class people who were not so poor as to be beneficiaries themselves. In particular, Procaccino criticized Lindsay for favoring unemployed blacks over working-class white ethnics.\n\nOne Procaccino campaign memo attacked \"rich super-assimilated people who live on Fifth Avenue and maintain some choice mansions outside the city and have no feeling for the small middle class shopkeeper, home owner, etc. They preach the politics of confrontation and condone violent upheaval in society because they are not touched by it and are protected by their courtiers\". \"The Independent\" later stated that \"Lindsay came across as all style and no substance, a 'limousine liberal' who knew nothing of the concerns of the same 'Silent Majority' that was carrying Richard Nixon to the White House at the very same time.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, the term was applied to wealthy liberal supporters of open-housing and forced school busing who didn't make use of public schooling. In Boston, Massachusetts, supporters of busing, such as Senator Ted Kennedy, sent their children to private schools or lived in affluent suburbs. To some South Boston residents, Kennedy's support of a plan that \"integrated\" their children with blacks and his apparent unwillingness to do the same with his own children, was hypocrisy.\n\nBy the late 1990s and early 21st century, the term has also come to be applied to those who support environmentalist or \"green\" goals, such as mass transit, yet drive large SUVs or literally have a limousine and driver. \"The Weekly Standard\" applied the term to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX 18) for being \"routinely chauffeured the one short block to work--in a government car, by a member of her staff, at the taxpayers' expense.\" The term was also used disparagingly in a 2004 episode of \"Law & Order\" by Fred Thompson's character, Arthur Branch, to criticize the politics and beliefs of his more liberal colleague, Serena Southerlyn. \"South Park\"'s creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone poked fun at the tendency of some liberals to be more concerned with image than actually helping the earth in the episode \"Smug Alert!\"\n\nThe \"New York Observer\" applied the term to 2008 Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards for paying $400 for a haircut and, according to the newspaper, \"lectures about poverty while living in gated opulence\".\n\nIn 2009, the term was applied by many commentators to former Senate Majority Leader and then-Obama cabinet appointee Tom Daschle for failing to pay back taxes and interest on the use of a limousine service.\n\nThe term has often been applied to documentary filmmaker Michael Moore over the years by both critics on the left and right due to his habit of traveling around New York City in a limousine.\n\nAl Gore is often called a limousine liberal by his critics for his use of private jet planes and SUVs, while giving speeches calling for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In the May 16, 2007 edition of TIME magazine, the term was used in the allegation that \"His (Gore's) Tennessee mansion consumes 20 times the electricity used by the average American home\"\n\n\"Lexus liberal\" is a variant on the term, used to describe an upper-middle class individual who supports the same ideas of the limousine liberals, but is still out-of-touch with the actual poor they purport to feel for. The term \"Lexus\" is used as these liberals might not have a limousine, but are wealthy enough to afford a luxury car or high-end vehicle, such as a Lexus.\n\n\n"}

The H.R. 6385 act was drafted by Harry Anslinger and introduced by Rep. Robert L. Doughton of North Carolina, on April 14, 1937. The seventy-fifth Congress held hearings on April 27, 28, 29th, 30th, and May 4, 1937. Upon the congressional hearings confirmation, the H.R. 6385 act was redrafted as H.R. 6906 and introduced with House Report 792. The Act is now commonly referred to, using the modern spelling, as the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act. This act was overturned in 1969 in \"Leary v. United States\", and was repealed by Congress the next year.\n\nRegulations and restrictions on the sale of cannabis sativa as a drug began as early as 1906 (see Legal history of cannabis in the United States). The head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), Harry J. Anslinger, argued that, in the 1930s, the FBN had noticed an increase of reports of people smoking marijuana. He had also, in 1935, received support from president Franklin D. Roosevelt for adoption of the Uniform State Narcotic Act, state laws that included regulations of cannabis.\n\nThe total production of hemp fiber in the United States had in 1933 decreased to around 500 tons/year. Cultivation of hemp began to increase in 1934 and 1935 but production remained at very low volume compared with other fibers.\n\nSome parties have argued that the aim of the Act was to reduce the size of the hemp industry largely as an effort of businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst, and the Du Pont family. The same parties have argued that with the invention of the decorticator, hemp had become a very cheap substitute for the paper pulp that was used in the newspaper industry. These parties argue that Hearst felt that this was a threat to his extensive timber holdings. Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury and the wealthiest man in the US, had invested heavily in the Du Pont family's new synthetic fiber, nylon, a fiber that was competing with hemp. In 1916, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) chief scientists Jason L. Merrill and Lyster H. Dewey created a paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 \"Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material\", in which they concluded that paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, so called hemp hurds, was \"favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood\". Dewey and Merrill believed that hemp hurds were a suitable source for paper production. However, later research does not confirm this. The concentration of cellulose in hemp hurds is only between 32% and 38% (not 77%, a number often repeated by Jack Herer and others on the Internet). Manufacture of paper with hemp as a raw material has shown that hemp lacks the qualities needed to become a major competitor to the traditional paper industry, which still uses wood or waste paper as raw material. In 2003, 95% of the hemp hurds in the EU were used for animal bedding, almost 5% were used as building material. The DuPont Company and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp. They argue that the purpose of developing the nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon.\n\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) opposed the act because the tax was imposed on physicians prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation/manufacturing. The AMA proposed that cannabis instead be added to the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. The bill was passed over the last-minute objections of the American Medical Association. Dr. William Creighton Woodward, legislative counsel for the AMA, objected to the bill on the grounds that the bill had been prepared in secret without giving proper time to prepare their opposition to the bill. He doubted their claims about marijuana addiction, violence, and overdosage; he further asserted that because the word \"Marijuana\" was largely unknown at the time, the medical profession did not realize they were losing cannabis. \"Marijuana is not the correct term ... Yet the burden of this bill is placed heavily on the doctors and pharmacists of this country.\"\n\nThe bill was passed on the grounds of different reports and hearings. Anslinger also referred to the International Opium Convention that from 1928 included cannabis as a drug not a medicine, and that all states had some kind of laws against improper use of cannabis (for ex. the Uniform State Narcotic Act). By 1951, however, new justifications had emerged, and the Boggs Act that superseded the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was passed. In August 1954, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was enacted, and the Marihuana Tax Act was included in Subchapter A of Chapter 39 of the 1954 Code.\n\nShortly after the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act went into effect on October 1, 1937, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Denver City police arrested Moses Baca for possession and Samuel Caldwell for dealing. Baca and Caldwell's arrest made them the first marijuana convictions under U.S. federal law for not paying the marijuana tax. Judge Foster Symes sentenced Baca to 18 months and Caldwell to four years in Leavenworth Penitentiary for violating the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act.\n\nAfter the Philippines fell to Japanese forces in 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the US Army urged farmers to grow fiber hemp. Tax stamps for cultivation of fiber hemp began to be issued to farmers. Without any change in the Marihuana Tax Act, were cultivated with hemp between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957.\n\nIn 1967, President Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice opened, \"The Act raises an insignificant amount of revenue and exposes an insignificant number of marijuana transactions to public view, since only a handful of people are registered under the Act. It has become, in effect, solely a criminal law, imposing sanctions upon persons who sell, acquire, or possess marijuana.\"\n\nIn 1969 in \"Leary v. United States\", part of the Act was ruled to be unconstitutional as a violation of the Fifth Amendment, since a person seeking the tax stamp would have to incriminate him/herself. In response the Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, which repealed the 1937 Act.\n\nAlthough the spelling \"marijuana\" is more common in current usage, the actual spelling used in the Marihuana Tax Act is \"marihuana\". \"Marihuana\" was the spelling most commonly used in Federal Government documents at the time.\n\nIn addition, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 legitimized the use of the term \"marijuana\" as a label for hemp and cannabis plants and products in the US and around the world. Prior to 1937, \"marijuana\" was slang; it was not included in any official dictionaries. The word \"marijuana\" is probably of Mexican origin. Mexico itself had passed prohibition for export to the US in 1925, following the International Opium Convention. In the years leading up to the tax act, it was in common use in the United States, \"smoked like tobacco\", and called \"ganjah\", or \"ganja\". After the enactment, illegal immigrants and US citizens could be arrested for possession of cannabis.\n\nThe only authoritative voice that opposed Anslinger's campaign against cannabis was that of New York Mayor, Fiorello La Guardia, who appointed in 1938 a commission of investigation, and in 1944 strongly objected to Anslinger's campaign with the La Guardia Committee.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "238894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238894", "title": "McDonaldization", "text": "McDonaldization\n\nMcDonaldization is a term developed by sociologist George Ritzer in his book \"The McDonaldization of Society\" (1993). For Ritzer McDonaldization becomes manifested when a society adopts the characteristics of a fast-food restaurant. \n\nMcDonaldization is a reconceptualization of rationalization and scientific management. Where Max Weber used the model of the bureaucracy to represent the direction of this changing society, Ritzer sees the fast-food restaurant as a more representative contemporary paradigm (Ritzer, 2004:553). The process of McDonaldization can be summarized as the way in which \"the principles of the fast-food restaurant are coming to dominate more and more sectors of American society as well as of the rest of the world.\" \n\nThe McDonaldization thesis in its cultural version is a comparatively recent idea about the worldwide homogenization of cultures due to globalization. \n\nRitzer highlighted four primary components of McDonaldization:\n\n\nWith these four principles of the fast food industry, a strategy which is rational within a narrow scope can lead to outcomes that are harmful or irrational. As these processes spread to other parts of society, modern society’s new social and cultural characteristics are created. For example, as McDonald’s enters a country and consumer patterns are unified, cultural hybridization occurs.\n\nRitzer also outlines Irrationality of Rationality as a fifth aspect of McDonaldization. \n\"Most specifically, irrationality means that rational systems are unreasonable systems. By that I mean that they deny the basic humanity, the human reason, of the people who work within or are served by them.\" (Ritzer 1994:154)\n\nRitzer introduces this during Chapter Two (The Past, Present, and Future of McDonaldization: From the Iron Cage to the Fast-Food Factory and Beyond) of his book \"The McDonaldization of Society\" in the sub-section Irrationality and the \"Iron Cage.\" He states that \"Despite the advantages it offers, bureaucracy suffers from the irrationality of rationality. Like a fast-food restaurant, a bureaucracy can be a dehumanizing place in which to work and by which to be served.\" In short; \"settings in which people cannot always behave as human beings\".\n\nA further problem with the irrationality of rationality is that this can lead to inconsistencies; fast food is no longer fast, there are long lines and it is at the expense of taste.\n\nHe further states that beyond dehumanization further irrationalities emerge; including the inefficient masses of red tape, over quantification leading to low quality work, unpredictability as employees grow unclear about what they are supposed to do, or the loss of control due to other things.\n\nOrganizations have been making an effort to deny the rationalization of McDonaldization. Efforts are related to focusing on quality instead of quantity, enjoying the unpredictability of service and product and employing more skilled workers without any outside control.\nProtests have also been rising in nation-states in order to slow down the process of McDonaldization and to protect their localization and traditional value.\n\nAlso some local case studies show how the rational model of McDonald's adjust to local cultural preferences and the result is a diminution of the original McDonald's product. In fact, the more the company adjusts to local conditions the more appeal the scientific calculations of the specifically American product may be lost. At the end of the day, McDonald's is a contributing factor to globalization.\n\nJunk food news, defined here as inoffensive and trivial news served up in palatable portions, is an example of McDonaldization. Another example could be McUniversities, which features modularized curricula, delivering degrees in a fast-track pick-and-mix fashion to satisfy all tastes. The diminished quality of these products can only be disguised by extensive advertising which constantly repackages them to look new.\n\nIn penology, there has been a shift from punishments and treatment tailored to individual offenders, to attempting to control classes of offenders who are considered to be at high risk of recidivism through standardized penalties, such as those specified by three-strikes laws or sentencing guidelines. Offenders are classified by security level and sent to facilities deemed capable of adequately incapacitating prisoners in their risk category. Technology such as electronic surveillance, electronic monitoring, urinalysis, and computer-based offender tracking systems are often used in place of humans in the penal system.\n\nThe response from McDonald's, expressed by its representatives in the United Kingdom, is that Ritzer, like other commentators, uses the company's size and brand recognition to promote ideas that do not necessarily relate to the company's business practices.\n\nIt has been argued by a westerner that an example of the phenomenon of McDonaldization can be seen in education, where there is seen to be increasing similarity between that of Western classrooms and the rest of the world. Slater argues that the class size, layout and pedagogy in Peru closely resemble that of America, with clear examples of Western culture focused on efficiency of transfer of knowledge in other parts of the world. Furthermore, Slater goes on to demonstrate that the McDonaldization of education could have many negative side effects; particularly that it does not promote inquiry or creativity. Therefore, schools will become less effective at educating children as they will fail to develop creative thinkers.\n\nAccording to Wong, the influence of McDonaldization has also affected Higher Education classrooms.\n\n\n\n\nA study by Carroll on \"E-learning – the McDonaldization of education\" describes how e-learning has become one of the biggest phenomena of educational literature in recent years. Although the potential promise of e-learning is often expected within the process of learning, much of the emphasis is in fact on the electronic issues to facilitate learning, with little regard for its consequences on the learning process. Consequently, this often erodes the human factor in learning – making the learning process a more isolated experience. This article suggests that academics should become more cautions with their acceptance of facilitating learning through e-learning platforms without fully understanding the impact on students learning experiences. It also explores the changing role of students in discovering, questioning, and seeking knowledge to that of ‘consumers of pre-packed education.\n\nThe McDonaldization of Education is not only limited to physical classroom settings. It is predicted by George Ritzer that MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) will make future education even more McDonaldized. While it is possible to create a new original MOOC every semester, it is more likely a basic structure will be created and subsequently altered each time in order to make their creation more efficient. Over time as the interest and quality of MOOCs increases, the same pre recorded MOOCs may be used by many different universities, creating predictable content for MOOC students. Computer graded exams will be used more frequently than written essay exams to make it more efficient for the instructors. Yet since MOOCs limit the amount of contact between student and teacher, it will be difficult to engage the course on a deeper and more meaningful level. \n\n\n"}

It is now a peace garden dedicated to all the Muslim soldiers of the British Indian Army who died during both wars. The site measures about by and is located in the southeast corner of Horsell Common about off Monument Road. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nLarge numbers of men from the Indian subcontinent fought on the Western Front during World War I. Some of those who were injured were moved to hospitals on the English south coast including one at Brighton Pavilion. Of those, nineteen Muslims died and were buried here. The burial ground was created, at least in part, to counteract German propaganda that Muslim Indian soldiers were not being buried according to their religious rites. The site was on land compulsorily purchased from the Earl of Onslow and chosen for its proximity to the Shah Jahan Mosque, the first purpose-built mosque in the United Kingdom. A further five men who died during World War II were also buried here.\n\nIn the 1960s the site was becoming subject to vandalism so in 1968 the bodies were transferred to the Military Cemetery at Brookwood. However this also meant that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission ceased further maintenance of the site, which became overgrown and further vandalised. Ownership reverted to the Horsell Common Preservation Society, the owners of the surrounding common in succession to the Earl of Onslow. \n\nIn the 1990s work was undertaken to clear the vegetation and stabilised the walls, as a result of financial support from a local resident of Woking, the musician Paul Weller. In 2011, Woking Borough Council, working in conjunction with the Horsell Common Preservation Society, received a grant from English Heritage, which enabled the restoration of the walls and chatri. In November 2015, the empty interior of the burial ground was landscaped to create a Peace Memorial Garden, dedicated to all the Muslim soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in World War I and II.\n\nThe garden brings together the cultural expression of the traditional Islamic Garden with the natural elements of the Common. The original walls and chhatri of the burial ground were retained and now surround a reflecting pond fed by a rill and small waterfall from an upper pool. By this is a memorial stone engraved with the names of the original burials, which acts as the garden’s focus. Himalayan Birch trees planted around the pool also symbolise the servicemen who died.\n\nThe architect Jeremy Poll, of the Radley House Partnership, was responsible for the restoration of the walls and chatri, whilst Terra Firma Landscape Architects Ltd, were responsible for the design and implementation of the garden. \n\n"}
{"id": "17379285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17379285", "title": "National champions", "text": "National champions\n\nNational champion is a governmental policy in which large organizations are expected not only to seek profit but also to \"advance the interests of the nation\"; the government sets policies which favor these organizations. The policy is practiced by many governments, in some sectors more than others (such as defense), but by giving an unfair advantage against market competition, the policy promotes economic nationalism domestically and global pre-eminence abroad contrary to the free market. The policy also deters or prevents venture capitalism.\n\nAs the policy is the collective form of inequality of opportunity, it is irreconcilable with the paradigm liberal economy advocated by 18th century economist Adam Smith. It was a key plank of the Dirigiste policy of 1945-1975 France.\n\nUnder a National champion policy, governments expect one domestic corporation or an oligopoly of such corporations, typically in strategic sectors (whether private or state-sponsored) to seek profit and to \"advance the interests of the nation\". The policy is practised or acquiesced to by every country in certain sectors (typically national defence and security and the printing of banknotes and often in the philanthropic, performing or subsidizing research and development of new technologies and through those National Institutes which produce marketable innovations). By allowing corporations a real or perceived monopoly due to the amalgamation of enterprises and the active or supportive suppression of domestic and foreign-based market competition, the policy over time operates as a form of economic nationalism as it is contrary to the free market and enhanced innovation. Academics often cite post-World War II Gaullist \"dirigisme\" in France as the pinnacle of the national champion policy. Other examples include the creation of the British Steel Corporation by the United Kingdom which acquired the country's largest 14 domestic steel companies in 1967.\n\nThe risk involved with such policies is exemplified by the unsuccessful challenges to IBM’s period of dominance of the innovative computer market by UK’s ICL, France’s Bull, and Italy’s Olivetti during the 1970s. Successful and rewarding challenges however are shown to be possible in recent years, as exemplified by European aircraft champion Airbus, and Chinese train champion CRRC.\n\nAs the policy is a form of inequality of opportunity it is irreconcilable with the paradigm liberal economy advocated by 18th century economist Adam Smith.\n\nThe policy is evident variously in the 21st century: Russia is its maximal exponent among the world's G-20. Other examples are the merger of E.ON with Ruhrgas backed by the German government in 2000 or the merger of GDF with Suez backed by the French government in 2008.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has made \"national champions\" a central axis of his policy. \nThe concept was introduced by Putin in his 1997 dissertation \"Strategic Planning of the Reproduction of the Resource Bases\". Putin, in turn, may have gotten the idea from a textbook by University of Pittsburgh analysts William King and David Cleland. Putin later expanded on the subject in an article published in 1999 in the Journal of the St. Petersburg Mining Institute.\n\nCharles de Gaulle had also advocated similar ideas when he was the president of France in the 1950s.\n\nIn his dissertation, Putin wrote: \"The process of restructuring the national economy must have the goal of creating the most effective and competitive companies on both the domestic and world markets.\"\n\nPutin's 1999 article proposes that the state should closely regulate and develop the natural resources sector through creating companies with close links to the power vertical, making the firms big enough to compete with multinationals. These companies would become “national champions”, representing the state’s interest in international commerce. \n\nMost national champions are likely to be 50% or more owned by the Russian government, but there is no reason why predominantly private companies could not also serve as national champions, given the right guidance and pressure.\n\nInstead of allowing the country's oligarch-controlled corporations to focus exclusively on making profit, Putin proposed that they should be used instead to advance the country's national interests, suggesting that Russia should reclaim some of the assets that were privatized during Yeltsin, and integrate them vertically into industrial conglomerates so they could compete better with Western multinational corporations.\n\nOne example of the concept is that energy corporations such as Gazprom should keep the prices inside Russia low, as a form of subsidy for the public, and only strive for maximal profit in foreign countries.\n\n"}

He was later found hanging from a pedestrian footbridge. Officials found a suicide note and later ruled his death a suicide. His sacrifices were praised by several democracy activists.\n\nAt 6 am, Saturday 30 September 2006, Nuamthong drove his taxi, spray painted with the words \"[CDR is] destroying the country,\" and \"Sacrificing life\", into an M41 Walker Bulldog tank at Bangkok's Royal Plaza. Nuamthong was severely injured and taken to a police station nearby. \"I did it intentionally to protest the junta that has destroyed our country, and I painted all the words myself,\" noted Nuamthong to reporters from his bed at Vachira Hospital.\n\nNuamthong was charged with damaging state property. Authorities downplayed the incident, saying that Nuamthong was drunk and no messages were sprayed on the taxi. However, several newspapers reported on the legibility of the words painted on the car. Akkara Thiproj, deputy spokesperson for the military junta, expressed scepticism about Nuamthong's intentions in crashing into the tank, and claimed that \"Nobodies’ ideals are so great that they would sacrifice their lives for them.\"\nHe was released from the hospital on 12 October, and attended the 33rd anniversary of the 14 October 1973 democratic uprising.\n\nNuamgthong's body was found hanging, with a hood covering his face, from a footbridge on Vibhavadi Rangsit road near the headquarters of Thai Rath newspaper in Bangkok on 1 November 2006. Police ruled the death a suicide after forensic tests were stated to have shown no traces of a physical assault or struggle. Although Nuamthong's body was found with a suicide note, family members testified that he had given no hint of being depressed or about to commit suicide. Nuamthong wore a black T-shirt with a drawing of the Democracy Monument and a poem about the power of the masses. Newspaper clippings about his crash into the army tank were also found on his body. His wife, Boonchu, said he had given no farewells or done anything that would suggest he was planning to kill himself.\n\nHis wife noted, \"I couldn't be more sad losing the love of my life and the leader of my family. I didn't think he would be this brave, but I'm very proud of him for sacrificing for the country.\"\n\nFuneral rites were held at Wat Bua Kwan in Nonthaburi's Muang district. A score of senior police showed up at his funeral at Wat Bua Kwan in Nonthaburi to \"keep the peace\" while pro-democracy groups sent representatives and flower wreaths to honour his death.\n\nHis wife later attempted to transport his coffin to the 14 October 1973 Memorial on Ratchadamnoen road for bathing rituals. Police prevented her van from arriving at the Memorial.\n\nAbout 200 people attended the second night of Nuamthong's funeral at Wat Bua Kwan. Among them were military and police officers, politicians from the Thai Rak Thai Party and National Human Rights Commissioner Jaran Dithapichai. Sant Hathirat read a statement declaring Nuamthong a \"democracy martyr.\"\n\nHe was also praised by activist and former senator Prateep Ungsongtham Hata, who noted, \"Uncle Nuamthong has made the biggest sacrifice for democracy. I fought for democracy all my life but don't have the courage to do as much as he did.\"\n\nJunta deputy spokesperson Akara Tipparoj apologised for his earlier claim that nobody would hurt themselves for political ideals and claimed he planned to attend the funeral.\n\nThe Young People for Democracy Movement (YPD) condemned Akara's views as ignorant and noted that \"His remark is an insult, as Thailand has a long history of people dying to defend democracy from dictatorship.\"\n\nPrime Minister General Surayud Chulanont said he was saddened by the news but doubted there would be copycat suicide attempts.\n\nAfter his death, an interview Nuamthong had earlier given was partially aired by iTV. The broadcast came to an abrupt end after the Director of Army-owned Channel 5 called to give a warning. Additional troops were dispatched to keep order at the station.\n\n"}

Some financial commentators have noted that the terms of these loans were exceptionally favourable to the French and British banks which facilitated them, whereas others have noted that the terms reflected the imperial administration's willingness to constantly refinance its debts.\n\nThe Ottoman government declared a sovereign default on its loan repayments with the \"Ramazan Kararnamesi\" (Decree of Ramadan) on 30 October 1875. Six years later, as part of the \"Muharrem Kararnamesi\" (Decree of Muharrem) on 15 October 1881, which reduced the overall public debt, the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA) was established.

Breaches of the customary protection of parlimentaires were deemed perfidy.\n\nLater, these customs and protections were codified in international law.

It was during Barrow's occupancy of the post that it was renamed permanent secretary.\nPermanent secretaries are the accounting officers for departments, meaning that they are answerable to parliament for ensuring that the department spends money granted by parliament appropriately. Permanent secretaries are thus frequently called for questioning by the Public Accounts Committee and select committees of the House of Commons. The permanent secretary usually chairs a department's management board which consists of executive members (other civil servants in the department) and non-executive directors. In the 1960s the permanent secretary to Tony Benn when he was Secretary of State for Industry was Peter Carey. After Benn spent government money on worker cooperatives, notably a motorbike company (Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative), Carey went before the Public Accounts Committee and expressed the opinion that his minister's expenditure had been \"ultra vires\". Benn was soon moved to the Department of Energy, while Peter Carey received a knighthood in the following honours list.\n\nSome larger departments also have a second permanent secretary who acts as deputy. In the early 1970s, in a major reorganisation of Whitehall, many smaller ministries were amalgamated into larger departments. Following this reorganisation, virtually all departments had second permanent secretaries for a time, though this is no longer as common.\n\nThe most senior civil servant is the Cabinet Secretary, currently Sir Mark Sedwill; he is also the Head of the Home Civil Service. The holder of this office is distinct from other officials of permanent secretary rank within the Cabinet Office. By convention, the prime minister is Minister for the Civil Service and as such makes regulations regarding the service and has authority over it. These duties are delegated to the Minister for the Cabinet Office.\n\nPermanent secretaries are usually created a Knight or Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath after five or more years of service in the grade or on retirement if not already holding the title (although the Permanent Secretary of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will be created a Knight or Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George instead). The most senior permanent secretaries, such as the Secretary of the Cabinet, may be created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and even be given a life peerage after retirement. For salary comparison purposes, the permanent secretary is deemed broadly equivalent to a general and to a High Court judge.\nBelow are the individuals in UK government departments with the grade of permanent secretary or second permanent secretary, though not all use these titles.\nIn some countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, the popular term for the equivalent position is now “principal secretary”.\n\nIn Australia, the position is called the \"departmental secretary\", “secretary of the department”, or “director-general of the department” in some states and territories.\n\nIn Canada, the position is a \"deputy minister\", as the political head of a department/ministry is generally called a minister.\n\nIn India, the equivalent position is called secretary to the Government of India and is the highest ranking permanent civil servant in a department.\n\nIn Germany, the equivalent office is called \"staatssekretär\" (state secretary).\n\nIn Hong Kong, heads of policy bureaux, secretaries, were filled by civil servants until their titles were changed to permanent secretaries in 2002, when political appointees filled the positions of secretaries under the second Tung Chee Hwa government. Since August 2005, the Office of the Chief Executive also has a permanent secretary. His ranking is, however, lower than most other permanent secretaries according to the pay scale.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the position of \"secretary-general\" of a department is almost identical to that of a permanent secretary in the British civil service, with the exception that since the introduction in the mid-1990s of the \"Strategic Management Initiative\", the post is no longer permanent, but carries a seven-year time limit. This coincided with the introduction of the change of title from the previous title of “secretary”. Irish government departments may also have a “second secretary”, which is equivalent to the Second Permanent Secretary grade in the British civil service. See also Civil service of the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn Italy the highest civil service official in a ministry or department is either a \"segretario generale\" (secretary-general) or a \"direttore generale\" (director-general), while the position of \"sottosegretario di stato\" (under-secretary of state) is a political one and ranks below the \"ministro segretario di stato\" (minister-secretary of state, the head of a ministry or department) or the \"vice ministro\" (deputy-minister), both political posts as well.\n\nThe Japanese equivalence are the administrative vice-ministers.\n\nIn New Zealand, the civil service head of a ministry is ordinarily entitled “chief executive”, though there are still some positions which still carry the title of secretary (Secretary of Education, Secretary of Justice, Secretary of Transport). In some cases (such as the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, Ministry for Primary Industries, Department of Conservation, Ministry of Health) the title is “director-general”. Organisations with enforcement powers, such as the Inland Revenue Department and the New Zealand Police, are headed by commissioners. The New Zealand Customs Service is headed by the Comptroller of Customs. Civil service heads are officially employed by the State Services Commission, further separating them from the politicians who hold ministerial positions.\n\nIn Singapore, permanent secretaries have to retire after a 10-year term even if they are younger than the official retirement age of 62, starting in 2000 when the Public Service Leadership scheme was introduced. This is to provide opportunities for younger officers from the Administrative Service — the elite arm of the Civil Service — to rise up the ranks.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the post of permanent secretary is the civil service head of the ministry. Normally referred to as secretary, non civil service, political appointees are regularly appointed.\n\n\n"}

Quikscript replaces traditional English orthography, which uses the Latin alphabet, with completely new letters. It is phonemically regular, compact, and designed to be comfortably and quickly written. There are also Quikscript alphabets adapted for other languages, using the same letters for sounds which do not exist in English.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw, the writer, critic and playwright, was a highly vocal critic of English spelling because it lacked a coherent system for representing the phonemes of English accurately. As a result, for years he wrote his literary works using Pitman shorthand. However, he found its limitations frustrating as well and realized that it was not a suitable replacement for the Latin alphabet, being difficult to use to produce printed material and impossible to type. A shorthand is, by definition, more specialized than an alphabet, which represents the standard written form of a language. Shaw desired and advocated a phonetic reworking of written English, and this called for a new alphabet.\n\nTo that end, Shaw placed in his will provisions instructing his executor to organize a world-wide competition to design an improved English alphabet. A British designer, Ronald Kingsley Read, who had corresponded extensively with Shaw for several years regarding just such an alphabet, was selected along with three other finalists as the winners of the competition. Read was chosen to design the final form of the alphabet. The \"Shaw Alphabet\" or \"Shavian\", as it is now generally known, was the result.\n\nTo provide field testing of the new alphabet, Read organized a lengthy public testing phase of Shavian by some 500 users from around the world who spoke different dialects of English. Once he had analyzed the results of those tests, Read decided to revise Shavian to incorporate a number of changes to improve the alphabet and make it both easier and faster to write. He called the revised alphabet \"Quikscript\". In 1966 he published the Quikscript manual which set out the alphabet's rationale, and briefly discussed different possible methods of alphabet reform. The heart of the manual provided comprehensive instructions regarding the use of the alphabet along with reading samples.\n\nEach Quikscript letter represents one, and only one, English phoneme. There are 25 consonants and 15 vowels, totaling in all 40 letters. The letters are also designed to be written easily and each of them only requires a single (usually curved) stroke of pen.\n\n\nQuikscript computer fonts have been developed so that the alphabet can be used with computers and the Internet. There is also a computer program which will transliterate Latin alphabet text into Quikscript text.\n\nBook two of the popular \"Cole's Funny Picture Books\", published in Australia by E. W. Cole at the turn of the 20th century, was revised in 1979 to include an article introducing Quikscript under the name Second Shaw.\n\n"}

He is currently vice-chairman of the League of Social Democrats (LSD) and was one of the leaders in the 2014 Hong Kong protests.\n\nWong was born in Hong Kong in 1988. His father, Wong Yu-choi is a pro-Beijing rural politician, belonging to the Civil Force and holding the position of member of the Sha Tin Rural Committee and resident representative of the Ha Wo Che village in Sha Tin.\n\nRaphael was educated at the Shatin Pui Ying College and graduated from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University with a bachelor's degree in social science and the Chinese University of Hong Kong with a master's degree in social policy.\n\nWong first got interested in politics in the 2008 Legislative Council election, when pro-democracy League of Social Democrats (LSD) chairman Wong Yuk-man chanted \"DAB the most shameless\" in an election forum. He started listening to Wong's internet radio and joined the LSD despite his father's opposition. He participated in the 1 July demonstration in 2009 for the first time.\n\nIn the 2010 July 1 demonstration, he joined the sit-in at the Central Government Offices after the demonstration. On 1 July 2011, he was one of the protesters blocked the Connaught Road Central.\n\nOn 1 March 2011, Wong and another protestor Wong Chun-kit protested against Chief Executive Donald Tsang when Tsang was on his way to the Hong Kong Museum of History in Tsim Sha Tsui. Wong held a box of rice with fish in corn sauce and ran towards Tsang. They were charged of hitting Tsang but later was found innocent by the court.\n\nOn 29 June 2012 during Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit in Hong Kong, five LSD members including Wong protested at the North Lantau Highway where Hu's car passed by. They climbed over a metal fence, scrambling onto a slope to hold up two banners reading: \"Vindication of the June 4th crackdown\"; and \"Give me back [Li] Wangyang\". They were later charged and fined for improper use of an expressway.\n\nOn 11 June 2014, Wong was charged along with Scholarism convenor Joshua Wong, former secretary general of Hong Kong Federation of Students Nathan Law and People Power legislator Albert Chan for obstructing police officers when they burnt replicas of Beijing's white paper interpreting Hong Kong's one country, two systems principle during a protest outside the Liaison Office. They were later found not guilty.\n\nAs a veteran activist, Wong was one of the leaders during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, which often called as \"Umbrella Revolution\". He was deeply involved in the movement and was later arrested with Joshua Wong, the main leader of the protests and Chinese University's Student Union member Jason Szeto Tze-long on 25 November during the police clearance of the Mong Kok sit-in site.\n\nIn 2014, Wong became the vice-chairman of the LSD.\n\nIn 2011 and 2015, Wong ran in the District Council elections in his neighbourhood Lek Yuen but was both defeated. In the 2016 Legislative Council election, he will run in the New Territories West with incumbent legislator Albert Chan of the People Power standing in the second place of his ticket.\n"}

The term scare quote is sometimes also used to refer to scare-lines that are direct quotations, but more often refers today to use of dismissive quotation marks around a term to imply doubt, irony, or scorn. \n\nThe terms \"scare-line\" and \"scare-head\" derive from \"scare\" + \"headline\"; the longer name \"scare headline\" has sometimes been used. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" notes the use of the shorter expressions \"scare-line\" and \"scare-head\", the latter as early as 1888. The use of \"scare quote\" in the same sense dates back to at least 1946. The term \"scare line\" also refers to \"a means of directing fish towards the main, holding part of a net by frightening the fish into movement\", but the term is not well known outside of commercial fishing (and bird hunting, where a similar technique is used to flush birds into flight), so an influence on the journalism term is dubious despite a conceptual similarity. \n\nScare-lining increases newspaper sales predictably, and this has been known for several generations. Upton Sinclair wrote in \"The Brass Check: A Study of American Journalism\" (1928): \"I knew for instance, sitting at my desk, just how many extra papers I could sell with a scare-line on a police scandal.\" The practice has also been criticized as manipulative and of questionable journalistic integrity since the same era.\n\nWomen's magazines, especially from the early 1990s onward, have published an increasing number of \"scare stories\" about health, most often using alarming headlines and \"billboard\" text that are not quotations. For example, \"Glamour\" magazine in the year 1990 had no health cover stories, but in 2002 had at least one scare-line in almost every issue, e.g. \"It's Common, It Can Kill: Why Aren't Doctors Telling Us about This Women-only Disease?\" (from the April 2002 issue). Myrna Blyth, a feminist, media critic, and former editor-in-chief of \"Ladies' Home Journal\", characterizes the trend as the selling of unhappiness and fear about health. Her 2007 book \"Spin Sisters\" observes the following, based on one-year, three-year, and ten-year studies of articles in women's magazines:\n\nShe concludes that women acting as the effective gatekeepers of family health is why they have been increasingly targeted by this sort of writing and marketing, often based on \"confusing, junk-science statistics\" and the replacement of rigorous reporting with personal opinion and vague, exaggeratory implications with a lot of \"wiggle room\". Such articles also appear to be the leading source of unreasonable fears about vaccines (e.g., the debunked but persistent idea that childhood vaccination causes autism). Blyth concedes that her own former publication also ran such scare-lines, such as \"Dangerous Medicine: When Cures Harm Instead of Heal\", and \"Foods that Can Kill\".\n"}

It was disbanded in 2010 after it was ruled to be operating fraudulently.\n\nFounded in 1985 by Stephen Riley, who ran the organization from his apartment in the Bronx, UHO solicited money at sidewalk tables at various locations in Manhattan. Soliciters paid UHO $15 per shift (with 3 to 4 shifts per day) to rent a table and collection jug; any remaining funds raised they could keep for themselves. According to UHO, more than three-quarters of its soliciters are homeless, and all have been homeless at one time.\n\nIn November 2009, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court against the group, charging that the founders kept most of the change collected. The suit charged that Riley and director Myra Walker used the money to buy items for their personal use, and to pay bills unrelated to UHO.\n\nOn June 24, 2010, Judge Barbara R. Kapnick ruled that UHO be permanently shut down and further banned Riley and Walker from ever engaging in non-profit work again.\n\n"}

Korten examines the evolution of corporations in the United States and argues that \"corporate libertarians\" have 'twisted' the ideas of Adam Smith's view of the role of private companies.\n\nKorten critiques current methods of economic development led by the Bretton Woods institutions and asserts his desire to rebalance the power of multinational corporations with concern for environmental sustainability and what he terms “people-centered development”. He advocates a 50% tax on advertising.\n\nKorten criticises consumerism, market deregulation, free trade, privatization and what he sees as the global consolidation of corporate power. Above all he rejects any focus on money as the purpose of economic life. His prescriptions include excluding corporations from political participation, increased state and global control of international corporations and finance, rendering financial speculation unprofitable and creating local economies that rely on local resources, rather than international trade.\n\nIn a review of the book in \"Left Business Observer\" #71 in January 1996, Doug Henwood observed that Korten \"offers a vision of 'a market economy composed primarily, though not exclusively, of family enterprises, small-scale co-ops, worker-owned firms, and neighborhood and municipal corporations.' Much of this is desirable. But it would be impossible to run a complex economy on this scale only; it's easy to imagine furniture being made this way, but not trains and computers. If Korten means to do away with trains and computers, he should tell us.\" \n"}
