{"id": "268409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268409", "title": "Barbary Wars", "text": "Barbary Wars\n\nThe Barbary Wars were a series of conflicts that culminated in two wars fought at different times over the same reasons between the United States, Sweden, and the Barbary states (the \"de jure\" possessions of the Ottoman Empire, but \"de facto\" independent, Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli) of North Africa in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Swedes had been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800; they were eventually joined by the Americans. \n\nAt issue was the Barbary pirates' demand for tribute from American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea. If ships of a given country failed to pay, pirates would attack the ship and take their goods, and often enslave crew members or hold them for ransom. \n\nWhen Thomas Jefferson became President of the United States in March 1801, he refused to pay tribute and sent a United States Naval fleet to the Mediterranean; the fleet bombarded various fortified pirate cities in present-day Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria, ultimately extracting concessions of fair passage from their rulers. James Madison, Jefferson's successor, directed military forces for the second war in 1815, shortly after the conclusion of the War of 1812 against the British.\n\nThe Barbary corsairs, sometimes called Ottoman corsairs or Berber pirates, were pirates and privateers who operated from North Africa, based primarily in the ports of Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers. This area was known in Europe as the Barbary Coast, a term derived from the name of its Berber inhabitants. Their predation extended throughout the Mediterranean, south along West Africa's Atlantic seaboard and even to the eastern coast of South America with Brazil, and into the North Atlantic Ocean as far north as Iceland, but they primarily operated in the western Mediterranean. In addition to seizing ships, they engaged in \"razzias\", raids on European coastal towns and villages, mainly in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, but also in England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Ireland, and as far away as Iceland. The main purpose of their attacks was to capture European slaves for the Arab slave market in North Africa.\n\nSince the 1600s, the Barbary pirates had attacked British shipping along the North Coast of Africa, holding captives for ransom or enslaving them. Ransoms were generally raised by families and local church groups. The British became familiar with captivity narratives written by Barbary pirates' prisoners and slaves.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the pirates attacked American ships. On December 20, 1777, Morocco's sultan Mohammed III declared that merchant ships of the new American nation would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage into the Mediterranean and along the coast. The Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship stands as America's oldest unbroken friendship treaty with a foreign power. In 1787, Morocco became one of the first nations to recognize the United States of America.\n\nStarting in the 1780s, realizing that American vessels were no longer under the protection of the British navy, the Barbary pirates had started seizing American ships in the Mediterranean. As the U.S. had disbanded its Continental Navy and had no seagoing military force, its government agreed in 1786 to pay tribute to stop the attacks. On March 20, 1794, at the urging of President George Washington, the United States Congress voted to authorize the building of six heavy frigates and establish the United States Navy, in order to stop these attacks and demands for more and more money. The United States had signed treaties with all of the Barbary states after its independence was recognized between 1786-1794 to pay tribute in exchange for leaving American merchantmen alone, and by 1797, the United States had paid out $1.25 million or a fifth of the government's annual budget then in tribute. These demands for tribute had imposed a heavy financial drain and by 1799 the U.S. was in arrears of $140,000 to Algiers and some $150,000 to Tripoli. Many Americans resented these payments, arguing that the money would be better spent on a navy that would protect American ships from the attacks of the Barbary pirates, and in the 1800 Presidential Election, Thomas Jefferson won in part against incumbent second President John Adams, in part by noting that the United States was \"subjected to the spoliations of foreign cruisers\" and was humiliated by paying \"an enormous tribute to the petty tyrant of Algiers\".\n\nThe First Barbary War (1801–1805), also known as the Tripolitian War or the Barbary Coast War, was the first of two wars fought between the alliance of the United States and several European countries against the Northwest African Berber Muslim states known collectively as the Barbary states. These were Tripoli and Algiers, which were quasi-independent entities nominally belonging to the Ottoman Empire, and (briefly) the independent Sultanate of Morocco. This war began during Thomas Jefferson's term when he refused to pay tribute, an amount that was greatly increased when he became president. A U.S. naval fleet was sent on May 13, 1801, at the beginning of the war under the command of Commodore Richard Dale. Other notable officers in the fleet included Stephen Decatur, assigned to the frigate and William Bainbridge in command of \"Essex\" which was attached to Commodore Richard Dale's squadron which also included , and .\n\nDuring this war, the ship \"Philadelphia\" was blockading Tripoli's harbor when she ran aground on an uncharted reef. Under fire from shore batteries and Tripolitan gunboats, the Captain, William Bainbridge, tried to refloat her by casting off all of her guns and other objects that weighed it down. The ship was eventually captured and the crew taken prisoners and put into slavery. To prevent this powerful war ship from being used by the Barbary pirates the ship was later destroyed by a raiding party led by Stephen Decatur.\n\nThe Second Barbary War (1815), also known as the Algerine or Algerian War, was the second of two wars fought between the United States and the Ottoman Empire's North African regencies of Tripoli, Tunis and Algeria, known collectively as the Barbary states. The war between the Barbary States and the U.S. ended in 1815; the international dispute would effectively be ended the following year by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The war brought an end to the American practice of paying tribute to the pirate states and helped mark the beginning of the end of piracy in that region, which had been rampant in the days of Ottoman domination (16th–18th centuries). Within decades, European powers built ever more sophisticated and expensive ships which the Barbary pirates could not match in numbers or technology.\n\nWhen the United States military efforts of the early 19th century were successful against the pirates, partisans of the Democratic-Republicans contrasted their presidents' refusals to buy off the pirates by paying tribute with the failure of the preceding Federalist administration to suppress the piracy. The Federalist Party had adopted the slogan, \"Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute,\" but had failed to end the attacks on merchant ships. From 1796–1797 French raiders seized some 316 American merchant ships flying American colors. To counter this ongoing advent three frigates, , and , were soon built to answer the call for security.\n\nIn the 21st century, the United States again conducted military operation in the North African area, specifically participating in the intervention against the government of Libya, and this operation has sometimes been termed in the media as the continuation of the previous Barbary Wars and given the name \"Third Barbary War\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Similar to the Red Mass, the service honors those who have died in the line of duty and those currently serving as first responders. The Mass is an opportunity for the community to show gratitude to first responders and their families.\n\nIn Washington, D.C. the service is held in conjunction with National Police Week. Psalm 91:11, \"For He will give His angels [especial] charge over you to accompany and defend and preserve you in all your ways [of obedience and service],\" are often invoked during the service.

{"id": "34816991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34816991", "title": "Border Force", "text": "Border Force\n\nBorder Force is a part of the Home Office, responsible for frontline border control operations at air, sea and rail ports in the United Kingdom. The force was part of the now defunct UK Border Agency from its establishment in 2008 until Home Secretary Theresa May demerged it in March 2012 after severe criticism of the senior management.\n\nSince 1 March 2012, Border Force has been a law-enforcement command within the Home Office, accountable directly to ministers. Border Force is responsible for immigration and customs at 140 rail, air and sea ports in the UK and western Europe, as well as thousands of smaller airstrips, ports and marinas. The work of the Border Force is monitored by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration.\n\nBorder Force officers are not police constables and the Border Force is not a police force. However, aside from powers listed below in relation to immigration and customs, section 2 of the Borders Act 2007 does allow designated members of the Border Force to detain anyone for any criminal offence or arrest warrant at a port if the Border Officer thinks they would be liable to arrest by a police constable. The power allows detention for 3 hours pending the arrival of a police constable. The power also applies to points of entry in Belgium and France where Border Officers work whereby the Border Officer will turn the detained person over to French or Belgian police officers as appropriate. \n\nBorder Force was born out of a confusing decade for the UK immigration and customs after several attempts of reform and re-structure. Prior to 2007 three agencies were responsible for border control in the UK, HMRC (HMCE till 2005) dealt with customs, Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) dealt with all immigration roles within the UK and at the border, and UKVisas issued visas both from the UK and its offices abroad. As early as 2003 a single \"border police force\" had been proposed. In 2005 HMCE and Inland revenue merged to form HMRC. HMRC were still response for customs control at the border until 2008. Throughout 2006 and 2007 there were suggestions for a merged border control department.\n\nInitially this plan was to turn the Immigration and Nationality Directorate into a uniformed body of Immigration officers at the border, the Border and Immigration Agency. The BIA was created on 1 April 2007 and short lived. It was replaced only a year later on 1 April 2008 by the UK Border Agency. The UK Border agency was a merger of the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA), UKvisas and the port customs functions of HM Revenue and Customs. It created one of the largest law enforcement bodies in the UK.\n\nUKBA had a chequered history. There were difficulties with the management of student visas under Tier 4 of the Points-Based System. The assessment of the Independent Chief Inspector, carried out between July and August 2010, found that there was an inconsistent response towards applications, with some cases given extra time to prepare and others dismissed for minor reasons.\n\nIn November 2011, the Home Affairs Select Committee issued a report that found that 124,000 deportation cases had been shelved by the UKBA. The report said the cases had been dumped in a \"controlled archive\", a term used to try to hide the fact from authorities and auditors that it was a list of lost applicants.\n\nFollowing allegations that staff were told to relax some identity checks, in November 2011 the UK Home Office suspended Brodie Clark, the Head of the UK Border Agency; Carole Upshall, director of the Border Agency South and European Operation; Graham Kyle, director of operations at Heathrow Airport. The Home Office investigated allegations that Clark had agreed to \"open up the borders\" at certain times in ways ministers would \"not have agreed with\". It is alleged that between July and the end of October 2011, queues at passport control were \"managed\" so as not to annoy holiday makers. The BBC reported that staff may have been told not to scan biometric passports at certain times. A biometric passport contains a digital image of the holder's face, which can be used to compare with the printed version and check the passport has not been forged. It is also believed that \"warning index checks\" at Heathrow and Calais were also suspended, which would have applied strict security checks against official watchlists of terrorists, criminals, and deported illegal immigrants.\n\nAfter Clark refused the offer to take early retirement, he was suspended and the investigation began. A two-week inquiry led by former Metropolitan Police detective Dave Wood, head of the agency's enforcement and crime group at the time, sought to discover to what extent checks were scaled down, and what the security implications might have been. A second investigation, led by former MI6 official Mike Anderson, the Director General of the Home Office's strategy, immigration and international group, sought to investigate wider issues relating to the performance of UKBA regarding racism. The issues relating to lost documents and case files was still going on at the same time, along with a backlog of cases. \n\nIt was then announced on 5 November by Theresa May that an independent inquiry would also be undertaken, led by the Chief Inspector of the UK Border Agency, John Vine. Following all these combined failings, UK Border Force became a separate organisation on 1 March 2012.\n\nThe first Director General of Border Force was the former Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police Brian Moore, who was appointed on secondment on an interim basis to last until 31 August 2012 and was expected to apply for the position permanently, despite criticism of his management of passport queues. On 10 July 2012, Immigration Minister Damian Green confirmed that Moore had not applied for the post, despite Moore earlier telling the Home Affairs Select Committee that he would be applying.\n\nTony Smith was appointed as interim Director General of Border Force on 19 September 2012. Smith was previously Gold Commander for the London 2012 Olympic Programme and Regional Director for London and the South East in the UK Border Agency. and has spent forty years in border control and enforcement work.\n\nVice-Admiral Sir Charles Montgomery was named as the new Director General on 25 January 2013. In June 2017 Montgomery left Border Force and Paul Lincoln a civil servant from the MOD and Home office appointed as the new Director General. Neither of the two had any previous experience of immigration or customs.\n\nThe stated responsibilities of the Home Office's Border Force are the following: \n\nBorder Force is responsible for immigration and customs at 140 rail, air and sea ports in the UK and western Europe, as well as thousands of smaller airstrips, ports and marinas.\n\nStaff hold a mixture of powers granted to them by their status as immigration officers and designated customs officials.\n\nImmigration officers have powers of arrest and detention conferred on them by the Immigration Act 1971 and subsequent Immigration Acts, when both at ports and inland. In practice, non-arrest trained Border Force immigration officers exercise powers under Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971, while inland immigration officers work under S28A-H of the Immigration Act 1971 and paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 of the same Act, as do arrest-trained Border Force immigration officers at the frontier.\n\nHistorically, port and inland immigration officers received different training to reflect these different approaches to immigration enforcement, which is now reinforced by inland officers working for Immigration Enforcement, a separate Home Office Command.\n\n\"Designated Immigration Officers\" are Border Force immigration officers who have been designated with additional detention powers, under Sections 1 to 4 of the UK Borders Act 2007, where a person at a port or airport is suspected of being liable to arrest by a police officer for non-border offences.\n\nBorder Force officers, designated as customs officials under the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, have wide-ranging powers of entry, search, seizure and arrest. They hold the same customs and excise powers as officers of HM Revenue and Customs, but cannot use HMRC powers for non-border matters, such as Income Tax and VAT. Amongst their powers is the ability to arrest anyone who has committed, or whom the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect has committed, any offence under the Customs and Excise Acts. They may also seize prohibited and restricted goods, such as controlled drugs and firearms, as well as ensuring that imported goods bear the correct taxes and duties.\n\nThe Border Force Officer training pathway consists of three standalone\nprogrammes aligned to professional frameworks including\nthe Operational Delivery Framework, Civil Service Competency\nFramework and European Sectoral Qualifications Framework.\n\nCore Skills 1 programme is a three part programme designed to\ntest both skills and knowledge of the immigration function at the Primary\nControl Point (PCP), as well as some customs functions. The three parts\ninclude pre course online learning, classroom learning and mentoring.\n\nThe classroom element is a three week programme combining assessment,\nrole-play, live and theoretical tests. This is then followed by a period of\nconsolidated learning (mentoring) in an operational environment, which\ncan take up to 4 weeks. Once all three strands of the programme have\nbeen completed and all the necessary tests and assessments have been\npassed, this will give successful officers the power to act under the Immigration Act.\n\nFollowing this initial phase your training will include:\n• ongoing on-the-job mentoring\n• Some specialist training as well as the Core Skills 3 programme, which includes\nfurther classroom training normally undertaken within 12 months.\n\nCore Skills 2 is the customs course. This consists of a 5 week course plus about 5 weeks of mentoring. \n\nCore Skills 3 which is the investigation/casework immigration course. This consists of 15 day course plus 3/4 weeks of mentoring.\n\nIn addition there is Personal safety training (PST) (self defence/restraint/handcuffing/baton training).\n\nBorder Force has five operational regions: Central; Heathrow; North; South; and South East & Europe. The regions have responsibility for securing the border 24 hours a day, 365 days a year at the UK’s ports, airports, postal depots and rail. This includes the Eurostar from Brussels and Paris to St Pancras International and the Eurotunnel from Coquelles to Folkestone.\n\nThe regions’ varied work includes stopping 100 per cent of passengers arriving at ports or airports for immigration controls. Officers also conduct risk-led interceptions for controlled drugs, cash, tobacco, alcohol, firearms, offensive weapons, prohibited goods, counterfeit goods and clandestine entrants. They do this at passenger and freight controls, covering passengers travelling on foot, by car, coaches, freight vehicles, as well as air freight and sea containers.\n\nImmigration control within the United Kingdom is managed within a wider Common Travel Area (CTA). The CTA is an intergovernmental agreement that allows freedom of movement within an area that encompasses the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands (Guernsey, Jersey, Sark and Alderney) and the Republic of Ireland. Authorised entry to any of the above essentially allows entry to all the others but it is the responsibility of the person entering to ensure that they are properly documented for entry to other parts of the CTA. Despite the CTA it is still possible to be deported from the UK to the Republic of Ireland and vice versa.\n\nEntry to the UK via the Channel Tunnel from France or Belgium or by ferry through selected ports in north-east France is controlled by juxtaposed immigration controls in Britain, France, and Belgium, i.e. travellers clear UK passport control in France or Belgium and those travelling to France or Belgium clear French controls while in the UK. Belgium does not maintain controls in the UK as the first Schengen country entered is France. UK Border Force checkpoints in France are operated at Gare de Calais-Fréthun, Gare de Lille Europe, Channel Tunnel, Calais ferry terminal, Dunkirk ferry terminal and Gare du Nord station, Paris. For passengers arriving by the Eurostar train from Marne-la Vallée Chessy, UK border control takes place at the arrival stations in the UK. A checkpoint operated at Boulogne-sur-Mer until the port closed in August 2010. United States border preclearance is an equivalent system operated by that country's equivalent to the UKBF at some airports outside the US.\n\nBorder Force officers wear a uniform with rank insignia. Border Force uniform is navy blue and, currently, modelled on the Metropolitan Police uniform. Border Force officers can make use of body armour and carry handcuffs, as well as extendable batons. Limb restraints are also in circulation. Officers also carry Tetra radios on the secure Airwave network, often with earpieces, to communicate with other officers. In addition, officers may also carry other useful police equipment, such as torches. Torches currently issued, depending on location and job role, include Lenser LED P7.2 and Maglite LED 2D & 3D Cell.\n\nSpecialist forgery detection equipment is available at ports and airports to identify false passports and identity documents. Customs officials make use of a variety of specialised tools and equipment when searching cars, lorries, aircraft, container ships and other items crossing the border.\n\nUniformed Border Force officers have their rank displayed on shoulder epaulettes, attached to their shirt, jumper or jacket. Warranted officers below Senior Officer rank may also have their identification number displayed. The rank and epaulette styling is in line with many other border agencies and shares close similarities with its Australian counterpart, the Australian Border Force.\n\nAll vessels of the Border Force bear the ship prefix \"HMC\"—Her Majesty's Cutter. Between May and October 2015 two of the vessels, HMC \"Protector\" and HMC \"Seeker\", were deployed in the Mediterranean conducting search and rescue operations. The Border Force also has a recently chartered vessel named MV \"VOS Grace\".\n\nMore Vessels are to be commissioned in 2017.\n\n\n"}

Fascism views a nation led by standard bourgeois culture as being associated with unfit sedentary lifestyle, individualism, plutocracy, and economic exploitation of proletarian people and proletarian nations, that fascism views as inconsistent with virile nationhood.\n\nBenito Mussolini denounced bourgeois nations for being based on the plutocratic rule of the rich and for engaging in oppressive economic exploitation of proletarian nations such as Italy, and in particular negatively referred to Britain as \"the fattest and most bourgeois nation in the world\". Mussolini described bourgeois nations as seeking to assert hegemony over the ability to pursue imperialism while hypocritically denying proletarian nations from being allowed to pursue imperialism. Mussolini described such plutocratic bourgeois nations as seeking to dominate the world economy at the expense of proletarian nations. From 1937 to 1939, Mussolini openly encouraged Italians to foster an anti-bourgeois attitude by having Italians send in anti-bourgeois cartoons to be published in newspapers, and by denouncing \"social games, five o'clock tea, vacations, compassion for Jews, preference for armchairs, desire for compromise, desire for money\" as indulgent bourgeois practices. In 1938, Mussolini escalated a public relations campaign against Italy's bourgeoisie, accusing them of preferring private gain to national victory.\n\nGermany's Nazis also rejected the bourgeois culture of states associated with materialistic consumption, profiteering, and exploitative plutocracy. Adolf Hitler was personally disgusted with the ruling bourgeois elites of Germany during the period of the Weimar Republic that he obscenely referred to as \"cowardly shits\".\n\nFascism's conception of the bourgeois nation was influenced by the political and economic theories of Vilfredo Pareto, who criticized capitalism for causing moral disintegration of societies that deteriorates the political order of societies. Pareto's criticism of capitalism was focused on its moral aspects, but Pareto did not criticize capitalism for economic inequality. Pareto argued that as wealth increases, idealism decreases, causing both money and individuals to soften in strength. Pareto claimed that the only means to rectify this weakening of strength was violence, war, or revolution.\n\n"}

More specifically, chronemics involves the study of both subjective and objective human tempos as they influence and are interdependent with human behavior. Further, chronemics involves the study of human communication as it relates to interdependent and integrated levels of time-experiencing. Previously, these interdependent and integrated levels have been outlined and discussed as: biological time; psychological time; social time; and cultural time. A number of classification systems exist in the literature of time. However, such systems are not applied to human interaction directly.\n\nChronemics can be defined as \"the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of time\" – the way in which one perceives and values time, structures time, and reacts to time frames communication. Time perception plays a large role in the nonverbal communication process. Time perceptions include punctuality, willingness to wait, and interactions. The use of time can affect lifestyle, daily agendas, speed of speech, movements, and how long people are willing to listen.\n\nTime can be used as an indicator of status. For example, in most companies the boss can interrupt progress to hold an impromptu meeting in the middle of the work day, yet the average worker would have to make an appointment to see the boss. The way in which different cultures perceive time can influence communication as well.\n\nCultures are sometimes considered monochronic or polychronic.\n\nA monochronic time system means that things are done one at a time and time is segmented into precise, small units. Under this system, time is scheduled, arranged and managed.\n\nThe United States considers itself a monochronic society. This perception came about during the Industrial Revolution, when \"factory life required the labor force to be on hand and in place at an appointed hour\" (Guerrero, DeVito & Hecht, 1999, p. 238). Many Americans like to think that to them, time is a precious resource not to be wasted or taken lightly. \"We buy time, save time, spend time and make time. Our time can be broken down into years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds and even milliseconds. We use time to structure both our daily lives and events that we are planning for the future. We have schedules that we must follow: appointments that we must go to at a certain time, classes that start and end at certain times, work schedules that start and end at certain times, and even our favorite TV shows, that start and end at a certain time.\"\n\nAs communication scholar Edward T. Hall wrote regarding the American's viewpoint of time in the business world, \"the schedule is sacred.\" Hall says that for monochronic cultures, such as the American culture, \"time is tangible\" and viewed as a commodity where \"time is money\" or \"time is wasted.\" The result of this perspective is that monochronic cultures, place a paramount value on schedules, tasks and \"getting the job done.\" These cultures are committed to regimented schedules and may view those who do not subscribe to the same perception of time as disrespectful, inefficient or unreliable.\n\nA polychronic time system is a system where several things can be done at once, and wider view of time is exhibited and time is perceived in large fluid sections. Examples of polychronic behaviors include: typing while answering telephones or taking notes while sitting participating in meetings. Polychronicity is in contrast to those who prefer monochronicity (doing one thing at a time).\n\nPolychronic cultures are much less focused on the preciseness of accounting for each and every moment. As Raymond Cohen notes, polychronic cultures are more focused on tradition and relationships rather than on tasks—a clear difference from their monochronic counterparts. Cohen notes that \"Traditional societies have all the time in the world. The arbitrary divisions of the clock face have little saliency in cultures grounded in the cycle of the seasons, the invariant pattern of rural life, community life, and the calendar of religious festivities\" (Cohen, 1997, p. 34).\n\nPolychronic culture is more focused on relationships, rather than watching the clock. Polychronic societies have no problem being \"late\" for an appointment if they are deeply focused on some work or in a meeting that ran past schedule, because the concept of time is fluid and can easily expand or contract as need be. As a result, polychronic cultures have a much less formal perception of time. They are not ruled by precise calendars and schedules. Rather, \"cultures that use the polychronic time system often schedule multiple appointments simultaneously so keeping on schedule is an impossibility.\"\n\nResearchers have developed the following questionnaires to measure polychronicity:\n\n\nConflicting attitudes between the monochronic and polychronic perceptions of time can interfere with cross-cultural relations, and similar challenges can occur within an otherwise assimilated culture. One example in the United States is the Hawaiian culture, which employs two time systems: Haole time and Hawaiian time.\n\n\"When you hear someone say, 'See you at two o'clock haole time,' they mean they will just that. Haole time is when the person will meet when they say they will meet. But if you were to hear someone say, 'I'll be there at two o'clock Hawaiian time,' then something different is implied. Hawaiian time is very lax and it basically means 'when you get there.'\" —Nick Lewis\n\nThe way an individual perceives time and the role time plays in their lives is a learned perspective. As discussed by Alexander Gonzalez and Phillip Zimbardo, \"every child learns a time perspective that is appropriate to the values and needs of his society\" (Guerrero, DeVito & Hecht, 1999, p. 227).\n\nThere are four basic psychological time orientations:\n\nEach orientation affects the structure, content, and urgency of communication (Burgoon, 1989). The past orientation has a hard time developing the notion of elapsed time and these individuals often confuse present and past happenings as all in the same. People oriented with time-line cognitivity are often detail oriented and think of everything in linear terms. These individuals also often have difficulty with comprehending multiple events at the same time. Individuals with a present orientation are mostly characterized as pleasure seekers who live for the moment and have a very low risk aversion. Those individuals who operate with future orientation are often thought of as being highly goal oriented and focused on the broad picture.\n\nThe use of time as a communicative channel can be a powerful, yet subtle, force in face-to-face \"interactions\". Some of the more recognizable types of interaction that use time are:\n\n\nTime orientation has also revealed insights into how people react to advertising. Martin, Gnoth and Strong (2009) found that future-oriented consumers react most favorably to ads that feature a product to be released in the distant future and that highlight primary product attributes. In contrast, present-oriented consumers prefer near-future ads that highlight secondary product attributes. Consumer attitudes were mediated by the perceived usefulness of the attribute information.\n\nJust as monochronic and polychronic cultures have different time perspectives, understanding the time orientation of a culture is critical to becoming better able to successfully handle diplomatic situations. Americans think they have, a future orientation. Hall indicates that for Americans \"tomorrow is more important\" and that they \"are oriented almost entirely toward the future\" (Cohen, 2004, p. 35). The future-focused orientation attributes to at least some of the concern that Americans have with \"addressing immediate issues and moving on to new challenges\" (Cohen, 2004, p. 35).\n\nOn the other hand, many polychronic cultures have a past-orientation toward time.\n\nThese time perspectives are the seeds for communication clashes in diplomatic situations. Trade negotiators have observed that \"American negotiators are generally more anxious for agreement because \"they are always in a hurry\" and basically \"problem solving oriented.\" In other words, they place a high value on resolving an issue quickly calling to mind the American catchphrase \"some solution is better than no solution\" (Cohen, 2004, p. 114). Similar observations have been made of Japanese-American relations. Noting the difference in time perceptions between the two countries, former ambassador to Tokyo, Mike Mansfield commented \"We're too fast, they're too slow\" (Cohen, 2004, p. 118).\n\nDifferent perceptions of time across cultures can influence global communication. When writing about time perspective, Gonzalez and Zimbardo comment that \"There is no more powerful, pervasive influence on how individuals think and cultures interact than our different perspectives on time—the way we learn how we mentally partition time into past, present and future.\" (Guerrero, DeVito & Hecht, 1999, p. 227)\n\nDepending upon where an individual is from, their perception of time might be that \"the clock rules the day\" or that \"we'll get there when we get there.\"\nImproving prospects for success in the global community requires understanding cultural differences, traditions and communication styles.\n\nThe monochronic-oriented approach to negotiations is direct, linear and rooted in the characteristics that illustrate low context tendencies. The low context culture approaches diplomacy in a lawyerly, dispassionate fashion with a clear idea of acceptable outcomes and a plan for reaching them. Draft arguments would be prepared elaborating positions. A monochronic culture, more concerned with time, deadlines and schedules, tends to grow impatient and want to rush to \"close the deal.\"\n\nMore polychronic-oriented cultures come to diplomatic situations with no particular importance placed on time. Chronemics is one of the channels of nonverbal communication preferred by a High context Polychronic negotiator over verbal communication.The polychronic approach to negotiations will emphasis building trust between participants, forming coalitions and finding consensus. High context Polychronic negotiators might be charged with emotion toward a subject thereby obscuring an otherwise obvious solution.\n\nTime has a definite relationship to power. Though power most often refers to the ability to influence people (Guerrero, DeVito & Hecht, 1999, p. 314), power is also related to dominance and status (Guerrero, DeVito & Hecht, 1999, p. 315).\n\nFor example, in the workplace, those in a leadership or management position treat time and – by virtue of position – have their time treated differently from those who are of a lower stature position. Anderson and Bowman have identified three specific examples of how chronemics and power converge in the workplace – waiting time, talk time and work time.\n\nResearchers Insel and Lindgren (Guerrero, DeVito & Hecht, 1999, p. 325) write that the act of making an individual of a lower stature wait is a sign of dominance. They note that one who \"is in the position to cause another to wait has power over him. To be kept waiting is to imply that one's time is less valuable than that of the one who imposes the wait.\"\n\nThere is a direct correlation between the power of an individual in an organization and conversation. This includes both length of conversation, turn-taking and who initiates and ends a conversation. Extensive research indicates that those with more power in an organization will speak more often and for a greater length of time. Meetings between superiors and subordinates provide an opportunity to illustrate this concept. A superior – regardless of whether or not they are running the actual meeting – lead discussions, ask questions and have the ability to speak for longer periods of time without interruption. Likewise, research shows that turn-taking is also influenced by power. Social psychologist Nancy Henley notes that \"Subordinates are expected to yield to superiors and there is a cultural expectation that a subordinate will not interrupt a superior\" (Guerrero, DeVito & Hecht, 1999, p. 326). The length of response follows the same pattern. While the superior can speak for as long as they want, the responses of the subordinate are shorter in length. Albert Mehrabian noted that deviation from this pattern led to negative perceptions of the subordinate by the superior. Beginning and ending a communication interaction in the workplace is also controlled by the higher-status individual in an organization. The time and duration of the conversation are dictated by the higher-status individual.\n\nThe time of high status individuals is perceived as valuable, and they control their own time. On the other hand, a subordinate with less power has their time controlled by a higher status individual and are in less control of their time – making them likely to report their time to a higher authority. Such practices are more associated with those in non-supervisory roles or in blue collar rather than white collar professions. Instead, as power and status in an organization increases, the flexibility of the work schedule also increases. For instance, while administrative professionals might keep a 9 to 5 work schedule, their superiors may keep less structured hours. This does not mean that the superior works less. They may work longer, but the structure of their work environment is not strictly dictated by the traditional work day. Instead, as Koehler and their associates note \"individuals who spend more time, especially spare time, to meetings, to committees, and to developing contacts, are more likely to be influential decision makers\" (Guerrero, DeVito & Hecht, 1999, p. 327).\n\nA specific example of the way power is expressed through work time is scheduling. As Yakura and others have noted in research shared by Ballard and Seibold, \"scheduling reflects the extent to which the sequencing and duration of plans activities and events are formalized\" (Ballard and Seibold, p. 6). Higher-status individuals have very precise and formal schedules – indicating that their stature requires that they have specific blocks of time for specific meetings, projects and appointments. Lower status individuals however, may have less formalized schedules. Finally, the schedule and appointment calendar of the higher status individual will take precedence in determining where, when and the importance of a specific event or appointment.\n\nDeveloped by Judee Burgoon, expectancy violations theory (EVT) sees communication as the exchange of information which is high in relational content and can be used to violate the expectations of another which will be perceived as either positively or negatively depending on the liking between the two people.\n\nWhen our expectations are violated, we will respond in specific ways. If an act is unexpected and is assigned favorable interpretation, and it is evaluated positively, it will produce more favorable outcomes than an expected act with the same interpretation and evaluation.\n\nThe interpersonal adaptation theory (IAT), founded by Judee Burgoon, states that adaptation in interaction is responsive to the needs, expectations, and desires of communicators and affects how communicators position themselves in relation to one another and adapt to one another's communication. For example, they may match each other's behavior, synchronize the timing of behavior, or behave in dissimilar ways. It is also important to note that individuals bring to interactions certain requirements that reflect basic human needs, expectations about behavior based on social norms, and desires for interaction based on goals and personal preferences (Burgoon, Stern & Dillman, 1995).\n\n\n\n\n"}

For several months afterwards, the text of the contract was widely discussed in Armenian political forums. An updated version of the contract was published and Civil Contract, a new political union, was announced on July 24 of that year. The union announced that before its first conference, the text of the contract would be amended and clarified and a detailed road map created.\n\nCivil Contract's governing board was introduced at a December 9, 2013 Ani Plaza Hotel press conference.

On April 17, Nikol Pashinyan announced the start of a national, nonviolent \"velvet revolution\" to thousands of supporters gathered near the National Assembly. On April 22, several hours after a brief meeting with Sargsyan, Pashinyan was arrested with about 250 other protesters. After mass strikes and blocked streets by over 300,000 protesters (including soldiers and Civil Contract members), Sargsyan resigned on April 23. He said, \"Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong. The movement of the street is against my office. I'm fulfilling your demands.\" According to al Jazeera's Robin Forestier-Walker, \"Thousands of people are on the streets, cheering and hugging each other, jumping up and down and honking their horns ... things happened so quickly, I don't think the crowd was expecting this, but it is exactly what they wanted\".\n\n"}

It was at this time, in May 2011, that the NIF decided to abruptly halt all funding to CWP, despite statements to the contrary. CWP posted on its website scathing letters to the NIF, saying \"It seems particularly unfortunate that the exact timing of cutting off the relations of NIF and CWP has been dictated by NGO Monitor.\" and \"The public attitude of NIF in relation to CWP is a rather disgraceful example of following and accepting the right-wing discourse and its strategies.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "47515478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47515478", "title": "Ethical eating", "text": "Ethical eating\n\nEthical eating or food ethics refers to the moral consequences of food choices, both those made by humans for themselves and those made for food animals. Common concerns are damage to the environment, exploitive labor practices, food shortages for others, inhumane treatment of food animals, and the unintended effects of food policy. Ethical eating is a type of ethical consumerism.\n\nCertain methods of food production and certain types of foods have greater environmental impacts than others. The Union of Concerned Scientists advises that avoiding eating beef is one of the two most important actions most people can take to help the environment because of the large amounts of water needed to produce beef, the pollution from fecal, ammonia, carbon dioxide and methane waste associated with raising cows, the physical damage from grazing, and the destruction of wildlife habitat and rainforests to produce land for grazing. Industrially produced meat, such as that from animals raised in Confined Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs, has \"the greatest impact of any food product on the environment\".\n\nPackaging of commercially produced foods is also an area of concern, because of the environmental impact of both the production of the packaging and the disposal of the packaging.\n\nTransportation of commercially produced foods can increase that food's impact on the environment.\n\nWithin the food system there are many low-paid occupations. Many farm workers are paid below-minimum wages or work in substandard conditions, especially farm workers in developing countries and migrant workers in industrialized nations. Jobs within food processing catering and food retailing are also often poorly paid and sometimes hazardous.\n\nSince the 1980s, policies promoting global free trade have increased the amount of food exported from poorer countries, which may adversely affect the food available for their own populations. Campaign to reduce levels of food imports, however, may reduce the incomes of farmers in poorer countries, who rely on export sales.\n\nSince the 1950s, the food system has become increasingly global and a small number of multi-national corporations now dominate trade in many foodstuffs. One result is that the proportion of industrially processed foods in diets is increasing globally. Public health researchers label these changes the nutrition transition, arguing that, in poorer countries, they are causing increasing rates of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes.\n\nMany food animals are raised inhumanely.\n\nMany governmental food policies have unintended consequences.\n\nSome ethicists argue that the keeping and killing of animals for human consumption is in itself unethical. Others point out that animal husbandry is \"essential to sustainable farms, which don't rely on fossil fuels and chemicals,\" rather using animal waste as fertilizer and animal activity as weed and pest control and using animals to \"convert vegetation that's inedible to humans, and growing on marginal, uncultivated land, into food.\"\n\nThe method in which food animals are raised and the type of food animal affect the ethics of eating that animal. Farm-raised oysters cause minimal environmental damage and are raised humanely.\n\nDairy and egg production have ethical consequences, in particular in large-scale industrialized production. Chickens and milk-animals raised in industrial operations are often treated inhumanely.\n\nSmall-scale production of eggs, such as by backyard chicken raisers and small diversified farms raising pastured birds or milk-animals, are less ethically fraught but still create some issues for ethicists.\n\nIndustrial fishing has broad effects with ethical consequences.\n\nSome foods produced in developing countries are exported in quantities that threaten the ability of local residents to affordably obtain their traditional foods. Western demand for quinoa, a traditional food in Bolivia Peru and Ecuador, has become so high that producers are eating significantly less of the grain, preferring to sell it for import instead and sparking concerns about malnutrition.\n\nSome critics of the food ethics movement argue that parsing the various concerns is futile.\n\nFairtrade International, the certifying body for Fair Trade products, has been accused of \"misleading consumers about its ability to monitor production practices\" and giving Fairtrade certification to at least one coffee association despite the fact they were \"illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.\"\n\nMost food ethicists agree that some food choices are more ethical than others.\n\n"}

{"id": "44914811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44914811", "title": "Galician Youth Union", "text": "Galician Youth Union\n\nThe Galician Youth Union (UMG, \"Unión da Mocidade Galega\" in Galician language) is the youth wing of the Galician People's Union. It was created in August 1977.\n\nThe document of the Galician People's Union (UPG) \"The youth of the party\", in February 1977, included the decision to create the UMG due to the increase in the number of supporters, members and activists of the UPG in high school or that were young workers. University students were already members of the Galician Revolutionary Students (ERGA). This led the party to the creation of a youth organization which, besides serving to bring to the Galician youth \"a patriotic and communist political line\", could address the youth particular issues and problems effectively. The creation of UMG was ratified in the 1st Congress of UPG in August 1977, few days after the UMG itself was officially founded.\n\nIn the spring of 1977 a recruitment of militants was carried out, along with cell organization and theoretical and programmatic discussion. The constituent congress was held on the 14 and 15 August 1977, under the slogan \"For a free and socialist Galiza\". In that congress the UMG approved the statutes of the organization and a program that analyzed the specific situation of the Galician youth, the role of UMG that context and the alternatives that the organization should offer, including a table of \"minimal demands\". The UMG defined itself as the \"Patriotic and communist organization of Galiza and the youth wing of the Galician People's Union\". In 1989 the UMG participated in the creation of Galiza Nova, the youth wing of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG). Since then, UMG has subordinated its political action to Galiza Nova, rarely doing solo acts. Since 1988, after the creation of Galiza Nova (BNG youth organization), UMG renounced to make public activity, focusing all their efforts in working for the BNG.\n\nLike the UPG, the UMG declares itself communist and nationalist, and believes that the establishment of socialism in Galiza necessarily passes by the previous national liberation of the country. Among Marxism the UMG follows the Marxist-Leninist ideology, although the organization also includes in their ideology the thought of the progressive Galician nationalists previous to the Spanish Civil War, like Castelao, Alexandre Bóveda or Ramón Suárez Picallo. The UMG also considers itself the continuation of the Federación de Mocedades Galeguistas.\n\nThe first statutes of UMG, established democratic centralism as the main organizational principle. The organization is formed as a pyramidal organization, divided into zones and localities and defining cells as the basic fundamental core (called \"Zone Assembly\" since 1990). Local Committees and Area Committees are the intermediate direction bodies, while the Central Committee acts as the supreme body of the UMG between congresses and elected by (and in every) the National Congress. The Executive Committee is elected by the Central Committee. The highest governing body is the National Congress. Heading the UMG is the Secretary or general secretary, with executive functions.\n\nVarious authors. \"25 anos da UMG (1977–2002): A paixón por transformar\".

{"id": "304586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304586", "title": "Gray Panthers", "text": "Gray Panthers\n\nThe Gray Panthers are a series of multi-generational local advocacy networks in the United States which confront ageism and many other social justice issues. The organization was formed by Maggie Kuhn in response to her forced retirement from the Presbyterian Church at the age of 65 in 1970.\n\nIn addition to its initial response to the issue of forced retirement, Gray Panthers have challenged other ageist laws and stereotypes and engaged in anti-war activism, Medicare and Social Security preservation, inter-generational housing, LGBT rights advocacy, environmentalism, the fair treatment of people in nursing homes, and the promotion of single-payer health care.\n\nMaggie Kuhn’s interest in older persons’ rights existed well before she founded the Gray Panthers in 1970. She was involved with the White House Conference on Aging in 1961, and appalled by the way people in some retirement homes were treated.\n\nWhat really sparked her determination to form an activist organization was when she found herself a victim of the lack of rights for older persons in 1970, forced to retire from a job she loved in the Presbyterian Church. Instead of passively accepting retirement, Kuhn decided to band together with other people she knew who were also forced to retire. The lack of accepting the status quo would not just form the Gray Panther organization, but also the Gray Panther name--“It’s a fun name. There’s a certain militancy, rather than just a docile acceptance of what our country’s doing.”\n\nWhen Kuhn formed the organization, her alliances were not just limited to other older persons facing a plight similar to her own. As indicated by the Gray Panthers’ slogan which endures to this day, “Age and Youth in Action,” she made it a priority to include people of all generations. Gray Panthers membership continues to be inclusive of people of diverse ages.\n\nDuring this period, the main issues of the Gray Panthers included forced retirement, ageist stereotypes, cuts to Medicare and Social Security, and world peace.\n\nThere had been a mandatory forced retirement age at 65, based on the perception that older persons could not be productive members of a workplace after that age. While that stereotype was difficult to overcome, the Panthers were ultimately successful in their efforts to overturn the law, and in 1986, Congress passed a law banning mandatory retirement. The law was signed by President Ronald Reagan, as of that time the oldest ever President of the United States.\n\nThere were other ageist stereotypes that the Gray Panthers wanted to end. In particular the stereotype that older persons were “impotent, frail, disabled, demented, or dependent.” By confronting those stereotypes, the Gray Panthers were at the forefront of ideas some considered provocative—namely, ideas that older persons should be able to live in inter-generational housing, and that older people can and should freely have sex. And, of course, many of Maggie Kuhn’s quotes—including,”Old age is not a disease, it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses”—were used as weapons against ageist stereotypes.\n\nWhile the Gray Panthers wanted to counteract the stereotypes that older persons were weak, disabled, and incapable of doing much physical labor, the organization still cared deeply for people who were frail. As such, the organization was among the most vocal opponents to President Reagan’s proposed cuts to Medicare and Social Security. As with the ban on mandatory retirement, this was an issue where the Gray Panthers were able to get what they wanted because Medicare and Social Security were saved from deep cuts.\n\nAnother key facet of Gray Panther work from its early years was its advocacy for peace. The Panthers, both young and old, were particularly vociferous in its opposition to the Vietnam War, and war in general was a part of the Gray Panthers platform from the very beginning. The organization’s work in being anti-war did not stop with Vietnam—the Panthers were opponents of several of President Reagan’s plans, such as his “Star Wars” and increased foreign intervention in Central America.\n\nWhile mandatory retirement ages were abolished in 1986, there were still many threats and social injustices for Gray Panthers to address, including world peace, Medicare and Social Security Benefits, and single-payer health care. They would also become a prominent advocate for LGBT rights.\n\nThe organization was prominent in protests against both Iraq Wars, in 1991 and 2003. There were even some Gray Panthers who were arrested over protests in the 2003. While such efforts were originally unsuccessful, protesting these wars resonated with younger generations of potential Gray Panthers, therefore, engaging the “youth” part of “Age and Youth in Action.” Furthermore, with the 2003 Iraq War, the Gray Panthers were critical of American intervention years before the majority of Americans shared similar opinions.\n\nThe Gray Panthers also advocated for a robust national health care system, whether it be through the preservation of Medicare and Social Security, or through single-payer health care. On these issues, the organization continued to succeed in preserving Medicare and Social Security, though the Clinton Administration’s health care proposal in 1993-94 fell short of what the Gray Panthers wanted. In fact, the health care plan Maggie Kuhn championed what was described by The New York Times as “the most radical of the various proposals: health insurance paid totally by the government.”\n\nThe organization protested President Bill Clinton’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy which kept members of the military from being openly LGBT. The Gray Panthers were, therefore, at the forefront of an issue which was deeply unpopular at the time.\n\nIn the present day, the Gray Panthers continue to be at the forefront of advocacy against ageism and for social justice at the local, national, and international levels.\n\nWithin the United States, the Gray Panthers have received considerable media attention for triggering an audit of nursing home violations, confronting ageist stereotypes at all levels of society, and bringing attention to other issues which affect the quality of life of all seniors. The Gray Panthers are working with the United States Department of Labor to ensure support for family caregivers, and are involved in discussions on how to deliver improved home health care in the United States.\n\nAction and advocacy for older persons is not confined just to the United States. The Gray Panthers have also become increasingly prominent at the United Nations. The organization is one of the strongest advocates for a binding global Convention to protect the Human Rights of Older Persons. Gray Panthers has been instrumental in ensuring that the concerns of older persons have been enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals, the world’s blueprint for social, economic and environmental development. Ensuring that the rights of older women would be recognized, Gray Panthers successfully overcame resistance so that the Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women had explicit protections. Gray Panthers has become one of the most prominent American Non-Governmental Organizations advocating for the rights of older persons globally.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24011267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24011267", "title": "Healthcare rationing in the United States", "text": "Healthcare rationing in the United States\n\nHealthcare rationing in the United States exists in various forms. Access to private health insurance is rationed on price and ability to pay. Those unable to afford a health insurance policy are unable to acquire a private plan except by employer-provided and other job-attached coverage, and insurance companies sometimes pre-screen applicants for pre-existing medical conditions. Applicants with such conditions may be declined cover or pay higher premuums and/or have extra conditions imposed such as a waiting period. \n\nThe poor are given access to Medicaid, which is restricted by income and asset limits by means-testing, and other federal and state eligibility regulations apply. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs), which are common among the rest of the population, restrict access to treatment by financial and clinical access limits. Those 65 and older and a few othera also qualify for the Medicare, but it also has many restrictions. \n\nIn the media and in academia, some have advocated explicit healthcare rationing to limit the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. They argue that a proper rationing mechanism would be more equitable and cost-effective.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has argued that health care costs are the primary driver of government spending in the long term.\n\nPeter Singer wrote for the \"New York Times Magazine\" in July 2009 that healthcare is rationed in the United States:\n\nDavid Leonhardt wrote in the \"New York Times\" in June 2009 that rationing presently an economic reality: \"The choice isn't between rationing and not rationing. It's between rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United States devotes far more of its economy to health care than other rich countries, and gets worse results by many measures, it's hard to argue that we are now rationing very rationally.\" He wrote that there are three primary ways the US rations healthcare:\n\nDuring 2007, nearly 45% of US healthcare expenses were paid for by the government. In 2009, an estimated 46 million individuals in the United States did not have health insurance coverage. Also, an additional 14,000 or more people lost coverage every day for reasons such as loss.\nHealth Care Rationing Through Inconvenience: The Third Party's Secret Weapon\nCreator\nGrumet, Gerald W.\nIn 2008, Tia Powell led a New York State work group to set up guidelines for rationing ventilators during a potential flu pandemic.\n\nDr. Gerald Grumet has chronicled how private insurers and third party payers delay and impede the utilization of medical services through creating inconvenience and confusion for both patients and physicians through complex claims review processes with layers of administrative handling that supersede the autonomy of treating physicians.\n\nPresident Obama noted that US healthcare was rationed based on income, type of employment, and pre-existing medical conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He stated that millions of Americans were denied coverage or face higher premiums because of pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nIn an e-mail to Obama supporters, David Axelrod wrote, \"Reform will stop 'rationing' - not increase it... It’s a myth that reform will mean a 'government takeover' of health care or lead to 'rationing.' To the contrary, reform will forbid many forms of rationing that are currently being used by insurance companies.\"\n\nA 2008 study by researchers at the Urban Institute found that health spending for uninsured non-elderly Americans was only about 43% of health spending for similar, privately-insured Americans. That implied rationing by price and ability to pay.\n\nFareed Zakaria wrote that only 38% of small businesses provided health insurance for their employees during 2009, versus 61% in 1993, because of rising costs.\n\nAn investigation by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations showed that health insurers WellPoint Inc., UnitedHealth Group and Assurant Inc. canceled the coverage of more than 20,000 people, allowing the companies to avoid paying more than $300 million in medical claims over five years. It also found that policyholders with breast cancer, lymphoma, and more than 1000 other conditions were targeted for rescission and that employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses.\n\nPrivate and public insurers all have their own drug formularies through which they set coverage limitations, which may include referrals to the insurance company for a decision on whether the company will approve its share of the costs. American formularies make generalized coverage decisions by class, with cheaper drugs at one end of the scale and more expensive drugs with more conditions for referral and possible denial at the other end. Not all drugs may be in the formulary of every company, and consumers are advised to check the formulary before they buy insurance.\n\nThe phenomena known as medical bankruptcy is unheard of in countries with universal health care in which medical copayments are low or no nonexistent. In the United States, however, research shows that many bankruptcies have a strong medical component, even among the insured. Medical insurance before the Affordable Care Act allowed annual caps or lifetime caps on coverage, and the high cost of care made it common for insured persons to suffer bankruptcy after breaching those limits.\n\nA July 2009 NPR article quoted various doctors describing how America rations healthcare. Dr. Arthur Kellermann said: \"In America, we strictly ration health care. We've done it for years... But in contrast to other wealthy countries, we don't ration medical care on the basis of need or anticipated benefit. In this country, we mainly ration on the ability to pay. And that is especially evident when you examine the plight of the uninsured in the United States.\"\n\nRationing by price means accepting that there is no triage according to need. Thus, in the private sector, it is accepted that some people get expensive surgeries such as liver transplants or non-life-threatening ones such as cosmetic surgery, when others fail to get cheaper and much more cost-effective care such as prenatal care, which could save the lives of many fetuses and newborn children. Some places, like Oregon for example, explicitly ration Medicaid resources by using medical priorities.\n\nPolling has discovered that Americans are much more likely than Europeans or Canadians to forgo necessary health care (such not seeking a prescribed medicine) on the grounds of cost.\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturers often charge much more for drugs in the United States than they charge for the same drugs in Britain, where they know that a higher price would put the drug outside the cost-effectiveness limits applied by regulators such as NICE]]. American patients, even if they are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, often cannot afford the copayments for drugs, which is rationing based on ability to pay.\n\nAfter the death of Coby Howard in 1987 Oregon began a programme of public consultation to decide which procedures its Medicaid program should cover in an attempt to develop a transparent process for prioritizing medical services. Howard died of leukaemia, which was not funded. His mother spent the last weeks of his life trying to raise $100,000 to pay for a bone marrow transplant, but the boy died before treatment could begin. John Kitzhaber began a campaign arguing that thousands of low-income Oregonians lacked access to even basic health services, much less access to transplants. A panel of experts was appointed, the Health Services Commission, to develop a prioritized list of treatments. The state legislators decided where on the list of prioritised procedures the line of eligibility should be drawn. In 1995 there were 745 procedures, 581 of which were eligible for funding.\n\nRepublican Newt Gingrich argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. He expressed concern that although there is nothing in the proposed laws that would constitute rationing, the combination of three factors would increase pressure on the government to ration care explicitly for the elderly: an expanded federal bureaucracy, the pending insolvency of Medicare within a decade, and\nthe fact that 25% of Medicare costs are incurred in the final year of life.\n\nPrinceton Professor Uwe Reinhardt wrote that both public and private healthcare programs can ration and rebutted the concept that governments alone impose rationing: \"Many critics of the current health reform efforts would have us believe that only governments ration things... On the other hand, these same people believe that when, for similar reasons, a private health insurer refuses to pay for a particular procedure or has a price-tiered formulary for drugs – e.g., asking the insured to pay a 35 percent coinsurance rate on highly expensive biologic specialty drugs that effectively put that drug out of the patient's reach — the insurer is not rationing health care. Instead, the insurer is merely allowing \"consumers\" (formerly \"patients\") to use their discretion on how to use their own money. The insurers are said to be managing prudently and efficiently, forcing patients to trade off the benefits of health care against their other budget priorities.\"\n\nDuring 2009, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote against rationing by government entities, referring to what she interpreted as such an entity in current reform legislation as a \"death panel\" and \"downright evil.\" Defenders of the plan indicated that the proposed legislation, H.R. 3200, would allow Medicare for the first time to cover patient-doctor consultations about end-of-life planning, including discussions about drawing up a living will or planning hospice treatment. Patients would be allowed but not required to seek out such advice on their own. The provision would limit Medicare coverage to one consultation every five years. However, as governor, Palin had supported such end of life counseling and advance directives from patients in Alaska in 2008.\n\nEzra Klein described in the \"Washington Post\" how polls indicate senior citizens are increasingly resistant to healthcare reform because of concerns about cuts to the existing Medicare program that may be required to fund it. That is creating an unusual and potent political alliance, with Republicans arguing to protect the existing Medicare program although they historically opposed that and other major entitlement programs. The CBO scoring of the proposed H.R. 3200 (America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009) included $219 billion in savings over 10 years, some of which would come from Medicare changes.\n\nA concept called \"quality-adjusted life year\" (QALY - pronounced \"qualy\") is used by Australian Medicare to measure the cost-benefit of applying a particular medical procedure. Ir reflects the quality and the quantity of life added by incurring a particular medical expense. The measure has been used for over 30 years in the country's universal single-payer healthcare system and has been implemented in several other countries to help with rationing decisions. Australia applies QALY measures to control costs and ration care and allows private supplemental insurance for those who can afford it.\n\nSeveral treatment alternatives may be available for a given medical condition, with significantly different costs but no statistical difference in outcome. Such scenarios offer the opportunity to maintain or improve the quality of care while significantly reducing costs through comparative effectiveness research. Writing in the \"New York Times\", David Leonhardt described how the cost of treating the most common form of early-stage, slow-growing prostate cancer ranges from an average of $2,400 (watchful waiting to see if the condition deteriorates) to as high as $100,000 (radiation beam therapy): \n\nAccording to economist Peter A. Diamond and research cited by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the cost of healthcare per person in the US also varies significantly by geography and medical center, with little or no statistical difference in outcome:\n\nComparative effectiveness research has shown that significant cost reductions are possible. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Peter Orszag stated: \"Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas.\"\n\nPresident Obama has provided more than $1 billion in the 2009 stimulus package to jumpstart Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) and to finance a federal CER advisory council to implement that idea. Economist Martin Feldstein wrote in the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"Comparative effectiveness could become the vehicle for deciding whether each method of treatment provides enough of an improvement in health care to justify its cost.\"\n\nFormer Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter George Peterson indicated that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of US finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25 to 33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions if quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended for a budget to be established for government healthcare expenses by establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. He advocated addressing those issues under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission.\n\nArizona modified its Medicaid coverage rules because of a budget problem that included denying care for expensive treatments such as organ transplants to Medicaid recipients, including those who had previously been promised funding. MSNBC's Keith Olbermann and others have dubbed Governor Jan Brewer and the state legislatures as a real life death panel because many of those poor people who are now being denied funding will lose their lives or have health because of the political decision.\n\nIn the US, the discussion on rationing healthcare for the elderly began to be noticed widely in 1983 when economist Alan Greenspan asked \"whether it is worth it\" in referring to the use of 30% of the Medicare budget on 5-6% of those eligible who then die within a year of receiving treatment. In 1984, the Democratic governor of Colorado, Richard Lamm, was widely quoted but claimed to have been misquoted as saying that the elderly \"have a duty to die and get out of the way.\"\n\nMedical ethicist Daniel Callahan's 1987 \"Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society\" discusses whether healthcare should be rationed by age. He calls the elderly \"a new social threat\" and selfish and for age to be used as a criterion in limiting healthcare. Callahan's book has been widely discussed in the America media, including the \"New York Times\", the \"Washington Post\", the \"Wall Street Journal\", and \"just about every relevant professional and scholarly journal and newsletter.\" One of the major arguments against such age-based rationing is the fact that chronological age, by itself, is a poor indicator of health. Another major argument against Callahan's proposal is that it inverts the Western tradition by making death a possible good and life a possible evil. Amherst College Jurisprudence Professor Robert Laurence Barry called Callahan's view \"medical totalitarianism.\" One book-length rebuttal to Callahan from half-a-dozen professors who held a conference at the University of Illinois College of Law in October 1989 was in 1991's \"Set No Limits: a Rebuttal to Daniel Callahan's Proposal to Limit Health\", edited by Robert Laurence Barry and Gerard V. Bradley, a visting professor of religious studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nAustralian philosopher Peter Singer argued for rationing processes:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office reported in June 2008: In other words, all other federal spending categories (such as Social Security, defense, education, and transportation) would require borrowing to be funded, which is not feasible.\n\nPresident Obama stated in May 2009, \"But we know that our families, our economy, and our nation itself will not succeed in the 21st century if we continue to be held down by the weight of rapidly rising health care costs and a broken health care system... Our businesses will not be able to compete; our families will not be able to save or spend; our budgets will remain unsustainable unless we get health care costs under control.\"\n\nHealthcare rationing remained a political topic into 2017, with Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz debating on CNN whether a single-payer system would lead to healthcare rationing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28043494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28043494", "title": "Human rights in South Africa", "text": "Human rights in South Africa\n\nHuman rights in South Africa are protected under the constitution. The 1998 Human Rights report by Myles Nadioo noted that the government generally respected the rights of the citizens; however, there were concerns over the use of force by law enforcement, legal proceedings and discrimination. The Human Rights Commission is mandated by the South African Constitution and the Human Rights Commission Act of 1994, to monitor, both pro-actively and by way of complaints brought before it, violations of human rights and seeking redress for such violations. It also has an educational role.\n\nApartheid was a system of segregation and discrimination implemented by a White minority onto the Black majority. For example, Blacks were not allowed to buy land outside of land reserves despite being the indigenous population. Many of South Africa's anti-apartheid laws have been enacted while keeping in mind that what is seen by the international community, human rights organisations, and the Black majority in the country as the social and legal injustices associated with apartheid, and its anti-apartheid message has been hailed as an exemplary face of a Sub-Saharan nation.\n\nThe South African government has legislated for equal education throughout the country. This legislation includes the White Paper on Education and Training 1995 and the South African Schools Act, Act 84 of 1996. Nevertheless, there have been issues in the implementation of these laws. The South African government tends to focus primarily on the quality of higher education. However, only 10% of South African students make it to grade 12 in a reasonable number of years. Additionally, there is not much racial integration in state schools. Though laws allow for integration, many schools remain predominantly one race.\n\nMost of the Education in South Africa comes from rural schools. In fact, approximately 79% of Black South Africans live in rural communities. However, the government has neglected the quality of education in these rural areas. Issues with rural schooling include: poor facilities, lack of clean water, lack of resources, and unmotivated teachers. Considering poor facilities, some schools are not structurally stable and are at risk of collapse, with some schools even lacking electricity. Most schools with more than 500 children lack proper sanitation for toilets while some schools don't have toilets at all. Furthermore, many rural schools are in remote areas without direct access to clean water. Water is generally kilometers away and unclean because animals bathe and drink in it. This lack of water is a particular issue in the daytime when the temperature is highest. The remoteness of these rural schools is also a particular problem because they are quite distant from pupils' homes. And, many schools do not remedy this issue with transport. Additionally, many schools lack the needed books and supplies for learning. In June 2010, the Government Gazette recognised that these unfavorable learning environments increase rates of absenteeism of teachers and dropout rates of students. Some students do not have enough food to eat and are hungry during school. This hunger causes a lack on concentration and makes learning environments less favorable.\n\nThough South Africa ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007, children with disabilities still do not have equal access to education. In many situations, a state school is able to determine which students are able to enroll and the school may simply reject a disabled child without any consequences. In cases where the student is able to enroll in a public school, a school may lack the resources necessary to effectively teach children with disabilities. Additionally, children with disabilities in state schools are forced to pay fees—such as for an assistant—that other students are not required to pay. South Africa has schools that cater for students with disabilities, but these schools are limited in number and require fees to be paid. The limited number of schools forces children to either board or use costly transport. In 2000, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child was specifically concerned with the lack of implementation of South Africa's agreement to guarantee free primary education. South Africa still struggles to provide free primary education for all. Additionally, many disabled students are not able to access quality education because they are on waiting lists for schools that cater to students with special needs. For example, in 2015, there are approximately 5,552 children with disabilities on waiting lists.\nSouth Africa has a liberal constitution that protects all basic political freedoms. However, there have been a number of incidents of political repression as well as threats of future repression in violation of this constitution leading some analysts and civil society organisations to conclude that there is or could be a new climate of political repression or a decline in political tolerance.\n\nPolitical patronage is a significant aspect in South African politics. However, this patronage infringes on the rights of the people, especially those in poverty. 40% of South Africans are dependent on the state to supply necessities. This dependence on the state lessens the autonomy of South Africans in need of this assistance. These necessities are supplied in the form of grants, which require governmental documents to obtain. Consequently, bureaucracy plays a major role in an individual's ability to obtain a grant and thus obtain necessities. Politicians gain substituents based on material promises. If the politicians fulfill these promises, often the recipients are only those who supported the politicians. Essentially, voters dependence on the state precludes their ability to vote based on ideological platforms. This phenomenon does not align with the democratic principles of South Africa.\n\nTwenty-five percent of South Africans receive some form of government welfare grants, most of whom are female. The 1997 \"White Paper on Social Welfare\" outlines South Africa's social welfare policy. The White Paper on Social Welfare focuses on providing South Africans with opportunities for increased autonomy. For example, White Paper on Social Welfare stipulates the provision of public works projects. The White Paper also emphasizes the significance of non-state welfare organizations in providing welfare. Such organizations include non-governmental organizations (NGO's) and religious organizations. Additionally, the White Paper focuses on the government providing welfare specifically to families. But, the White Paper has relatively fewer provisions for the elderly. The government expects families to take responsibility for caring their elderly relatives, partly because of cultural values. The White Paper also covered child support grants and refrained from stereotyping concerning the gender roles in a family. For instance, the White Paper did not specifically refer to the male in a household as the \"breadwinner\". Racial disparities in the cities of South Africa still exist, despite the country's having long since ended apartheid. Many black South Africans still struggle to obtain basic needs such as housing, living in under-maintained townships, while many urban white South Africans reside in gated communities with a heavy presence of private security. The Sowetan Live has recently reported that \"...indeed the city has contributed to\" building \"4,000 social homes in 11 districts\" with more than 350,000 residents still in need of immediate housing relief.\n\nSouth Africa has a plethora of infectious disease cases. Malaria is major cause of death because of a lack of resources to treat patients. Additionally, the water is dirty with human and industrial waste which contributes to the spread of disease. Many deaths are caused by poverty rather than a lack of cures for a disease. Poverty is a major reason for death because poor families are not able to afford proper health services and hospitals are not able to buy enough supplies. Additionally, people living in South Africa who are illegal immigrants lack resources for health care that is non-emergency. For example, many of the people living in the Hillbrow Health Precinct are not legal and have poor health resources. Specifically, some hospital buildings were built before World War II. Furthermore, the Hillbrow community has high rates of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.\n\nSouth Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world. It was first detected in 1982. The disease was first detected in homosexuals, but it rapidly spread to heterosexuals. Because of the rapid spread, the government tried to step in and help. However, South Africa was in the last years of apartheid during the time when HIV/AIDS was becoming an epidemic. Thus, the South African government had great difficulty mitigating the effect of the epidemic. For instance, because of the desegregation of schools and the controversy surrounding that, the government did not focus on providing quality sex education that specifically focused on HIV/AIDS. Additionally, the local and federal governments had contention about the allocation of funds for HIV/AIDS prevention, thus causing inefficiency and gridlock. Also, some of the money allocated to HIV/AIDS prevention was misused. For example, a musical called \"Serefina II\" was projected to increase awareness about AIDS and AIDS prevention. However, the play was not clear and did not significantly help with sex education. Much of the HIV/AIDS treatment and progress have been funded by non profit organizations such as WHO and UNAIDS.\n\nThere are multiple theories about the causes for the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Some theorize that migrant workers were a source of the proliferation of the disease. The migrant workers usually would not see their wives and families for months, so they had extramarital sexual intercourse in the cities. Then, later during the holidays, husbands would return home and unknowingly infect their wives with the disease. Another theory is that the culture makes South Africa more vulnerable to the epidemic. For example, male circumcision at birth reduces the risk of the child getting HIV/AIDS. However, many South Africans do not do this procedure because it is not traditional to do circumcision at birth.\n\nAdditionally, a lack of quality health care can exacerbate the epidemic. There is quite a disparity between public and private healthcare. Overall, public hospitals provide worse care than private hospitals do. Public hospitals are generally overcrowded and understaffed. In fact, 82% of South Africans are cared for by 27% of South Africa's general physicians. The difference in these percentages is caused by general physicians moving to the private healthcare sector and by brain drain. Brain drain is when professionals emigrate from their home country to work elsewhere. Also, the disparity is caused by the fact that private hospitals have more resources and funds than public hospitals do because of the higher fees at private hospitals.\n\nThe South African government has been criticised by Human Rights Watch for deporting hundreds of thousands of Zimbabwean refugees and treating victims of political violence as economic migrants. By sending refugees back to persecution, Human Rights Watch has asserted that South Africa is violating the refugee convention and international law.\n\nSouth Africa has had some issues concerning gender inequality in court cases. A prominent example is that of \"Jacob Zuma's Rape Trial in 2006. \"Khwezi, a female AIDS activist, brought Zuma to court for raping her. As his defense, Zuma claimed that he could \"have liaisons with women\" quite easily, so he asserted that he would not have raped Khwezi. Zuma also used Zulu culture as support for his defense. Some of Zuma's supporters gathered outside of the courthouse and burned photographs of Khewzi and yelled phrases like \"Burn the Bitch. \" These actions caused gender activists to protest against sexism and to raise concern about the fact that the judge allowed the court to admit evidence about Khwezi's sexual history, but did not admit evidence from Zuma's sexual history. Many people felt that Zuma went against the modern South African liberal democracy because he represented patriarchy at a relative extreme.\n\nIt is estimated that 500,000 women are raped in South Africa every year with the average woman more likely to be raped than complete secondary school. A 2009 survey found one in four South African men admitted to raping someone and another survey found one in three women out of 4000 surveyed women said they had been raped in the past year.\n\nRapes are also perpetrated by children (some as young as ten). Child and baby rape incidences are some of the highest in the world. A number of high-profile baby rapes that included extensive reconstructive surgery to rebuild urinary, genital, abdominal, or tracheal systems have appeared.\n\nThe Civil Union Act 17 of 2006 legalized same-sex marriage in South Africa. It was a direct retort to the \"Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie,\" which did not recognize same-sex marriage as legal.\n\nSouth Africa's post-apartheid constitution was the first in the world to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. South Africa was the first country in Africa, and the fifth in the world, to legalise same-sex marriage.\n\nIntersex people in South Africa have some of the same rights as other people, but with significant gaps in protection from non-consensual cosmetic medical interventions and protection from discrimination. The country was the first to explicitly include intersex people in anti-discrimination law.\n\nSouth Africa has implicit and explicit labour regulations. Its implicit labour regulations are stated in the Constitution and set the boundaries for explicit regulations. Explicit regulations are set by employers and are specific to each job. On the other hand, implicit regulations are the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997, the New Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998, and the Skills Development Act 97 of 1998—each with subsequent amendments. The Labour Relations Act 66 allows workers to create unions and collectively bargain. Over the years, the number of unions in South Africa have declined. Also, there are fewer federation-associated trade unions and more independent trade unions in South Africa today. The Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 has regulations concerning working hours, leave, and termination. The New Employment Equity Act 55 was created to lessen discrimination. It also provides parameters for affirmative action. The Skills Development Act 97 promotes worker productivity and competitiveness in the market.\n\nSouth Africa has some labour related issues. One aspect is the formation of unions. In fact, 22% of South African workers are union members. In 2012, the Marikana Massacre occurred. The Marikana Massacre was the killing of 44 platinum miners who were on strike to earn increased wages. 78 people were wounded and 259 were arrested. One reason for this brutality was that the strike was not protected. Additionally, poorly paid farm workers have been striking. One example is of the Western Cape Farm worker strike in which the workers were mostly female. The strike resulted in 3 deaths, but the workers got a 52% increase in pay. This strike was also unprotected. There was another platinum mining strike in 2014, but it differed from the 2012 platinum mining strike because it was protected. The protection prevented police brutality. In fact, this strike lasted for five months. Consequently, the world's platinum production decreased by 40% because of the lack of labour. The worker's wages did increase as a result but, the workers also suffered losses because of the \"no work, no pay\" policy in South Africa. Workers who strike are generally strongly motivated, even with protected strikes, because there is much risk of loss.\n\nThe union membership rate in South Africa is one of the highest in the world. Furthermore, the risk of union conflict is a deterrent for foreign companies. South Africa is receptive to foreign companies because they create jobs. The unemployment rate in South Africa is approximately 30%. The government encourages foreign and disadvantaged domestic company partnership by giving benefits to foreign companies. Also, the South African government requires that businesses with government contracts donate to social programs. Also, South Africa has high numbers of migrant workers from rural areas throughout Africa, which gives foreign companies a large labor force to choose from.\n\nThe following chart shows South Africa's ratings since 1972 in the Freedom in the World reports, published annually by Freedom House. A rating of 1 is \"free\"; 7, \"not free\".\nSouth Africa's stances on international human rights treaties are as follows:\n\n\n"}

His father was Donald MacCormick, a sea captain who was from the Isle of Mull. His mother was the first district nurse in the Western Isles. McCormick was educated at Woodside School, and studied law at the University of Glasgow (1923–1928). He became involved in politics while at university, and joined the Glasgow University labour club and the Independent Labour Party in 1923. In September 1927 MacCormick left the ILP and formed the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association (GUSNA), which was designed to promote Scottish culture and nationalism and self-government. The association was sufficiently neutral to act as the honest broker between the various nationalist organisations which would merge to form the National Party of Scotland (NPS) in April 1928. MacCormick was a talented speaker and organiser, and served as the national secretary of the NPS. MacCormick was often known by his nickname \"King John\", which he said came from a heckle during a debate he was participating in when upon a question from the floor whether a devolved Scotland would retain the monarchy, or would be a republic, someone interjected and said: \"no, it will be a kingdom and John MacCormick will be our king.\"\n\nThe failure of the NPS to make an electoral breakthrough led him to question current tactics and he concluded that the party's fundamentalist wing was frightening away potential support because of its support for republicanism and independence. In consequence, MacCormick initiated a campaign to redefine the policy of the NPS, to make it more moderate and to tone down demands for independence. He first stood for Parliament as an NPS candidate at the 1929 general election, when he came third in Glasgow Camlachie, with 1,646 votes. He also stood at Inverness at the 1931 general election.\n\nIn 1932, MacCormick began to make overtures to the right-wing Scottish Party, believing that, as the Scottish Party included a number of members of the Scottish 'establishment', their conversion to the cause of home rule would enhance the credibility of the nationalists. To secure an accommodation, MacCormick purged the NPS of radical elements, and moved the policy of the NPS towards that of the Scottish Party. His endeavours paid dividends, and in 1934 the two parties merged to form the Scottish National Party (SNP). MacCormick himself was not a dogmatic politician, and described himself as a radical, by which he meant a form of centrist liberal. His response to the failure of the SNP to make an electoral impact in the mid-1930s was to search for alternative strategies. He considered the basic problem to be that, although many people in Scotland favoured home rule, they were not, on the whole, willing to put the issue above conventional party loyalties. The solution, MacCormick argued, was to make the other parties take home rule seriously, and to demonstrate widespread support for the cause. In 1939 he launched the idea of a Scottish national convention, which would bring together all sections of Scottish society and all shades of Scottish political opinion in favour of home rule. He had made contact with both the Labour and Liberal parties, and although the first meeting, scheduled for September 1939, was cancelled because of the outbreak of World War II, MacCormick pushed negotiations throughout the war.\n\nAs a leading figure in the SNP, MacCormick came under increasing attack from the rank and file members for his failure to maintain party structure and organisation. He considered that his preferred strategy of co-operation with other organisations meant that there was little need for the SNP to function as a mainstream political party. He endeavoured to present an acceptable face of Scottish nationalism, and did much to reverse the party's official anti-conscription policy following the outbreak of the Second World War. MacCormick stood as an SNP candidate for Inverness at the 1935 general election and at the 1937 Glasgow Hillhead by-election.\n\nHe resigned from the party in 1942 following his failure to persuade the party to adopt a devolutionist stance rather than supporting all out Scottish independence and due to the victory of Douglas Young over his favoured candidate, William Power, for the leadership of the SNP. Along with a number of dissatisfied delegates to that year's SNP conference, he established the Scottish Convention to campaign for home rule for Scotland and later formed the Scottish Covenant Association.\n\nMacCormick took the decision to join the Liberal Party as he viewed them as being the party most closely allied to his devolutionist ambitions for Scotland. He stood as the Liberal candidate for Inverness at the 1945 general election.\n\nThe Scottish Convention succeeded in 1947 in setting up an assembly along the lines planned in 1939. In 1951, MacCormick formed the Scottish Covenant Association, a non-partisan political organisation which campaigned to secure the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. This covenant was hugely successful in securing support from across the political spectrum, as well as in capturing the Scottish public's imagination (over 2 million signed a petition demanding the convocation of an Assembly. In 1948, he stood as an independent candidate at the Paisley by-election, with what he erroneously believed to be Liberal and Conservative support, and lost. His failure discredited claims as to the popularity of home rule, and further served to reinforce notions that the Scottish Convention was an anti-Labour organisation. MacCormick's failure left the SNP with a monopoly of the cause of home rule.\n\nMacCormick was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow in October 1950. He served as Rector until 1953. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the university in 1951. This association with GUSNA also saw the formation of a political friendship with a then young law student at Glasgow University, Ian Hamilton, who had run his campaign to be elected rector. MacCormick was involved, along with Hamilton, in the removal of the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1950 and its return to Arbroath Abbey. He also mounted a legal challenge, MacCormick v. Lord Advocate, over the right of Queen Elizabeth using the title \"Queen Elizabeth II\", on grounds that there had been no previous Scottish Queen Elizabeth.\n\nIn 1955 MacCormick had a book detailing his activities in the home rule movement published, entitled \"The Flag in the Wind\". His last attempt to enter parliament came at the 1959 General Election, when he stood for the Liberal Party at Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles, again finishing second.\n\nIn the film \"Stone of Destiny\" MacCormick is played by Robert Carlyle.\n\nMacCormick married Margaret Isobel Miller in 1939, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. Their elder son, Iain (1939–2014), served as SNP Member of Parliament for Argyll from 1974 till 1979 (and was a founder member of the Social Democratic Party. Their second son, Neil (1941–2009) was regius professor of Public Law and Vice-Principal of the University of Edinburgh, and served as an SNP Member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004. He was also the uncle of the journalist and broadcaster Donald MacCormick.\n\nMacCormick died on 13 October 1961. His funeral was held in the chapel of the University of Glasgow.\n"}

{"id": "1833462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833462", "title": "Lawful interception", "text": "Lawful interception\n\nLawful interception (LI) refers to the facilities in telecommunications and telephone networks that allow law enforcement agencies with court orders or other legal authorization to selectively wiretap individual subscribers. Most countries require licensed telecommunications operators to provide their networks with Legal Interception gateways and nodes for the interception of communications. The interfaces of these gateways have been standardized by telecommunication standardization organizations. \n\nWith the legacy public switched telephone network (PSTN), wireless, and cable systems, lawful interception (LI) was generally performed by accessing the mechanical or digital switches supporting the targets' calls. The introduction of packet switched networks, softswitch technology, and server-based applications the past two decades fundamentally altered how LI is undertaken.\n\nLawful interception differs from the dragnet-type mass surveillance sometimes done by intelligence agencies, where all data passing a fiber-optic splice or other collection point is extracted for storage or filtering. It is also separate from the data retention of metadata that has become a legal requirement in some jurisdictions.\n\nLawful interception is obtaining communications network data pursuant to lawful authority for the purpose of analysis or evidence. Such data generally consist of signalling or network management information or, in fewer instances, the content of the communications. If the data are not obtained in real-time, the activity is referred to as access to retained data (RD).\n\nThere are many bases for this activity that include infrastructure protection and cybersecurity. In general, the operator of public network infrastructure can undertake LI activities for those purposes. Operators of private network infrastructures in the United States have an inherent right to maintain LI capabilities within their own networks unless otherwise prohibited.\n\nOne of the bases for LI is the interception of telecommunications by law enforcement agencies (LEAs), regulatory or administrative agencies, and intelligence services, in accordance with local law. Under some legal systems, implementations—particularly real-time access to content—may require due process and receiving proper authorization from competent authorities—an activity that was formerly known as \"wiretapping\" and has existed since the inception of electronic communications. The material below primarily treats this narrow segment of LI.\n\nAlmost all countries have lawful interception capability requirements and have implemented them using global LI requirements and standards developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), or CableLabs organisations—for wireline/Internet, wireless, and cable systems, respectively. In the USA, the comparable requirements are enabled by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), with the specific capabilities promulgated jointly by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice. In the USA, lawful intercept technology is currently patented by a company named Voip-pal.com under the USPTO Publication #: 20100150138.\n\nGovernments require phone service providers to install a legal interception gateway (LIG), along legal interception nodes (LIN), which allow them to intercept in real-time the phone calls, SMS messages, emails and some file transfers or instant messages. These LI measures for governmental surveillance have been in place since the beginning of digital telephony.\n\nTo prevent investigations' being compromised, LI systems may be designed in a manner that hides the interception from the telecommunications operator concerned. This is a requirement in some jurisdictions.\n\nTo ensure systematic procedures for carrying out interception, while also lowering the costs of interception solutions, industry groups and government agencies worldwide have attempted to standardize the technical processes behind lawful interception. One organization, ETSI, has been a major driver in lawful interception standards not only for Europe, but worldwide.\n\nThis architecture attempts to define a systematic and extensible means by which network operators and law enforcement agents (LEAs) can interact, especially as networks grow in sophistication and scope of services. Note this architecture applies to not only “traditional” wireline and wireless voice calls, but to IP-based services such as voice over IP, email, instant messaging, etc. The architecture is now applied worldwide (in some cases with slight variations in terminology), including in the United States in the context of CALEA conformance. Three stages are called for in the architecture: \nThe call data (known as intercept related information (IRI) in Europe and call data (CD) in the US) consists of information about the targeted communications, including destination of a voice call (e.g., called party’s telephone number), source of a call (caller’s phone number), time of the call, duration, etc. Call content is namely the stream of data carrying the call. Included in the architecture is the lawful interception management function, which covers interception session set-up and tear-down, scheduling, target identification, etc. Communications between the network operator and LEA are via the handover interfaces (HI). Communications data and content are typically delivered from the network operator to the LEA in an encrypted format over an IP-based VPN. The interception of traditional voice calls still often relies on the establishment of an ISDN channel that is set up at the time of the interception.\n\nAs stated above, the ETSI architecture is equally applicable to IP-based services where IRI/CD is dependent on parameters associated with the traffic from a given application to be intercepted. For example, in the case of email IRI would be similar to the header information on an email message (e.g., destination email address, source email address, time email was transmitted) as well as pertinent header information within the IP packets conveying the message (e.g., source IP address of email server originating the email message). Of course, more in-depth information would be obtained by the interception system so as to avoid the usual email address spoofing that often takes place (e.g., spoofing of source address). Voice-over-IP likewise has its own IRI, including data derived from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that are used to set up and tear down a VOIP call.\n\nETSI LI Technical Committee work today is primarily focussed on developing the new Retained Data Handover and next-generation network specifications, as well as perfecting the innovative TS102232 standards suite that apply to most contemporary network uses.\n\nUSA interception standards that help network operators and service providers conform to CALEA are mainly those specified by the Federal Communications Commission (which has both plenary legislative and review authority under CALEA), CableLabs, and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS). ATIS's standards include new standards for broadband Internet access and VoIP services, as well as legacy J-STD-025B, which updates the earlier J-STD-025A to include packetized voice and CDMA wireless interception.\n\nTo ensure the quality of evidence, the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) has outlined standards for electronic surveillance once a Title III surveillance application is approved:\nGeneric global standards have also been developed by Cisco via the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that provide a front-end means of supporting most LI real-time handover standards. All of these standards have been challenged as \"deficient\" by the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to CALEA.\n\nThe principal global treaty-based legal instrument relating to LI (including retained data) is the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, 23 Nov 2001). The secretariat for the Convention is the Council of Europe. However, the treaty itself has signatories worldwide and provides a global scope.\n\nIndividual countries have different legal requirements relating to lawful interception. The Global Lawful Interception Industry Forum lists many of these, as does the Council of Europe secretariat. For example, in the United Kingdom the law is known as RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act), in the United States there is an array of federal and state criminal law, in Commonwealth of Independent States countries as SORM.\n\nIn the European Union, the European Council Resolution of 17 January 1995 on the Lawful Interception of Telecommunications (Official Journal C 329) mandated similar measures to CALEA on a pan-European basis. Although some EU member countries reluctantly accepted this resolution out of privacy concerns (which are more pronounced in Europe than the US), there appears now to be general agreement with the resolution. Interception mandates in Europe are generally more rigorous than those of the US; for example, both voice and ISP public network operators in the Netherlands have been required to support interception capabilities for years. In addition, publicly available statistics indicate that the number of interceptions in Europe exceed by many hundreds of times those undertaken in the U.S.\n\nEurope continues to maintain its global leadership role in this sector through the adoption by the European Parliament and Council in 2006 of the far reaching Data Retention Directive. The provisions of the Directive apply broadly to almost all public electronic communications and require the capture of most related information, including location, for every communication. The information must be stored for a period of at least six months, up to two years, and made available to law enforcement upon lawful request. The Directive has been widely emulated in other countries.\nOn 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the Directive 2006/24/EC invalid for violating fundamental rights.\n\nIn the United States, three Federal statutes authorize lawful interception. The 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, Title III pertains mainly to lawful interception criminal investigations. The second law, the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, as amended by the Patriot Act, governs wiretapping for intelligence purposes where the subject of the investigation must be a foreign (non-US) national or a person working as an agent on behalf of a foreign country. The Administrator of the U.S. Courts annual reports indicate that the federal cases are related to illegal drug distribution, with cell phones as the dominant form of intercepted communication.\n\nDuring the 1990s, as in most countries, to help law enforcement and the FBI more effectively carry out wiretap operations, especially in view of the emerging digital voice and wireless networks at the time, the U.S. Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994. This act provides the Federal statutory framework for network operator assistance to LEAs in providing evidence and tactical information. In 2005, CALEA was applied to public broadband networks Internet access and Voice over IP services that are interconnected to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).\n\nIn the 2000s, surveillance focus turned to terrorism. NSA warrantless surveillance outside the supervision of the FISA court caused considerable controversy. It was revealed in 2013 mass surveillance disclosures that since 2007, the National Security Administration has been collecting connection metadata for all calls in the United States under the authority of section 215 PATRIOT Act, with the mandatory cooperation of phone companies and with the approval of the FISA court and briefings to Congress. The government claims it does not access the information in its own database on contacts between American citizens without a warrant.\n\nLawful interception can also be authorized under local laws for state and local police investigations.\n\nPolice ability to lawfully intercept private communications is governed by Part VI of the Criminal Code of Canada (Invasion Of Privacy).\n\nDue to Yarovaya Law, law enforcement is entitled to stored private communication data.\n\nMost countries worldwide maintain LI requirements similar to those Europe and the U.S., and have moved to the ETSI handover standards. The Convention on Cybercrime requires such capabilities.\n\nAs with many law enforcement tools, LI systems may be subverted for illicit purposes, producing a violation of human rights, as declared by European Court of Human Rights in the case \"Bettino Craxi III v. Italy\"\n. It occurred also in Greece during the 2004 Olympics: the telephone operator Vodafone Greece was fined US$100,000,000 in 2006 (or 76 Million Euro) for failing to secure its systems against unlawful access.\n\n\n"}

In India, lieutenant governors are in charge of special administrative divisions in that country.\n\nIn the United States, lieutenant governors are usually second-in-command to a state governor, and the actual power held by the lieutenant governor varies greatly from state to state. The lieutenant governor is often first in line of succession to the governorship, and acts as governor when the governor leaves the state or is unable to serve. Also, the Lt.

After registering as a political action committee in 2011, MFC has lobbied against same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Minnesota Family Council (MFC) was founded in 1983.\n\nThe Minnesota Family Council has been active in politics, representing religious conservatives since at least 1994. In 1996, the MFC reacted negatively when glow condoms were sent by Planned Parenthood to men ages 18 to 25, who were living within four miles of its Minneapolis office.\n\nThomas Prichard joined the Minnesota Family Council in 1990. MFC describes itself as \"a non-partisan, grassroots, Christian organization dedicated to strengthening the family – the bedrock of society – by advancing foundational biblical principles in churches, the media, government, and the public square throughout the state of Minnesota.\"\n\nMinnesota Family Council (MFC) is the statewide sponsor of the Parents Action League, an organization formed to oppose proposed changes in the Anoka-Hennepin (Minnesota) School District 11 policy which limited discussions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues in district classrooms. Barb Anderson, a longtime researcher for MFC, fought \"gay influence\" in local schools for two decades. When the Anoka-Hennepin, Minnesota district's sex-ed curriculum was due for re-evaluation in 1994, Anderson and four like-minded parents joined the review committee. They argued against teaching gay tolerance in school, suggesting that it would \"promote homosexuality\", and that discussing it openly might actually \"turn straight kids gay\". Anderson also serves as spokesperson for the Parents Action League.\n\nIn 2011, MFC registered as a political action committee (PAC) in its efforts for lobbying against same-sex marriage. MFC's CEO, John Helmberger is a registered lobbyist for the organization.\n\nThe Minnesota Family Council has been an active participant in the social values dialogue in the United States (US).

{"id": "4177369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4177369", "title": "Name recognition", "text": "Name recognition\n\nIn politics, name recognition is the ability a voter has to identify a candidate's name due to a certain amount of previous exposure through various campaigning methods. It can be described as the awareness voters have about specific candidates resulting from various forms of campaign advertising. Some of the advertising methods used by candidates running for various offices are creating posters, making yard signs, bumper stickers and attempting to get media exposure are a few examples of how they achieve this. Though candidates can achieve high name recognition and exposure, this doesn't necessarily that the average voter has a good understanding of their ideologies, positions and stances of political issues.\n\nThe ability of a citizen to recognize a candidates name can impact the effect of their voting behavior and which candidates they select when casting their ballots. Exposure to a candidates name, with or without the conscious awareness of the name recognition, can lead to an increase in the candidates likability. One explanation for this is the recognition heuristic\",\" when applied to voting behavior, is the ability to recognize a political figures name which leads the individual to believe that they should support that specific candidate. The ability to recognize a candidates name can occur consciously or subconsciously through various forms of subliminal messages and advertising. One of the reasons behind the reoccurring incumbency effect\",\" or the constant trend of individuals reelecting politicians who currently hold the position up for election, is due to the effects of name recognition. According to a study performed in \"Name Recognition and Candidate Support\" by Cindy D. Kam Elizabeth J. Zechmeister, they discovered that after a three-day subliminal exposure to a candidates name can lead to an increase in support for this politician. These reasons described are the factors that explain why politicians spend such large amounts of money and work very hard to make their names recognizable to the voting population. There are proven positive effects when name recognition of a candidate is accomplished.\n\nOnline advertising is one very extremely popular method used by political campaigns in order to gain exposure and support. The benefits of using this form of advertising are that is a very low-cost method and it has the ability to reach a large amount of people fast. Also, using the current technology available enables these campaigns with the ability to target specific individuals who have a higher chance of voting for them, by using factors such as race and age. Another advantage of using online political advertisements is that it is a very effective method to achieving a higher likelihood that the candidates name will be recognized by a larger range of individuals. The online world and social media gives candidates the ability to gain a large amounts of exposure and name recognition, which can increase the chances that they'll win in the upcoming election.

It was established in 1994 by president Yasser Arafat in accordance with the Oslo Accords. \n\nThe Preventive Security is an internal intelligence organization, part of the Palestinian Security Services, and led by the Minister of the Interior. Its main tasks are protecting the internal security of Palestine and the Palestinian Authority, and preventing crimes which target governmental departments and public bodies and institutions. It was the keeper of the Oslo peace process.\n\nThe Preventive Security (PPS) is one of several intelligence services of Palestine. According to some sources, 5,000 plain-clothed members served in separate units in the West Bank and Gaza in 2006.\n\nThe PPS has long been one of the most powerful intelligence organizations, mainly to protect the Oslo peace process. In the late 1990s the \"Security and Protection Department\" or so-called \"Death Sqad\" was established, aimed at activists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. In 2007, the estimated strength was 3,500 in the West Bank and 4,500 in Gaza.\n\nIn November 2007, President Mahmoud Abba issued \"Decree Law No. ( ) of 2007 Concerning the Preventive Security\", which re-defined the Preventive Security. The Law is not approved by the Palestinian Legislative Council.\n\nThe Preventive Security is led by the Minister of the Interior and headed by the Director-General of the Directorate-General of the Preventive Security.

{"id": "18118666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18118666", "title": "Privatization in criminal justice", "text": "Privatization in criminal justice\n\nPrivatization in criminal justice refers to a shift to private ownership and control of criminal justice services. \n\nThe term is often used to refer simply to contracting out services, which takes place extensively in many countries today; for instance, in the form of various prison services provided piecemeal by private vendors. Taken to its fullest extreme, however, privatization entails private-sector control over all the decisions regarding the use of resources devoted to the protection of persons and property.\n\nMany criminal justice services are privatized because the government lacks the means to carry them out. For example, private bail bondsmen help enforce the laws requiring those released on bail to appear for trial. If the defendant disappears, the bondsman may hire a bounty hunter to find them and bring them back. \n\nThe bondsman also has a monetary incentive to make an accurate assessment as to the defendant's likelihood of jumping bail; if he declines to grant a bond to an individual who would have shown up to trial, then he loses business, but if he grants bail to a person who jumps bail, then he suffers a financial loss. The government does not have such incentives built into its decisionmaking mechanisms for pretrial release.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Florida Governor Claude Kirk commissioned Wackenhut Services for a $500,000 \"war on organized crime\" contract that led to more than 80 criminal indictments, including many local politicians and government employees. Multi-State, a firm established by a former Columbus, Ohio police chief and employed thirteen former police officers with narcotics experience in 1973 \"rented\" skilled narcotics agents to small-town police forces in Ohio and West Virginia; more than 150 arrests and seizures of $200,000 in drugs took place. \n\nIn 1993, the Kentwood, Michigan police department signed a three-year contract with a private firm to investigate and recover bad checks. The contractor handles all merchant contacts, telephone calls regarding bad checks, and investigations, in an effort to recover the face value of the check as well as the expenses for both the merchant and the police department. \n\nAccording to Wyoming Detective James Maguffee, \"\"They've got a great track record...It's just been a phenomenal success.\"\n\nIn Switzerland, Securitas provides police services for more than 30 Swiss villages and townships. Paradise Island also has a private police force. \n\nIn 1975, Oro Valley, Arizona contracted for police services with Rural/Metro Fire Department but the arrangement was challenged by the Arizona Law Enforcement Officers Advisory Council. Rural/Metro could not pay the legal fees needed to fight the challenge and the arrangement was ended in 1977. \n\nIn some cases, private police are deputized in order to ensure compliance with the law, but continue to be paid by the hour so that money can be saved by releasing them during slow times; as when Kalamazoo, Michigan contracted for street patrol and traffic control with Charles Services. Other jurisdictions that have had contracts for police services with private firms include Indian Springs, Florida, Buffalo Creek, West Virginia (which was served by Guardsmark) and Reminderville, Ohio which contracted with Corporate Security in 1981; as well as Sussex, New Jersey, which contracted for police services with Executive Security and Investigations Services after the town's entire four-officer police force was dismissed in 1993 because of a drug scandal.\n\n"}
{"id": "35869303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35869303", "title": "Renationalization of YPF", "text": "Renationalization of YPF\n\nPresident Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina introduced a bill on April 16, 2012 for the partial renationalization of YPF, the nation's largest energy firm. The state would purchase a 51% share, with the national government controlling 51% of this package and ten provincial governments receiving the remaining 49%. The bill was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of Congress, and was signed by the president on May 5.\n\nThe government of Argentina eventually agreed to pay $5 billion in compensation to Repsol, which had previously owned YPF.\n\nYPF was founded in 1922 as the first oil company in the world to be established as a state enterprise. The company grew to become largest in its sector in Argentina, and despite the divestiture of a sizable percentage of its extractive, refining, logistic, and retail infrastructure during its 1993 privatization, YPF in 2012 operated 52% of the nation's refinery capacity and accounted for 57% of the national market in gasoline and other motor fuels. Its share of petroleum and natural gas production nationally was 34% and 23%, respectively, in 2011; company revenues that year were US$13.7 billion.\n\nThe firm was privatized in 1993 on the initiative of President Carlos Menem and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo pursuant to the State Reform Law of 1989, which authorized the president to present bills to Congress for the privatization of any of the numerous state enterprises in operation at the time. Madrid-based Repsol acquired a majority stake in 1999. Oil and gas production subsequently weakened while demand increased, and in 2011 Argentina recorded the first energy trade deficit since 1987.\n\nInvestment in exploration at YPF as a percentage of profits had been far below those in most other Repsol subsidiaries, and fell from 30 new wells in 1998 to eight in 2010 (French energy firm Total S.A. overtook YPF as the leading oil driller in Argentina). Its reserves of crude and natural gas fell 60% and 67% respectively between 1999 and 2011, and declines in output at the firm represented 54% of the nation's lost oil production and 97% in the case of natural gas.\n\nRepsol and some market analysts blamed the decline in exploration and production on government controls on exports and prospecting leases, and price controls on domestic oil and gas. YPF, however, remained profitable throughout Repsol's tenure even as output fell, and net income from 1999 to 2011 at YPF totaled nearly US$16.5 billion.\n\nThe Kirchner administration in turn pointed to high dividend yields and low investment levels at YPF in relation to profits. Argentine Economy Minister Hernán Lorenzino claimed that asset stripping at YPF had financed Repsol's expansion in other parts of the world, while Repsol officials denied charges of underinvestment in its YPF operations and instead cited the Vaca Muerta discovery as a motivation for the takeover.\n\n\"Vaca Muerta\", a 30,000 km² (11,600 mi²) unconventional oil field with proven recoverable reserves of up to 927 million barrels, had been discovered by RepsolYPF in November 2011. Repsol executives declared however that government policies would have to change in order to allow investment in new production. Following bills signed by governors in six fossil-fuel producing provinces during March and April 2012 revoking YPF leases accounting for over a fifth of its production, the president announced on April 16 that the Argentine Government would acquire a majority stake in YPF. Repsol YPF Gas, a liquefied natural gas subsidiary in which Repsol had an 85% stake, was concurrently nationalized on April 19.\n\nThe Chinese state oil concern, Sinopec, was reported to have been in talks to buy out Repsol's share in YPF – a potential deal scuttled by the Argentine announcement.\n\nRepsol officials maintained that, per company statutes, the acquisition by any one party of stock held by Repsol equaling a 15% stake or more would trigger a mandatory purchase of Repsol's entire 57% stake (rather than the 51% sought). Repsol officials calculated compensation by multiplying the highest price earnings ratio reached by YPF in the prior two years by its earnings per share in 2011, and arrived at US$10.5 billion for a 57% stake. Argentine Deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof rejected these demands, however, citing debts of nearly US$9 billion. The book value of YPF was US$4.4 billion at the end of 2011; its total market capitalization on the day of the announcement was US$10.4 billion. Repsol claimed that the Argentine Government drove down YPF shares ahead of the announcement (market price of the shares declined by over half from February to April), and chairman Antoni Brufau estimated the company's potential loss at €5.7 billion (US$7.5 billion). \nRepsol retaliated by canceling nine shipments of liquefied natural gas to Argentine state energy distributor Enarsa, claiming the government breached contracts following the seizure of YPF. Repsol filed a lawsuit at the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes on May 15. The Government of Spain petitioned the European Commissioner for Trade for sanctions against Argentine exports. The Spanish Government did unilaterally curtail biodiesel purchases from Argentina (its main provider), as well as from Indonesia. Following a complaint filed at the World Trade Organization by the Argentine Government as well as higher costs for biodiesel distributors in Spain itself however, boycotts of both Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel were lifted by January 2013.\n\nAn audit of Repsol documents conducted by Kicillof and Planning Minister Julio de Vido in May uncovered what Kicillof described as a \"debasement of the company and a policy of creating shortages that would raise domestic prices to those prevailing internationally;\" these findings were published on June 1 in the Mosconi Report. The Government of the Province of Santa Cruz published the results of an investigation of 13,000 inactive YPF oil wells on May 14, finding that 8,000 of these leaked and that at least US$3.5 billion of environmental damage had been caused by these; an environmental law enacted by the province in 2010 mandated the inventory and maintenance of all such wells. Other claims, including environmental damage in five other provinces, a tax debt in Chubut Province, and a judicial injunction issued against Repsol over their illegal sale in 2011 of 45 million shares belonging to an employees' severance fund, raised their potential liability to US$15 billion.\n\nAn agreement was reached with Repsol on November 27, 2013, whereby the latter would be compensated for a 51% stake in YPF with approximately US$5 billion in 10-year corporate bonds. Repsol sold its remaining 12% stake to Morgan Stanley the following May.\n\nThe largest minority shareholder, the Petersen Group, held a 25% stake at the time of the renationalization, and had financed their initial purchase of 15% of the stock in 2007 with a vendor's loan from Repsol for €1.5 billion. The chairman and majority owner of the Petersen Group, Enrique Eskenazi, was close to President Néstor Kirchner, who supported Eskenazi's bid to become YPF's principal Argentine stockholder. Eskenazi benefited from a dividend distribution rate at YPF of 90%, which allowed the Group to repay its vendor's loan in installments. The 2008 agreement required Repsol to buy back shares owned by the Group and to assume the loan should the Madrid-based firm lose majority control of YPF. Sebastián Eskenazi, the son of the Petersen Group chairman and CEO of YPF until April 16, indicated however that the group would forego this option. The Group defaulted in May on a Credit Suisse loan taken in 2011 to raise its stake in YPF from 15% to 25%. Officials at Credit Suisse and at other creditors involved, including Banco Itaú, BNP Paribas, and Goldman Sachs, announced on May 11 that the Group's shares would be repossessed as collateral. Repsol, as another of the Group's creditors affected by their default, also repossessed a block of shares, thus increasing their stake in YPF to 12%; following a steep rally in YPF shares, Repsol sold its stake a year later.\n\nThe Argentine Senate approved the takeover on April 26 with 63 votes in favor of the measure, three opposing it and four abstentions. The Chamber of Deputies approved the bill on May 4 with 208 votes out of 257, and the president signed the renationalization into law on May 5. Miguel Galluccio, an Argentine petroleum engineer with experience at both YPF and at oilfield services leader Schlumberger as president of its production management division in London, was appointed CEO.\n\nGalluccio presented an investment program on June 5, 2012, to increase oil exploration by tenfold and gas exploration by twenty-fold, with the goal of raising production of oil and gas by 6% annually and of refined fuel by over 7% annually over five years. The US$39 billion plan would be largely self-financed, as well as by investments from Chevron Corporation and the periodic issuance of high-yield, 8.75% corporate bonds. These bond issuances were raised to US$1.5 billion per series in April 2015, as demand surged to US$4 billion.\n\nYPF acquired a controlling stake in Metrogas (the nation's largest gas distributor) in November. YPF stock rose by 190% from its post-nationalization depths in mid-2012 to the announcement of a compensation agreement with Repsol in November 2013. Production declines of 6% annually under Repsol were likewise reversed. Overall output rose by 3% in 2013, and a further 8.7% in oil and 12.5% in gas during 2014. Output increased a further 3% in 2015.\n\nDevelopment prospects for the \"Vaca Muerta\" field, which by 2014 was estimated to contain at least 23 billion barrels of oil, attracted numerous joint exploratory ventures in subsequent years. The most significant such joint ventures include those signed with Chevron, Dow Chemical, and Petronas. The Vaca Muerta block operated jointly with Chevron produced 35,000 m³ daily by 2014.\n\nMiguel Galuccio announced his resignation as CEO, effective April 30, 2016.\n\n"}

The same terms were used for similar boroughs represented in the 18th-century Parliament of Ireland.\n\nOld Sarum in Wiltshire (pictured) was the most notorious pocket borough. It was a possession of the Pitt family from the mid-17th century until 1802, and one of its Members of Parliament was Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder. In 1802 the Pitt family sold it for £60,000, even though the land and manorial rights were worth £700 a year (which would be equivalent to a capital sum of around £20,000 at most).\n\nA parliamentary borough was a town which was incorporated under a royal charter, giving it the right to send two elected burgesses as Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons. It was not unusual for the physical boundary of the settlement to change as the town developed or contracted over time, for example due to changes in its trade and industry, so that the boundaries of the parliamentary borough and of the physical settlement were no longer the same.\n\nFor centuries, constituencies electing members to the House of Commons did not change to reflect population shifts, and in some places the number of electors became so few that they could be bribed by a single wealthy patron. In the 19th century, proponents of reform gave these boroughs the derogatory appellations \"rotten boroughs\" or \"pocket boroughs\", or more formally \"nomination boroughs\", because their democratic processes were rotten and their parliamentary member(s) were elected by the whim of the patron, thus \"in his pocket\"; the actual votes of the electors were a mere formality, all or a majority being willing to vote as the patron instructed them, with or without bribery. As voting was by show of hands at a single polling station at a single time, none dared to vote contrary to the instructions of the patron. Often only one candidate would be nominated (or two for a two-seat constituency), so that the election was uncontested.\n\nThus an MP might represent only a few constituents, while at the same time many new towns, which had grown due to increased trade and industry, were entirely unrepresented, or inadequately represented. For example, before 1832 the town of Manchester, which expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution from a small settlement into a large city, was merely part of the larger county constituency of Lancashire and did not elect its own MPs.\n\nMany of these ancient boroughs elected two MPs. By the time of the 1831 general election, out of 406 elected members, 152 were chosen by fewer than 100 voters each, and 88 by fewer than fifty voters.\n\nBy the early 19th century moves were made towards reform, with eventual success, when the Reform Act 1832 disenfranchised the rotten boroughs and redistributed representation in Parliament to new major population centres. The Ballot Act 1872 introduced the secret ballot, which greatly hindered patrons from controlling elections by preventing them from knowing how an elector had voted. At the same time, the practice of paying or entertaining voters (\"treating\") was outlawed, and election expenses fell dramatically.\n\nThe term \"rotten borough\" came into use in the 18th century; it meant a parliamentary borough with a tiny electorate, so small that voters were susceptible to control in a variety of ways, as it had declined in population and importance since its early days. The word \"rotten\" had the connotation of corruption as well as long-term decline. In such boroughs most or all of the few electors could not vote as they pleased, due to the lack of a secret ballot and their dependency on the \"owner\" of the borough. Only rarely were the views or personal character of a candidate taken into consideration, except by the minority of voters who were not beholden to a particular interest.\n\nTypically, rotten boroughs had gained their representation in Parliament when they were more flourishing centres, but the borough's boundaries had never been updated, or else they had become depopulated or even deserted over the centuries. Some had once been important places or had played a major role in England's history, but had fallen into insignificance as for example industry moved away.\n\nFor example, in the 12th century Old Sarum had been a busy cathedral city, reliant on the wealth expended by its own Sarum Cathedral within its city precincts, but it was abandoned when the present Salisbury Cathedral (also called \"New Sarum\") was founded nearby on a new site, which immediately attracted merchants and workers who built up a new town around it. Despite this dramatic loss of population, the borough of Old Sarum retained its right to elect two MPs.\n\nMany such rotten boroughs were controlled by landowners and peers who might give the seats in Parliament to their like-minded friends or relations, or who went to parliament themselves, if they were not already members of the House of Lords. Commonly also they sold them for money or other favours; the peers who controlled such boroughs had a double influence in Parliament as they themselves held seats in the House of Lords. This patronage was based on property rights which could be inherited and passed on to heirs, or else sold, like any other form of property.\n\nBefore being awarded a peerage, Arthur Wellesley, later Duke of Wellington, served in the Irish House of Commons as a Member for the rotten borough of Trim.\n\nPocket boroughs were boroughs which could effectively be controlled by a single person who owned at least half of the \"burgage tenements\", the occupants of which had the right to vote in the borough's parliamentary elections. A wealthy patron therefore had merely to buy up these specially qualified houses and install in them his own tenants, selected for their willingness to do their landlord's bidding, or given such precarious forms of tenure that they dared not displease him. As there was no secret ballot until 1872, the landowner could evict electors who did not vote for the man he wanted. A common expression referring to such a situation was that \"Mr A had been elected on Lord B's interest\".\n\nThere were also boroughs which were controlled not by a particular patron but rather by the Crown, specifically by the departments of state of the Treasury or Admiralty, and which thus returned the candidates nominated by the ministers in charge of those departments.\n\nSome rich individuals controlled several boroughs; for example, the Duke of Newcastle is said to have had seven boroughs \"in his pocket\". The representative of a pocket borough was often the man who owned the land, and for this reason they were also referred to as proprietarial boroughs.\n\nPocket boroughs were seen by their 19th-century owners as a valuable method of ensuring the representation of the landed interest in the House of Commons.\n\nSignificantly diminished by the Reform Act of 1832, pocket boroughs were finally abolished by the Reform Act of 1867. This considerably extended the borough franchise and established the principle that each parliamentary constituency should hold roughly the same number of electors. Boundary commissions were set up by subsequent Acts of Parliament to maintain this principle as population movements continued.\n\nIn the late 18th century, many political societies, like the London Corresponding Society and the Society of the Friends of the People, called for Parliamentary reform. Specifically, they thought that the rotten borough system was unfair, and they called for a more equal distribution of representatives that reflected the population of Britain. However, the legislative reign of terror of William Pitt caused these societies to disband by enacting legislation that made it illegal for these societies to meet or publish information.\n\nIn the 19th century, there were moves towards \"Reform\", which broadly meant ending the over-representation of boroughs with few electors. The issue which finally brought the Reform issue to a head was the arrival of Catholic Emancipation in 1829, and the Reform movement had a major success in the Reform Act 1832, which disfranchised the 57 rotten boroughs listed below, most of them in the south and west of England, and redistributed representation in Parliament to new major population centres and to places with significant industries, which tended to be farther north.\n\n\n\n\n\nA substantial number of Tory constituencies lay in rotten and pocket boroughs, and their right to representation was defended by the successive Tory governments in office between 1807 and 1830. During this period they came under criticism from prominent figures such as Tom Paine and William Cobbett.\n\nIt was argued in defence of such boroughs that they provided stability and were also a means for promising young politicians to enter parliament, with William Pitt the Elder being cited as a key example. Some Members of Parliament who were generally in favour of the boroughs claimed they should be kept, as Britain had undergone periods of prosperity while they were part of the constitution of parliament.\n\nBecause British colonists in the West Indies and British North America, and those in the Indian subcontinent, had no representation of their own at Westminster, representatives of these groups often claimed that rotten boroughs provided opportunities for virtual representation in parliament for colonial interest groups.\n\nThe Tory politician Spencer Perceval asked the nation to look at the system as a whole, saying that if pocket boroughs were disfranchised, the whole system was liable to collapse.\n\nThe magazine \"Private Eye\" has a column entitled 'Rotten Boroughs', which lists stories of municipal wrongdoing; \"borough\" is used here in its usual sense of a local district rather than a parliamentary constituency.\n\nIn his book \"The Age of Consent\", George Monbiot compared small island states with one vote in the U.N. General Assembly to \"rotten boroughs\".\n\nThe term \"rotten borough\" is sometimes used as a pejorative epithet for electorates used to gain political leverage. In Hong Kong and Macau, functional constituencies (with small voter bases attached to special interests) are often referred to as 'rotten boroughs' by long-time columnist Jake van der Kamp. In New Zealand, the term has been used to refer to electorates which – by dint of an agreement for a larger party – have been won by a minor party, enabling that party to gain more seats under the country's proportional representation system. The London Borough of Tower Hamlets has also been referred to as a \"rotten borough\" owing to the electoral process receiving interference from Tower Hamlets First members.\n\nIn the satirical novel \"Melincourt, or Sir Oran Haut-Ton\" (1817) by Thomas Love Peacock, an orang-utan named Sir Oran Haut-ton is elected to parliament by the \"ancient and honourable borough of Onevote\". The election of Sir Oran forms part of the hero's plan to persuade civilisation to share his belief that orang-utans are a race of human beings who merely lack the power of speech. \"The borough of Onevote stood in the middle of a heath, and consisted of a solitary farm, of which the land was so poor and intractable, that it would not have been worth the while of any human being to cultivate it, had not the Duke of Rottenburgh found it very well worth his while to pay his tenant for living there, to keep the honourable borough in existence.\" The single voter of the borough is Mr Christopher Corporate, who elects two MPs, each of whom \"can only be considered as the representative of half of him\".\n\nIn the parliamentary novels of Anthony Trollope rotten boroughs are a recurring theme. John Grey, Phineas Finn, and Lord Silverbridge are all elected by rotten boroughs.\n\nIn Chapter 7 of the novel \"Vanity Fair\", author William Makepeace Thackeray introduces the fictitious borough of \"Queen's Crawley,\" so named in honor of a stopover in the small Hampshire town of Crawley by Queen Elizabeth I, who being delighted by the quality of the local beer instantly raised the small town of Crawley into a borough, giving it two members in Parliament. At the time of the story, in the early 19th century, the place had lost population, so that it was \"come down to that condition of borough which used to be denominated rotten.\"\n\nIn Charles Dickens' novel \"Our Mutual Friend\" (1864-1865), Mr. Veneering is elected MP to a borough called \"Pocket-Breaches\".\n\n\"Rotten Borough\" was a controversial story published by Oliver Anderson under the pen name Julian Pine in 1937, republished in 1989.\n\nIn Diana Wynne Jones' 2003 book \"The Merlin Conspiracy\", Old Sarum features as a character, with one line being \"I'm a rotten borough, I am.\"\n\nIn the Aubrey–Maturin series of seafaring tales, the pocket borough of Milport (also known as Milford) is initially held by General Aubrey, the father of protagonist Jack Aubrey. In the twelfth novel in the series, \"The Letter of Marque\", Jack's father dies and the seat is offered to Jack himself by his cousin Edward Norton, the \"owner\" of the borough. The borough has just seventeen electors, all of whom are tenants of Mr Norton.\n\nIn the first novel of George MacDonald Fraser's \"The Flashman Papers\" series, the eponymous antihero, Harry Flashman, mentions that his father, Sir Buckley Flashman, had been in Parliament, but \"they did for him at Reform,\" implying that the elder Flashman's seat was in a rotten or pocket borough.\n\nIn the episode \"Dish and Dishonesty\" of the BBC television comedy \"Blackadder the Third\", Edmund Blackadder attempts to bolster the support of the Prince Regent in Parliament by getting the incompetent Baldrick elected to the fictional rotten borough of \"Dunny-on-the-Wold\". This was easily accomplished with a result of 16,472 to nil, even though the constituency had only one voter (Blackadder himself).\n\nIn the video game, Assassin's Creed III pocket and rotten boroughs are briefly mentioned in a database entry entitled \"Pocket Boroughs\", and Old Sarum is mentioned as one of the worst examples of a pocket borough. In the game, shortly before the Boston Massacre an NPC can be heard speaking to a group of people on the colonies lack of representation in Parliament and lists several rotten boroughs including Old Sarum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The newly designated lands and inland waterways would comprise the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness, a new component of the National Wilderness Preservation System.\n\nIt was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. On March 13, 2014, it was signed into law as by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is a United States National Lakeshore located along the northwest coast of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan in Leelanau County and Benzie County. The park covers a 35-mile (60-km) stretch of Lake Michigan's eastern coastline, as well as North and South Manitou Islands. This northern Michigan park was established primarily because of its outstanding natural features, including forests, beaches, dune formations, and ancient glacial phenomena. The Lakeshore also contains many cultural features including the 1871 South Manitou Island Lighthouse, three former Life-Saving Service/Coast Guard Stations and an extensive rural historic farm district. In 2011 the area won the title of \"The Most Beautiful Place in America\" from Good Morning America.\n\n\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.\"\n\nThe Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act would designate specified land and inland water within the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Michigan, to be known as the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness, as wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System.\n\nThe bill would require the boundary of the Wilderness to be: (1) 100 feet from the centerline of adjacent county roads, and (2) 300 feet from the centerline of adjacent state highways.\n\nThe bill would specify this Act's effect on: (1) the maintenance and improvement of roads located outside the boundary of the Wilderness; (2) Michigan's jurisdiction with respect to the management of fish and wildlife, including hunting and fishing, within the National Lakeshore; and (3) any treaty rights or any existing valid private property rights.\n\n\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on March 14, 2013.

The newly designated lands and inland waterways would comprise the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness, a new component of the National Wilderness Preservation System.\n\nBased on information from the United States National Park Service, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the bill would have no significant impact on the federal budget. More than 30,000 of the affected acres have been managed as wilderness since 1981, and CBO estimates that the potential impact of the designation on public use would be minor. Enacting S. 23 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.\n\nS. 23 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.\n\nThe Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act was introduced into the United States Senate on January 22, 2013 by Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It was reported by the committee alongside Senate Report 113-14. On June 19, 2013, it passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It was received in the United States House of Representatives on June 20, 2013 and referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. On February 29, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that S. 23 would be considered under a suspension of the rules on March 3, 2014. Consideration was delayed until March 4, 2014 due to a snowstorm in Washington D.C. The House voted on March 3, 2014 to pass the bill by a voice vote. On March 13, 2014, it was signed into law as by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Wilderness Society called the dunes \"a slice of tranquility along the coast of Lake Michigan\" that \"is known for the gorgeous sunsets over towering dunes.\"\n\nRepresentative Dan Benishek, who supported the bill, expressed his pleasure that the bill \"was developed locally,\" describing it as \"the ideal way federal land management should occur, with input from the local communities.\" The bill was supported locally by the group Citizens for Access to the Lakeshore. The president of that organization, Jeannette Feeheley, said that the bill would take care of \"the problems we had tried to resolve back in 2002.\"\n\nHowever, some opponents objected to the length of the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail and to the locations that it would stop at.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7436762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7436762", "title": "Term limits in the United States", "text": "Term limits in the United States\n\nTerm limits in the United States apply to many offices at both the federal and state level, and date back to the American Revolution.\n\nTerm limits, also referred to as \"rotation in office\", restrict the number of terms of office an officeholder may hold. For example, according to the 22nd Amendment, the President of the United States can serve two four-year terms and serve no more than 10 years. \n\nTerm limits date back to the American Revolution, and prior to that to the democracies and republics of antiquity. The council of 500 in ancient Athens rotated its entire membership annually, as did the ephorate in ancient Sparta. The ancient Roman Republic featured a system of elected magistrates—tribunes of the plebs, aediles, quaestors, praetors, and consuls —who served a single term of one year, with re-election to the same magistracy forbidden for ten years \"(see cursus honorum)\". According to historian Garrett Fagan, office holding in the Roman Republic was based on \"limited tenure of office\" which ensured that \"authority circulated frequently\", helping to prevent corruption. An additional benefit of the \"cursus honorum\" or \"Run of Offices\" was to bring the \"most experienced\" politicians to the upper echelons of power-holding in the ancient republic. Many of the founders of the United States were educated in the classics, and quite familiar with rotation in office during antiquity. The debates of that day reveal a desire to study and profit from the object lessons offered by ancient democracy.\n\nPrior to independence, several colonies had already experimented with term limits. The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut of 1639, for example, prohibited the colonial governor from serving consecutive terms, setting terms at one year's length, and holding \"that no person be chosen Governor above once in two years.\" Shortly after independence, the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 set maximum service in the Pennsylvania General Assembly at \"four years in seven\". Benjamin Franklin's influence is seen not only in that he chaired the constitutional convention which drafted the Pennsylvania constitution, but also because it included, virtually unchanged, Franklin's earlier proposals on executive rotation. Pennsylvania's plural executive was composed of twelve citizens elected for the term of three years, followed by a mandatory vacation of four years.\n\nThe Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, established term limits for the delegates to the Continental Congress, mandating in Article V that \"no person shall be capable of being a delegate for more than three years in any term of six years.\"\n\nOn October 2, 1789, the Continental Congress appointed a committee of thirteen to examine forms of government for the impending union of the states. Among the proposals was that from the State of Virginia, written by Thomas Jefferson, urging a limitation of tenure, \"to prevent every danger which might arise to American freedom by continuing too long in office the members of the Continental Congress\". The committee made recommendations, which as regards congressional term limits were incorporated unchanged into the Articles of Confederation (1781–89). The fifth Article stated that \"no person shall be capable of being a delegate [to the continental congress] for more than three years in any term of six years\".\n\nIn contrast to the Articles of Confederation, the federal constitution convention at Philadelphia omitted mandatory term limits from the U.S. Constitution of 1789. At the convention, some delegates spoke passionately against term limits such as Rufus King, who said \"that he who has proved himself to be most fit for an Office, ought not to be excluded by the constitution from holding it.\" The Electoral College, it was believed by some delegates at the convention, could have a role to play in limiting unfit officers from continuing.\n\nWhen the states ratified the Constitution (1787–88), several leading statesmen regarded the lack of mandatory limits to tenure as a dangerous defect, especially, they thought, as regards the presidency and the Senate. Richard Henry Lee viewed the absence of legal limits to tenure, together with certain other features of the Constitution, as \"most highly and dangerously oligarchic\". Both Jefferson and George Mason advised limits on reelection to the Senate and to the Presidency, because said Mason, \"nothing is so essential to the preservation of a Republican government as a periodic rotation\". The historian Mercy Otis Warren, warned that \"there is no provision for a rotation, nor anything to prevent the perpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little well-timed bribery, will probably be done\".\n\nMichael Korzi says George Washington did not set the informal precedent for a two-term limit for the Presidency. He only meant he was too worn out to personally continue in office. It was Thomas Jefferson who made it a principle in 1808. He made many statements calling for term limits in one form or another.\n\nThe tradition was challenged by Ulysses Grant in 1880, and by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Otherwise no major effort to avoid it took place until 1940 when Franklin Roosevelt explicitly broke it. The 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1951 formally establishing in law the two-term limit—although it did not apply to the incumbent Harry Truman.\n\nThe fact that \"perpetuity in office\" was not approached until the 20th century is due in part to the influence of rotation in office as a popular 19th-century concept. \"Ideas are, in truth, forces\", and rotation in office enjoyed such normative support, especially at the local level, that it altered political reality. For a detailed study of the 19th-century concepts of rotation, consult \"Political Science Quarterly\", vol. 94, \"House Turnover and the Principle of Rotation\", by Robert Struble, Jr. See also his \"Treatise on Twelve Lights\", chapter six, \"Rotation in History\". Consult also, James Young's \"The Washington Community, 1800–1828\".\n\nAccording to Young, the tendency to look with mistrust upon political power was so ingrained into American culture that even the officeholders themselves perceived their occupations in a disparaging light. James Fenimore Cooper described the common view that \"contact with the affairs of state is one of the most corrupting of the influences to which men are exposed\". An article in the \"Richmond Enquirer\" (1822) noted that the \"long cherished\" principle of rotation in office had been impressed on the republican mind \"by a kind of intuitive impulse, unassailable to argument or authority\".\n\nBeginning about the 1830s, Jacksonian democracy introduced a less idealistic twist to the practice of limiting terms. Rotation in office came to mean taking turns in the distribution of political prizes. Rotation of nominations to the U.S. House of Representatives—the prizes—became a key element of payoffs to the party faithful. The leading lights in the local party machinery came to regard a nomination for the House as \"salary\" for political services rendered. A new code of political ethics evolved, based on the proposition that \"turnabout is fair play\". In short, rotation of nominations was intertwined with the spoils system.\n\nIn district nominating conventions local leaders could negotiate and enforce agreements to pass the nominations around among themselves. Abraham Lincoln was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 under such a bargain, and he returned home to Springfield after a single congressional term because, he wrote, \"to enter myself as a competitor of another, or to authorize anyone so to enter me, is what my word and honor forbid\".\n\nDuring the Civil War, the Confederate States Constitution limited its president to a single six-year term.\n\nThe practice of nomination rotation for the House of Representatives began to decline after the Civil War. It took a generation or so before the direct primary system, civil service reforms, and the ethic of professionalism worked to eliminate rotation in office as a common political practice. By the turn of the 20th century the era of incumbency was coming into full swing.\n\nA total of 8 presidents served two full terms and declined a third and three presidents served one full term and refused a second. After World War II, however, an officeholder class had developed to the point that congressional tenure rivaled that of the U.S. Supreme Court, where tenure is for life.\n\n\"Homesteading,\" or securing a lifelong career in Congress, was made possible by reelection rates that approached 100% by the end of the 20th century. The concept of homesteading brought about a popular movement known as the \"term-limits movement\". The elections of 1990–94 saw the adoption of term limits for state legislatures in almost every state where citizens had the power of the initiative. In addition, 23 states limited service in their delegation to Congress. As they pertain to Congress, these laws are no longer enforceable, however, as in 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned congressional term limits in \"U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton\", ruling that state governments cannot limit the terms of members of the national government.\n\nWhere rotation in the legislative branch has withstood court challenges, term limits continue to garner popular support. As of 2002, the advocacy group \"U.S. Term Limits\" found that in the 17 states where state legislators served in rotation, public support for term limits ranged from 60 to 78 percent.\n\nAs of 2013, term limits at the federal level are restricted to the executive branch and some agencies. Judicial appointments at the federal level are made for life, and are not subject to election or to term limits. The U.S. Congress remains (since the Thornton decision of 1995) without electoral limits.\n\nThe third president, Thomas Jefferson, started the tradition of presidential term limits by refusing to run for a third term in 1808. Everything the first president did obviously set a precedent, but did not necessarily set a new policy. However George Washington's decision in 1796 not to run for a third term has sometimes been given credit as the start of a \"tradition\" of the strong policy that no president should ever run for a third term. Washington wanted to retire when his first term ended in 1792 but all his advisors begged him to stand for reelection. By 1796 he insisted on retiring, for he felt worn out, and was disgusted with the virulent personal attacks on his integrity. His Farewell Address very briefly mentioned why he would not run for a third term, and goes on to give a great deal of political advice. But he does not mention of term limits . After his death his refusal to run was explained in terms of a \"no-third-tradition\". Historian David Crocket argues, \"The argument for term limits has a solid and respectable pedigree. Contrary to popular belief, however, that pedigree does not begin with George Washington.\" \n\nPolitically Washington felt the stability of the republic required a contested presidential election with a choice of candidates, which would not happen if he ran again. If he won and then died a vice president would take over who was not elected and his goal would fail. (He in fact did die in 1799 two years into the new term). The election went forward and he was absolutely neutral between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. He personally did not feel bound by a two-term limit. In the 1780s, about half the states provided term limits for governors. The Constitutional convention of 1787 discussed the issue and decided not to do so. \"The matter was fairly discussed in the Convention,\" Washington wrote in 1788, \"and to my full convictions ... I can see no propriety in precluding ourselves from the services of any man, who on some great emergency shall be deemed universally, most capable of serving the Public\" even after serving two terms. The Constitution, Washington explained, retained sufficient checks against political corruption and stagnant leadership without a presidential term limits provision. Jefferson, however, strongly endorsed a policy of term limits. He rejected calls from supporters that he run for a third term in 1808, telling several state legislatures in 1807-1808 that he needed to support \"the sound precedent set by [his] illustrious predecessor.\" \n\nThomas Jefferson mentioned that Washington retired after serving only two terms, without mentioning that Washington opposed the policy Jefferson was proposing. Crockett argues that Washington, \"did not intentionally establish the so-called two-term tradition; his departure was motivated by a desire to demonstrate that the country could function without him and to retire to Mount Vernon. He made no principled argument for limiting presidents to two terms, and in fact disagreed with Thomas Jefferson on this point.\" The \"two term tradition\" was created in 1807-1808 and it mistakenly suggested Washington had launched the policy. \nIn 1861 the Confederate States of America adopted a six-year term for their president and vice-president and barred the president from seeking re-election. That innovation was endorsed by many American politicians after the Civil War, most notably by Rutherford B. Hayes in his inaugural address. Ulysses Grant was urged to run for a third term in 1876, but he refused. He did try for the 1880 nomination but was defeated in part because of anti-third-term sentiment. Theodore Roosevelt had already served over 7 years and in 1912, after a four-year hiatus, ran for a third term. He was violently criticized--indeed almost killed by John Flammang Schrank, who was obsessed with stopping a third term.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (president, 1933–1945) in 1940 was the only president to break the tradition, winning a third term in 1940 and a fourth term in 1944. This gave rise to a successful move to formalize the traditional two-term limit by amending the U.S. Constitution. As ratified in 1951, the Twenty-Second Amendment provides that \"no person shall be elected to the office of President more than twice\". The new Amendment explicitly did not apply to the incumbent, President Harry S. Truman. However all his close advisors, pointing to his age, his failing abilities, and his poor showing in the polls, talked him out of it. \n\nReformers during the early 1990s used the initiative and referendum to put congressional term limits on the ballot in 24 states. Voters in eight of these states approved the congressional term limits by an average electoral margin of two to one. It was an open question whether states had the constitutional authority to enact these limits. In May 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in \"U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton\", , that states cannot impose term limits upon their federal Representatives or Senators.\n\nIn the 1994 elections, part of the Republican platform included legislation for term limits in Congress. After winning the majority, a Republican congressman brought a constitutional amendment to the House floor that proposed limiting members of the Senate to two six-year terms and members of the House to six two-year terms. However, this rate of rotation was so slow (the life-tenured Supreme Court averages in the vicinity of twelve years) that the congressional version of term-limits garnered little support among the populist backers of term limits, including U.S. Term Limits, the largest private organization pushing for congressional term limits. The bill got only a bare majority (227–204), falling short of the two-thirds majority (290) needed for constitutional amendments. Three other term limit amendment bills failed to get more than 200 votes.\n\nDefeated in Congress and overridden by the Supreme Court, the federal term limit movement was brought to a halt. The term limits intended simultaneously to reform state legislatures (as distinguished from the federal congressional delegations) remain in force, however, in fifteen states.\n\nIn 2007 Larry J. Sabato revived the debate over term limits by arguing in \"A More Perfect Constitution\" that the success and popularity of term limits at the state level suggests that they should be adopted at the federal level as well. He specifically put forth the idea of congressional term limits and suggested a national constitutional convention be used to accomplish the amendment, since the Congress would be unlikely to propose and adopt any amendment that limits its own power.\n\nSome state legislators have also expressed their opinions on term limits. It is confirmed that in the following five states—and there may be others—state lawmakers approved resolutions asking Congress to propose a federal constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms which members of Congress may serve:\n\nLegal scholars have discussed whether or not to impose term limits on the Supreme Court of the United States. Currently, Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life \"during good behavior\". A sentiment has developed, among certain scholars, that the Supreme Court may not be accountable in a way that is most in line with the spirit of checks and balances. Equally, scholars have argued that life tenure has taken on a new meaning in a modern context. Changes in medical care have markedly raised life expectancy and therefore has allowed Justices to serve for longer than ever before. Steven G. Calebresi and James Lindgren, professors of law at Northwestern University, argued that, because vacancies in the court are occurring with less frequency and justices served on average, between 1971 and 2006, for 26.1 years, the \"efficacy of the democratic check that the appointment process provides on the Court's membership\" is reduced. There have been several similar proposals to implement term limits for the nation's highest court, including Professor of Law at Duke University, Paul Carrington's 2005 \"The Supreme Court Renewal Act of 2005\".\n\nMany of the proposals center around a term limit for Justices that would be 18 years (Larry Sabato, Professor of Political Science at University of Virginia, suggested between 15 and 18 years). The proposed staggered term limits of 18 years would, according to Calebresi, Lindgren (2006), and Carrington (2005), allow for a new appointment to the Court every two years, which in effect would allow every president at least two appointments. Professor Carrington has argued that such a measure would not require a constitutional amendment as the \"Constitution doesn’t even mention life tenure; it merely requires that justices serve during ‘good behaviour’ \". The idea was not without support among Judges, as John Roberts supported term limits before he was appointed to the Supreme Court as Chief Justice. Calebresi, Lingren, and Carrington have also proposed that when justices have served out their proposed 18-year term they should be able to sit on other Federal Courts until retirement, death, or removal.\n\nFairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll measured American voters’ attitudes towards various proposed Supreme Court reforms, including implementing term limits. The 2010 poll found that a majority of Americans were largely unaware of a proposal to impose a term limit of 18 years, as 82% reported they had heard little or nothing at all. Notwithstanding a lack of awareness, 52% of Americans approved of limiting terms to 18 years, while 35% disapproved. When asked how old is too old for a Supreme Court judge to serve if he or she seems healthy, 48% said \"no limit as long as he or she is healthy\", while 31% agreed that anyone over the age of 70 is too old.\n\nSome state lawmakers have officially expressed to Congress a desire for a federal constitutional amendment to limit terms of Supreme Court justices as well as of judges of federal courts below the Supreme Court level. While there might be others, below are three known examples:\n\nTerm limits for state officials have existed since colonial times. The Pennsylvania Charter of Liberties of 1682, and the colonial frame of government of the same year, both authored by William Penn, provided for triennial rotation of the provincial council—the upper house of the colonial legislature. The Delaware Constitution of 1776 limited the governor to a single three-year term; currently, the governor of Delaware can serve two four-year terms.\n\nAt present, 36 states have term limits of various types for their governors. To circumvent the term limit in Alabama incumbent governor George Wallace pushed through the nomination of his wife Lurleen, in the 1966 Democratic primary, which was, in those days, the real contest in Alabama. It was generally understood that Mrs. Wallace would only be a titular governor while her husband continued to hold the real power. She won the election, but only served 16 months before dying in 1968.\n\nAs indicated above, in fifteen state legislatures the members serve in rotation, i.e., under term limits enacted during the reforms of the early 1990s. In another six states, however, state legislatures have either overturned their own limits or state supreme courts have ruled such limits unconstitutional. In 2002 the Idaho Legislature became the first legislature of its kind to repeal its own term limits, enacted by a public vote in 1994, ostensibly because it applied to local officials along with the legislature.\n\nGovernors of 36 states and four territories are subject to various term limits, while the governors of 14 states, Puerto Rico, and the Mayor of Washington, D.C., may serve an unlimited number of terms. Each state's gubernatorial term limits are prescribed by its state constitution, with the exception of Wyoming, whose limits are found in its statutes. Territorial term limits are prescribed by its constitution in the Northern Mariana Islands, the Organic Acts in Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and by statute in American Samoa.\n\nUnique in its restriction, Virginia prohibits its governors from serving \"consecutive\" terms, although former governors are reeligible after four years out of office. Many other states formerly had this prohibition, but all had eliminated it by 2000.\n\nThe governors of the following states and territories are limited to two consecutive terms, but are reeligible after four years out of office: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Equivalently, the Governors of Indiana and Oregon are limited to serving 8 out of any 12 years. Conversely, the Governors of Montana and Wyoming are limited to two terms, serving 8 out of any 16 years. Finally, the governors of the following states and territory are limited to two terms for life: Arkansas, California, Delaware, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Oklahoma. The current Governor of California (Jerry Brown) is, however, serving a fourth non-consecutive term because his first two terms were before limits were passed in California, and the limits did not apply to individuals' prior terms.\n\nThe governors of New Hampshire and Vermont may serve unlimited two-year terms. The governors (or equivalent) in the following states, district, and territory may serve unlimited four-year terms: Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The Governor of Utah was previously limited to serving three terms, but all term limit laws have since been repealed by the legislature.\n\nThe following 15 legislatures have term limits:\n\nThe following six legislatures have had their term limits nullified:\n\nSome local governments have term limits. In Philadelphia, the mayor cannot be elected three consecutive times, but there is no limit on how long any individual can serve as mayor. Frank Rizzo was elected mayor in 1971 and 1975; he attempted to repeal the term limit, but failed and could not run in 1979. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1983 but he lost to Wilson Goode. In 1986, he switched to the Republican Party, and ran as a Republican in the mayoral elections of 1987 and 1991.\n\nLimits vary from city to city even within the same state. For example, Houston, Texas, has a limit of 2 four-year terms (prior to November 3, 2015, 3 two-year terms dating back to 1991), while San Antonio, Texas, has a limit of 4 two-year terms. Both Houston and San Antonio's term limits are absolute; elected officeholders are ineligible to run for the same position where seeking higher office is common.\n\nA two-term limit was imposed on New York City Council members and citywide elected officials (except for district attorneys) in New York City after a 1993 referendum (see the Charter of the City of New York, § 1138). On November 3, 2008, however, when Michael Bloomberg was in his second term of mayor, the City Council approved the extension of the two-term limit to a three-term limit; one year later, he was elected to a third term. The two-term limit was reinstated after a referendum in 2010.\n\nIn Los Angeles the mayor serves up to two four-year terms since 1993, while the City Council serve up to three four-year terms.\n\nIn Cincinnati, Ohio, the term limit for mayor is two successive four-year terms. Council members are limited to two successive four-year terms. There is no limit to total terms that may be served, just a limit on successive terms.\n\nIn New Orleans, City Council members are limited to two four-year terms. However, a council member representing one of the five council districts may run for one of the two at-large seats on the council once they reach the two-term limit, and vice versa. There is no limit on the number of terms a council member may serve in a lifetime. Since 1954, the mayor of New Orleans has been limited to two consecutive four-year elected terms, but he or she may be elected again after sitting out one four-year term. When the new city plan of government was adopted, the mayor at the time, DeLesseps Story Morrison, was exempt from term limits due to a grandfather clause. \n\nUnder the original Metropolitan Charter adopted in 1962, the mayor of Nashville was limited to three consecutive four-year terms, which was subsequently reduced to two consecutive four-year terms in 1991. Councilors were likewise limited to two consecutive four-year terms, but subsequent court rulings have determined the offices of district councilor and at-large councilor to be separate offices even though all councilors serve together in one unicameral body, which has meant that at large councilors have continued in office as district members, and (more frequently) district councilors have been elected to subsequent terms as at large councilors.\n\n\n\n"}

The Executive Committee received endorsements from influential Japanese and gathered signatures from across the world. On April 9, 2014, they received a report from the Norwegian Nobel Committee that the committee had received the recommendation. On May 22, 2014, Hiroyuki Konishi, Yoshiko Kira and other Members of the Parliament (Diet) of Japan announced that they had submitted the recommendation via the Norwegian Embassy. The supportive 60 Diet lawmakers came from 7 ruling parties, as well as opposition parties, indicating its cross-bench appeal.\n\nOn February 21, 2015, the Kobe branch's Executive Committee announced that they had submitted a similar recommendation, selecting political groups concerned with protecting the Peace Constitution.\n\nPRIO listed the movement as one of the leading candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014. However, the Research Institute misconstrued the as a corporate name. The Nobel committee spokesperson said that it was not possible for the citizens of an entire nation to be awarded the prize. Therefore, the application was rejected.\n\nKristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo was concerned that Shinzō Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was trying to reinterpret Article 9 and that this could be a precursor of armed confrontation. He nominated Kenzaburō Ōe, a former Nobel laureate in literature, and the , the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations for the Nobel Peace Prize list.\n\nIn response, on January 15, 2015, the group's Korean branch (일본 평화헌법9조 노벨평화상 추천 한국위원회) nominated the and for the prize and dispatched testimonial letters and signatures of Korean citizens to the Norwegian Embassy in Seoul. Peace Research Institute Oslo included \"Kyūjyō no kai\" as one of the leading candidates (fourth place) for 2015 prize.\n\nIn South Korea, many people engaged in supportive activities and collected signatures. A total of 142 lawmakers, former Presidents and intellectuals supported the movement. In Korea itself, there is fierce competition for the Nobel Prize, indeed it is rare for Koreans to support the candidacy of foreigners, especially Japanese, for the Nobel Peace Prize. Yi Buyoung (이부영 李富榮), who is promoting the signature campaign in Korea and also a past chairman of Yeolin Uri Party (열린우리당), said that this movement was triggered by the example of Japanese opposition party legislators going against the ruling party of Japan, e.g., Ichirō Ozawa, the leader of of Japan, and former Japanese Prime Minister attempt to get South Koreans to participate in signature-collecting drives in September 2014. On December 9, 2014, Gangwon Province (강원도, 江原道), a local government of South Korea, decided to award the \"Korean DMZ Peace Prize\" to the group.\n\nConservatives, including , a Japanese journalist, claimed that a hidden motive behind the movement is to prevent amendments to the Japanese Constitution by anti-Japanese foreign powers as well as domestic anti-government forces.\n\nAccording to a survey of 188 constitutions across the world made by , an emeritus professor at Komazawa University, 158 (84%) of these constitutions also contain a peace clause (平和条項). For this reason, according to him, the statement that the Japanese Constitution is the world's only pacifist constitution is incorrect. He also claims that articles that renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation as means of settling international disputes are explicitly stated in the constitutions of Italy and Azerbaijan.\n\n\n"}

The territory functioned as a self-governing entity with Dominican soldiers as overseers. Dominican citizens also had more rights than the Haitians who were under Jean-Pierre Boyer's code rural.\n\nBlack Haitian slaves expelled by force the French from French Saint Domingue.\n\n\"For more information see: Haitian Revolution\"\n\nSelf-declared Emperor Jean-Jacques Dessalines decrees that all Haitian whites (women and children included) should be eliminated without exceptions. This was a separate action from French military whites (which were already expelled) and was specifically aimed at the remaining local white civilian population. The act was carried out between February and April 1804. Fears of a genocide similar to the Haitian Massacre of 1804 were explicitly referred in the Confederate discourse during the American Civil War.\n\n\"For further reading see: 1804 Haiti massacre\"\n\nIn February 1805, Haitian forces, under Jean-Jacques Dessalines, invaded from the southern route in opposition of French-led approved slave raiding. Unable to overpower the Spanish-French defense, and intimidated by the arrival of a French fleet in support of Borgella in Santo Domingo, the army of Dessalines along with Henri Christophe raided through the interior Dominican towns Santiago and Moca, while Alexandre Pétion invaded Azua. On his retreat from Santo Domingo, Dessalines arrived in Santiago on 12 April 1805. While in Santiago, Haitian forces set fire to the town, including churches and convents. The army killed approximately 400 inhabitants including some priests and took prisoners to Haiti. More people were killed on Dessalines's orders in the French-held portions of the island, including the towns of Monte Plata, Cotuí and La Vega and approximately 500 people of the northern town of Moca. The barrister Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo wrote, \"40 [Dominican] children had their throats cut at the Moca's church, and the bodies found at the presbytery, which is the space that encircles the church's altar...\" Survivors from the raids fled to western locations including Higüey through Cotuí as well as to other territories of the Spanish Antilles.\n\nDessalines was assassinated, an act which was instigated by his own generals Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion. Afterward, both Christophe and Pétion failed to agree to on who was going to be the next leader-for-life (a title created by Dessalines himself), so they went separate ways: Christophe took the North of Haiti (which he named \"Kingdome of Haiti\"), while Pétion got for himself the South part of Haiti (the newly created \"Republic of Haiti\"); and immediately they started a series of wars to overtake the other's side. The internal military conflicts lasted until 1820 when Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer finally unified both the South and North of Haiti. After this, Boyer aimed his sights on the struggling Spanish-side of the island.\n\n\"For further reading see: The struggle for unity (1806–20)\"\n\nUpon unification of both French-side (Haitï) and Spanish-side (Dominican Republic) nations under the Haitian flag, Boyer divided the island into six departments, that were subdivided into \"arrondissements\" (administrative districts) and communes. The departments established in the west were, Nord, Ouest, Sud, and Artibonite, while the east was divided into Ozama and Cibao. This period led to large-scale land expropriations and failed efforts to force production of export crops, impose military services, restrict the use of the Spanish language, and suppress traditional customs. There was also a resurgence of the decades-old rivalries between the governing Haitian elite (mulattoes) and the masses of the black population, most notably throughout the western end.\n\nBy the late 18th century, the island of Hispaniola had been divided into two European colonies: Saint-Domingue, in the west, governed by France; and Santo Domingo, governed by Spain, occupying the eastern two-thirds of Hispaniola.\n\nDuring the second half of the eighteenth century the French side of the island quickly developed into the most prosperous plantation colony of the New World. French Saint-Domingue was dubbed the \"Pearl of the Antilles\", as a result of the sugar plantations worked by African slaves; sugar had become an indispensable commodity in Europe. By the Peace of Basel of 22 July 1795, Spain ceded its two-third of the island to France in exchange for the return of the province of Guipuzcoa occupied by the French since 1793. Although Hispaniola was now unified under a single administration, it proved difficult for the French to consolidate their rule since their part of the island had been experiencing uprisings by elite mulattos and black freedman since 1791, and in 1804 the leader of the Haitian revolution, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, declared Haiti's independence. Independence did not come easily, given the fact that Haiti had been France's most profitable colony.\n\nBy 1795, the eastern side, what was once the headquarters of Spanish colonial power in the New World had long fallen into decline. The economy was stalled, the land largely unexploited and used for sustenance farming and cattle ranching, and the population was much lower than in Haiti. The accounts by the Dominican essayist and politician José Núñez de Cáceres cite the Spanish colony's population at around 80,000, mainly composed of European descendants, mulattos, freedmen, and a few black slaves. Haiti, on the other hand, was nearing a million former slaves.\n\nWhile the French had lost their former colony of Saint-Dominque by 1804, the French commander of the former Spanish side had been able to repulse the attacks of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, but in 1808 the people revolted and the following year, with the help of a British squadron, ended French control of the city of Santo Domingo. Spanish rule was reestablished. However, this short period under which the whole of Hispaniola was \"de jure\" under French rule was to be the chief justification of the freed Haitians in their quest to reunite the island under their rule.\n\nOn 9 November 1821 the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo was toppled by a group led by José Núñez de Cáceres, the colony's former administrator, and the rebels proclaimed independence from the Spanish crown on 1 December 1821. The new nation was known as Republic of Spanish Haiti (Spanish: \"República del Haití Español\"), as \"Haiti\" had been the indigenous name of the island. On 1 December 1821 a constitutive act was ordered to petition the union of Spanish Haiti with Gran Colombia.\n\nA group of Dominican politicians and military officers favored uniting the newly independent nation with Haiti, as they sought for political stability under Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer, and were attracted to Haiti's perceived wealth and power at the time. A large faction based in the northern Cibao region were opposed to the union with Gran Colombia and also sided with Haiti. Boyer, on the other hand, had several objectives in the island that he proclaimed to be \"one and indivisible\": to maintain Haitian independence against potential French or Spanish attack or reconquest and to maintain the freedom of its former slaves.\n\nWhile appeasing the Dominican frontier officers, Jean-Pierre Boyer was already in negotiations with France to prevent an attack by fourteen French warships stationed near Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital. The Dominicans were unaware that Boyer made a concession to the French, and agreed to pay France 150 million gold francs destined to compensated the former French slave owners. Thus, Haiti would essentially be forced into paying reparations for its freedom.\n\nThe Dominican nationalists who were against the unification of the island were at a serious disadvantage if they were to maintain their nation's sovereignty. At the time, they had an untrained infantry force. The population was eight to ten times less than Haiti's, and the economy was stalled. Haiti, on the other hand, had formidable armed forces, both in skill and sheer size, which had been hardened in nearly ten years of repelling French Napoleonic soldiers, and British soldiers, along with the local colonialists, and military insurgents within the country. The racial massacres perpetrated in the later days of the French–Haitian conflict only added to the determination of Haitians to never lose a battle.\n\nAfter promising his full support to several Dominican frontier governors and securing their allegiance, Boyer ceremoniously marched into the country with 12,000 soldiers in February 1822, against a significantly smaller, untrained army serving some 70,000 Dominican souls (Haiti had a population around 600,000 people), encountering little to no opposition. On 9 February 1822, Boyer formally entered the capital city, Santo Domingo after its ephemeral independence, where he was received by president José Núñez de Cáceres who offered to him the keys of the Palace; Boyer decorously declined the offer by quoting: \"I have not come into this city as a conqueror but by the will of its inhabitants\". The island was thus united from \"Cape Tiburon to Cape Samana in possession of one government.\"\n\nIn order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (\"terrenos comuneros\"), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and Joseph Balthazar Inginac's \"Code Rural\". In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\n\nHaiti's constitution also forbade white elites from owning land, and the major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Many emigrated to Cuba, Puerto Rico (these two being Spanish possessions at the time) or Gran Colombia, usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials, who acquired their lands. The Haitians, who associated the Roman Catholic Church with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence, confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican. Santo Domingo's university, the oldest in the Western Hemisphere, lacking both students and teachers had to close down, and thus the country suffered from a massive case of human capital flight.\n\nAlthough the occupation instated a constitution modeled after the United States Constitution throughout the island, and led to the abolition of slavery as an institution in what became known as the Dominican Republic, forms of slavery persisted in Haitian society. Several resolutions and written dispositions were expressly aimed at converting average Dominicans into second-class citizens as Boyer had done with the Haitian peasantry under the aforementioned \"Code Rural\": restrictions of movement, prohibition to run for public office, night curfews, inability to travel in groups, banning of civilian organizations, and the indefinite closure of the state university (on the alleged grounds of its being a subversive organization) all led to the creation of movements advocating a forceful separation from Haiti with no compromises.\n\nIn 1838 a group of educated nationalists, among them, Juan Pablo Duarte, Matías Ramón Mella, and Francisco del Rosario Sánchez founded a secret society called \"La Trinitaria\" to gain independence from Haiti. The \"Trinitarios\" took advantage of a Haitian rebellion against the dictator Jean-Pierre Boyer. The \"Trinitarios\" won the loyalty of two Haitian regiments made up of Dominicans from the city of Santo Domingo. They rose up on 27 January 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian Charles Hérard who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti. Known as \"The Reform\" (\"La Reforma\"), the rebellious Dominicans seized the capital, Santo Domingo, on 24 March in the name of Hérard. The movement soon discarded its pretext of support for Hérard and now championed Dominican independence. In the meantime, Hérard overthrew Boyer and marched against Santo Domingo in order to resubjugate the Dominicans. Hérard entered the capital on 12 July executed some Dominicans, and threw many others into prison; Duarte escaped.\n\nUpon returning to Haiti, Hérard, a mulatto, faced a rebellion by blacks in the continuing racial strife between those two elements within Haiti. The two regiments of Dominicans were among those used by Hérard to suppress the uprising. Their loyal participation convinced Hérard that the Dominican troublemakers had been eliminated. Surviving members of the \"La Trinitaria\", now led by Tomás Bobadilla, planned another uprising. Once again, the conspirators persuaded the two Dominican-manned regiments to participate. On 27 February 1844, the Trinitarios declared independence from Haiti, backed by Pedro Santana, a wealthy cattle-rancher from El Seibo who commanded a private army of peons who worked on his estates. Over the next decade, the Haitians conducted military campaigns against the newly formed Dominican Republic.\n\nThe Haitian military campaigns involved more than 40,000 Haitian soldiers against 15,000 Dominicans. Despite their numerical superiority, the Haitian forces were not supported by their compatriots, who feared that the cost of the conflict would drain the national economy. Furthermore, internal divisions prevented a succession of Haiti's presidents from forming a united front against the rebellious Dominicans.\n\n\"For further reading: Dominican War of Independence\"\n\nIn February 1844 a group of Dominican independence fighters moved to restore their freedom from military-enforced Haitian rule in the Spanish-speaking two-thirds of the island. Called the \"La Trinitaria\" (\"The Trinity\"), this organization was composed of Spanish Creoles, mulattoes, and blacks, and led by Juan Pablo Duarte, Francisco del Rosario Sánchez and Matías Ramón Mella. Independence was proclaimed in the city of Santo Domingo on 27 February 1844, but on the following day a group of ex-slaves led by Santiago Basora, announced its opposition to the independentists. These men suspected that the rebels intended to reintroduce slavery; if this was true, the blacks were ready to fight alongside the Haitians. \"Trinitaria\" leaders realized the explosive nature of this situation and moved rapidly to defuse it. The very next day, 28 February provisional President Tomás Bobadilla and Vice-President Manuel Jimenes conferred with Basora and his supporters, and on the following day slavery was again declared abolished. The war to expel Haiti from Dominican soil was a great success: This was the last time ever Haiti would dominate the Dominican nation.\n\nFor the next ten years, Dominican military strongmen fought to preserve their country's independence from their Haitian neighbors. In March 1844, a 30,000-strong two-pronged attack was successfully repelled in both north and south. Four years later, it took a Dominican flotilla harassing Haitian coastal villages, land reinforcements in the south, and a British and French naval blockade to force the determined Haitian Emperor into a one-year truce. In the most thorough and intense encounter of all, Dominican irregulars armed with machetes sent Haitian troops into flight on all three fronts in 1855. Nearly a century later, the Dominican despot Rafael Trujillo revived the old hatreds between the Hispaniolan neighbors by a sudden ruthless massacre of up to 40,000 Haitians.\n\nThe constant military internal power struggles (constantly warring for over 50 years) would deteriorate Haiti's mighty military forces of 1805 to crippling levels, transforming itself into a local repression force at the service of a series of dictators and military warlords well into the 20th century.\n\nIn 1995 democratically-elected President Jean Bertrand Aristide disbanded the military forces, after he was overthrown by force in 1991. The local security was eventually handed over to United Nations' UNSTAMIH (French: \"MIUSTAH\"), from 2004 to 2017.\n\nIn 2017, president Jovenel Moïse proposed restoring their military forces that have been disbanded for over 22 years.\n\nNeighboring towns and cities like Hincha (now \"Hinche\"), Juana Méndez (now \"Ouanaminthe\"), San Rafael de La Angostura (now \"Saint-Raphaël\"), San Miguel de la Atalaya (now \"Saint-Michel-de-l'Atalaye\"), Las Caobas (now \"Lascahobas\"), and Veladero (now \"Belladère\"), among others, remained isolated with little communication with the Dominican capital whilst there were a growing Haitian influence as the gourde circulated and in addition to the Spanish language, Haitian Creole was also spoken; eventually becoming Haitian territories, however these cities would often be disputed between the two countries.\n\n\n\n \n"}

VAERS is a postmarketing surveillance program, collecting information about adverse events (possible harmful side effects) that occur after administration of vaccines to ascertain whether the risk–benefit ratio is high enough to justify continued use of any particular vaccine.\n\nVAERS, the Vaccine Safety Datalink, and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Network are tools by which the CDC and FDA measure vaccine safety to fulfill their duty as regulatory agencies charged with protecting the public. Some scientists would like to do a more scientifically rigorous job of this, noting that VAERS has several limitations, including unverified reports, underreporting, inconsistent data quality, and absence of an unvaccinated control group.\n\nThe program is an outgrowth of the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which requires health care providers to report: \n\nVAERS was established in 1990, and is managed jointly by the FDA and the CDC. It is meant to act as a sort of \"early warning system\"—a way for physicians and researchers to identify possible unforeseen reactions or side effects of vaccination for further study.\n\nEach year the VAERS receives 10,000–20,000 reports of adverse events following immunization by more than 10 million vaccines.\nHigher-priority uses of the data include reports of death and other serious adverse events, recognizing and detecting adverse effects, and finding unexpected adverse events involving new vaccines. The VAERS data are also used to monitor known reactions to vaccines and for vaccine lot surveillance. Data mining techniques such as empirical Bayes methods can be used to improve the quality of data analysis.\n\nLike other spontaneous reporting systems, VAERS has several limitations, including underreporting, unverified reports, inconsistent data quality, absence of a control group that is not vaccinated, and inadequate data about the number of people vaccinated. Indeed, an autism activist named Jim Laidler once reported to VAERS that a vaccine had turned him into The Incredible Hulk. The report was accepted and entered into the database, but the dubious nature thereof prompted a VAERS representative to contact Mr. Laidler, who then gave his consent to delete the report.\n\nMany medical researchers make use of VAERS to study the effects of vaccination. VAERS warns researchers using its database that the data should not be used in isolation to draw conclusions about cause and effect. Nonetheless, data from VAERS has been used in vaccine litigation to support the claim that vaccines cause autism.\n\nLitigation related to vaccines and autism has led to an increase in VAERS reports filed by plaintiff's attorneys. A 2006 article in \"Pediatrics\" found that most VAERS reports related to thimerosal, and many related to autism, were filed in connection with litigation, leading the authors to caution that inappropriate reliance on VAERS data may be a source of bias. The study's lead author stated: \"Lawyers are manipulating this system to show increases [in vaccine-related adverse events] that are based on litigation, not health research.\" Paul Offit, chief of infectious disease at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, wrote:\nPublic health officials were disappointed to learn that reports of autism to VAERS weren't coming from parents, doctors, nurses, or nurse practitioners; they were coming from personal-injury lawyers... For the lawyers, VAERS reports hadn't been a self-fulfilling prophecy; they'd been a self-generated prophecy.\n\n"}

Sometimes words have complete equivalents, such as translating French \"chien\" as English \"dog\"; but other times have partial or alternative equivalents, such as translating French \"veau\" as either the animal \"calf\" or the meat \"veal\" (Svensén 1993: 143-157). English \"propaganda\" and \"publicity\" are alternative equivalents for Chinese \"xuanchuan\". The classical Chinese word \"qing\" 青 \"green; blue; black\", representing the distinction of blue and green in various languages, is a better known example of Chinese-English alternative translations. Compare the color range across collocations like \"qīngcài\" 青菜 \"green vegetables; greens\", \"qīngjīn\" 青筋 \"blue veins\", \"qīngtiān\" 青天 \"azure sky\", \"qīngbù\" 青布 \"black cloth\", or \"qīngkèmǎ\" 青騍馬 \"gray mare\".\n\nTranslation equivalents of \"xuanchuan\" in major Chinese-English dictionaries include:\nThus, the most frequent English lexicographical translations of \"xuanchuan\" are , , , , , and .\n\nMany languages besides English have different words to distinguish \"propaganda\" and \"publicity\", for instance, German \"Propaganda\" and \"Werbung\", or Russian \"propagánda\" \"пропага́нда\" and \"rekláma\" \"рекла́ма\". Few languages besides Chinese have one polysemous word; excluding Sinoxenic loanwords from Chinese such as Japanese \"senden\" 宣伝 \"propaganda; advertisement; publicity\", one example is Irish \"bolscaireacht\" \"publicity; propaganda; claptrap\".\n\nThe \"Hanyu Da Cidian\" is a historical dictionary that gives chronologically arranged usage examples, comparable with the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". The \"xuanchuan\" entry gives three meanings (tr. Edney 2014: 22): \"xuānbù chuándá\" 宣布传达 \"to announce or convey information\", \"xiàng rén jiạ̌ngjiě shuōmíng\" 向人讲解说明, 进行教育, \"jìnxíng jiàoyù\" 进行教育 \" to explain something to someone, or to conduct education\", and \"chuánbō\" 传播, \"xuānyáng\" 宣扬 \"to disseminate or publicize\".\n\nFirst, the meaning of \"to announce or convey information\" was originally recorded in the historian Chen Shou's (3rd century) \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" in contexts of transmitting (esp. military) orders. For example, the biography of Shu Han dynasty General Ma Zhong (Shu Han) (d. 249) records that after defeating rebels in Nanyue, he was appointed General Who Pacifies the South and ordered back to the capital in Chengdu. \"In 242, when [Ma Zhong] was returning to court, upon reaching Hanzhong, he went to see Grand Marshall Jiang Wan, who conveyed an imperial decree that he was also appointed General in Chief of Zhennan Circuit [in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi].\" Later usage examples are cited from historian Li Baiyao (564–647), poet Cao Tang 曹唐 (fl. 860-874), and scholar Wang Mingqing 王明清 (1163-1224).\n\nSecond, the \"xuanchuan\" meaning of \"to explain something to someone, or to conduct education\" first appeared in Ge Hong's (c. 320) \"Baopuzi\" criticism of effete scholars who Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75-88) extravagantly rewarded.\nThese various gentlemen were heaped with honors, but not because they could breach walls or fight in the fields, break through an enemy's lines and extend frontiers, fall ill and resign office, pray for a plan of confederation and give the credit to others, or possess a zeal transcending all bounds. Merely because they expounded an interpretation [\"xuanchuan\"] of one solitary classic, such were the honors lavished upon them. And they were only lecturing upon words bequeathed by the dead. Despite their own high positions, emperors and kings deigned to serve these teachers. (tr. Ware 1966: 231) \nSubsequent usages are quotes from monk-translator Pukong 不空 or Amoghavajra (705–774), poet Wang Yucheng (954–1001), novelist Ba Jin (1904-2005), and Mao Zedong (1893-1976). Mao's (1957) \"The speech for the Chinese Communist party National Propaganda Work Meeting\" (tr. Leung 1992: 379) says, \"Our comrades who are engaged in propaganda work have the task of disseminating Marxism. This is a gradual [task of] propaganda and should be done well, so that people are willing to accept it.\"\n\nThird, the modern \"xuanchuan\" meaning of \"to disseminate or publicize\" occurred in Lao She's (1937) \"Camel Xiangzi\" or \"Rickshaw Boy\" (tr. Goldblatt 2010: 48), \"As promised, Old Man Liu told no one of Xiangzi’s experiences [selling stolen wartime camels for 30 \"yuan\"], but the camel story quickly spread from Haidian into the city.\" The \"Hanyu Da Cidian\" gives two other usage examples from novels by Zhao Shuli (1906-1970).\n\nThe \"Nihon Kokugo Daijiten\" (2001) entry for the Japanese word \"senden\" 宣伝 differentiates three meanings and notes their earliest recorded usages: \"Convey a statement, transmit widely\" (述べ伝えること. ひろく伝えること.; c. 758-797 \"Shoku Nihongi\"); \"Explain to people the existence or effect of a thing, principle, policy, etc., seeking their understanding. Or such movement or activity. Propaganda\" (ある物の存在や効能または主義主張などを人々に説明し, 理解を求めること. また, その運動や活動. プロパガンダ.; 1924, Kanson Arahata's \"Entering Russia\"); and \"Spread a rumor that is unrealistic or exaggerated\" (事実以上に大げさに言いふらすこと.; 1930 Riichi Yokomitsu's \"Machine\").\n\nWhether \"xuanchuan\" is translated as either \"propaganda\" or \"propagandize\" versus \"publicity\" or \"publicize\" depends upon the Chinese collocation and context, and the English semiotic connotations. For English and Chinese translation equivalent examples, \"political propaganda\" and \"zhèngzhì xuānchuán\" 政治宣传 are usually pejorative, but \"public health propaganda\" and \"gōnggòng wèishēng xuānchuán\" 公共卫生宣传 are not.\n\nSome \"xuanchuan\" collocations customarily refer to \"propaganda\" (e.g., \"xuānchuánzhàn\" 宣传战 \"propaganda war\"), others to \"publicity\" (\"chǎnpǐn xuānchuán\" 產品宣传 \"product promotion\"), and still others can ambiguously refer to either (\"xuānchuányuán\" 宣传员 \"propagandist; publicist\").\n\n\"Xuanchuan\" contexts can vary from covert black propaganda (such as astroturfing) that misrepresents its source to overt white propaganda (such as a public service announcement) that truthfully states its source. Chinese contexts determine the word's semantic connotations. For instance, the term \"Gòngchạ̌ndǎng de xuānchuán\" 共产党的宣传 \"Communist propaganda\" generally has positive connotations in Chinese Communist Party usage but negative ones in Kuomintang usage. In official CCP discourse, \"xuanchuan\" \"propaganda\" has a neutral or positive connotation, but in informal usage, the word often has a pejorative connotation (Edney 2014: 22, 195). For instance, in 2009 a group of Chinese academics and lawyers called for a boycott of the major China Central Television network and sarcastically said the program \"Xinwen Lianbo\" \"Network News\" should be called \"Xuanchuan Lianbo\" \"Propaganda News\" (Edney 2014: 195, Chen 2009).\n\nDavid Shambaugh (2007: 29), the scholar of Chinese politics and foreign policy, describes \"proactive propaganda\" in which the Chinese Communist Party Propaganda Department writes and disseminates information that it believes \"\"should\" be used in educating and shaping society\". In this particular context, \"xuanchuan\" \"does \"not\" carry negative connotations for the CCP, nor, for that matter, for most Chinese citizens.\" The sinologist and anthropologist Andrew B. Kipnis (1995: 119) says unlike English \"propaganda\", Chinese \"xuanchuan\" is officially represented as language that is good for the nation as a whole. \"Although no American government would describe its own declarations as propaganda, the CCP is proud of its \"xuanchuan\".\"\n\n\"Propaganda\" and \"publicity\" have undergone considerable diachronic change in meaning. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"propaganda\" was first recorded in 1718, referring to the Latin title \"Congregatio de Propaganda Fide\" \"Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith\" \"a committee of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church having the care and oversight of foreign missions\". The religious meaning was extended to \"any association, systematic scheme, or concerted movement for the propagation of a particular doctrine or practice\" in 1790, and specialized to \"the systematic propagation of information or ideas by an interested party, esp. in a tendentious way in order to encourage or instill a particular attitude or response\" in 1908. The linguist Adrian Room (1991: 216) suggests that the \"bad\" sense of \"propaganda\" emerged on the political scene in the United States. \"Publicity\" was first used to mean \"the quality of being public; the condition or fact of being open to public observation or knowledge\" in 1791, and subsequently specified to \"public notice; the action or fact of making someone or something publicly known; the business of promotion or advertising; an action or object intended to attract public notice; material issued to publicize\".\n\nMost standard English dictionary definitions of \"propaganda\" note the word's negative connotations; either through explanation \"ideas or statements that are often false or exaggerated and that are spread in order to help a cause, a political leader, a government, etc.\" (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1993), or through a usage note \"The systematic dissemination of doctrine, rumour, or selected information to propagate or promote a particular doctrine, view, practice, etc.; ideas, information, etc. disseminated thus (frequently \"derogatory\")\" (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 1993).\n\nIn contrast, standard Chinese-Chinese dictionary definitions of \"xuanchuan\" (see the \"Hanyu Da Cidian\" above) neither mention that the term can have a pejorative connotation nor highlight any connection between the act of propagandizing and the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of the information that is being disseminated (Edney 2014: 22).\n\nAs China’s involvement in world affairs grew in the late 20th century, the CCP became sensitive to the negative connotations of the English word \"propaganda\", and the commonly used Chinese term \"xuanchuan\" acquired pejorative connotations (MacKinnon 1997: 4). In 1992, Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin asked one of the CCP's most senior translators to come up with a better English alternative to \"propaganda\" as the translation of \"xuanchuan\" for propaganda targeting foreign audiences (Schoenhals 2008: 125). Replacement English translations include \"publicity\", \"information\", and \"political communication\" domestically (Brady 2009: 73), or \"media diplomacy\" and \"cultural exchange\" internationally (Edney 2014: 24).\n\nCCPPD officials left the \"xuanchuan\" in official Chinese names the same but changed the English translations from \"Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China\" to \"Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China\" (Shambaugh 2007: 47), and changed \"Central Propaganda Department\" to \"Central Publicity Department\" (Hassid 2007: 415). English-languages sources rarely use either \"Publicity Department\" translation. The \"Zhōngyāng Xuānchuán Sīxiǎng Lǐngdǎo Xiǎozǔ\", which oversees the CCPPD, continues to be translated as the \"Central Leading Group for Propaganda and Ideological Work\".\n\nWhen Ding Guan'gen, director of the CCP Central Propaganda Department from 1992 to 2002, traveled abroad on official visits, he was known as the Minister of Information (Chen et al. 2002: 287).\n\n\n"}

He is a professor of Russian history and Director of the Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. He is best known as the author of the book \"The Jewish Century\" (2004) and \"The House of Government: A Saga of The Russian Revolution\" (2017).\n\nSlezkine originally trained as an interpreter in Moscow State University. His first trip outside the Soviet Union was in the late 1970s when he found work as a translator in Mozambique. He returned to Moscow to serve as a translator of Portuguese, and spent 1982 in Lisbon before emigrating to Austin, Texas the next year. He earned a PhD from the University of Texas, Austin.\n\nSkezine is a W. Glenn Campbell and Rita Ricardo-Campbell National Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and Jane K. Sather Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2008).\n\nSlezkine characterizes the Jews (alongside other groups such as the Armenians and Overseas Chinese) as a \"Mercurian\" people \"specializ[ing] exclusively in providing services to the surrounding food-producing societies,\" which he characterizes as \"Apollonians\". This division is, according to him, recurring in pre-20th century societies. With the exception of the Gypsies, these \"Mercurian peoples\" have all enjoyed great socioeconomic success relative to the average among their hosts, and have all, without exception, attracted hostility and resentment. A recurring pattern of the relationship between Apollonians and Mercurian people is that the social representation of each group by the other is symmetrical, for instance Mercurians see Apollonians as brutes while Apollonians see Mercurians as effeminate. Mercurians develop a culture of \"purity\" and \"national myths\" to cultivate their separation from the Apollonians, which allows them to provide international services (intermediaries, diplomacy) or services that are taboo for the local Apollonian culture (linked to death, magic, sexuality or banking). Slezkine develops this thesis by arguing that the Jews, the most successful of these Mercurian peoples, have increasingly influenced the course and nature of Western societies, particularly during the early and middle periods of Soviet Communism, and that modernity can be seen as a transformation of Apollonians into Mercurians.\n\n\n\n"}
