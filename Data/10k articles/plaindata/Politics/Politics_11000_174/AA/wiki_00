Absolute democracies function as completely changeable systems where things such as rights and privileges begin to lose meaning, because rights can be voted away at any election.\n\nThere are no supermajorities in absolute democracies, because that is just an added limit on democracy.\n\nNothing is stable or long term, because everything is under scrutiny from the voters.\n\nAn absolute monarchy suggests total authoritarian rule from a monarch or other leading dictator, while in this type of democracy, 100% of all power is concentrated into the majority opinion for each issue. For example, if a king decides he wants to make free pies a human right, there is nothing stopping him from doing that. But in an Absolute Democracy, rights become superfluous because they change every time there is an election, and there is nothing keeping legislation permanent or long term.\n"}

Transnational and interdisciplinary in character, her work explores the interrelations of gender, race, and class power within imperial modernity, spanning Victorian and contemporary Britain to contemporary South Africa, Ireland, and the United States. Since 2015, McClintock is the A. Barton Hepburn Professor in the Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies, and also affiliated with the Princeton Environmental Institute and the Department of English at Princeton University.\n\nPreviously, McClintock was the Simone de Beauvoir Professor of English and Women’s and Gender Studies at UW–Madison where she taught from 1999 to 2015. Before UW-Madison, she taught at both Columbia University and New York University.\n\nMcClintock was born in Harare, Zimbabwe, moving to South Africa as a child, where she became involved in the anti-apartheid movement. She began her university studies at the University of Cape Town, completing a B.A. (Hons.) in English, before traveling to England, where she earned a M.Phil. in Linguistics at the University of Cambridge. She completed a Ph.D. in English Literature from Columbia University, where she subsequently became an Associate Professor of Gender and Cultural Studies, teaching in both the Department of English and the Institute of African Studies. She also held a Visiting Professorship at New York University before moving to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where she was the Simone de Beauvoir Professor of English and Women's and Gender Studies.\n\nMcClintock is best known for her book, \"Imperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Contest\". McClintock has also written short biographies of Olive Schreiner and Simone de Beauvoir and a monograph on madness, sexuality and colonialism called \"Double Crossings\". She also co-edited (with Ella Shohat and Aamir Mufti) a collection called \"Dangerous Liaisons\", as well as two special journal issues: one on sex work, and one on race and queer theory. McClintock has written over 50 articles and reviews, and has given over 160 keynote addresses and lectures in the US and abroad, on sexuality, race, gender, nationalism, imperialism, photography, visual culture, and contemporary culture in a wide range of prominent venues and journals, including \"Critical Inquiry\", \"Transition\", \"Social Text\", \"New Formations\", \"Feminist Review\", \"The New York Times Book Review\", \"The Guardian\", \"The Times Literary Supplement\", \"The Village Voice\", and \"The Women’s Review of Books\", among others. Her articles and essays have been widely reprinted and anthologized both in the US and internationally.\n\nMcClintock is currently completing three books: a creative non-fiction book \"Skin Hunger: A Chronicle of Sex, Desire and Money\" (Jonathan Cape); \"Planet of Intimate Trespass: Essays on Sexuality and Power in a Global Era\", (Routledge); and an anthology \"The Sex Work Reader\" (Vintage). She is also working on a new book called \"Paranoid Empire: Specters Beyond Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib\", (Duke University Press).\n\nMcClintock's writings have been widely acclaimed and anthologized. She has received numerous awards, including two prestigious MacArthur-SSRC Fellowships and numerous creative writing fellowships, including Artist Residency Fellowships at the MacDowell, Yaddo, Blue Mountain Center, VCCA and Dorland writing colonies. Her work has been translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Japanese, Taiwanese and Madarin.\n\nMcClintock has written many articles discussing her efforts to try and give prostitutes the most respectful and equal working conditions possible. McClintock writes an article discussing how the European Prostitute Congress is working to recognize prostitutes “for full rights as workers under European labor law” (McClintock, rights). These labor rights are intended to be put in place so prostitutes can trade their work for money safely, and be taxed normal taxes and live in a normal household without penalty. Another huge point that McClintock addresses in multiple articles is the forceful testing for HIV that prostitutes must go through. McClintock likes to point out that as she disagrees with the legalization of brothels, that they majority of men who attend there are married men, and having forceful HIV testing for those prostitutes would “protect good family men from infection” (McClintock, brothels). McClintock is trying to exploit the dangerous and underpaid working conditions for prostitutes and give them more rights than just having the final say of what type of sexual activity will occur in a session. McClintock states that the legalization of brothels (prostitution houses) is unacceptable and that if prostitution is going to be recognized as an occupation, then the working rights and payment need to be equal in comparison to an everyday job.\n\nCitation:\nMcClintock, Anne. “Women: Down by law - Reporting on Europe's first ever Prostitutes' Congress, Anne McClintock highlights their demands for equal working rights.” The Guardian, 21 Oct. 1991, libproxy.cortland.edu:2150/ps/i.do?p=STND&u=sunycort_main&id=GALE%7CA171153440&v=2.1&it=r&sid=ebsco.\n\nMcClintock, Anne. “Women: Meanwhile back at Chicken Ranch - Anne McClintock argues that it is unacceptable merely to legalise brothals.” Gale, The Guardian, 12 May 1992, libproxy.cortland.edu:2150/ps/i.do?p=STND&u=sunycort_main&id=GALE%7CA171014263&v=2.1&it=r&sid=ebsco.\n\nImperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Contest\n"}

At least 19 Battalion 3–16 members were graduates of the School of the Americas. The Battalion 3–16 was also trained by Pinochet's Chile.\n\nThe name indicated the unit's service to three military units and sixteen battalions of the Honduran army. The reorganisation of the unit under the name \"Intelligence Battalion 3–16\" is attributed to General Gustavo Álvarez Martínez.\n\nAccording to the human rights NGO COFADEH, Battalion 3–16 was created in 1979 with the name \"Group of 14\". In 1982, its name was changed to the \"Special Investigations Branch (DIES)\", commanded by \"Señor Diez\" (Mr. Ten).\n\nIn 1982, according to requests for US declassified documents by the National Commissioner for Human Rights in Honduras, or in 1984 according to COFADEH, its name was changed to the \"Intelligence Battalion 3–16\". The reorganisation of the unit under the name \"Intelligence Battalion 3–16\" is attributed to General Gustavo Álvarez Martínez.\n\nFrom 1987 until at least 2002, it was called the \"Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence Branch\".\n\nGustavo Alvarez Martínez, at that time a colonel, studied at the Argentine Military College, graduating in 1961. By the end of 1981 (i.e. during the Dirty War in Argentina during which up to 30,000 people were disappeared by Argentine security forces and death squads) more than 150 Argentine officers were in Honduras. This training operation took the code-name of Operation Charly and used training bases in Lepaterique and Quilalí. The Central Intelligence Agency took over from the Argentinians after the Falklands War, although Argentine officers remained active in Honduras until 1984–1986.\n\nThe Argentine Navy's ESMA also sent instructors to Honduras, including Roberto Alfieri González who served in the National Guard of El Salvador as well as in Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nBeginning in 1984, Battalion 3-16 agents, working closely with CIA operatives, detained hundreds of leftist activists, including students, teachers, unionists, and suspected guerrillas who then disappeared. The members of the unit dressed in plain clothes and often disguised themselves with masks, wigs, false beards, and mustaches. Armed with Uzi sub-machine guns or pistols, they surveilled their victims, abducted them, and then sped off in double-cab Toyota pickup trucks with tinted windows and stolen license plates. Many of the abductions occurred during the daytime and in full view of witnesses. The captured suspects were taken to the Battalion's secret prisons, where they were stripped naked, bound at the hands and feet, and blindfolded. Although, during training sessions, the agency emphasized psychological torture, the CIA adviser referred to as Mr. Mike told 3-16 agent Florencio Caballero that electric shocks were \"the most efficient way to get someone to talk when they resisted\". Moreover, the unit's commander, General Alvarez, told interrogators that psychological torture was not effective and ordered them to use physical torture instead. The CIA's Argentine surrogates provided such expertise. The torture Battalion 3-16 used included electric shocks, submerging in water, and suffocation. \n\nA former prisoner of the 3-16, Ines Murillo, claimed that during her captivity she had often been tortured in the presence of the CIA adviser, Mr. Mike, and that he at one time submitted questions to ask her. In his June 1988 testimony, Richard Stolz, then the CIA deputy director for operations, confirmed that a CIA official had visited the prison where Murillo was being held. She also accused a prominent New York Times reporter of doing some dirty work of his own. In a letter to the Times, Ines Murillo responds to James LeMoyne's reporting of the interview with her, noting a series of distortions and falsehoods, which \"have caused great damage to me and my family\" and \"could be used to justify the kidnapping, disappearance and assassination of hundreds of people.\" A whistleblower who deserted Battalion 316 asserted that Father James Carney, a liberation theologian priest, was executed by order of General Álvarez, and that \"Álvarez Martínez gave the order for Carney’s execution in the presence of a CIA officer, known as 'Mister Mike.'\" Ten years later, one senior State Department official was willing to concede in private the U.S. role in the disappearances. \"The green light was kill a commie,\" said the official. \"Everybody was winking and nodding.\"\n\nThe US Ambassador to Honduras at the time, John Negroponte, met frequently with General Gustavo Alvarez Martínez. In summarising declassified US documents showing telegrams (cables) sent and received by Negroponte during his period as US Ambassador to Honduras, the National Security Archive states that \"reporting on human rights atrocities\" committed by Battalion 3–16 is \"conspicuously absent from the cable traffic\" and that \"Negroponte's cables reflect no protest, or even discussion of these issues during his many meetings with General Alvarez, his deputies and Honduran President Robert Suazo. Nor do the released cables contain any reporting to Washington on the human rights abuses that were taking place.\"\n\nIn 2002, COFADEH stated that \"Many retired or active 3–16 agents have been included as intelligence advisors in the National Prevention Police.\"\n\nSeven former members of Battalion 3–16 (Billy Joya, Alvaro Romero, Erick Sánchez, Onofre Oyuela Oyuela, Napoleón Nassar Herrera, Vicente Rafael Canales Nuñez, Salomón Escoto Salinas and René Maradianga Panchamé) occupied important positions in the administration of President Manuel Zelaya as of mid-2006, according to the human rights organisation CODEH.\n\nFollowing the 2009 coup d'état, in which Zelaya was detained and exiled by Honduran military units, Zelaya claimed that Battalion 3–16 was again operating, with a different name, and being led by Joya, who became a direct advisor to \"de facto\" President Roberto Micheletti. Zelaya stated (translation), \"With a different name, [Battalion 3–16 is] already operating. The crimes being committed is torture to create fear among the population, and that's being directed by Mr. Joya.\" In addition, Nelson Willy Mejía Mejía was appointed by Micheletti as Director of Immigration, Napoleón Nassar Herrera (or \"Nazar\") is a spokesperson for dialogue for the Secretary of Security.\n\nUsing freedom of information laws, efforts were made by various people to obtain documentary records of the role of the United States with respect to Battalion 3–16. For example, on 3 December 1996, members of United States Congress, including Tom Lantos, Joseph Kennedy, Cynthia McKinney, Richard J. Durbin, John Conyers and others, asked President Bill Clinton for \"the expeditious and complete declassification of all U.S. documents pertaining to human rights violations in Honduras\" and claimed that \"The U.S. government ... helped to establish, train and equip Battalion 3–16, military unit which was responsible for the kidnapping, torture, disappearance and murder of at least 184 Honduran students, professors, journalists, human rights activists and others in the 1980s.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "148651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148651", "title": "Battle of Cable Street", "text": "Battle of Cable Street\n\nThe Battle of Cable Street was an event that took place in Cable Street and Whitechapel in the East End of London, on Sunday 4 October 1936. It was a clash between the Metropolitan Police, sent to protect a march by members of the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Mosley, and various anti-fascist demonstrators, including local anarchist, communist, Jewish and socialist groups. The majority of both marchers and counter-protesters travelled into the area for this purpose.\n\nIt became known that the British Union of Fascists (BUF) were organising a march to take place on Sunday 4 October 1936, through the heart of the East End (an area which then had a large Jewish population). Mosley planned to send thousands of marchers dressed in their Blackshirt uniform through the East End. An estimated 100,000 residents of the area petitioned then Home Secretary John Simon to ban the march because of the strong likelihood of violence. He refused, and sent a police escort in an attempt to prevent anti-fascist protesters from disrupting the march.\n\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews denounced the march as anti-semitic, and urged Jews to stay away. Phil Piratin, a member of the local branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain, quickly organised opposition forces. The following year, Piratin became the first Communist to be elected to Stepney Borough Council.\n\nThe anti-fascist groups built roadblocks in an attempt to prevent the march from taking place. The barricades were constructed near the junction with Christian Street in Stepney, towards the west end of this long street. The main confrontation took place around Gardiner's Corner in Whitechapel. An estimated 20,000 anti-fascist demonstrators turned out, and were met by 6,000-7,000 policemen (including mounted police), who attempted to clear the road to permit the march of 2,000–3,000 fascists to proceed. The demonstrators fought back with sticks, rocks, chair legs and other improvised weapons. Rubbish, rotten vegetables and the contents of chamber pots were thrown at the police by women in houses along the street. After a series of running battles, Mosley agreed to abandon the march to prevent bloodshed. The BUF marchers were dispersed towards Hyde Park instead while the anti-fascists rioted with police. About 150 demonstrators were arrested, although some escaped with the help of other demonstrators. Around 175 people were injured including police, women and children.\n\nMany of the arrested demonstrators reported harsh treatment at the hands of the police.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1983, a large mural depicting the battle was painted on the side of St George's Town Hall. This building was originally the vestry hall for the area and later the town hall of Stepney Borough Council. It stands in Cable Street, about west of Shadwell overground station. A red plaque in Dock Street commemorates the incident.\n\nNumerous events were planned in East London for the battle's 75th anniversary in October 2011, including music and a march, and the mural was once again restored. In 2016, to mark the battle's 80th anniversary, a march took place from Altab Ali Park to Cable Street. The march was attended by some of those who were originally involved.\n\nThe event is frequently cited by the contemporary Antifa movement.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45330308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45330308", "title": "Biometric device", "text": "Biometric device\n\nA biometric device is a security identification and authentication device. Such devices use automated methods of verifying or recognising the identity of a living person based on a physiological or behavioral characteristic. These characteristics include fingerprints, facial images, iris and voice recognition.\n\nBiometric devices have been used by man over a long period of time. Non-automated biometric devices have used us since 500 BC as it was seen that Babylonian business transactions were recorded on clay tablets that included fingerprints. Automation in Biometric devices was first seen in the 1960s. The FBI in the 1960s, introduced the Indentimat, which started checking for fingerprints to maintain criminal records. The first systems measured the shape of the hand and the length of the fingers. Although discontinued in the 1980s, the system set a precedent for future Biometric Devices.\n\nThe characteristic of the human body are used to access information by the users. According to these characteristics, the sub-divided groups are:\n\nBiometrics are being used to establish better and accessible records of the hours employee's work. With the increase in \"Buddy Punching\"( a case where employees clocked out coworkers and fraudulently inflated their work hours) employers have looked towards new technology like fingerprint recognition to reduce such fraud. Additionally, employers are also faced with the task of proper collection of data such as entry and exit times. Biometric devices make for largely foul proof and reliable ways of enabling to collect data as employees have to be present to enter biometric details which are unique to them.\n\nAs the demand for air travel grows and more people travel, modern day airports have to implement technology in such a way that there are no long queues. Biometrics are being implemented in more and more airports as they enable quick recognition of passengers and hence lead to lower volume of people standing in queue's. One such example is of the Dubai International Airport which plans to make immigration counters a relic of the past as they implement IRIS on the move technology (IOM) which should help the seamless departures and arrivals of passengers at the airport.\n\nFingerprint sensors can be found on mobile devices. The fingerprint sensor is used to unlock the device and authorize actions, like money and file transfers, for example. It can be used to prevent a device from being used by an unauthorized person.\n\nThis is one of the most highly recognised and acceptable biometrics in corporate surroundings. This verification has been taken one step further by capturing the signature while taking into account many parameters revolving around this like the pressure applied while signing, the speed of the hand movement and the angle made between the surface and the pen used to make the signature. This system also has the ability to learn from users as signature styles vary for the same user. Hence by taking a sample of data, this system is able to increase its own accuracy.\n\nIris recognition involves the device scanning the retina of the subject and then cross referencing that to data stored on the database. It is one of the most secure forms of authentication, as while fingerprints can be left behind on surfaces, iris prints are extremely hard to be stolen. Iris recognition is widely applied by organisations dealing with the masses, one being the Aadhar identification carried out by the Indian government to keep records of its population. The reason for this is that iris recognition makes use of iris prints of humans, which hardly evolve during one's lifetime and are extremely stable.\n\nBiometric spoofing is a method of fooling a biometric identification management system, where a counterfeit mold is presented in front of the biometric scanner. This counterfeit mold emulates the unique biometric attributes of an individual so as to confuse the system between the artifact and the real biological target and gain access to sensitive data/materials.\n\nOne such high-profile case of Biometric spoofing came to the limelight when it was found that German Defence Minister, Ursula von der Leyen's fingerprint had been successfully replicated by the Chaos Computer Club Group. The group used high quality camera lenses and shot images from 6 feet away. They used a professional finger software and mapped the contours of the Ministers thumbprint. Although progress has been made to stop spoofing. Using the principle of pulse oximetry- the liveliness of the test subject is taken into account by measure of blood oxygenation and the heart rate. This reduces attacks like the ones mentioned above, although these methods arent commercially applicable as costs of implementation are high. This reduces their real world application and hence makes biometrics insecure until these methods are commercially viable.\n\nAccuracy is a major issue with biometric recognition. Passwords are still extremely popular, because a password is static in nature, while biometric data can be subject to change (such as one's voice becoming heavier due to puberty, or an accident to the face, which could lead to improper reading of facial scan data). When testing voice recognition as a substitute to PIN-based systems, Barclays reported that their voice recognition system is 95 percent accurate. This statistic means that many of its customers' voices might still not be recognised even when correct. This uncertanity revolving around the system could lead to slower adoption of biometric devices, continuing the reliance of traditional password-based methods.\n\n\nResearchers are targeting the drawbacks of present-day biometric devices and developing to reduce problems like biometric spoofing and inaccurate intake of data. Technologies which are being developed are-\n\nhttp://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=7&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=lawrence.IN.&s2=glaser.IN.&OS=IN/lawrence+AND+IN/glaser&RS=IN/lawrence+AND+IN/glaser\n"}
{"id": "3449534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3449534", "title": "Bogotazo", "text": "Bogotazo\n\nEl Bogotazo (from \"Bogotá\" and the \"-azo\" suffix of violent augmentation) refers to the massive riots that followed the assassination in Bogotá, Colombia, of Liberal leader and presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán on 9 April 1948 during the government of President Mariano Ospina Pérez. The 10-hour riot left much of downtown Bogotá destroyed. The aftershock of Gaitan's murder continued extending through the countryside and escalated a period of violence which had begun eighteen years before, in 1930, and was triggered by the fall of the conservative party from government and the rise of the liberals. The 1946 presidential elections brought the downfall of the liberals allowing conservative Mariano Ospina Pérez to win the presidency. The struggle for power between both again triggered a period in the history of Colombia known as \"La Violencia\" (\"The Violence\") that lasted until approximately 1958, from which the civil conflict that continues to this day grew.\n\nOn April 9, 1948 the 9th Pan-American Conference was being held in Bogotá. The Cold War was in its early stages with communist regimes installed throughout eastern Europe. Washington was eager to set a position against communism through a statement forwarded by General George Marshall, the U.S. Secretary of State and head of the American delegation, which was to be backed by the foreign ministers of the Latin American nations.\n\nAt the time, Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was the leader of the Liberal Party, and the most prominent politician in the country after President Ospina. His office was in downtown Bogotá, on the corner of 7th avenue and 14th street. Gaitán was a candidate in the presidential election, and with massive support among the country's working class, was seen as the candidate most likely to win. Both Conservatives and traditional Liberal elites were very concerned at this prospect.\n\nGaitán, a practicing attorney, arrived home early on the morning of the 9th of April after the successful ending to a case that he had been involved with. He returned to his office around 9:00 a.m., where he worked on political matters till the afternoon. Later that day he was invited to lunch by a political supporter, Plinio Mendoza Neira. Other sympathizers would join them as well including a newspaper editor, a fellow politician and a physician. On their way out, the group was surprised by a lone gunman who fired several times at Gaitán from the front. Gaitán fell to the ground.\n\nThe man suspected of killing Gaitán ran away heading south and pursued by an angry crowd. A policeman Carlos Alberto Jiménez Díaz tried to control the situation. According to police reports, the man surrendered to Jiménez calling:\n\n- \"No me mates, mi cabo\" \"(Don't kill me, my corporal)\"\n\nIn an attempt to avoid the mob, Jiménez locked himself and his prisoner in the nearby Granada drugstore. Some witnesses subsequently interviewed by local newspapers (\"El Tiempo\" and \"El Espectador\", issues from April to May, same year) claimed that the man who was taken into the drugstore was not the same one who was captured, and that in the confusion Officer Jiménez was mistaken because the other man was also wearing a gray hat. According to the drugstore owner, when he asked the prisoner why he had killed Gaitán, he replied:\n\n- \"¡Ay Señor, cosas poderosas! ¡Ay, Virgen del Carmen, sálvame!\" \"(Oh mighty lord! Oh powerful things! Our Lady of Carmen, save me!)\"\n\nAfter that, the doors were charged and the man was taken by the mob. His naked corpse was found later, in the Bolívar Square, outside the Presidential Palace. His face was crushed with a brick, and his body was mutilated. A bystander, Gabriel Restrepo, collected the remains of his clothes and found some personal documents, which identified him as 26-year-old Juan Roa Sierra.\n\nThere have been a number of theories concerning Gaitán's murder, some claiming that the assassination was planned and undertaken by other persons in addition to Juan Roa Sierra; or that the latter was not the real killer. Sierra was born into a poor family. There was a history of mental illness amongst Sierra's brothers, and he may himself have been unstable. He was seen often in Gaitán's office asking for a job, since he was unemployed, but Gaitán had never received him. Some people who knew Sierra stated that he never learned to shoot a gun, although Gaitán's assassin had fired accurate shots. It has been known that the gun used to kill Gaitán was sold two days before the crime, with not enough time to teach Roa to use a gun. So, it has been theorized that the crime was planned for political reasons and to promote interests of foreign countries, but this has never been corroborated. Publications have mentioned among others: the government of Mariano Ospina Pérez; sectors of the Liberal party; the Colombian Communist party; Fidel Castro; the CIA; and others that may have been involved in his murder.\n\"Radio Estación Últimas noticias\", managed by followers of Gaitán, made the following broadcast some minutes later:\n\nÚltimas Noticias con ustedes.

A la calle con palos, piedras, escopetas, cuanto haya a la mano. Asaltad las ferreterías y tomaos la dinamita, la pólvora, las herramientas, los machetes ...\nTranslation:\nLatest news with you. Conservatives and the Ospina Pérez government have just killed Dr. Gaitán, who fell by the door of his office, shot by a police officer. People: To arms! Charge! To the streets with clubs, stones, shotguns, or whatever is at hand! Break into the hardware stores and take the dynamite, gunpowder, tools, machetes...\nAfter that, instructions to make Molotov cocktails were broadcast.\n\nPeople from everywhere in the city rushed downtown. Many were homeless people who had come to Bogotá to flee the violent political conflicts of rural Colombia. A large crowd formed outside Clinica Central, the hospital where Gaitan died.\n\nAt 1:20 p.m. President Ospina was notified of the murder and called for a council with his cabinet. After dumping the body of Roa outside the Casa de Nariño, the crowd attacked the palace with stones and bricks. Many cars, buses and streetcars were burned. A few hours later violence exploded in other cities, including Medellín, Ibagué and Barranquilla.\n\nThe leaders of the Liberal Party decided to nominate Darío Echandía to replace Gaitán as head of the party. From a balcony, he pleaded the crowd to stop the violence, but it was useless. The mobs tried to force entry to the Casa de Nariño. They were confronted by the Army, and many were killed. The offices of the government ministry and \"El Siglo\" newspaper were set on fire.\n\nMost hardware stores were raided, especially in San Victorino district. People armed themselves with pipes, hooks, steel rods, hatchets, saws, and machetes. Some policemen joined the mobs. Others were confused and waited for orders that never came.\n\nAbout 3:00 p.m, the mobs broke into the police headquarters. The major in charge, Benicio Arce Vera, came out unarmed to plead with the crowd, and gave orders to his men not to shoot. The mob trampled him and seized weapons and ammunition. According to Arce, in an interview years later to \"Bohemia\" magazine, among those who took the weapons was Fidel Castro, (La Habana, April 21, 1983, issue 16). Some writers say that this event influenced Fidel Castro at the age of 21, who had the opportunity to witness the initial violence and take views about the viability of an electoral route for political change. Others view it more darkly since Castro at that age had already been involved in violence in Cuba where he is reputed to have killed, or tried to kill, some university rivals (including Rolando Masferrer) by that time (Ros, 2003).\n\nThe leaders of the Liberal party were still in the hospital, next to Gaitán's body, overwhelmed and at a loss as to how the chaos might be controlled. They received a phone call from the presidential palace, inviting them to a meeting to try to resolve their differences and find a solution. However, because of the conflict in the streets, the Liberal leaders could not reach the palace - some received shotgun wounds. Eventually they asked for a military escort, and successfully reached the palace. However, President Ospina was surprised to see the Liberal leaders, since the invitation had been made by some of his ministers without his knowledge. Discussions went throughout the night, but failed to reach an agreement.\n\nThe murder of Gaitán was followed by widespread confusion. Civilians took to the streets of the \"centro\" district sacking public buildings. Among these were the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Health, the offices of the public prosecutor and the Ministry of Communications. The rioting also extended to private property with 157 buildings in the downtown area suffering serious damage, 103 of these were a total loss.\n\nMany were killed over struggles for stolen goods. All sorts of merchandise was carried off to the poorer outlying districts. As reported some days later by \"Semana\" magazine (issue #78, April 24/1948), people started to sell the stolen objects at extremely low prices, or just exchanged the merchandise for alcohol. In the following days, a market for selling the stolen goods was set up, which was known as the \"Feria Panamericana\" (Pan-American Fair).\n\nTrying to calm the riots, staff of the radio station \"Últimas Noticias\" — Gerardo Molina, Diego Montaña Cuéllar, Carlos Restrepo Piedrahita, Jorge Zalamea, Jorge Uribe Márquez, José Mar and others — planned to start a Revolutionary Council. They broadcast information about the constitution of this council and announced severe punishment to those who took advantage of the riots to commit crimes.\n\nThe Central Government, after defeating the mobs that were attacking the Justice Palace, showed little interest in the violence over the rest of the city. However, statements broadcast by Últimas Noticias claiming political power were perceived as a threat. The electricity in that district was shut down, and the Army was sent in to shut down transmission.\n\nThe rioting and violence that followed Gaitán's murder resulted in the deaths of 600-3000 people, with 450 more hospitalized with injuries.\n\n\n\n"}

He was an advocate of Yiddish language and culture and was a vice-president of the Czernowitz Yiddish Language Conference of 1908, which declared Yiddish to be \"a national language of the Jewish people.\"\n\n\"Issued by the Zhitlowsky Anniversary Committee in 1935:\"\n\nChaim Zhitlowsky was born in 1865, in the small town of Ushachy, in the province of Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire. When he was five years old, his parents moved to Vitebsk, the capital of the province. On his mother's side he was descended from artisans and merchants, on his father's—from an aristocratic and well-educated family. His father, Joseph, studied to be a rabbi in the Yeshiva of Volozhin, but chose to become a merchant. Though an ardent Lubavich Chassid he was well versed in Haskalah (enlightenment) literature, and often recited satiric Haskalah tales and poems in Yiddish and Hebrew at family gatherings.\n\nJoseph Zhitlowsky's business prospered. He moved to a richer, more exclusive section of the city. He kept an open house. A tutor of the Russian language was engaged for Chaim, but he continued his elementary religious studies at a kheyder. Soon Chaim became friendly with high school students of his neighborhood and began to read Russian literature. He made his first literary attempt, translating the Yiddish version of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" into Hebrew.\n\nOn his 13th birthday (his bar-mitzvah) Chaim made the acquaintance of Shloyme Rappaport, who was later to become S. Ansky, the famous author of \"The Dybuk\". A warm lifelong friendship developed between Zhitlowsky and Ansky, who had a weakness in common – writing. For a short time they issued a handwritten (holographic) magazine called \"Vitebsk Bells\".\n\nOn entering the third grade of the Russian Gymnasium in 1879, Zhitlowsky came into contact with revolutionary circles, and, for the time being was estranged from Yiddish and other matters of Jewish interest. He was sobered, however, by the pogroms of the early 1880s, and his naive cosmopolitanism was quickly dissipated. He left the gymnasium, went to Tula in 1881 and there was engaged in spreading Socialist Revolutionary propaganda. Shocked by the view of some members of that party, that pogroms were a step toward the liberation of the Russian people, he left the party. When he returned to Vitebsk he was caught in the current of the then rising Palestine movement. He was inspired by the vision of the Jewish colonies and a Jewish peasantry, but the religious character of that Palestinism did not appeal to him. He sought to publish a magazine to propagandize \"his idea\"—a synthesis of Jewish nationalism and socialism. At first his father was willing to finance this enterprise, but was talked out of it by an ardent Palestinian friend.\n\nIn 1885 Zhitlowsky tried to found a Jewish section of the illegal Narodnya Volya party, but the Jews in the central committee of the Narodnya Volya who believed in cosmopolitanism and assimilation defeated the Zhitlowsky project. This was a severe blow for the young Jewish revolutionary. His grandfather consoled him, pointing out the revolutionary character of the prophets, and of the great Jewish intellects of the later times. This quickened Zhitlowsky's interest in Jewish history. At the St. Petersburg Imperial Library he found books he needed, and soon he established contact with a St. Petersburg group of the Narodnaya Volya.\n\nHis first work, a treatise in Russian entitled \"Thought of the Historical Fate of the Jewish People\" was published in Moscow in 1887 when he was only twenty-two. (Shortly before that he had been banished by the police from St. Petersburg). The liberal Russian press enthusiastically greeted and responded warmly to his ideas, but it met with scant favor among Jewish critics, because it contained no solution of the problems it treated. Several suspected him of being a Christian missionary.\n\nZhitlowsky returned to Vitebsk for a short time, from there he went to Galicia where it was much easier to preach Socialist doctrines among the Jewish masses. He became acquainted with a group of Jewish revolutionists from Zurich, who were engaged in disseminating radical literature in Yiddish.\n\nHe went to Berlin and resumed his study of Jewish history, Marxism and philosophy. He was expelled from Germany, under the anti-Socialist law, and moved to Zurich. He immediately became active, founding the non-partisan \"Verein für Wissenschaft und Leben des Jüdischen Volkes,\" for the purpose of inculcating nationalism and socialism among the Jewish masses. He engaged in debates between the orthodox and the adherents of the Narodnaya Volya. The latter evolved into the Social Revolutionary Party. He moved to Berne to study. Here, too, he founded an organization similar to the one in Zurich.\n\nWhen famine broke out in Russia in 1891, he and Charles Rappaport founded a non-partisan organization to help the afflicted. The work was doomed to failure from the start. The representatives of the various political groups could not forget their differences. The work ended, even before it had begun.\n\nThough engrossed as ever in social and political activity, he found time to prepare his Ph.D. thesis, and to continue his studies in Marxism. His debut in Jewish literature took place in 1891.\n\nThe London newspaper \"Freie Welt\" published his translation of two revolutionary poems. In 1892 The London Fund for Revolutionary Publication printed his Russian tractate \"A Jew to Jews\", under the pseudonym of I. Khisin. In his first socialist pamphlet on a Jewish theme, he demanded national as well as civil equality for Jews. He was also active in an organization which combated the anti-Jewish \"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\"\n\nToward the latter part of 1893, Zhitlowsky, now a Ph.D., aided by Shloyme Rappaport, M. Rosenbaum and several other Russian radicals, founded the Federation of Socialist Revolutionaries from which later developed the Socialist Revolutionary Party. The group opposed dogmatic Marxism. The newspaper \"The Russian Worker\", appearing under Zhitlowsky's and Rappaport's editorship, spread propaganda among the masses. The Verband published in 1898 Zhitlowsky's theoretical work, \"Socialism and the Fight for Political Freedom\", written under the pen name Gregorovich. In this work, he tried to synthesize the three principal currents of the Russian revolutionary movement. From time to time, he contributed to several well-known Russian magazines, such as \"Russkoye Bogastvo\"; articles on Marxism and philosophy in the Jewish—Russian Voskhod; and contributed also to \"Sozialistische Monatshefte\" and \"Deutsche Worte\".\n\nIn 1896, he organized the Group of Jewish Socialists Abroad, the purpose of which was to prepare revolutionary propaganda literature in Yiddish, with the \"Communist Manifesto\" as a beginning. For this revolutionary library, Zhitlowsky wrote an introduction entitled \"Yiddish—Why?\". The Bund which published the booklet thought that Zhitlowsky's introduction was not sufficiently revolutionary and too nationalistic, because the author expressed the belief that the rebirth of the Yiddish language and literature would lead to the national and social awakening of the Jewish people.\n\nZhitlowsky attended the First Zionist Congress convened at Basle in 1897. He was against founding a Zionist party. He believed in the necessity for a League for Jewish Colonization, a league that would appeal to all those opposed to Herzel's political Zionism. A day after the Congress, Zhitlowsky addressed the delegates and guests on Yiddish and the purposes of the Yiddish publishing house Zeit Geist, which had been founded by a group of Jewish intellectuals and revolutionaries. In this speech were first laid the foundations of Yiddishism, which subsequently became deeply rooted in Eastern Europe and America. He came into close relations with the Bund which published his pamphlet \"Zionism or Socialism?\" in 1898.\n\nIn 1900, Zhitlowsky and John Edelheim founded the Deutscher Academischer Soziale Wissenschafte. They also took over the magazine \"Sozialistische Monatshefte\".\n\nHe toured important European centers, making connections with revolutionary leaders of England, France, and Germany. The Deutscher Academischer Varlag existed several years. It was often attacked by orthodox Marxists because of the \"revisionist\" works published by him.\n\nAfter the Kishineff pogrom of 1903 Zhitlowsky turned toward the territorialistic movement. He conceived the idea of a Jewish Sejm (parliament). At his initiative a group of radical nationalists and Zionists organized the Jewish Socialist Workers Party (commonly called the Sejmist party). In 1904, Zhitlowsky served as delegate at the International Socialist Congress in Amsterdam, and his fight that the Socialist Revolutionary Party should have a representative in the International Socialist Bureau ended victoriously.\n\nWhen the first Yiddish daily in Russia, the St. Petersburg \"Frajnd\", was founded, Zhitlowsky, under the pen name N. Gaydaroff, contributed a series of articles entitled \"The Jewish People and the Yiddish Language\".\n\nIn 1904 Zhitlowsky and \"Babushka\" (Granny) Breshkovskaya were sent by the Socialist Revolutionary Party to America to collect funds for the party and carry on a propaganda of its ideas.\n\nWith the Party's permission he gave lectures on various Jewish matters during his stay in America. At that time the Jewish radical intelligentsia in America was under the influence of naive socialist cosmopolitanism, which expressed itself in scorn for Jewish national problems, and for the Yiddish language and culture. When Zhitlowsky in a series of lectures pointed out that there was no contradiction between progressive nationalism and the socialist ideal, he encountered strong opposition. Very soon, however, many of his erstwhile opponents turned into his most ardent partisans.\n\nAfter a two-year sojourn in America, he returned to Europe. He spent some time in Galicia and then went to Russia, where his native province, Vitebsk, nominated him for Duma elections. The government refused to allow him to take his seat when elected. The reversal of this decision by the Senate came too late, for the Tsar had dissolved the Duma.\n\nZhitlowsky spent 1907 in Finland. With the aid of Gregory Gershuni, he engaged in a strong Socialist Revolutionary propaganda. He called a congress of socialist factions which leaned more closely to the Socialist Revolutionary ideology. This congress adopted several of his resolutions which increased the influence of the Sejmists (Parliamentarians) The Socialist Revolutionaries and the Sejmists sent him as their delegate to the International Socialist Congress at Stuttgart that year. Here he fought for the rights of these two parties in the International Socialist Bureau.\n\nIn 1908 he was sent to America by the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Sejmists. With the help of the following he had attracted among the radical Jewish intellectuals during his previous visit, Zhitlowsky founded a publishing house that issued a new monthly, \"Dos Naye Leben\" (The New Life). Under his editorship, the journal exercised great influence on Yiddish culture, including the development of free socialist thought, and became an organ of modern Yiddish literature; for the six years it existed (until 1914), \"Dos Naye Leben\" was a spiritual home of many Jewish publicists and scientists.\n\nZhitlowsky returned to Europe in 1908, where he participated in the Czernowitz Yiddish Language Conference. Under the leadership of its originators, Zhitlowsky, J. L. Perez and Nathan Birnbaum, the Conference for the first time declared Yiddish to be \"a national language of the Jewish people.\"\n\nIn 1909 Zhitlowsky raised (in his magazine \"Dos Naye Leben\") the question of founding Yiddish secular schools in America.\n\nIn 1910 at the Convention of the Poale Zion Party in Montreal, Canada, that matter was placed by him on the order of the day, and there and then the inauguration of this type of school was proclaimed. The first Folkshul in New York City was opened on 10 December 1910 at 143 Madison St., and Zhitlowsky took an active part in the growth of the school.\n\nHis influence was also very considerable in the creation, some years later, of the Jewish secular schools of the Workmen's Circle, despite the opposition of Abe Cahan, editor of \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" who advocated assimilation of Jewish workers into the general working class.\n\nIn 1912, the thousands of Zhitlowsky's followers attracted by his writings and lectures, celebrated the 25th anniversary of his literary activity. Four volumes of his collected works, shortly followed by two others, were published in connection with this anniversary.\n\nIn 1913 publication of \"Dos Naye Leben\" ceased, and Zhitlowsky made a lecture tour of Jewish student colonies of the important academic centers in France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. He also visited Palestine in order to study the possibilities of widespread Jewish colonization there.\n\nHe returned to America at the outbreak of the World War I. Until then he had been a contributor to the \"Warheit\", edited by L. A. Miller. He now joined the staff of the newly organized \"Day\". He advocated America's neutrality, and battled against the pro-German feelings of the man in the street and of the Yiddish press.\n\nZhitlowsky also joined the movement for a Jewish congress and when it was convened he played an important part in its deliberations. At the same time, he continued his tracts on philosophy and sociology in the Yiddish magazine \"Zukunft\".\n\nIn 1920, publication commenced of \"Die Zeit\" (\"The Times\"), a daily of the Poale Zion party, a party that Zhitlowsky had joined a few years before, and he became one of its major contributors. When the publication ceased in 1921, Zhitlowsky became a contributor of \"Der Tog\" (\"The Day\").\n\nIn 1922, Zhitlowsky and Shmuel Niger renewed the publication of \"Dos Naye Leben\". Its point of view remained unaltered. In 1923, when the magazine was discontinued, Zhitlowsky returned to Europe to complete \"The Spiritual Struggle of the Jewish People for Freedom\". He visited Palestine and toured the Jewish centers in Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, between 1924 and 1925. Everywhere he was received with the greatest enthusiasm and admiration.\n\nOn 28 November 1925, Zhitlowsky's 60th birthday was celebrated at the Manhattan Opera House in New York. Similar celebrations were held in other American and European cities visited by Zhitlowsky. A Zhitlowsky memorial volume was published in Berlin containing articles and reminiscences of his intimate friends and disciples. At Zhitlowsky's suggestion, the proceeds from the book were given to the Yiddish Scientific Institute (YIVO) of Vilno, which Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, as well as Zhitlowsky, were members of its Honorary Board of Directors.\n\nThrough his and S. Ellsberg's initiative, the Yiddish Culture Society was founded in September 1929. The purpose of the organization was to unite all adherents of Yiddish to enable them to work in common for the development of Yiddish, the Yiddish school and Yiddish culture in general. He was also one of the editors of the weekly \"Yiddish\", issued by the Yiddish Culture Society.\n\nWhen the Jewish-American Congress decided to resume activity on a democratic basis, Zhitlowsky at once engaged in its labors. He was one of the leaders of the Worker's Bloc, and supported the calling of a Jewish World Congress.\n\nOn the eve of his 70th birthday, he was no less active as a writer and leader than in former years.\n\nOther writings of Zhitlowsky include: \n\nThe committee sponsoring the celebration of Zhitlowsky's 70th birthday planned to publish his collected works and memoirs.\n\nDuring his literary career, Zhitlowsky has contributed to the most important Yiddish newspapers and magazines in America and Europe, and helped to create a style for Yiddish publicistic and scientific writing.\n\nIn his monograph, \"Zhitlowsky; His Life and Work\", Shmuel Niger made the following summary of Zhitlowsky's achievements:\n\nIn the world of universal ideas:\n\nIn the Jewish world:\n\nThis is a short summary of over a half of century of scientific, literary, journalistic work, and activity as a lecturer and publisher, all in the spirit of socialism and progressive nationalism among the Jewish masses in America and abroad.\n\nIn \"Yidn un Yiddishkayt\" (\"Jews and Jewishness\", 1924), he sought to define the secular essence of \"Yiddishkeit\", this time by calling forth the notions of racial contemporary theories.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3512501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3512501", "title": "Child protection", "text": "Child protection\n\nChild protection is the protection of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect. Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides for the protection of children in and out of the home.\n\nChild protection systems are a set of usually government-run services designed to protect children and young people who are underage and to encourage family stability. UNICEF defines a ‘child protection system’ as: \n\nDue to economic reasons, especially in poor countries, children are forced to work in order to survive. Child labour often happens in difficult conditions, which are dangerous and impair the education of the future citizens and increase vulnerability to adults. It is hard to know exactly the age and number of children who work. At least 152 million children under 5 years of age worked in 2016, but the figure is underestimated because domestic labour is not counted. \n\nIn some countries, children can be imprisoned for common crimes. In some countries, like Iran or China, criminals can even be sentenced to capital punishment for crimes committed while they were children (the United States abandoned the practice in 2005). In contexts where military use of children is made, they also risk being prisoners of war. Other children are forced to prostitution, exploited by adults for illegal traffic in children or endangered by poverty and hunger. Infanticide today continues at a much higher rate in areas of extremely high poverty and overpopulation, such as parts of China and India. Female infants, then and even now, are particularly vulnerable, a factor in sex-selective infanticide.\n\nMost children who come to the attention of the child welfare system do so because of any of the following situations, which are often collectively termed child abuse. Abuse typically involves abuse of power, or exercising power for an unintended purpose. This includes willful neglect, knowingly not exercising a power for the purpose it was intended. This is why child abuse is defined as taking advantage of a position of trust having been invested with powers\n\nIn 1984 the Council of Europe, the body that supervises the European Convention on Human Rights, make Recommendation R(84) 4 on Parental Responsibilities. These defined parental responsibility as a 'function' duties to be met and powers that can be exercised to meet those duties. Child abuse and neglect is failure by a person with parental or any other protective responsibility to exercise the powers for the intended purpose, which is the benefit of the child.\n\nActions typically include services aimed at supporting at-risk families so they can remain intact to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child, investigation of alleged child abuse and, if necessary, assuming parental responsibility by foster care and adoption services.\n\nServices are provided by corporate bodies (or legal personalities). Parental responsibility gives parents and businesses that make provision to children and families equivalent legal entities. This includes public bodies and public bodies that regulate private bodies. This has been described as the partnership between state and family.\n\nA position held in a body corporate places a person in a position of trust. Child maltreatment is the neglectful or abusive exercise of power in a position of trust by either business in delivery of the products that best serve the child's needs for the parents to provide for the child or by the parents in providing for the child with those products.\n\nA 2014 European Commission survey on child protection systems listed the following categories of children needing help:\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) is a United Nations agency dealing with labour issues, created in 1919. It takes care also of child labour issues, in particular with conventions 138 and 182.\n\nOn 20 November 1959 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Declaration of the Rights of the Child during the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is a United Nations Programme headquartered in New York City, that provides long-term humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries.\n\nIn 2000, an agreement was reached among UNO countries about the military use of children.\n\nThe effectiveness of these programs is contested and seems limited to some.\n\nProvincial or state governments' child protection legislation empowers the government department or agency to provide services in the area and to intervene in families where child abuse or other problems are suspected. The agency that manages these services has various names in different provinces and states, e.g., Department of Children's Services, Children's Aid, Department of Child and Family Services. There is some consistency in the nature of laws, though the application of the laws varies across the country.\n\nThe United Nations has addressed child abuse as a human rights issue, adding a section specifically to children in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\nMost countries have introduced laws to protect and prevent children and young persons from certain threats or harms.\n\nIn 1908 the Children Act 1908 was introduced followed by the Children and Young Person Act 1920 with a bundle of laws to protect young persons and children in the early 20th century. The Children and Young Persons Act 1933 consolidated the laws into a single law.\n\nThe Children Act 1933 defined child neglect and abuse as is now currently understood in the context of welfare and well-being. Welfare (health, safety and happiness) is the 'fare', nourishment, that makes a person 'well', healthy.\n\nLucy Delap notes that 'the period before 1948 saw the majority of work with vulnerable children undertaken by ‘moral’ or family welfare workers. These were mostly voluntary workers based within groups such as the Church of England’s Moral Welfare Associations. Their remit also included supporting ‘friendless girls’, unmarried mothers and babies, intervening to prevent prostitution, and helping treat and prevent the spread of venereal disease. Boys were not widely perceived as sexually vulnerable, and barely featured in discussions of child assault and prostitution.'\n\nWell-being is the personal motivation and aspiration for security, comfort and emotional contentment that drives the process. The offence of child cruelty under section 1 of the Children and Young Peoples Act 1989 provides protection for health and safety. Learning, as the other essential ingredient to the pursuit of well-being, is covered by section 44.\n\nChild protection and the prevention of neglect and abuse follows this model throughout. This was the approach that led the policy imperative for eradicating child poverty in a system of public health epidemiology. A programme international promoted by the World Health Organisation in the Health For All programming goal and nationally as Health for All Children. The public health imperative of well-being is exactly mirrored in the socio-economic philosophy of capabilities as welfare economics.\n\nWhilst the Children and Young People Act 1933 established the foundations they were later consolidated into the state's employment, education, health and welfare by the Children Act 1989 and following tranche of legislation. Internationally, the principles were embodied in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nImportant Changes in 1933:\n\nAs can be seen from the above provisions, which all follow the principles of the Children and Young Peoples Act 1933, child protection is concerned with the child's exposure to, and consumption of, potentially hazardous products of all description.\n\nThe act followed Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100 to reflect the new law of negligence and demolition of the privily barrier in the law of contract. The new law recognised that the product manufacturer may be \"many parties removed\" from the ultimate product consumer and that the product may contain potentially hazardous but un-examinable content. This may be either through ingredient or packaging. Food intolerances are a simple example. The purchaser will be unaware of potentiality allergic content unless clearly advised by the producer.\n\nThe purchaser, or more generally 'procurer' (person who obtains), of product may not be the ultimate consumer. A parent procures for a child who is, potentially, the most vulnerable consumer. Section 1(1) of the Children and Young Peoples Act 1933 makes it a criminal offence of child cruelty for the person responsible for a child to expose him/her \"in a \"manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health\"\" (emphasis supplied). The approach is no different to employment health and safety, but for the consumer rather than the employee.\n\nIt is the \" \"manner\" \" of acting that is important: is this activity being carried out safely after an appropriate risk assessment to meet the duty of care in the law of negligence established by Donoghue. The person responsible for a child should know the child's food allergies and check any product content for potential food intolerances before allowing the child to consume the product.\n\nChild safeguarding follows directly from these principles. Safeguarding means taking the necessary protective measures for the child's safe consumption of any product, stair-gates, seatbelts, protective footwear, glasses, basic hygiene, etc. The list is both endless and, to the most part, obvious common sense. Failure by the responsible person is an offence of child cruelty on the grounds of failing to protect the child in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care \n\nA parent, person with parental responsibility for a child, has an express liability, whoever is responsible for the child at the time (s.17 of the act). Just as in employment health and safety, the powers of parenthood can be delegated but not the duties. Parents should make arrangements for suitable and properly informed others to have responsibility for their children (see also s.2(9)-(11) Children Act 1989).\n\nFor the product to be safely consumed by a child means that the responsible person must fully understand the product's safe use for its intended purpose. Miss-selling in the law of contract, suggesting the product does something it doesn't or selling products to those that do not fully understand what they are getting is potentially hazardous to the child as the ultimate consumer. Health and medical treatment may involve some form of physical contact in which case lack of proper consent is a potential battery, or even assault, of the person. The procurer must be placed in a position to assess any potential risk to the child in the reliable use of the product. (see 1.19 Reference Guide to Consent for Examination and Treatment (DOH 2009)).\n\nJust as in all of life, the likely benefits of a procured product come with possible non-beneficial qualities. Procurement is a careful activity attempting to achieve the best value for money. The benefits of the product must be satisfactorily delivered as specified for performance in the law of contract. Just as in food intolerances and consent to examination and treatment, the procurer must be made aware of any potential hazards in their circumstances of a product that performs reliably.\n\nWelfare defines the process by which proper consent or agreement is given when procuring products that will be beneficial and safe in the procurer's particular circumstances. If a child is the ultimate consumer of a procured product then the child's welfare (health, safety and happiness) is the paramount consideration when coming to the decision (see s.1(1) Children Act 1989).\n\nA balance must be struck between the obligations of the producer and the obligations of the procurer for the child's safe consumption of the product. The calculus of negligence is a legal approach, in the spirit of procurement efficiency, that attempts to strike that balance on economic grounds. This is most easily understood in terms of insurance liability. Should a car driver have a duty of care towards until cyclists at night or should the cyclist have a duty of care to properly illuminate his bicycle at night? The costs of bicycle illumination are considerably less than the cost of driving with a duty of care to unlit cyclists.\n\nA parent must also procure (obtain) all necessary products, environments, accommodation, goods and services to be provided for the child's safe consumption. Failure to do so is, again, an offence of child cruelty under s.1(2) of the act on the grounds of physical neglect and failing to prevent harm as impairment of health and development in Working Together to Safeguard Children (see, Part 2 B, 24, sentencing guidance, Overarching Principles: Overarching Principles: Assaults on children Assaults on children and Cruelty to a child; and Introduction, Working Together to Safeguard Children (HMG 2015) the governmental child protection guidance).\n\nThe procurement process for integrated provision is called a Children and Family Assessment, CAF Assessment, for integrated provision. The outcome is a CAF Action Plan to safeguard and promote the child's welfare with the specified outcomes of the services that best serve the child's needs to be delivered under the terms of proper consent (see 1.35 of Working Together).\n\nIn the Family Justice System the CAF Assessment is conducted by the Children and Family Court Advisory and Supervisory Service (CAFCASS) to \"safeguard and promote the welfare of children involved in family court proceedings\". In the Youth Justice System and Special Education Needs the CAF Assessment is conducted by local council parental responsibility units following Schedule 2 of the Special Educational Needs Regulations (Consolidated) 2001.\n\nDecisions made on all the necessary products: environments, accommodation, goods and services procured to be provided for the child's safe consumption must be in the best interests of the child. A child is a person, not an object of concern who simply lacks the capacity to give consent on her own behalf until Gillick Competent to do so. He/she must still be involved in the decision making processes for the products that best serve his/her needs in accordance with the best interests determination of s.4 Mental Capacity Act 2005. Failure of the responsible person to so is an offence on the grounds of emotional neglect (see, Part 2 B, 24, sentencing guidance, Overarching Principles: Overarching Principles: Assaults on children Assaults on children and Cruelty to a child; and Introduction, Working Together to Safeguard Children (HMG 2015) the governmental child protection guidance).\n\nWorking Together to Safeguard Children extends mental capacity to parental capacity for a person with parental responsibility and the best interests consideration under s.1(3)(a)-(f) the, so-called, [welfare checklist of family law http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/1 Children Act 1989]. This is the UK implementation of Article 3 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child \"Best Interests of the Child\".\n\n\"s.1(3)(a) the wishes and feelings of the child in light of his age and experience;\" are the child's involvement in the decision making process (see also s.17(4A) and s.47(4A) Children Act 1989).\n\n\"s.1(3)(b) the child's physical, emotional and educational needs\"; are for physical and emotional neglect to be prevented and to receive a proper education (s.36 Children Act 1989) in accordance with his/her aptitudes, abilities and any special needs he may have (s.7 Education Act 1996).\n\n\"s.1(3)(c) the likely effect of the change of circumstances\" are the likely outcomes for the child of the products as environment, accommodation, goods and services procured to be provided for him/her.\n\n\"s.1(3)(d) the age, sex, background, and other relevant characteristics of the child\" specifies the child's current condition for which the provision is required to address.\n\n\"s.1(3)(e) harm the child has suffered, or is at risk of suffering;\" specifies the harm, as ill-treatment or impairment of health and development the child has suffered or the hazards in his/her circumstances from which she is at risk of suffering harm. Just as in employment health and safety, these are the risks of the present care environment.\n\n\"s.1(3)(f) capability of the parents, or anybody else considered relevant, of meeting the child's needs;\" is the ability and responsibility of the parents for procuring the necessary products as environments, accommodation, goods and services to promote the child's welfare to be safely provided to him/her in safeguarding his/her welfare.\n\nThere is both a business and social imperative to give all the opportunity for safely and satisfactorily consuming the offerings of producers. Some, may not have the capacity to be capable of giving proper consent or agreement for the products that best serve their needs to use those products safely. In the case of parents, their children's needs to keep their children safe. This is called Legal Disability.\n\nDisability is the difference between capacity and capability. In the case of parents parental capacity of Working Together and parental capability of s.1(3)(f) of the Children Act 1989. Disability is defined as a mental or physical impairment with and adverse effect on normal day-to-day activities. A person without the use of their legs lacks the physical capacity to walk. They are not capable of carrying out the normal day-to-day activity of, say, shopping without some corrective measure such as a mobility scooter (see s.6 Equality Act 2010 and Guidance on Matters to be Taken into Account when Assessing Disability).\n\nMental capacity is the ability to make decisions in a best interests determination on a particular issue so as to be mentally capable of giving proper consent or agreement. Determining mental capacity requires the information on which the decision to be made to safeguard the person's welfare. A lack of mental capacity to process the information and make decisions is a legal disability leaving the person incapable of instructing a solicitor (s.3 Mental Capacity Act 2006, 26 Explanatory Notes to the Mental Capacity Act (2005); 1.6 Family Law Protocol (Law Society 2010)).\n\nPhysical and moral health refer to the faculties of the mind used in making decisions. Physical health is the mental capacity to understand the effects of matter and energy on both self and others. That is, to understand how a person may be physically harmed which is called causality in the law of negligence. Moral health is the mental capacity to recognise the persons and environment that may be damaged by the acts and omissions in the law of negligence, the neighbour and neighbourhood.\n\nPart 1 of the Children and Young Peoples Act 1933 is headed \"Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Exposure to Physical and Moral Danger\". The offence of child cruelty under s.1(1) includes \"...exposure in a manner likely to cause an unnecessary injury to health...\". Again, the manner of the exposure endangers the child's physical and moral health as faculties of the mind. It means nothing more than setting a bad example in either behaviour towards others (moral health) or carelessness with potentially dangerous items, e.g. speeding in a motor car.\n\nEmotional health is firstly intellectual health, the capacity to reason based on the understandings of physical and moral health when making decisions so as not harm a neighbour or neighbourhood. It is secondly the competencies to engage in social relationships, personal or business, under the terms of proper consent or agreement following that reasoning and decision making. Thirdly, it is the likely capability of applying those competencies to take opportunities in the cause of growth and well-being and then to perform reliably.\n\nThe Department of Health Introduction to the Children Act 1989 described new notion of parental responsibility as \"the authorities conferred by parental responsibility exist only for raising the child to physical, emotional and moral health\". Lord McKay of the Clasfern, the Lord Chancellor when introducing the act to Parliament said \"...the overwhelming task of parenthood and the all the rights it brings are for raising the child to be a properly developed adult, both physically and morally.\".\n\nThe child's physical and moral health are developed as physical development and behavioural (moral) development of physical and moral capacities; the child's emotional health is developed as intellectual development for the capacity to reason based on those understandings when making decisions; social development as the competencies to enter into social relationships, both personal and business; and emotional development of likely capability to take opportunities in the cause of growth and well-being and perform reliably (see s.17(11) Children Act 1989).\n\nLady Elizabeth Butler Sloss made this oft quoted remark in her inquiry into the Cleveland child abuse scandal. As a medical discipline, child welfare under s.1 and s.44 of the Children and Young Peoples Act 1933 is only distinguished from animal welfare under s.9 Animal Welfare Act 2006 by consideration of the child's wishes and feelings when making decisions in her best interests following s.4 Mental Capacity Act 2005 extended to parental capacity by Working Together to Safeguard Children and s.1(3)(a)-(f) of the Children Act 1989.\n\nAn animal is a possession whilst a child is a person and this distinction was a central intention of the Children Act 1989. Lord McKay also said when introducing the act, \"The days when a child was regarded as a possession of his family, indeed to sue on their loss, are today buried forever\". The child is socially and emotionally developed, whilst he lacks capacity, by full involvement in the decision making process in his best interests until he becomes competent as Gillick Competent.\n\nThe Department of Work and Pensions disability assessment is a measure of physical and mental capacities under clinical or controlled conditions from occupational health in respect to employment performance. The test for disability is capability as \"the mental or physical impairment with an adverse effect on day-to-day activities\" as social performance. The assessment of capacity is used in a home based disability assessment under s.47 NHS and Community Care Act 1990.\n\nFor a parent, a parental disability is the mental or physical impairment with the adverse effect on the day-to-day activity of giving the child the care it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give a similar child (s.31 Children Act 1989).\n\nWhatever their mental or physical impairments parents should be given the necessary disability support to care for their children to maintain a reasonable standard of health and development. (s.17(10) Children Act 1989).\n\nFor those with parental responsibility mental capacity to make decisions in own best interests is extended to parental capacity to make decisions in the best interests of the child by Working Together to Safeguard Children. The s.47 disability assessment is extended by Part III and s.8 Part 1 Schedule 2 Children Act 1989.\n\nPart III Children Act 1989 includes s.17 and the local authority duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children by the provision of services for the families of children in need. The services include advocacy services for advice and assistance in decision making when exercising the authorities of parental responsibility. This was another clear intention of the act described in the Department of Health Introduction as \"...the belief that children are best brought up in the family with both parents playing a full part...the local authority duty to provide support for children and families...\"\n\nThe s.47 disability assessment is to support mental health care in the community and is conducted with a view to a possible deprivation of liberty for those who lack the capability to care for themselves in the community under Schedule A1 Mental Capacity Act 2005. The decision is made after a Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conference known as MARAC.\n\nIn the case a parent who is not capable of meeting the child's needs then the local authority can intervene with a court order under s.31(2) Children Act 1989. To do so they must meet the public law thresholds that the child is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm attributable to the care it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give, the same criteria as for parental disability support.\n\nIt is assumed that the parent has been given the necessary support for any parental disability under the terms of proper consent, that the welfare of the child has been safeguarded and the risk to the child is parental negligence. The test of parental negligence is, following Donoghue later called the Bolam Test, the same test as for professional negligence. If a care order is made the local authority acquires parental responsibility under s.33 of the act as the, so-called, corporate parent.\n\nThese thresholds are highly controversial and poorly understood. A number of esoteric legal principles are involved and most easily understood in terms of employment performance and health and safety.\n\nA parent, just like the CEO of a corporate body, must be, and be seen to be a fit and responsible person. If called into question the court will firstly examine the facts. In employment health and safety there are the facts of accidents, the accident record book of harm suffered, and the facts of the employment environment, harm likely to be suffered, say, from a trip hazard.\n\nThe facts are found to the civil standard of proof, the balance of probabilities, 'Did the facts of the alleged trip hazard occur?\", this is called 'The Trier of Fact'. If so, do these found facts amount to a trip hazard?, this is called the Question of Law. This conforms that the alleged events occurred and were unlawful but that is not enough there is next the issue of culpability or State of Mind. Negligence is a state of mind. This notion comes from the criminal law and the offence of child cruelty under s.1 Children and Young Peoples Act 1933. What was the motivation, carelessness or malice? There is a defence of diminished responsibility, the offence occurred but was not voluntary or reasonably foreseeable by an impaired or incapacitated defendant.\n\nThe offence of child cruelty allows a defence of parental incapacity on a wide range of grounds (see sentencing guidance, Overarching Principles: Overarching Principles: Assaults on children Assaults on children and Cruelty to a child).\n\nThe employment health and safety approach is again helpful in understanding this complexity. To summarise so far, as a matter of fact found on the balance of probabilities, the child has suffered harm or been exposed to an unsafe environment. The person responsible for the child was in, at least, a negligent state of mind in failing to protect the child to safeguarding or promote his/her welfare. This is all based in the present and the final finding is as a fit and proper person to hold this responsibility into the future. Is there a track record of such irresponsible behaviour?\n\nThe offence of child cruelty can be prosecuted concurrently with any assault on the child. If a child is assaulted, sexually or physically, then both the assailant and the person responsible for keeping the child safe from the assault are culpable for the harm suffered as physical abuse or sexual abuse. This completes the definitions of child neglect and abuse in Annex A of Working Together (see also Preventing child maltreatment: a guide to taking action and generating evidence (WHO 2006)).\n\nThe offence of child cruelty is the UK implementation of Article 19(1) UN Convention on the Rights of the Child \"Protection of Children From Violence\". Article 19(2) requires social programmes to for preventing violence to children and these are to be found under s.4 Part 1 Schedule 2 Children Act 1989 and include services to children and families under Part III of the same enactment in meeting the local authority duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.\n\nA key part of child protection work is assessment.\n\nA particular challenge arises where child protection professionals are assessing families where neglect is occurring. Professionals conducting assessments of families where neglect is taking place are said to sometimes make the following errors:\n\nchild fund international\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34941883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34941883", "title": "Despard Plot", "text": "Despard Plot\n\nThe Despard Plot was a failed 1802 conspiracy by British revolutionaries led by Colonel Edward Marcus Despard, a former army officer and colonial official. Evidence presented in court suggested that Despard planned to assassinate the monarch George III and seize key strong points in London such as the Bank of England and Tower of London as a prelude to a wider uprising by the population of the city. The British Government was aware of the plot five months before the scheduled date of attack, however waited to arrest to gain enough evidence. One week before the scheduled attack, Despard and his co-conspirators were arrested at a pub in Lambeth on suspicion of plotting an uprising. Despard's execution on 21 February 1803 was attended by a crowd of around 20,000, the largest public gathering until the funeral of Lord Nelson two years later following the Battle of Trafalgar.\n\nDespard had been arrested for the police (Bow Street Runners) on 16 November 1802 while attending a meeting of 40 working men at the Oakley Arms tavern: eight carpenters, five labourers, two shoemakers, two hatters, a stonemason, a clockmaker, a plasterer (formerly a sailor), and a wood cutter had been among the arrested. Many had been soldiers, including Despard, and several were Irishmen who had served on the King's ships. Furthermore, several of those arrested had been Irish labourers \"united in Ireland\", a contemporary code-phrase which implied that the mass killings and terror inflicted by the British following the Irish Rebellion of 1798 had not extinguished the Irish enthusiasm for independence. The tavern was immediately down the road from the Albion Mills, the first London steam powered mill which had been burned in 1791, part of the direct, anonymous resistance to the industrial revolution; the neighbourhood was a hotbed of continued resistance to exploitation both parliamentary and economic, an area where the government was referred to as \"Man Eaters, and Parliament the \"Den of Thieves.\n\nAlthough the plot was highly publicised, details of the trial have never been released. In 1794 the British government failed to prove that the London Corresponding Society (of which Despard was a member) was treasonous. Because of this, many of the details focused on the attempted assassination of Despard's plot, as this is what prosecutors focused on. Informers claimed that John Wood offered to post himself sentry with a cannon to fire at the King's carriage as it was going to what was then called Buckingham House. It is unlikely that Despard favoured this plan, as it was viewed as very dangerous and still hoped that men in high places, such as the politician Francis Burdett, would agree to non-regicidal changes in government. Though that may be true, evidence produced at the trial suggests that Despard did indeed consider regicide.\n\nSir Edward O'Brien Pryce approached authorities the day of Despard's arrest to offer evidence against Despard. Pryce claimed that through notes, Despard had offered him unlimited sums of money in exchange for advice on making underground bombs. Despard, it was alleged, had sent him a diagram of boxes with spring locks containing three powder barrels surrounded by balls and metal spikes. These were to be buried under the road and detonated by connecting wire. Bombs were to be placed in three locations: the road to Windsor Castle, between Buckingham House and Hyde Park gate, and an exit of Buckingham House, opposite the gate into the lower part of Green Park.\n\nAlthough seemingly concluded, Pryce's evidence was not used in court; this was because the authorities wondered why he had failed to make contact with them in February when this happened. While the trial (and thus information about the plot) was mostly focused on the attempted assassination of the King, Despard and his co-conspirators also contemplated the seizure of the Bank of England and a military rising of the Third Grenadiers stationed at the Tower of London. They hoped that these attacks would set off uprisings all over the country.\n\nThere was little physical evidence produced during this trial. The only pieces were printed copies of the United Englishmen's constitution which called for independence for Britain and Ireland, equal rights, and compensation for those who fall to achieve these ideals. Although the United Englishmen's constitution was revolutionary, there was little evidence of planned regicide. The 1797 Act Against Administering Unlawful Oaths made these constitutions stronger evidence for rebellion, but not necessarily for regicide. Like the similar case of James Hadfield, another possible attempted assassin of King George III, Colonel Despard's sanity was questioned during the trial. Many of Despard's contemporaries, including Cobbett and Lord Cloncurry (who had earlier been suspected of complicity), distanced themselves from Despard's failure. The jury concluded that Despard's words had been freely given in public spaces and thus was judged as sane. Although judged sane, public society deemed Despard and his plan mad. Cobbett commented on this distinction, \"If you abhor treason, you are told Despard was a madman; if you are discontented with public affairs, you are told he was a hero.\"\n\nDue to the 1795 Treason Act, there was little legal distinction between plotting treason and committing treason. The jury was impressed by the Colonel's character references such as that given by Evan Neppean and Horatio Nelson, who had been his companion in Honduras; the jury was also unsure about the lack of solid evidence, and consequently Despard and his colleagues were found guilty of high treason but the jury recommended mercy.\n\nThe proposed execution raised considerable anxiety, given that it was to be in an area congested by working men (exactly the kind of man to whom Despard had appealed) and the chief magistrate, Sir Richard Ford, expressed his concern over the size of the crowds that assembled during the day and evenings near the jail. He had trouble hiring workmen to build the scaffold; the jailer feared to leave the safety of the prison; and he deployed over 100 armed soldiers throughout the neighbourhood on the night before the execution. Handbills calling on the people to rise had been distributed and the authorities feared the possibility of a riot, if not an outright attempt to free the prisoners. The prisoners remained recalcitrant, especially Despard, refusing to discuss their plans or to reveal the identities of any others who might have been involved in the plot.\n\nA further problem for the authorities was Despard's wife, who caused considerable dismay. A woman of African descent, she had accompanied her husband from Central America to London in 1790. Active in prisoners' rights, she formed a link between her husband and the other revolutionaries with their colleagues and families outside the prison. She had worked for improvement of prison conditions, including the necessities of life: warmth, fresh air, food, space, writing materials, and access to friends and families. She was, essentially, a courier between the condemned and the outside world, and furthermore an intrepid correspondent. The prison wardens feared she was smuggling goods in and out of the prison, but feared to search her. It was she who had approached Lord Nelson to speak at the trial, and he made further applications to the government on behalf of Despard and his compatriots.\n\nThose executed were Despard, John Francis, John Wood, James Sedgewick, Thomas Broughton, Arthur Graham, and John Macnamara. They were executed in Old Horsemonger Lane Gaol in Southwark on Monday 21 February 1803.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11292873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11292873", "title": "Economic diplomacy", "text": "Economic diplomacy\n\nEconomic diplomacy is a form of diplomacy. Economic diplomacy is the use of the full spectrum economic tools of a state to achieve its national interests. The scope of economic diplomacy can encompass the all of the main international economic activities of a state including, but not limited to, policy decisions designed to influence exports, imports, investments, lending, aid, free trade agreements, etc.\n\nEconomic diplomacy is concerned with economic policy issues, e.g. work of delegations at standard setting organizations such as World Trade Organization (WTO). Economic diplomats also monitor and report on economic policies in foreign countries and give the home government advice on how to best influence them. Economic diplomacy employs economic resources, either as rewards or sanctions, in pursuit of a particular foreign policy objective. This is sometimes called \"economic statecraft\".\n\nEconomic diplomacy is traditionally defined as the decision-making, policy-making and advocating of the sending state-business interests. Economic diplomacy requires application of technical expertise that analyze the effects of a country's (receiving state) economic situation on its political climate and on the sending state's economic interests. The sending state and receiving state, foreign business leaders, as well as government decision-makers, work together on some of the most cutting-edge issues in foreign policy, such as technology, the environment, and HIV/AIDS, as well as in the more traditional areas of trade and finance. Versatility, flexibility, sound judgment and strong business skills are all needed in the execution of economic diplomacy.\n\n\n\nBerridge and James (2003) state that “economic diplomacy is concerned with economic policy questions, including the work of delegations to conferences sponsored by bodies such as the WTO” and include “diplomacy which employs economic resources, either as rewards or sanctions, in pursuit of a particular foreign policy objective” also as a part of the definition.\n\nRana (2007) defines economic diplomacy as “the process through which countries tackle the outside world, to maximize their national gain in all the fields of activity including trade, investment and other forms of economically beneficial exchanges, where they enjoy comparative advantage.; it has bilateral, regional and multilateral dimensions, each of which is important”.\n\nThe broad scope of this latter definition is especially applicable to the practice of economic diplomacy as it is unfolding in emerging economies. This new approach involves an analysis of a nation's economy, taking into account not only its officially reported figures but also its gray, or unreported, economic factors. An example might be the new Republic of Kosovo; in that emerging nation, widely regarded as a candidate for \"poorest nation in Europe\", an enormous amount of economic activity appears to be unreported or undocumented by a weak and generally ineffectual central government. When all economic factors are considered, the so-called \"poorest\" nations are demonstrably healthier and thus more attractive to investment than the raw statistics might otherwise show.\n\nEmerging economies have learned that they are not flowers and businesses are not like bees; in other words, a nation that wants to attract business must be proactive rather than passive. They must seek out opportunities and learn to bring them home. Tax and other concessions will likely be necessary and in the short term costly. However, creative support of new business opportunities can generate major chances for success. This sort of activity is also a part of economic diplomacy.\n\nThe sort of economic diplomacy that utilizes a nation's already-deployed corps of diplomats to promote the nation and seek business opportunities is not traditional, but its effectiveness is apparent. Emerging nations seeking to conserve scarce personnel and financial resources immediately benefit from multitasking. \n\n1. Commercial diplomacy and NGO's: The use of political influence and relationships to promote and/or influence international trade and investment, to improve on functioning of markets and/or to address market failures and to reduce costs and risks of cross border transactions(including property rights).\n\n2. Structural policies and bilateral trade and investment agreements: The use of economic assets and relationships to increase the cost of conflict and to strengthen the mutual benefits of cooperation and politically stable relationships, i.e. to increase economic security.\n\n3. International organizations: Ways to consolidate the right political climate and international political economic environment to facilitate and institute these objectives.\n\nBrazil has made a concerted effort to engage in economic diplomacy with the developing world. Brazil has made it a priority to be a leader in sharing technological knowledge in areas such as education and the all important agricultural sector.\n\nOne example of Brazil's economic diplomacy strategy is the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC), which is affiliated with the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations. The ABC has the mandate to negotiate, coordinate, implement and monitor technical cooperation projects and programs with countries, primarily in the developing world, that Brazil has agreements with. As Brazil States:\n\n\"Brazil has been investing in agreements with both developed and developing countries to acquire and disseminate knowledge applied to social and economic development. We have practiced the concept of not simply receiving knowledge from developed countries, but also sharing our own experiences with others in effective partnerships towards development.\n\nSouth-South cooperation contributes to consolidating Brazil’s relations with partner countries as it enhances general interchange; generates, disseminates and applies technical knowledge; builds human resource capacity; and, mainly, strengthens institutions in all nations involved.\n\nTaking these goals into account, ABC has defined focal partners that include African Portuguese-speaking countries (PALOPs), East Timor, Latin America and the Caribbean. In this context, we have started cooperating trilaterally with developed countries as well.\n\nThe ultimate goal of technical cooperation – exchanging experiences and knowledge – materializes reciprocal solidarity among peoples and does not only benefit recipient countries, but Brazil as well.\"\n\nThe ABC is a primary example of how Brazil is using economic diplomacy to fit into its larger national strategy of providing leadership in the developing world.\n\nEconomic diplomacy is a central aspect of Chinese foreign policy. During China's remarkable economic rise, it has used economic diplomacy primarily through trade, and the use of carrots as a means to accumulate or attract soft power. This was a part of the broader strategy formulated by think tanks in the PRC during the 1990s titled the new security concept. It is referred to in the West as the period of \"China's Peaceful Rise\".\n\nRecently, China has changed its strategic doctrine and begun to use economic diplomacy as a coercive tool. After 10 years or so of a policy based primarily on economic carrots, China has begun to show a willingness to use economic diplomacy for coercive means. This is evidenced in the September 2010 incident that blocked shipments of rare earth minerals to Japan. Another incident took place in 2012 in the Philippines, where China sent a gunboat in to enforce trade restricts. China's willingness to use bring in warships during trade disputes is reminiscent to an earlier era of American gunboat diplomacy.\n\nRecent history shows that as China grows more confident, we will see it gradually move away from an economic diplomacy policy of carrots, to sticks.\n\nKazakhstan has formally identified economic diplomacy as a key function of the country's foreign policy to yield productive economic and trade relations at bilateral and multilateral levels. Kazakhstan hosted a South-South Development Exchange on Economic Diversification and Industrialization in Africa with 43 African governments. \n\nThe United States has a long history of economic diplomacy dating back to the dollar diplomacy of William Howard Taft. The United States was also central to perhaps the most important economic diplomacy event, the Bretton Woods Conference where the International Monetary Fund and International Bank of Reconstruction and Development were created. The United States was involved in one of the more notable acts of economic diplomacy in history with the Marshall Plan.\n\nThough it has always played an important role, Economic diplomacy took on increased importance during the first term of President Barack Obama under the leadership of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nDuring a major policy speech as Secretary of State, Clinton stated that economic statecraft is at the heart of (the American) foreign policy agenda.\n\nSecretary of State Clinton saw economic development and democratic development as inextricably linked. In her speech she explained the importance of its success: \"we happen to believe that our model is not only the best for us; we think it embodies universal principles, human aspirations, and proven results that make it the best model for any country or people. Now, there can be variations on how it’s implemented, but we are in this competition to win it. We want to make clear that it’s not only good for America but it’s good for the rest of the world to pursue democratic and economic reform.”\n\nClinton laid out the stakes as such: \"If people don’t believe that democracy and free markets deliver, then they’re going to be looking elsewhere for models that more readily respond to their daily needs.\"\n\nSecretary Clinton saw pursuing mutually beneficial trade between the United States and other areas of the world as central to the American diplomatic agenda. She went on to detail the American strategy for several significant regions.\n\nOn Russia: \"Even in a U.S.-Russia relationship dominated for decades by politics and security, we are now focused on helping Russia join the World Trade Organization, and we are putting a special premium on protecting freedom of navigation and a rules-based approach to resource development in places like the South China Sea and the Arctic Ocean.\"\n\nOn Europe: \"Together, America and Europe account for half of the world’s economic output, but just one-third of global trade. We can and we should be trading more. At the Transatlantic Economic Council, too often we re-litigate regulatory differences when we ought to be resolving them and avoiding new ones. And this frustrates companies on both sides of the Atlantic. The Transatlantic Economic Council is the forum where we try to resolve these differences, and I believe harmonizing regulatory schemes between the United States and the EU is one of the best ways we can both enhance growth, enhance exports, and avoid duplicative costs. But if you spend weeks arguing about the size of a jar for baby food, that’s not exactly facing up to the potential of the payoff that comes from resolving these issues.\"\n\nOn China: \"We also need to promote the free flow of capital, too. Investment in both directions, backed by well-enforced rules, is vital to creating growth and jobs here at home. For example, last year, the Kentucky-based company that owns KFC and Pizza Hut, two iconic American brands, actually made more money selling pizza and fried chicken in China than in the United States. But this creates jobs at headquarters in Louisville and it creates jobs as well in China. When Tom Friedman warns that the Chinese will “eat our lunch,” I’m not sure that’s what he had in mind.\"\n\nOn the Middle East: \"Consider the transitions underway in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya. If we want to see democracy take root, which we do, we have to bring advanced tools to bear to help countries reform economic systems designed to keep autocrats and elites in power. And we know that aid alone, no matter how generous, is not enough. We need a sophisticated effort to integrate the region’s economies, to promote investment, and to assist in economic modernization. This is the logic behind the Middle East proposals that the President laid out in May, which I have been urging Congress to support. To succeed, the Arab political awakening must also be an economic awakening.\"\n\nOn Latin America: \"we are also making it a priority to engage with the Latin American jaguars, if you can call them that, which grew by more than six percent last year. Our free trade agreements with Panama and Colombia move us closer to our ultimate goal of a hemispheric trade partnership reaching from the Arctic to the tip of Argentina.\"\n\nOn the Pacific Basin: \"...we will continue to use the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, which President Obama will host next month in Hawaii, to push the envelope on open, free, transparent, and fair trade across the Pacific basin.\"\n\nIndia has engaged in economic diplomacy primarily through the use of trade and aid. For example, in order to build a stronger, more stable relationship with Bangladesh, India granted it an $800 million soft loan, and provided $200 million in aid.\n\nIndia set up a development wing in its government in January 2012. The Development Partners Administration (DPA), is a primary way India uses economic diplomacy, in this case development aid, as a way to engage diplomatically. The DPA is building 50,000 housing units in Sri Lanka, a large transmission line in Puli Khumri, Afghanistan, and extends Lines of Credit projects globally, particularly in Africa.\n\nEconomic diplomacy and the DPA are very important to Indian foreign policy. As the former Indian Foreign Secretary Lalit Mansingh stated: \"The fact that the DPA division is located in the ministry of external affairs shows it is in sync with our foreign policy objectives of transforming India into a global player”.\n\nAfter the widely reported incident near the Senkaku Islands in 2010, over which Japan, China and Taiwan all claim sovereignty, China engaged in coercive economic diplomacy. In response to the dispute, China allegedly blocked all shipments of rare earth minerals to Japan, harming their economy. Whether this embargo indeed took place is unclear, as Japan saw no decrease in rare earths imports during that time.\n\nIn response to the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize going to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo from the Norwegian Nobel Committee, China froze free trade agreement negotiations with Norway and imposed new veterinary inspections on imports of Norwegian salmon. This caused the volume of salmon imports from Norway shrunk 60 percent in 2011.\n\nRecently, China has become more assertive in its claim that the South China Sea is part of its territory. This has caused several disputes with the\nseven sovereign states who also claim part of the South China Sea as their own territory. In one such dispute, China and the Philippines engaged in a standoff over the Scarborough Shoal in which Navy vessels were sent in. In retaliation to this territorial conflict, China engaged in coercive economic diplomacy by blocking Philippine bananas from entering Chinese ports, as well as slowing down the inspections of apayas, mangoes, coconuts, and pineapples from the Philippines. Philippine businessmen pressured their government to stand down. According to Manila, Chinese Vessels now block the entrance to the lagoon, preventing any Philippine ships from entering, in another example of China using coercive economic diplomacy.\n\n"}
{"id": "14668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14668", "title": "Economy of Iraq", "text": "Economy of Iraq\n\nIraq's economy is dominated by the oil\nsector, which has provided about 99.7% of foreign exchange earnings in modern times. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures, borrow heavily, and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq suffered economic losses of at least $80 billion from the war. After the end of hostilities, in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.\n\nSince mid-2009, oil export earnings have returned to levels seen before and government revenues have rebounded, along with global oil prices. In 2011 Baghdad probably will increase oil exports above the current level of per day as a result of new contracts with international oil companies, but is likely to fall short of the per day it is forecasting in its budget. Iraq's recent contracts with major oil companies have the potential to greatly expand oil revenues, but Iraq will need to upgrade its oil processing, pipeline, and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach their potential.\n\nAn improved security environment and an initial wave of foreign investment are helping to spur economic activity, particularly in the energy, construction, and retail sectors. Broader economic improvement, long-term fiscal health, and sustained increases in the standard of living still depend on the government passing major policy reforms and on continued development of Iraq's massive oil reserves. Although foreign investors viewed Iraq with increasing interest in 2010, most are still hampered by difficulties in acquiring land for projects and by other regulatory impediments.\n\nInflation has decreased consistently since 2006 as the security situation has improved. However, Iraqi leaders remain hard pressed to translate macroeconomic gains into improved lives for ordinary Iraqis. Unemployment remains a problem throughout the country.\n\nNominal GDP grew by 213% in the 1960s, 1325% in the 1970s, 2% in the 1980s, -47% in the 1990s, and 317% in 2000s.\n\nReal GDP per capita (measured in 1990 $) increased significantly during the 1950s, 60s and 70s, which can be explained by both higher oil production levels as well as oil prices, which famously peaked in the 1970s due to the OPEC's oil embargo, causing the 1973 oil crisis. In following two decades however, GDP per capita in Iraq dropped substantially because of multiple wars, namely the 1980-88 war with Iran, the 1990-1991 Gulf War.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the war with Iran in September 1980, Iraq's economic prospects were bright. Oil production had reached a level of 560,000 m³ (3.5 million barrels) per day in 1979, and oil revenues were 21 billion dollars in 1979 and 27 billion in 1980 due to record oil prices. At the outbreak of the war, Iraq had amassed an estimated 35 billion in foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe Iran–Iraq War and the 1980s oil glut depleted Iraq's foreign exchange reserves, devastated its economy, and left the country saddled with a foreign debt of more than $40 billion. After the initial destruction of the war, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and the restoration of damaged facilities.\n\nIraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international economic sanctions on Iraq, and damage from military action by an international coalition beginning in January 1991, drastically reduced economic activity. The regime exacerbated shortages by supporting large military and internal security forces and by allocating resources to key supporters of the Ba'ath Party. The implementation of the UN's Oil for Food program in December 1996 helped improve economic conditions. For the first six six-month phases of the program, Iraq was allowed to export increasing amounts of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods. In December 1999, the UN Security Council authorized Iraq to export as much oil as required to meet humanitarian needs. Per capita food imports increased substantially, while medical supplies and health care services steadily improved, though per capita economic production and living standards were still well below their prewar level.\n\nIraq changed its oil reserve currency from the U.S. dollar to the euro in 2000. However, 28% of Iraq's export revenues under the program were deducted to meet UN Compensation Fund and UN administrative expenses. The drop in GDP in 2001 was largely the result of the global economic slowdown and lower oil prices.\n\nThe removal of sanctions on 24 May 2003 and rising oil prices in the mid-to-late 2000s led to a doubling in oil production from a low of 1.3 mbpd during the turbulence of 2003 to a high of 2.6 mbpd in 2011. Furthermore, reduced inflation and violence since 2007 have translated to real increases in living standards for Iraqis.\n\nOne of the key economic challenges was Iraq's immense foreign debt, estimated at $125 billion. Although some of this debt was derived from normal export contracts that Iraq had failed to pay for, some was a result of military and financial support during Iraq's war with Iran.\n\nThe Jubilee Iraq campaign argued that much of these debts were odious (illegitimate). However, as the concept of odious debt is not accepted, trying to deal with the debt on those terms would have embroiled Iraq in legal disputes for years. Iraq decided to deal with its debt more pragmatically and approached the Paris Club of official creditors.\n\nIn a December 2006 \"Newsweek International\" article, a study by Global Insight in London was reported to show \"that Civil war or not, Iraq has an economy, and—mother of all surprises—it's doing remarkably well. Real estate is booming. Construction, retail and wholesale trade sectors are healthy, too, according to [the report]. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports 34,000 registered companies in Iraq, up from 8,000 three years ago. Sales of secondhand cars, televisions and mobile phones have all risen sharply. Estimates vary, but one from Global Insight puts GDP growth at 17 percent last year and projects 13 percent for 2006. The World Bank has it lower: at 4 percent this year. But, given all the attention paid to deteriorating security, the startling fact is that Iraq is growing at all.\"\n\nTraditionally, most of Iraq's manufacturing activity has been closely connected to the oil industry. The major industries in that category have been petroleum refining and the manufacture of chemicals and fertilizers. Before 2003, diversification was hindered by limitations on privatization and the effects of the international sanctions of the 1990s. Since 2003, security problems have blocked efforts to establish new enterprises. The construction industry is an exception; in 2000 cement was the only major industrial product not based on hydrocarbons. The construction industry has profited from the need to rebuild after Iraq's several wars. In the 1990s, the industry benefited from government funding of extensive infrastructure and housing projects and elaborate palace complexes.\n\nHistorically, 50 to 60 percent of Iraq's arable land has been under cultivation. Because of ethnic politics, valuable farmland in Kurdish territory has not contributed to the national economy, and inconsistent agricultural policies under Saddam Hussein discouraged domestic market production. Despite its abundant land and water resources, Iraq is a net food importer. Under the UN Oil for Food program, Iraq imported large quantities of grains, meat, poultry, and dairy products. The government abolished its farm collectivization program in 1981, allowing a greater role for private enterprise in agriculture.\n\nIraqi agriculture suffered substantial physical disruption from the Gulf War, and economic disruption from sanctions imposed by the United Nations (August 1990). Sanctions curtailed imports by cutting off Iraq's petroleum exports, and embargoing those agricultural production inputs deemed to have potential military applications. The Iraqi government responded by monopolizing grain and oilseed marketing, imposing production quotas, and instituting a Public Distribution System for basic foodstuffs. By mid-1991 the government supplied a “basket” of foodstuffs that provided about one-third of the caloric daily requirement, and cost consumers about five percent of its market value. With subsidies for agricultural inputs diminished, the prices that the government paid to farmers failed to cover their costs. The implicit tax on agricultural production was estimated to reach 20 to 35 percent by the mid-1990s. In October 1991 the Baghdad regime had withdrawn personnel from the northern region controlled by two Kurdish parties. Iraqi Kurdistan was described as \"... a market economy essentially left alone by a very weak governing structure, but heavily influenced by substantial international humanitarian aid flows.\"\n\nUnder an “Oil for Food Program” negotiated with the United Nations, in December 1996 Iraq started exporting petroleum, and used the proceeds to start importing foodstuffs three months later. Grain imports averaged $828 million in the years 1997-2001, an increase of over 180 percent from the previous five-year period. Due to foreign competition, Iraqi production declined (29 percent for wheat, 31 percent for barley, and 52 percent for maize). Because the government had generally neglected the production of forage crops, fruits, vegetables, and livestock other than poultry, those sectors had remained more traditional and market-based, and less buffeted by international affairs. Nevertheless, severe drought, an outbreak of screwworm, and an epizootic of foot-and-mouth disease devastated production during this period. As the Oil for Food Program expanded to cover more agricultural inputs and machinery, the productivity of Iraqi agriculture stabilized around 2002.\n\nFollowing the invasion led by the United States in March 2003, with incomes of many Iraqis devastated, the market for foodstuffs shrunk. Seeking to re-orient Iraq's economy toward private ownership and international competitiveness, the United States had seen the dismantling of the Public Distribution System as essential for a market-driven agriculture. Because of the great reliance of most Iraqis on government-subsidized food, this goal was never realized. Increased productivity became the focus of much of the U.S.-funded agricultural reconstruction program. Many of these projects were undertaken by the Agricultural Reconstruction and Development Iraq (ARDI) program run by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) of Bethesda, Maryland, under a contract with USAID signed on October 15, 2003. While ARDI participated in limited ways, the restoration of Iraq's irrigation systems was mostly funded under USAID's contract with Bechtel International.\n\nARDI conducted demonstration trials of improved practices and varieties of many crops: winter cereals (wheat and barley), summer cereals (rice, maize, and sorghum), potatoes, and tomatoes. Feed supplements and veterinary treatments were demonstrated to increase ovulation, conception, and birth weights of livestock. Surveys were conducted of poultry growers and apple farmers. Nurseries were established for date palms and grapes. College buildings and farm tractors were rebuilt. ARDI had projects promoting trade associations and producers’ co-ops, but also supported extension as an appropriate governmental function. The contract eventually cost over $100 million and lasted through December 2006. Under its Community Action Program, USAID also funded an analysis of markets for sheep and wool. It awarded a contract to the University of Hawaii to revitalize higher education in agriculture. It awarded a contract for $120 million to the Louis Berger Group to promote Iraq's private sector, including agriculture.\n\nStarting in 2006, agricultural reconstruction was also conducted by Provincial Reconstruction Teams within the occupying military forces. Intended to promote goodwill and sap the insurgency, “PRTs” allowed military commanders to identify local needs and, with few bureaucratic hurdles, to dispense up to $500,000. Civilians from many agencies within the U. S. Department of Agriculture, as well as USAID, served tours on PRTs. Some participants criticized the absence of a national agricultural strategy, or clear direction on the design of projects. Others complained that projects emphasized \"American-style, 21st-century agricultural technologies and methodologies...\" that were inappropriate for Iraq.\n\nAgricultural production has not rebounded noticeably from the reconstruction program. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), between 2002 and 2013, production of wheat increased 11 percent and milled rice 8 percent, but barley had decreased 13 percent and maize 40 percent. Scaled in “international dollars” (2004-2006 base equaling 100) Iraq's per capita food production was 135 in 2002, 96 in 2007, and 94 in 2012. The agricultural sector shed workers. In those same years, production per worker was 117, 106, and 130, respectively.\n\nThe international Oil-for-Food program (1997–2003) further reduced farm production by supplying artificially priced foreign foodstuffs. The military action of 2003 did little damage to Iraqi agriculture; because of favorable weather conditions, in that year grain production was 22 percent higher than in 2002. Although growth continued in 2004, experts predicted that Iraq will be an importer of agricultural products for the foreseeable future. Long-term plans call for investment in agricultural machinery and materials and more prolific crop varieties—improvements that did not reach Iraq's farmers under the Hussein regime. In 2004 the main agricultural crops were wheat, barley, corn, rice, vegetables, dates, and cotton, and the main livestock outputs were cattle and sheep.\n\nThe Agricultural Cooperative Bank, capitalized at nearly 1 G$ - by 1984, targets its low-interest, low-collateral loans to private farmers for mechanization, poultry projects, and orchard development. Large modern cattle, dairy, and poultry farms are under construction. Obstacles to agricultural development include labour shortages, inadequate management and maintenance, salinization, urban migration, and dislocations resulting from previous land reform and collectivization programs.\n\nIn 2011, an agricultural adviser to the Iraqi government, Layth Mahdi, summarized the forced United States agricultural reconstruction:Prior to 2003, Iraq had imported about 30 percent of its food needs annually. The decline in agricultural production after this period, created the need for importing 90 percent of the food at a cost estimated at more than $12 billion annually. Due to the sudden shift in the agricultural policy from subsidized assistance to an immediate shift to a free market policy, the outcomes led to a decline in production. The observed outcome resulted in many farmers abandoning the land and agriculture. The impact on natural resources results in an exploited and degraded environment leaving the land destitute and the people impoverished, unemployed [and] experiencing a sense of losing their human dignity.Importation of foreign workers and increased entry of women into traditionally male labour roles have helped compensate for agricultural and industrial labour shortages exacerbated by the war. A disastrous attempt to drain the southern marshes and introduce irrigated farming to this region merely destroyed a natural food producing area, while concentration of salts and minerals in the soil due to the draining left the land unsuitable for agriculture.\n\nIn the Mada’in Qada region east of Baghdad, hundreds of small farmers united to form the Green Mada’in Association for Agricultural Development, an agricultural cooperative that provides its members with drip irrigation and greenhouses as well as access to credit.\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, human exploration, shifting agriculture, forest fires, and uncontrolled grazing denuded large areas of Iraq's natural forests, which in 2005 were almost exclusively confined to the northeastern highlands. Most of the trees found in that region are not suitable for lumbering. In 2002 a total of 112,000 cubic meters of wood were harvested, nearly half of which was used as fuel.\n\nDespite its many rivers, Iraq's fishing industry has remained relatively small and based largely on marine species in the Persian Gulf. In 2001 the catch was 22,800 tons.\n\nAside from hydrocarbons, Iraq's mining industry has been confined to extraction of relatively small amounts of phosphates (at Akashat), salt, and sulfur (near Mosul). Since a productive period in the 1970s, the mining industry has been hampered by the Iran–Iraq War (1980–88), the sanctions of the 1990s, and the economic collapse of 2003.\n\nIraq is one of the most oil-rich countries in the world, holding the fifth largest proven crude oil reserves. Most of this oil—4 million barrels per day out of 4.3 million barrels produced daily—is exported, making Iraq the third-largest exporter of oil. Despite its ongoing civil war, Iraq was able to increase oil production during 2015 and 2016, with production dipping by 3.5 percent in 2017 due to conflict with the Kurdistan Regional Government and OPEC production limits. By world standards, production costs for Iraqi oil are relatively low. However, four wars—the 1980–1988 Iraq-Iran War, 1991 Gulf War, the 2003-2011 War in Iraq, and the civil war—and the 1991–2003 UN sanctions have left the industry's infrastructure in poor condition, and the de facto independence of oil-rich Iraqi Kurdistan have limited production.\n\nIn the 1970s, Iraq produced over 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. Production began to fall during the Iran-Iraq War, before plummeting 85 percent after the 1991 invasion of Kuwait. UN sanctions prevented the export of oil until 1996, and then allowed exports only in exchange for humanitarian aid in the Oil-for-Food Programme.\n\nThe 2003 lifting of sanctions enabled production—and exports—to restart. Production has since recovered to pre-Gulf War levels, and most of Iraq's oil infrastructure has been repaired, in spite of persistent sabotage by the Islamic State (ISIL) and others. In 2004 Iraq had eight oil refineries, the largest of which were at Baiji, Basra, and Daura.\n\nDespite its oil wealth, sabotage and technical problems at refineries have forced Iraq to import petroleum, other refined oil products, and electricity from neighboring countries, especially Iran. In 2004, for example, Iraq spent $60 million per month for imported gasoline. Sabotage\nIn late 2004 and early 2005, regular sabotage of plants and pipelines reduced export and domestic distribution of oil, particularly to Baghdad. Nationwide fuel shortages and power outages resulted. Persistent ISIL sabotage of pipelines, power plants and power lines, and theft of oil and electricity have also contributed to the July 2018 protests in southern Iraq.\n\nIn 2004 plans called for increased domestic utilization of natural gas to replace oil and for use in the petrochemical industry. However, because most of Iraq's gas output is associated with oil, output growth depends on developments in the oil industry.\n\nHalf of Iraq's power plants were destroyed in the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and full recovery never occurred. In mid-2004, Iraq had an estimated 5,000 megawatts of power-generating capacity, compared with 7,500 megawatts of demand. At that time, the transmission system included 17,700 kilometers of line. In 2004 plans called for construction of two new power plants and restoration of existing plants and transmission lines to ease the blackouts and economic hardship caused by this shortfall, but sabotage and looting kept capacity below 6,000 megawatts. The ongoing civil war, sabotage of transmission lines, and government corruption caused the electricity shortage to worsen: by 2010 demand outstripped supply by 6000 megawatts.\n\nOil continues to dominate Iraq's economy. , oil is responsible for over 65 percent of GDP, 90 percent of government revenue, and almost 100 percent of exports. The central government hopes to diversify the economy away from oil, and has had some success: non-oil GDP growth, which was below the regional average from 2014-2016, pushed above the average in 2017. Despite this, the percent of government spending going to non-oil investment has continued to decline since 2013 and now stands at only 34 percent.\n\nBetween June 2009 and February 2010 the Iraqi Oil Ministry tendered for the award of Service Contracts to develop Iraq's existing oil fields. The results of the tender, which were broadcast live on Iraqi television, are as follows for all major fields awarded but excluding the Kurdish controlled areas where Production Sharing Contracts have been awarded that are currently being disputed by the Baghdad government. All contracts are awaiting final ratification of the awards by the Iraqi government. Company shares are subject to change as a result of commercial negotiations between parties.\n\n\"Notes:\"\n\" 1. Field shares are as a % of the total. The Iraq state retains a 25% share in all fields for which Service Contracts have been awarded.\"\n\" 2. Production Increase Share is the millions bbls per day that will attract the Service Fee for the company.\"\n\" 3. Gross revenue at plateau is the total payment each company will receive upon reaching their declared target plateau production rate (in between 5 and 8 years depending on field), before deduction of any operating costs but in addition to recovery of all development costs as billions of US$ per annum. The total gross revenue for all companies, after recovery of capital costs, is at plateau production of an additional 9.4 mb/d, 4.34 bn US per annum at a $70 bbl oil price. The 2010 Iraq govt budget is $60 billion. $300 billion is approximately $10,000 per annum for each Iraqi citizen.\"\n\nIn summary the shares by region in the increased production are:\n\nIraq's financial services have been the subject of post-Hussein reforms. The 17 private banks established during the 1990s were limited to domestic transactions and attracted few private depositors. Those banks and two main state banks were badly damaged by the international embargo of the 1990s. To further privatize and expand the system, in 2003 the Coalition Provisional Authority removed restrictions on international bank transactions and freed the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) from government control. In its first year of independent operation, the CBI received credit for limiting Iraq's inflation. In 2004 three foreign banks received licenses to do business in Iraq.\n\nBecause of the danger posed by Iraq's ongoing insurgency, the security industry has been a uniquely prosperous part of the services sector. Often run by former U.S. military personnel, in 2005 at least 26 companies offered personal and institutional protection, surveillance, and other forms of security.\n\nIn the early post-Hussein period, a freewheeling retail trade in all types of commodities straddled the line between legitimate and illegitimate commerce, taking advantage of the lack of income tax and import controls.\n\nThe Iraq tourism industry, which in peaceful times has profited from Iraq's many places of cultural interest (earning US$14 million in 2001), has been dormant since 2003. Despite conditions, in 2005 the Iraqi Tourism Board maintained a staff of 2,500 and 14 regional offices. Between 2009 and 2010, 165 tourists from 16 different countries entered Iraq to visit historic sites; as of January 2011, a U.S. State Department grant provided $2 million to help preserve Babylon, supporting the re-opening of one of the site's two museums.\n\nDuring 2003-8, mobile phone subscriptions had expanded over hundredfold to 10 million nationwide, according to the Brookings Institution.\n\nIn 2002 Iraq's labor force was estimated at 6.8 million people.\n\nIn 1996 some 66.4 percent of the labor force worked in services, 17.5 percent in industry, and 16.1 percent in agriculture. 2004 estimates of Iraq's unemployment ranged from 30 percent to 60 percent.\n\nThe CPA has referred to a 25% unemployment rate, the Iraqi Ministry of Planning mentioned a 30% unemployment rate, whereas the Iraqi Ministry of Social Affairs claims it to be 48%. Other sources are claiming a 20% unemployment rate and a probably 60% under-employment rate. The actual figure is problematic because of high participation in black-market activities and poor security conditions in many populous areas. In central Iraq, security concerns discouraged the hiring of new workers and the resumption of regular work schedules. At the same time, the return of Iraqis from other countries increased the number of job seekers. In late 2004, most legitimate jobs were in the government, the army, the oil industry, and security-related enterprises. Under Saddam Hussein Hussein, many of the highest-paid workers were employed by the greatly overstaffed government, whose overthrow disrupted the input of these people to the economy. In 2004 the U.S. Agency for International Development committed US$1 billion for a worker-training program. In early 2004, the minimum wage was US$72 per month.\n\nIraq is a founding member of OPEC. Petroleum constitutes 99,7% of Iraq's exports with a value of $43,8 billion in 2016.\n\nFrom the 1990s until 2003, the international trade embargo restricted Iraq's export activity almost exclusively to oil. In 2003 oil accounted for about US$7.4 billion of Iraq's total US$7.6 billion of export value, and statistics for earlier years showed similar proportions. After the end of the trade embargo in 2003 expanded the range of exports, oil continued to occupy the dominant position: in 2004 Iraq's export income doubled (to US$16.5 billion), but oil accounted for all but US$340 million (2 percent) of the total. In late 2004, sabotage significantly reduced oil output, and experts forecast that output, hence exports, would be below capacity in 2005 as well. In 2004 the chief export markets were the United States (which accounted for nearly half), Italy, France, Jordan, Canada, and the Netherlands. In 2004 the value of Iraq's imports was US$21.7 billion, incurring a trade deficit of about US$5.2 billion. In 2003 the main sources of Iraq's imports were Turkey, Jordan, Vietnam, the United States, Germany, and Britain. Because of Iraq's inactive manufacturing sector, the range of imports was quite large, including food, fuels, medicines, and manufactured goods. By 2010, exports rose to US$50.8 billion and imports rose to US$45.2 billion. Chief 2009 export partners were: U.S., India, Italy, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Netherlands, and Japan. Chief 2009 import partners were: Turkey, Syria, U.S., China, Jordan, Italy, and Germany.\n\n"}
{"id": "9344058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9344058", "title": "Falls Curfew", "text": "Falls Curfew\n\nThe Falls Curfew, also called the Battle of the Falls (or Lower Falls), was a British Army operation during 3–5 July 1970 in the Falls district of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The operation began as a search for weapons in the staunchly Irish nationalist district. As the search ended, local youths attacked the British soldiers with stones and petrol bombs and the soldiers responded with CS gas. This quickly developed into gun battles between British soldiers and the Irish Republican Army (IRA). After four hours of continuous clashes, the British commander sealed off the area, which comprised 3,000 homes, and imposed a curfew which would last for 36 hours. Thousands of British troops moved into the curfew zone and carried out house-to-house searches for weapons, while coming under intermittent attack from the IRA and rioters. The searches caused much destruction, and a large amount of CS gas was fired into the area. Many residents complained of suffering abuse at the hands of the soldiers. On 5 July, the curfew was brought to an end when thousands of women and children from Andersonstown marched into the curfew zone with food and groceries for the locals.\n\nDuring the operation, four civilians were killed by the British Army, at least 78 people were wounded and 337 were arrested. Eighteen soldiers were also wounded. Large quantities of weapons and ammunition were captured. The British Army admitted afterwards that some of its soldiers had been involved in looting. The Falls Curfew was a turning point in the Troubles. It is seen as having turned many Catholics/Irish nationalists against the British Army and having boosted support for the IRA.\n\nThe Northern Ireland riots of August 1969 marked the beginning of the Troubles. In Belfast, Catholic Irish nationalists clashed with Protestant Ulster loyalists and the mainly-Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Northern Ireland’s police force. Hundreds of Catholic homes and businesses were burnt out and more than 1,000 families, mostly Catholics, were forced to flee. The rioting ended with Operation Banner, the deployment of British troops. In December 1969, the IRA split into the 'Official' IRA and 'Provisional' IRA, with the 'Provisionals' promising to defend Catholic areas.\n\nA week before the Falls Curfew, on Saturday 27 June 1970, there was severe rioting in Belfast following marches by the Protestant/unionist Orange Order. At the Short Strand, a Catholic enclave in a Protestant part of the city, the Provisional IRA fought a five-hour gun battle with loyalists (see Battle of St Matthew's). Three people were killed and the loyalists withdrew. The Provisional IRA presented itself as having successfully defended a vulnerable Catholic enclave from armed loyalist mobs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Official IRA arranged for a large number of weapons to be brought into the mainly nationalist and Catholic Lower Falls area for distribution. The area was a stronghold of the Official IRA.\n\nAt about 4:30pm on Friday 3 July, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British soldiers from the Royal Scots regiment entered the Lower Falls to carry out a weapons search. An informer had told them they would find an arms dump belonging to the Official IRA in a house on Balkan Street. A column of five or six armoured vehicles arrived at the house and sealed off the street. The search lasted about 45 minutes and uncovered 15 pistols, a rifle, a sub-machine gun and a large quantity of ammunition.\n\nAs the search ended and the troops began to leave, a crowd of youths on Raglan Street tried to block their path and pelted them with stones. The troops replied by launching CS gas at the crowd. The youths continued to throw stones and the soldiers responded with more CS gas. According to a local republican: \"it being the week after Short Strand... they were angry that the Army was going to disarm their only means of defence\".\n\nThe stone-throwing escalated into a riot. The soldiers became surrounded and called for reinforcements. Over the following hours, the Royal Scots would be reinforced by troops from the Black Watch, the Life Guards, the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, the Gloucestershire Regiment and the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment.\n\nAs troops began to arrive at the edge of the district, locals hastily barricaded a number of streets to keep the soldiers out. Buses were hijacked and made into burning barricades.\n\nJim Sullivan, the local Official IRA commander, feared that the troops would launch a bigger raid and instructed his men to move weapons out of the area. At about 6pm, Provisional IRA volunteers attacked the troops with improvised hand grenades. A number of soldiers suffered leg injuries. As more troops arrived, \"the Officials realized that they would have to fight\" and Sullivan ordered his men to confront the troops. An Official IRA source later said, \"The way we looked at it, we were not going to put up our hands and let them take the weaponry. We didn't want the confrontation, but we couldn't surrender\". One source said that 60–70 Official IRA volunteers were involved, while another said 80–90. Each was armed with a rifle and at least one revolver. They exchanged fire with the troops and attacked them with grenades. Hundreds of local youths also pelted the troops with stones and petrol bombs. Journalist Simon Winchester later wrote:To anyone who experienced the battle, it was perfectly obvious that hundreds and hundreds of bullets were being fired by both sides – and yet the Army had the gall, when asked by reporters later in the weekend, to say that its soldiers fired only 15 shots in sum. The official figures were to be published later: soldiers in the Falls that weekend fired no less than 1,457 rounds.\n\nThe British Army also continued firing CS gas. Local politicians and priests who were on the streets \"complained that every time they got a bad situation cooled down more gas had been plunged in\". Slingshots were used to launch heavy CS gas canisters into the area and some went through the roofs of houses. According to the Central Citizens' Defence Committee, even streets where there had been no disorder \"received salvo after salvo\". The soldiers fired 1,600 canisters and cartridges of CS gas during the operation, which was considered to be excessive in such a small area. Some householders set buckets filled with a mixture of water and vinegar outside their front doors \"so that those involved in clashes could wet rags to protect them against the stinging gas\". Journalist Peter Taylor described the effect of the CS gas on the densely populated area:The clouds of choking and suffocating gas drifted up the narrow alleyways and back streets of the warren that is the Lower Falls. The gas got everywhere, in through windows, under doors and into the residents' eyes, noses, throats and lungs. A soldier later interviewed by Taylor recalled: \"The place was still saturated with CS gas. Children were coughing, I remember. I'm talking now about the toddlers, kids of three, four, five. It affected everyone but children especially\". There were allegations that some soldiers fired CS gas canisters through the windows of houses while residents were still inside. Hundreds of women and children, along with the sick and elderly, began to leave the area.\n\nAt 10pm on Friday 3 July, four hours after the violence began, Freeland ordered that the area be put under an indefinite curfew and that anyone on the streets be arrested. British soldiers announced the curfew through loudspeakers on the ground and from helicopters flying low over the streets. The boundaries of the official curfew zone were the Falls Road in the west and north, Albert Street and Cullingtree Road in the east, and Grosvenor Road in the south. However, during the curfew the zone was extended in the southwest as far as Dunmore Street. There were about 3,000 homes inside the curfew zone. After the curfew was announced, up to 3,000 soldiers began moving into the curfew zone supported by armoured vehicles and helicopters. They also began sealing off the curfew zone with barbed wire.\n\nShooting and rioting continued for a number of hours after the curfew began. Minutes after the curfew was announced, three soldiers were shot and wounded by Official IRA volunteers in Omar Street. Troops also reported coming under \"heavy and extremely accurate sniper fire\" in Plevna Street. Billy McKee, commander of the Provisional IRA's Belfast Brigade, telephoned Jim Sullivan and offered help, but Sullivan rejected the offer. The small Provisional IRA unit in the area decided to engage the troops nevertheless. It consisted of up to 11 volunteers commanded by Charles 'Charlie' Hughes. They fought a gun battle with troops in Cyprus Street before withdrawing. According to Brendan Hughes, the unit ran out of ammunition. Martin Dillon wrote that by withdrawing, they \"avoided losing what few weapons they had in a confrontation which could only end in disaster\". Outside the curfew zone, Springfield Road Army/RUC base came under sustained attack from missile-throwing crowds. Soldiers pushed them back with CS gas and baton charges, but IRA snipers moved in and kept the base under intermittent fire. The last shots were fired at dawn on Saturday 4 July.\n\nInside the curfew zone, the British Army began a house-to-house search for weapons and demolished barricades and made arrests. At least 1,000 houses were searched. Any journalists who remained inside the curfew zone were arrested by the British Army. It is claimed that because the media was unable to watch their activities, the soldiers behaved \"with reckless abandon\". British Army log sheets reveal that the troops were ordered to \"be aggressive\". Hundreds of houses were forcibly searched and there were scores of complaints of soldiers hitting, threatening, insulting and humiliating residents. Pubs and businesses were also searched and it is claimed that several of them were looted by the soldiers. According to Mallie and Bishop's account: \"The soldiers behaved with a new harshness... axeing down doors, ripping up floorboards, disembowelling chairs, sofas, beds, and smashing the garish plaster statues of the Madonna... which adorned the tiny front parlours\".\n\nAt a Northern Ireland Cabinet meeting on 7 July, it was said that \"little structural damage had been reported, apart from the pulling up of floorboards\". The ministers concluded that there was a \"smear campaign\" being mounted against the British Army. The British Minister of State for defence, Lord Balniel, defended the actions of the soldiers: \"I am deeply impressed by the impartial way they are carrying out an extremely difficult task\".\n\nAt 5pm on Saturday, the Army announced by loudspeaker that people could leave their homes for two hours to get vital supplies. However, nobody was allowed to leave or enter the curfew zone. During this time, the local Member of Parliament, Paddy Devlin, was arrested by the British Army while out talking to his constituents. He claimed that the soldiers responsible threatened to shoot him.\n\nAlthough the area remained sealed off, by midday on Sunday 5 July there was a perception among locals that the operation had been abandoned. According to Hanley and Millar, \"the British knew that most of the 'more attractive' armaments had been spirited away 'before the cordon was fully effective'\". The curfew was broken on Sunday, when 3,000 women and children from the nationalist Andersonstown area marched to the British lines with food and other groceries for the people there. The unprepared soldiers tried to hold back the crowd at first, but eventually allowed it to pass through.\n\nBy the time the search was over, the troops had captured about 100 firearms, 100 home-made grenades, 250 pounds of explosives and 21,000 rounds of ammunition. Among the firearms were 52 pistols, 35 rifles, 6 machine guns and 14 shotguns. Almost all of this material belonged to the Official IRA.\n\nIt was later reported that while the lower Falls was under curfew and the streets emptied of people, the British Army had driven two Ulster Unionist Party government ministers, John Brooke and William Long, through the area in armoured vehicles. This enraged nationalists, who perceived the gesture as a symbol of unionist triumphalism over an area subdued by British military force.\n\nThe British Army killed four civilians during the operation:\n\n\nAnother 60 civilians suffered gunshot wounds. Eighteen soldiers were also wounded; twelve by gunshots and six by grenades. A total of 337 people, including Official IRA leader Billy McMillen, were also arrested.\n\nThe Falls Curfew was a turning point in the relationship between the British Army and the Irish nationalist/Catholic community. Historian Richard English wrote that it was \"arguably decisive in terms of worsening the relationship between the British Army and the Catholic working class\". Previously, many of them had seen the British Army as a neutral force in the city that would protect them from the police. However, the events of the Falls Curfew gave credence to the Irish republican argument that the British Army was a hostile colonial army of occupation. According to Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams, \"Thousands of people who had never been republicans now gave their active support to the IRA; others, who had never had any time for physical force now regarded it as a practical necessity\".\n\nAnother result of the Falls Curfew was a deepening of the enmity between the two factions of the Irish Republican Army, the 'Official' IRA and the 'Provisional' IRA, who had parted ways in December 1969. The Officials accused the Provisionals of tricking them into a fight they could not win and then leaving them to fight alone, resulting in the loss of much of their weaponry. Over the following year, the two factions carried out many shootings and beatings of each other's members. A truce was eventually agreed between them to prevent further bloodshed after the Officials assassinated a young Provisional named Charlie Hughes. Hughes was the commander of the Provisional's unit in the Lower Falls and had taken part in some of the fighting during the Curfew.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30861073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30861073", "title": "Fog collection", "text": "Fog collection\n\nFog collection refers to the collection of water from fog using large pieces of vertical canvas to make the fog-droplets flow down towards a trough below the canvas, known as a fog fence.\n\nThrough a process known as condensation, atmospheric water vapour from the air naturally condenses on cold surfaces into droplets of liquid water known as dew. The phenomenon is most observable on thin, flat, exposed objects including plant leaves and blades of grass. As the exposed surface cools by radiating its heat to the sky, atmospheric moisture condenses at a rate greater than that of which it can evaporate, resulting in the formation of water droplets.\n\nThe organized collection of dew or condensation through natural or assisted processes is an ancient practice, from the small-scale drinking of pools of condensation collected in plant stems (still practised today by survivalists), to large-scale natural irrigation without rain falling, such as in the Atacama and Namib desert. Several man-made devices such as antique stone piles in Ukraine, medieval \"dew ponds\" in southern England or volcanic stone covers on the fields of Lanzarote have all been thought to be possible dew-catching devices.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) began constructing and deploying large fog collecting devices on Mount Sutton in Quebec. These simple tools consisted of a large piece of canvas (generally 12 m long and 4 m high) stretched between two 6 m wooden poles held up by guide wires, with a long trough underneath. Water would condense out of the fog onto the canvas, coalesce into droplets, and then slide down to drip off of the bottom of the canvas and into the collecting trough below.\n\nThe intent of the Canadian project was simply to use fog collection devices to study the constituents of the fog that they collected. However, their success sparked the interest of scientists in Chile's National Forest Corporation (CONAF) and Catholic University of Chile to exploit the camchanca or garúa clouds which blanket the northern Chile coast in the southern hemisphere winter. With funding from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), the MSC collaborated with the Chileans to begin testing different designs of collection facilities on El Tofo Mountain in northern Chile. Once perfected, approximately 50 of the systems were erected and used to irrigate seedlings on the hillside in an attempt at reforestation. Once vegetation became established, it should have begun collecting fog for itself, like the many cloud forests in South America, in order to flourish as a self-sustaining system.\n\nHowever, the success of the reforestation project is unclear, but approximately five years after the beginning of the project, the nearby village of Chungungo began to push for a pipeline to be sent down the mountain into the town. Though this was not in the scope of CONAF, which pulled out at this point, it was agreed to expand the collection facility to 94 nylon mesh collectors with a reserve tank and piping in order to supply the 300 inhabitants of Chungungo with water.\n\nThe project, completed in 1992, initially achieved a spectacular success, with an average production of 15,000 litres of water per day (peaking at 100,000 liters) that could be stored or piped to the village for use in drinking, bathing and irrigating. The accomplishment achieved high publicity, with frequent quotes from the townspeople, for whom water was dangerously scarce before, calling the collectors a “miracle.”\n\nUnfortunately, the IDRC reports that ten years later in 2002, only nine of the devices remained and the system overall was in very poor shape. On the other hand, the MSC oddly states in its article that the facility was still fully functional in 2003, but provides no details behind this statement. In June 2003 the IDRC reported that plans existed to revive the site on El Tofo.\n\nThe reason for the failure of this project to achieve sustainability can be attributed to many factors. Because the project started off on a different path, the final route that it took was disorganized and lacked clear objectives once the facilities were built. The villagers of Chungungo formed a committee to see to the maintenance and repair of the collectors, funded by collections from the village households, but the new water supply caused the population of the village to triple and the committee was unable to acquire the supplementary funds to expand the array of collectors and the reservoir, which would have solved any new water shortage problems easily and cost effectively. It is also suggested that this and other methods of water supply are shunned by the people of Chungungo and towns in other developing countries, who feel that collecting one’s own water lacks prestige and think that the state should pay for such services. In fact, this is exactly what the people of Chungungo wanted as of 2003 – a pipeline costing around US$1 million to be built from Los Choros river, 20 km away.\n\nHowever, current evidence suggests the failure has been mended, and operations are successful. \n\nIn March 2015 Dar Si Hmad (DSH), a Moroccan NGO, built the world’s largest fog-collection and distribution system in the Anti-Atlas Mountains. The region DSH worked in is water-poor, but abundant fog drapes the area 6 months out of the year. DSH's system also included technology that allowed reporting and monitoring of the water system via SMS message. These capabilities were crucial in dealing with the effects Fog Collection had on the social fabric of these rural areas. According to MIT researchers, the Fog Collection methods implemented by DSH have \"improved the fog-collecting efficiency by about five hundred per cent.\"\n\nDespite the apparent failure of the fog collection project in Chungungo, the method has already caught on in various localities around the world. Nowadays the International Organization for Dew Utilization organization is working on foil-based effective condensers for regions where rain or fog cannot cover water needs throughout the year. Shortly after the initial success of the project, researchers from the various participating organizations formed the nonprofit organization FogQuest, which has set up operational facilities in Yemen and central Chile, while still others are under evaluation in Guatemala, Haiti, and Nepal, this time with much more emphasis on the continuing involvement of the communities in the hopes that the projects will last well into the future. Villages in a total of 25 countries worldwide now operate fog collection facilities. There is also still potential for the systems to be used to establish dense vegetation on previously arid grounds. Overall, it appears that the inexpensive collectors will continue to flourish.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33976803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33976803", "title": "Green affordable housing", "text": "Green affordable housing\n\nGreen affordable housing is reasonably priced housing that incorporates sustainable features. The phenomenon has become increasingly common in the United States with the adoption of state and local policies that favor or require green building practices for publicly owned or funded buildings. Potential benefits of green affordable housing include lower energy cost burden and improved health. One challenge to green affordable housing is the tendency to overlook long-term benefits in the face of higher upfront cost. The challenge for green housing advocates is to see to the life cycle cost of the building. Many affordable housing projects already find it a challenge to raise capital to finance basic affordable housing. Green affordable housing has taken form in traditionally wooden homes and most recently with 'upcycling' shipping containers. \n\nAlthough there is no single definition for what constitutes a Green Building, some elements recur in describing the concept. A Green Building can thus be defined as a high-performance building designed, built, operated and disposed of in a resource-efficient manner with the aim to minimize the overall (negative) impact on the built environment, human health and the natural environment. Some examples of green building features are choice of site and orientation, efficient use of materials and resources, indoor environmental quality and innovation.\n\nAffordable Housing in the US is defined as dwelling units whose total housing costs fit within the budget of households at the local median income level. Affordability is commonly defined as not spending more than 30 percent of household income on housing. Given the higher exposure of low-income households and the need for public assistance, the most salient features of green affordable housing are energy use, material use/durability and a healthy indoor environment.\n\nPublicly sponsored affordable housing projects use public funds or tax breaks in order to increase the stock of housing available to low income people. In addition, these projects often seek to improve the quality of the stock, in order to offer \"decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable living environments\". Green Affordable Housing projects add to those goals by lowering the lifetime cost of units and improving the quality. The concept of the triple bottom line defines sustainability to include economics, social equity and the environment. Affordable housing already addresses economics and social equity. Sustainability measures obviously help the environment, but they can help the economics and social equity of housing projects as well. Housing units with a better design can improve health outcomes. With lower utility costs and improved health outcomes, the projects are more beneficial to low-income households, who are particularly exposed to poor housing quality and increases in general life costs, e.g. for utilities or medical expenses. Economically, sustainable design lowers the lifetime cost of a building. Since the preservation of affordable housing is sensitive to public funding, making affordable housing greener is a logic step to reducing long-term costs and increasing stability. Green design increases the economics, social equity, and environmental impact of affordable housing projects.\n\nThe affordable housing stock varies in terms of ownership, type and quality. However, financing of affordable housing has in most cases been constrained which means quality of affordable housing construction projects often has been compromised.\n\nPolicy programs that require green building standards in new construction will contribute to greening the affordable housing stock. However, new construction, whether green or conventional building, will in general be of higher quality, more efficient and healthier than older buildings. In contrast, the existing affordable stock constitutes a challenge from many perspectives. According to the National Center for Healthy Housing (NCHH) 5.7 million of American families live in substandard housing.\n\nExisting low-cost units tend to be older than the housing stock in general. For example, in 1995, 68% of the affordable rental housing stock was constructed before 1970 and another 21% were built before 1980. A considerable share of the older affordable rental stock has been removed from the market since 1995, but many of the remaining units are in older buildings. Due for example to differences in building standards, technical development and historical maintenance, the older building stock is generally of worse quality than newer buildings. Deficits include cold down draft, poor insulation and inefficient windows and appliances.\n\nPoor housing quality and low incomes contributes to fuel poverty, a phenomenomen that is more common among lower-income household than among households in general. Over the past decade home energy costs have risen in American homes in general. For low-income households this cost increase is even more pressing, for which home energy expenditures can be as high as a fifth of household income and more than a quarter of total housing costs. For that reason, improving energy efficiency has been pointed out as one of the challenges for American housing by the Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\nEnergy expenditures for low income households have risen over the past decades, and the energy burden (energy expenditures as share of household income) has increased since 1997. Mean residential energy expenditures increased by 27 percent from 2001 to 2005, to $1,522, and by almost 20 percent to $1,822 by fiscal year 2009. The mean group residential energy burden (the ratio between mean energy expenditures and mean income for a given set of households) for households with incomes at or below 150 percent of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) poverty guidelines rose from 10.7 percent in 1997 to 13.5 percent in 2009. Utilities are included in housing expenditures in calculations of housing affordability. However, higher energy costs mean that rents will be higher and/or that more assistance is needed to cover the difference between actual and \"affordable\" energy expenditures, assistance that already is insufficient to cover this gap.\n\nThe deterioration of the existing stock has contributed to health problems for those living in affordable housing. Green updates to existing units can improve health outcomes. In addition, new housing units that address the causes of health issues improve the sustainability of the house. These units will have a lower lifetime building cost (because they won't need updates) and cost less to inhabitants (because of improved health outcomes).\n\nDepending on the extent of sustainability design, the costs of green building often imply an initial capital cost premium compared to the cost of conventional buildings. Newer technology and the requirement of special labor skills are examples of cost drivers in green building projects. However, careful planning and deliberate choices can minimize these upfront costs. It is expected that the costs of building green will decrease over time, thanks to experience and the development of products and services.\n\nThere are many new types of products in the market that offer green affordable housing. The type of area the housing is located in (rural versus suburban versus urban) can also play a big role in choosing the best resource in building affordable green housing. Other factors include the location of housing and the type of transportation options that it supports. \"Dispersed, low-density housing often cannot support viable public transit, biking, or pedestrian options, all but making auto ownership a necessary cost. The true cost of housing, therefore, is the combined cost of housing plus transportation.\" \n\nCurrently, one third of the human population resides in earthen houses; in developing countries this figure is more than one half. To build shelter in these developing countries with traditional industrial building materials (i.e. It has proven impossible to fulfill the immense requirements for shelter in the developing countries with traditional industrial building materials i.e. brick, concrete and steel).\n\nFunds available to the development and maintenance of affordable housing are scarce and, in order to maximize the supply of housing, low construction costs are often favored in choosing projects. However, one of the main arguments for green affordable housing is that a higher upfront cost for construction/renovation can be motivated by a lower operating cost over the life-time of the building, i.e. a lower life-cycle cost. If the initial investment leads to lower operating costs and/or higher durability the higher upfront capital cost needed for construction or renovation can be justified. This is especially true considering that public funding and tax breaks (like the low-income housing tax credit) for housing often require a longer term perspective from its builders. However, the need to preserve affordability of housing sometimes restricts value enhancement over time and may thus be a barrier to investing in green features.\n\nGeneral green building benefits include environmental, economic and social benefits. The potential \"environmental\" benefits are enhancement and protection of biodiversity and ecosystems; improved air and water quality; reduced waste stream and conservation and restoration of natural resources. \"Economically\" potential benefits include lower operation costs; a market for green products and services; enhanced occupier productivity and the optimization of life-cycle performance. \"Social\" potential benefits include improved health and comfort for residents, minimizing the burden on local infrastructure and improved aesthetics. Affordable housing projects emphasize all three benefits, because they replace deteriorating stock, which harm the environment most and provide the least economic and social benefit.\n\nThe potential benefits of green affordable housing projects can be divided into direct, regional and global benefits. The direct benefits include lower utility costs, a healthier indoor environment and increased durability. Regional benefits include support for solid waste management and improved water quality. Globally benefits may include reduced energy use and carbon footprint and lower material use.\n\nEnergy efficiency and other sustainability improvements for low-income households have external benefits as well. Governments, energy-providers, property owners, and taxpayers all experience direct financial, indirect financial, and social welfare and livelihood co-benefits from green affordable housing projects. The improved quality and energy efficiency of these projects result in direct financial benefit in the form of reduced energy bills, reduced outlays for assistance to low-income households, reduced rates of shut-offs and thus reduced related administrative costs. Indirect financial co-benefits accrue to residents, property owners and tax-payers and society as a whole. Examples of these co-benefits are increased property values and economic activity, increased home and fire safety and reduced involuntary mobility for low-income households. Potential co-benefits for social welfare and livelihood include improved comfort, health and safety for the residents, community pride and improved health outcomes.\n\nGovernments, local housing authorities, and other interested parties can either begin new affordable housing projects with sustainable design, or retrofit the existing stock. While new projects require a larger upfront cost, these projects provide a greater return on investment than retrofitting. Initiatives for Green Affordable Housing are becoming increasingly more common, supported for example by The Green Affordable Housing Coalition\n\nTo ensure the energy efficiency of affordable housing, state and local governments have implemented sustainability standards. Washington was the first state to enact green building legislation in the U.S., with its Evergreen Sustainability Development Standard. This standard requires that all buildings that receive public funding meet “79 criteria that safeguard health and safety, increase durability, promote sustainable living, preserve the environment, and increase energy and water efficiency.” This applies to all publicly subsidized affordable housing, but not private projects.\n\nThe potential problem with sustainability standards is that projects will be more costly and projects will become cost prohibitive. While units that are built will be higher efficiency, the number of available units could decrease because of costs. A 2009 study prepared by Davis Langdon examines the effect of green standards on the costs of affordable housing projects in Seattle and Portland. This study compared “standard housing projects” (i.e. projects with no explicit sustainability goals) and projects attempting to achieve Built Green or LEED certification. The study includes both public and private affordable housing projects. At the time of the study, both cities had high sustainability standards for public projects, and Washington has only increased that standard since then. Construction cost analysis (in terms of cost per square foot) showed no significant difference between standard projects and green-rated projects. The study is limited by a small sample size, because of which they couldn’t compare public and privately funded projects.\n\nMany jurisdictions offer options for updating the energy efficiency of existing housing stock. The US Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) offers the chance for low-income families to improve their housing in order to reduce energy consumption and costs. WAP uses funds from the federal Department of Energy. Federal funds are distributed by state offices and services are provided by local agencies. WAP has suffered because of increased competition for federal funds. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) designated funds for WAP. The program as a whole was criticized for its failure to distribute these funds effectively.\n\nEnergy-efficient appliances are another method for households to decrease energy use. Low-income households have trouble realizing this gain energy efficiency. Energy-efficient appliances require a large up-front investment, and savings will not be realized for many years. Local grantees have the option to use Weatherization funds to support appliance purchases. However, unlike weatherization programs, the gains in household budgets are often not worth the investment. A 2010 study examined the households' purchasing habits in regard to high-efficiency appliances. Using household-level data, this study determines that homeowners are significantly more likely to own energy efficient large appliances, such as refrigerators or washing machines. However, the results show that the cost of this problem is negligible compared to overall energy consumption. This finding is important considering the increasing efficiency standards for household appliances. A higher standard may put simple appliances out of the price range of low income households, while not offering much energy relief for households that do own them.\n\nAs Green Affordable Housing still is a rather marginal phenomenon the outcomes of policy programs and specific interventions remain to be examined and confirmed. However, a number of studies are underway to examine the effects on health, energy savings and project costs. Other research initiatives seek to develop Green Affordable Housing while continuously evaluating the efforts. Some early learning point to the importance of training, outreach and resource coordination for the success of a green affordable housing program.\n"}
{"id": "1437184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1437184", "title": "Guns versus butter model", "text": "Guns versus butter model\n\nIn macroeconomics, the guns versus butter model is an example of a simple production–possibility frontier. It demonstrates the relationship between a nation's investment in defense and civilian goods. In this example, a nation has to choose between two options when spending its finite resources. It may buy either guns (invest in defense/military) or butter (invest in production of goods), or a combination of both. This may be seen as an analogy for choices between defense and civilian spending in more complex economies.\n\nThe \"guns or butter\" model is used generally as a simplification of national spending as a part of GDP. The nation will have to decide which balance of guns versus butter best fulfills its needs, with its choice being partly influenced by the military spending and military stance of potential opponents. Researchers in political economy have viewed the trade-off between military and consumer spending as a useful predictor of election success.\n\nOne theory on the origin of the concept comes from William Jennings Bryan's resignation as United States Secretary of State in the Wilson Administration. At the outbreak of World War I, the leading global exporter of nitrates for gunpowder was Chile. Chile had maintained neutrality during the war and provided nearly all of the US's nitrate requirements. It was also the principal ingredient of chemical fertilizer in farming. The export product was sodium nitrate, a salt mined in the northern part of Chile which is often called \"Chilean saltpeter.\"\n\nWith substantial popular opinion running against US entry into the war, the Bryan resignation and peace campaign (joined prominently with Henry Ford's efforts) became a banner for local versus national interests. However, Bryan was no more pro-German than the infamously nativistic Wilson; his motivation, instead, was to expose and publicize what he considered to be an unconscionable public policy.\n\nThe National Defense Act of 1916 directed the president to select a site for the artificial production of nitrates within the United States. It was not until September 1917, several months after the United States entered World War I, that Wilson selected Muscle Shoals, Alabama, after more than a year of competition among political rivals. A deadlock in the Congress was broken when South Carolina Senator Ellison D. Smith sponsored the National Defense Act of 1916 that directed \"the Secretary of Agriculture to manufacture nitrates for fertilizers in peace and munitions in war at water power sites designated by the President.\" This was presented by the news media as \"guns and butter.\"\n\nPerhaps the best known use of the phrase (in translation) was in Nazi Germany. In a speech on January 17, 1936, Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels stated: \"We can do without butter, but, despite all our love of peace, not without arms. One cannot shoot with butter, but with guns.\" Referencing the same concept, sometime in the summer of the same year another Nazi official, Hermann Göring, announced in a speech: \"Guns will make us powerful; butter will only make us fat.\"\n\nUS President Lyndon B. Johnson used the phrase to catch the attention of the national media while reporting on the state of national defense and the economy.\n\nAnother use of the phrase was British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's statement, in a 1976 speech she gave at a Kensington Town Hall, in which she said, \"The Soviets put guns over butter, but we put almost everything over guns.\"\n\nThe song \"Guns Before Butter\" by Gang of Four from their 1979 album \"Entertainment!\" is about this concept.\n\nThe Prodigy's 1997 album \"The Fat of the Land\" has the following text on the fold-out booklet: \"We have no butter, but I ask you /Would you rather have butter or guns? /Shall we import lard or steel? Let me tell you /Preparedness makes us powerful. /Butter merely makes us fat.\"\n\nThis phrase as the title for an episode (\"Guns Not Butter\") in season four of the television show \"The West Wing\" (1999–2006) that focused on the portion of the federal budget devoted to foreign aid.\n\nThe concept was also discussed in the 2001 movie Baby Boy.\n\nThe concept is referenced in the title of the song \"Gunz n Butter\" on \"A$AP Rocky\"'s 2018 album \"TESTING\".\n\nLyndon B. Johnson's Great Society programs in the 1960s, when he was President of the United States, are examples of the guns versus butter model. While Johnson wanted to continue New Deal programs and expand welfare with his own Great Society programs, he was also involved in both the arms race of the Cold War and in the Vietnam War. These wars put strains on the economy and hampered his Great Society programs.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to President Dwight D Eisenhower's own objections to the expansion and endless warfare of the military-industrial complex. In his \"Chance For Peace\" speech in 1953, he referred to this very trade-off, giving specific examples:Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.This is, I repeat, the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. ... Is there no other way the world may live?\n\n"}

{"id": "16809636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16809636", "title": "Involuntary unemployment", "text": "Involuntary unemployment\n\nInvoluntary unemployment occurs when a person is willing to work at the prevailing wage yet is unemployed. Involuntary unemployment is distinguished from voluntary unemployment, where workers choose not to work because their reservation wage is higher than the prevailing wage. In an economy with involuntary unemployment there is a surplus of labor at the current real wage. Involuntary unemployment cannot be represented with a basic supply and demand model at a competitive equilibrium: All workers on the labor supply curve above the market wage would voluntarily choose not to work, and all those below the market wage would be employed. Given the basic supply and demand model, involuntarily unemployed workers lie somewhere off of the labor supply curve. Economists have several theories explaining the possibility of involuntary unemployment including implicit contract theory, disequilibrium theory, staggered wage setting, and efficiency wages.\n\nModels based on implicit contract theory, like that of Azariadis (1975), are based on the hypothesis that labor contracts make it difficult for employers to cut wages. Employers often resort to layoffs rather than implement wage reductions. Azariadis showed that given risk-averse workers and risk-neutral employers, contracts with the possibility of layoff would be the optimal outcome.\n\nEfficiency wage models suggest that employers pay their workers above market clearing wages in order to enhance their productivity. In efficiency wage models based on shirking, employers are worried that workers may shirk knowing that they can simply move to another job if they are caught. Employers make shirking costly by paying workers more than the wages they would receive elsewhere. This gives workers an incentive not to shirk. When all firms behave this way, an equilibrium is reached where there are unemployed workers willing to work at prevailing wages.\nFollowing earlier disequilibrium research including that of Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman, work by Edmond Malinvaud clarified the distinction between classical unemployment, where real wages are too high for markets to clear, and Keynesian unemployment, involuntary unemployment due to inadequate aggregate demand. In Malinvaud's model, classical unemployment is remedied by cutting the real wage while Keynesian unemployment requires an exogenous stimulus in demand. Unlike implicit contrary theory and efficiency wages, this line of research does not rely on a higher than market-clearing wage level. This type of involuntary unemployment is consistent with Keynes's definition while efficiency wages and implicit contract theory do not fit well with Keynes's focus on demand deficiency.\n\nFor many economists, involuntary unemployment is a real-world phenomenon of central importance to economics. Many economic theories have been motivated by the desire to understand and control involuntary unemployment. However, acceptance of the concept of involuntary unemployment isn't universal among economists. Some do not accept it as a real or coherent aspect of economic theory. \n\nShapiro and Stiglitz, developers of an influential shirking model, stated \"To us, involuntary unemployment is a real and important phenomenon with grave social consequences that needs to be explained and understood.\"\n\nMancur Olson argued that real world events like the Great Depression could not be understood without the concept of involuntary unemployment. He argued against economists who denied involuntary unemployment and put their theories ahead of \"common sense and the observations and experiences of literally hundreds of millions of people... that there is also involuntary unemployment and that it is by no means an isolated or rare phenomenon\".\n\nOther economists do not believe that true involuntary unemployment exists or question its relevance to economic theory. Robert Lucas claims \"...there is an involuntary element in all unemployment in the sense that no one chooses bad luck over good; there is also a voluntary element in all unemployment, in the sense that, however miserable one's current work options, one can always choose to accept them\" and \"the unemployed worker at any time can always find some job at once\". Lucas dismissed the need for theorists to explain involuntary unemployment since it is \"not a fact or a phenomenon which it is the task of theorists to explain. It is, on the contrary, a theoretical construct which Keynes introduced in the hope it would be helpful in discovering a correct explanation for a genuine phenomenon: large-scale ﬂuctuations in measured, total unemployment.\" Along those lines real business cycle and other models from Lucas's new classical school explain fluctuations in employment by shifts in labor supply driven by changes in workers' productivity and preferences for leisure.\n\nInvoluntary unemployment is also conceptually problematic with search and matching theories of unemployment. In these models, unemployment is voluntary in the sense that a worker might choose to endure unemployment during a long search for a higher paying job than those immediately available; however, there is an involuntary element in the sense that a worker does not have control of the economic circumstances that force them to look for new work in the first place.\n\n"}
{"id": "296498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296498", "title": "Japan–Korea disputes", "text": "Japan–Korea disputes\n\nThere have been disputes between Japan and Korea (both North and South) on numerous issues over the years.\n\nKorea was ruled by the Imperial Japanese government starting with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910 until the Japanese Instrument of Surrender in 1945 which ended World War II. South Korea refused to trade or open diplomatic relations with Japan until 1965, after which trade links expanded dramatically. Today, Japan and South Korea are major trading partners, and many students, tourists, entertainers, and business people travel between the two countries, whereas North Korea's political and economic relations with Japan are not developed.\n\nWith the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, Japan decided the expansion of their settlement, the addition of the market and acquired an enclave in Busan. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, Japan defeated the Qing dynasty, and succeeded in released from the tributary system of the Qing China in Korea by concluding the Treaty of Shimonoseki that compelled Qing to acknowledge Yi Dynasty Korea as an independent country. Japan encouraged the modernization of Korea. However, the Min clan, including the Queen Min, took precautions against Japan of which dominating power was further increasing in Korea. In 1895, Queen Min was assassinated by Japan after seeking to promote Russian influence and oppose reform. In 1897, Joseon was renamed the Korean Empire (1897–1910), affirming its independence, but greatly gravitated closer to Russia, with the King ruling from the Russian legation, and then using Russian guards upon return to his palace. Japan declared war on Russia to drive out Russian influence, and ended the war by imposing the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905. Korea became a protectorate of Japan, a precursor to its annexation. Itō Hirobumi, who was the first prime minister of Japan and one of the elder statesmen, was Resident-General of Korea and was opposed to the annexation of Korea. However, the power balance of the Japan domestic grew in favor of the annexation, because an influential statesmen objecting to the early annexation disappeared due to the assassination of Itō Hirobumi by An Jung-geun in 1909, On August 22, 1910, annexing the Korea by signing the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty.\n\nKim Il-sung led a Korean independence movement, which was active in the border areas of China and Russia, particularly in areas with considerable ethnic Korean populations. Kim founded North Korea, and his descendants have still not signed a peace treaty with Japan. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, led by (later) South Korea's first president Syngman Rhee, moved from Shanghai to Chongqing. Lee lobbied in the United States and was recognized by the South Korean administrator by Douglas MacArthur. Japanese control of Korea ended on September 9, 1945, when the Governor-General of Korea signed the surrender document of the United States in Seoul.\n\nAfter signing the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty of 1910, the lives of Koreans were changed significantly. The treaty was set in action the same day it was signed (signed by the pro-Japanese Korean Prime minister, Ye Wanyong). \n\nThe Japanese colonization of Korea was known to be harsh and ruthless. Japan had power over Korea’s domestic politics and waged a war against Korean culture. Japan’s military ruled over the Koreans for the first ten years of Japan’s colonization. The Japanese government forced the people to worship and remain loyal to the Japanese Emperor and refused to allow them to preach their religions or beliefs. They forbade the Korean language to be spoken in public places and Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names, to integrate them into Japanese culture even more. Teachers were only allowed to teach approved texts from the government after over two hundred thousand Korean historical documents were burned by the Japanese at an attempt to wipe out Korea’s history. \n\nKoreans were subjected to a harsh class structure during this time. Compared to the Japanese, Koreans were seen as the lowest and poorest class, treated unjustly and seen as barbaric or animals. During Japan’s wars, Korean men were sent to work at Japanese factories or as soldiers for Japan while the women were drafted as comfort women, aka sex slaves, for the Japanese soldiers. Overall, many Koreans faced significant economic hardship. Koreans were continuously oppressed by the Japanese up to 1945, after Japan lost in World War Two. \n\nAlthough Japan’s treatment of Korea was unjust, Korea’s modernization emerged. Korea produced rapid urban growth, expanded in commerce and increased their use of popular mass culture like the radio or cinema. Korea’s industrial development grew as well, even though the main reason was to support and provide for Japan and their needs. By the time of the end of Japan’s colonization of Korea in 1945, Korea was the second-most industrialized asian nation, Japan being the first. \n\nIn 1910, Japan annexed Korea. The legality of the annexation and the subsequent 35-years of occupation of the Korean Peninsula by Japan are controversial. Both have been criticized as illegal based on the fact that the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 was signed under duress, as well as its never having been ratified by Gojong of Korea. Some Japanese scholars have challenged this view of the treaty as invalid.\n\nAlthough diplomatic relations were established by treaty in 1965, South Korea continues to request an apology and compensation for Korea under Japanese rule. The Japanese government has not apologized officially and many Japanese cabinet members have also not made apologies. In 2012, The South Korean government announced that Emperor Akihito must apologize for Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.\nMost Japanese Prime Ministers have issued apologies, including Prime Minister Obuchi in the Japan–South Korea Joint Declaration of 1998. While South Koreans welcomed and accepted the apologies at the time, many South Koreans are taught that the statements as insincere, because of misunderstandings between the two nations. In one example in 2005, the Koizumi Cabinet did not participate, but 47 Diet members visited Yasukuni shrine for a memorial service at exactly the same time Prime Minister Koizumi was issuing the apology. This was portrayed by South Korean Media as a contradiction and has caused many South Koreans to distrust and discard Japanese statements of apology.\n\nPrime Minister Junichirō Koizumi, in the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration of 2002, said: \"I once again express my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology, and also express the feelings of mourning for all victims, both at home and abroad, in the war.\"\n\nSince the 1950s, many prominent politicians and officials in Japan have made statements on Japanese colonial rule in Korea which created outrage and led to diplomatic scandals in Korean-Japanese relations. The statements have led to anti-Japanese sentiments among Koreans, and a widespread perception that Japanese apologies for colonial rule have been insincere and discarded due to these statements\n\nDuring the talks between Japan and Korea in 1953, Kan'ichirō Kubota, one of the Japanese representatives, stated: \"Japanese colonial rule was beneficial to Korea ... Korea would have been colonized by other countries anyway, which would have led to harsher rules than Japanese rules.\" Many Koreans consider this remark to be the first reckless statement made by Japanese politicians about colonial rule in Korea.\n\nIn 1997, Shinzō Abe, then a member of the House of Representatives and now Prime Minister of Japan, stated: \"Many so-called victims of comfort women system are liars ... prostitution was ordinary behavior in Korea because the country had many brothels.\"\n\nOn May 31, 2003, Tarō Asō, then the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications and later Prime Minister, stated that \"the change to Japanese name (創氏改名) during Japanese colonial rule was what Koreans wanted\".\n\nOn October 28, 2003, Shintaro Ishihara, then Governor of Tokyo, stated: \"The annexation of Korea and Japan was Koreans' choice ... the ones to be blamed are the ancestors of Koreans.\"\n\nIn 2007, Hakubun Shimomura, then Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Japanese government, stated: \"The comfort women system existed, but I believe it was because Korean parents sold their daughters at that time.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2010, on the centennial of Japan–Korean annexation, Yukio Edano, then Japanese Minister of State for Government Revitalization, stated that \"The invasion and colonization and China and Korea was historically inevitable ... since China and Korea could not modernize themselves.\"\n\nTwenty years after World War II, South Korea and Japan re-established diplomatic relations with the 1965 signing of the Treaty on Basic Relations. In 2005, South Korea disclosed diplomatic documents that detailed the proceedings of the treaty. Kept secret in South Korea for 40 years, the documents revealed that Japan provided 500 million dollars in soft loans and 300 million in grants to South Korea as compensation for the reign of Japan. South Korea agreed to demand no more compensation after the treaty, either at a government-to-government level or an individual-to-government level. It was also revealed that the South Korean government assumed the responsibility for compensating individuals on a lump sum basis while rejecting Japan's proposal for direct compensation.\n\nHowever, the South Korean government used most of the loans for economic development and have failed to provide adequate compensation to victims, paying only 300,000 won per death, with only a total of 2,570 million won to the relatives of 8,552 victims who died in forced labor. As the result, the Korean victims were preparing to file a compensation suit against the South Korean government as of 2005. The treaty does not preclude individual suits against Japanese individuals or corporations but such suits are often constrained by the statute of limitation. Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery, a mock trial organised by and supported by Japanese NGO Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery, issued a ruling that \"states cannot agree by treaty to waive the liability of another state for crimes against humanity\".\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Korea (particularly during World War II), Japan mobilized 700,000 laborers from Korea to sustain industrial production, mainly in mining. Some of them eventually returned to Korea after the war, with some dying in Japan during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, or the other Allied bombings of Japan. The high death toll may also have had other causes in the harsh conditions of the war. Corporations, such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui and others, stated that the culpability should fall on the government and not on private companies. The government distributed funds to companies for the purposes of worker repatriation. Japanese companies paid out sums at the end of the war to Chinese work leaders intended for Chinese labourers to return home to China, but the money went missing after distribution to the Chinese workers. Later, the People's Republic of China and South Korea requested help in finding the dead bodies of kidnapped Chinese and Korean laborers for proper burial. The situation prevented China and South Korea from appropriately coordinating their efforts, and they have only identified a few hundred bodies. In addition, Korean workers began demanding their unpaid wages immediately after Japan's surrender and continue to do so today. The issue remains salient in South Korea.\n\nThe Japanese rule of Korea also resulted in the relocation of tens of thousands of cultural artifacts to Japan. The issue over where these articles should be located began during the U.S. occupation of Japan. In 1965, as part of the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, Japan returned roughly 1,400 artifacts to Korea, and considered the diplomatic matter to have been resolved. Korean artifacts are retained in the Tokyo National Museum and in the hands of many private collectors.\n\nIn 1994, hundreds of books of the Heart Sutra which were donated by the Goryeo Dynasty to Japan in 1486 were stolen from a temple. The following year, three damaged books out of these hundreds were discovered in South Korea and registered as National Treasure no. 284. In 2002, thieves stole another medieval gift and a Japanese biography of Prince Shōtoku, and donated them to a temple in Korea.\n\nAccording to the South Korean government, there are 75,311 cultural artifacts that were taken from Korea. Japan has 34,369, the United States has 17,803, and France had several hundred, which were seized in the French campaign against Korea and loaned back to Korea in 2010 without an apology. In 2010, Prime Minister of Japan Naoto Kan expressed \"deep remorse\" for the removal of artifacts, and arranged an initial plan to return the Royal Protocols of the Joseon Dynasty and over 1,200 other books, which was carried out in 2011.\n\nMany South Koreans have demanded compensation for \"comfort women\", the women who were forced to work in Imperial Japanese military brothels during World War II. Enlisted to the military \"comfort stations\" through force, including kidnapping, coercion, and deception, the Korean comfort women, most of them under the age of 18, were forced to serve as sex slaves for 30–40 soldiers each day. As the few surviving comfort women continued to demand acknowledgement and a sincere apology, the Japanese court rejected their compensation claims.\n\nIn November 1990, was established in South Korea. As of 2008, a lump sum payment of 43 million South Korean won and a monthly payment of ₩0.8 million won were given to the survivors by the Korean government. In 1993, the government of Japan officially acknowledged the presence of wartime brothels, and set up a private Asian Women's Fund to distribute donated money and issue official letters of apology to the victims. Today, many of the surviving comfort women are in their 80s. As of 2007, according to South Korean government, there are 109 survivors in South Korea and 218 in North Korea. The survivors in South Korea protest every Wednesday in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul, Korea. The protest was held for the 1000th time in December 2011.\n\nIn July 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution calling for Japan to apologize for forcing women into sex slavery during World War II. The resolution was sponsored by Mike Honda (D-CA), a third-generation Japanese-American. On December 13, 2007, the European Parliament adopted a resolution demanding that the Japanese government apologize to the survivors of Japan's military sexual slavery system. This resolution was passed with 54 ayes out of 57 parliament members present.\n\nOn December 28, 2015, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-hye reached a formal agreement to settle the dispute. Japan agreed to pay ¥1 billion (₩9.7 billion; $8.3 million) to a fund supporting surviving victims while South Korea agreed to refrain from criticizing Japan regarding the issue and to work to remove a statue memorializing the victims from in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul. The announcement came after Japanese foreign minister Fumio Kishida met his counterpart Yun Byung-se in Seoul, and later Abe phoned Geun-hye to repeat the apologies already offered by Japan. The South Korean government will administer the fund for elderly comfort women.\n\nYasukuni Shrine is a Shinto shrine that memorializes Japanese armed forces members killed in wartime. It was constructed as a memorial during the Meiji period to house the remains of those who died for Japan. The shrine houses the remains of Hideki Tojo (東条英機), the Prime Minister and Army Minister of Japan between 1941 and 1944, and 13 other Class A war criminals. Yasukuni Shrine has been a subject of controversy, containing a memorial for 1,043 Japanese and 23 Korean B and C war criminals who were executed, as well as the 14 Japanese A-class war criminals. The presence of these war criminals among the dead honoured at Yasukuni Shrine has meant that visits to Yasukuni have been seen by Chinese and South Koreans as apologism for the wartime era.\n\nYasuhiro Nakasone and Ryutaro Hashimoto visited Yasukuni Shrine in, respectively, 1986 and 1996, and paid respects as Prime Minister of Japan, drawing intense opposition from Korea and China. Junichirō Koizumi visited the shrine and paid respects six times during his term as Prime Minister of Japan, with the first visit on August 13, 2001, stating that he was \"paying homage to the servicemen who died [in the] defense of Japan\". These visits again drew strong condemnation and protests from Japan's neighbors, mainly China and South Korea. As a result, the heads of the two countries refused to meet with Koizumi, and there were no mutual visits between Chinese and Japanese leaders after October 2001 and between South Korean and Japanese leaders after June 2005. The President of South Korea, Roh Moo-hyun, had suspended all summit talks between South Korea and Japan until 2008 when he resigned from office. The current prime minister, Shinzō Abe, has made several visits to the shrine, the most recent being in December 2013.\n\nMost anthropologists and historians acknowledge that Japan has historically been actively engaged with its neighbors China and Korea, as well as Southeast Asia. Among these neighbors, Chinese culture came to Japan from the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Japanese and Korean peoples share closely linked ethnic, cultural and anthropological histories; a point of controversy between nationalist scholars in Japan and Korea rests on which culture came first, and can thus be considered the forebear of the other.\n\nModern historiography is also a seat of discord. In South Korea, popular debates about \"cleansing history\" () focus on finding and recriminating \"collaborators\" with Japanese colonial authorities. In North Korea, the songbun system of ascribed status is used to punish citizens with collaborating relatives or ancestors.\n\nOn the other hand, Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) reviews and approves the content of school history textbooks available for selection by Japanese schools. Foreign scholars, as well as many Japanese historians, have criticized the political slant and factual errors in some approved textbooks. After a textbook by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform (JSHTR) passed inspection in April 2001, the South Korean government, 59 NGOs from South Korea and Japan, and some Japanese teachers' unions, registered objections to certain passages' omission of Imperial Japanese war crimes including comfort women and the Rape of Nanking. Although Tsukurukai's textbook has sold six hundred thousand copies in the general market, it has been adopted by less than 0.39% of Japanese schools. In 2010, another textbook by the JSHTR passed inspection and was published by Jiyusha (自由社).\n\nThe Liancourt Rocks, called Dokdo (독도, 獨島; \"solitary island\") in Korean and Takeshima (竹島; \"bamboo island\"), are a group of islets in the Sea of Japan whose ownership is disputed between South Korea and Japan. There are valuable fishing grounds around the islets and potentially large reserves of methane clathrate.\n\nThe territorial dispute is a major source of nationalistic tensions. Since the South Korean government bases its legitimacy partly on the notion that it defends South Korea from North Korea in the North and from Japan from the south, nationalism has been stoked over this issue. Korean tourists visit the remote, inhospitable island, in order to show national solidarity. In Japan, maps mark the islands as being Japanese territory.\n\nOn August 10, 1951, a secret correspondence currently known as the Rusk documents was sent to South Korea communicating the then U.S. position on issues of territorial sovereignty in the Peace Treaty explaining why the U.S. believed Liancourt Rocks were Japanese territory: \"This normally uninhabited rock formation was according to our information never treated as part of Korea and, since about 1905, has been under the jurisdiction of the Oki Islands Branch Office of Shimane Prefecture of Japan. The island does not appear ever before to have been claimed by Korea.\" In September 1954 and March 1962, Japan proposed to South Korea that the dispute be referred to the International Court of Justice, but South Korea rejected the proposals. Japan again proposed bringing the dispute to the International Court of Justice in August 2012, which was also officially rejected by South Korea on August 30, 2012.\n\nIn 2005, members of the Japanese prefecture of Shimane (the prefecture to which the islands belong according to the Japanese claim) declared \"Takeshima Day\", to highlight their territorial claim to the islands.\n\nAlthough the Liancourt Rocks are claimed by both Japan and (both) Koreas, the rocks are controlled by South Korea, which has the South Korean coast guard stationed there, as well as two elderly Korean residents.\n\nA small minority of Koreans claim this island as belonging to Korea, although the South Korean government does not make this claim. Called \"Tsushima\" in Japanese and \"Daemado\" in Korean, this island was recorded on the Chinese history book as a territory of Japan from ancient times. This island, as Tsushima Province, has been ruled by Japanese governments since the Nara period. According to Homer Hulbert, this island was a dependency to Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. However, according to the Korean history book Samguk Sagi written in 1145, Tsushima is ruled by the Japanese from CE 400.\n\nIn 1948, the South Korean government formally demanded that the island be ceded to South Korea based on \"historical claims\". However, the claim was rejected by SCAP in 1949. On July 19, 1951, the South Korean government agreed that the earlier demand for Tsushima had been dropped by the South Korean government with regards to the Japanese peace treaty negotiations.\n\nIn 2010, a group of 37 members of the South Korean congress formed a forum to study Korea's territorial claims to Tsushima and make outreach efforts to the public. They said that Tsushima was a part of Korean history and that the people on the island are closely related to Koreans. Yasunari Takarabe, incumbent Mayor of Tsushima rejects the South Korean territorial claim: \"Tsushima has always been Japan. I want them to retract their wrong historical perception. It was mentioned in the (a chapter of volume 30 of Book of Wei in the Chinese Records of the Three Kingdoms) as part of Wa (Japan). It has never been and cannot be a South Korean territory.\"\n\nThere is dispute over the international name for this body of water. Japan points out that the name \"Sea of Japan\" () was used in a number of European maps from the late 18th century to the early 19th century, and that many maps today retain this naming. However, both the North and South Korean governments have protested that Japan encouraged the usage of the name \"Sea of Japan\" while Korea lost effective control over its foreign policy under Japanese imperial expansion. South Korea argues that the name \"East Sea\" or \"Korean Eastern Sea\" (), which was one of the most common names found on old European maps of this sea, should be the name instead of (or at least used concurrently with) \"Sea of Japan.\"\n\nJapan claims that Western countries named it the \"Sea of Japan\" prior to 1860, before the growth of Japanese influence over Korean foreign policy after the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. Further, Japan claims that the primary naming occurred during the period of Sakoku, when Japan had very little foreign contact, and thus Japan could not have influenced the naming decisions. It was in 1928, when the International Hydrographic Organization's \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\" officially took the name Sea of Japan, which eventually influenced other official international documents such as the United Nations. South Korea claims that Korea was occupied by the Japanese and effectively had no international voice to protest in 1928.\n\nAfter the end of Japanese Occupation, Japanese cultural products such as music, film, and books were banned in both North and South Korea. The boycott was lifted in South Korea starting in 1998. Some Japanese cultural items, including but not limited to manga, anime, and music, have been introduced into South Korea even while they were banned (the South Korean public was not informed of their Japanese origin, though people mostly knew that they were).\n\nIt is still illegal to broadcast Japanese music and television dramas over terrestrial signals in South Korea.\n\nThe Japanese anime \"\", a satire series that personifies various nations created by Hidekaz Himaruya, was banned from airing on the Japanese TV Station, Kid Station, after many protests arrived from South Korea about how the character that represents South Korea was a disgrace and did not represent South Koreans correctly. This is in spite of the fact that a Korean character does not appear in any episode of the animated series, though it appears on web comic versions. The animation continues to see distribution through mobile networks and internet streaming.\n\nA 13-year-old junior high school student from Niigata, Megumi Yokota, was kidnapped by North Korea on November 15, 1977. In addition to her, many other Japanese citizens were kidnapped by North Korean agents. In 2002, North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens during the 1970s and 1980s, in order to train spies to infiltrate U.S. military installations in Japan. Five people have been released, but the North Korean government claimed that there were eight dead. Japan has pressed for the return of the bodies. However, the Japanese government believes that there are still kidnapped Japanese citizens being held captive in North Korea. North Korea's official statement is that the issue has been settled. Because of the overwhelming number of South Koreans also kidnapped by North Korea, there have been some joint efforts by South Korea and Japan to retrieve their citizens. The issue remains unresolved, but Japan has insisted on an explanation of what happened to their citizens as a precondition for normalizing relations with North Korea.\n\nIn brief, the Korean points are that through a long history of contact, several important Chinese innovations in culture and technology were transferred to Japan. Several linguistic theories make similar points. In these theories, practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy, and writing were introduced from China. Buddhism was first introduced to Japan from Baekje in Korea, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" writes that Japanese national treasures such as the Kōryū-ji sculptures, which are \"a symbol of Japan itself and an embodiment of qualities often used to define Japanese-ness in art\", are in actuality based on Korean prototypes and probably carved in Korea. In 1976, Japan stopped all foreign archaeologists from studying the Gosashi tomb in Nara Prefecture, which is the supposed resting place of Empress Jingū (of 200 BCE). In 2008, Japan allowed controlled, limited access to foreign archaeologists, but the international community still has many unanswered questions. National Geographic News reported that Japan \"the agency has kept access to the tombs restricted, prompting rumors that officials fear excavation would reveal bloodline links between the \"pure\" imperial family and Korea—or that some tombs hold no royal remains at all.\".\n\nSouth Korea has been accused of plagiarizing Japanese products. In 2007, a K-pop singer, Ivy, was accused of copying a scene from the Japanese video game movie adaptation \"\" in one of her music videos. The court ordered that the video be banned from airing on television, stating that \"most of the clip is noticeably similar to scenes from the film\".\n\nKoreans are the second largest group of foreign nationals living in Japan, before the Chinese, Filipinos, and after the Brazilians and Peruvians. Ethnicity censuses are not available in Japan, what leaves naturalized citizens that are part of these and other immigrant populations, as well historical groups with their own identity such as the Ryukyuans, the Ainu and the mixed-race Japanese invisible, so figures giving Yamato people an amount of about 98.5% of the Japanese population are very likely exaggerated.\n\nMore positively speaking, Masayoshi Son (Son Jeong-ui), a businessman and CEO of Japanese telecom giant SoftBank, is of Zainichi background. In addition, some of Japan's baseball players and martial artists were of Zainichi Korean background, including Rikidōzan (Kim Sin-rak), Mas Oyama (Choi Yeong-eui), Isao Harimoto (Jang Hun), and Masaichi Kaneda (Kim Kyung-hong). To avoid discrimination, some Zainichi Koreans have adopted Japanese names. Today, however, as the relationship between Japan and South Korea has improved, there also exist many Zainichi Koreans or former Zainichi Koreans with Japanese nationality who do not hide their origin and are in full activity, such as Yu Miri, an Akutagawa Prize-winning playwright and Tadanari Lee (Lee Chung-Sung), a Japanese football player of Korean origin.\n\nIn the 1990s, a dispute arose regarding the marketing of kimchi, considered to be a traditional Korean dish. Kimchi was growing in popularity, and its consumption and production were expanding. Korean manufacturers, however, argued that Japanese kimchi is fundamentally different, in that Japanese manufacturers often skip fermentation and mimic the flavors through the use of additives. South Korean producers argued that this made the product fundamentally different from kimchi, while Japanese producers argued they were simply altering the product to fit local tastes. In 2000, South Korea began lobbying the makers of the Codex Alimentarius, an international food-standards maker which provides voluntary advice to national food agencies, to designate kimchi as only that which is produced in the traditional Korean style. In 2001, the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as \"a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature\", but which did not specify a minimum amount of fermentation or forbid the use of additives.\n\nFrom 2013, South Korea banned all seafood products imported from Japan, due to concerns on the radioactive contamination from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The ban was extended to Fukushima and seven other Japanese prefectures. The Japanese government strongly opposes to South Korea's decision on placing the ban, insisting that the country's fisheries exports are safe for consumption, with stringent inspection procedures in place. The ban has led Japan to consider taking the issue to the WTO dispute settlement process.\n\n\n\n"}

She founded the Morris Knibb Preparatory School and donated a building which is used as the headquarters of the Moravian Church in Jamaica as well as land for construction of a community center. Morris Knibb was a women's rights activist and the first elected councilwomen in Jamaica. She was the first woman to vie for a seat in the House when Universal Suffrage was granted to all Jamaicans.\n\nMary Lenora Morris \"Nora\" was born on 28 February 1886 in Carmel, Westmoreland Parish, Jamaica. In 1893, Morris began teaching as an assistant teacher at the Moravian Day School, in the customary pupil-teacher system of recruitment. Throughout the Caribbean prior to the 1950s, the most promising primary students, began working as assistant teachers to offset the cost of their further education. In some cases, they became full teachers upon passing an examination and in others were sent after their pupil-teacher contractual period to normal schools for additional training. Morris, followed the latter path and attended the Shortwood Teachers' College. While attending the college, Morris became one of the founders of the Alumni Students' Association.\n\nBetween 1907 and 1917, Morris taught at the St. George Girls' School and then taught for almost two years at the Central Branch School. She then became the headmistress of the Wesley School, where she remained until 1928. In 1931, the now married Morris, opened her own school, the Mary Morris-Knibb Preparatory School in Kingston, at 3 Hector Street, Saint Andrew Parish, which she had inherited a few months previously upon the death of Frances Morris. Catering to the middle-class, Morris-Knibb was known to provide an excellent education and stern discipline. Students were required to study geography, history, Latin, math, reading, spelling, and writing, earning the school the reputation as \"one of the leading preparatory schools in the nation\".\n\nIn 1936 or 1937, she co-founded, along with Amy Bailey, Eulalie Domingo and Edith Dalton James, the Jamaica Women’s Liberal Club (LC). The organization was mostly made up of teachers and their goal was to agitate for women's inclusion in government service, including such posts as serving on the school board and civil service. Most of the women were black and middle-class women who wanted to advance the position of women in society on both socio-economic and political levels. One of the social protections for which Morris Knibb advocated was marriage. In part because of morality concerns, but in part because common-law arrangements did not protect children adequately, she favored even holding mass weddings so that the costs of the ceremony would be reduced and participation greater. When black women, like Morris-Knibb wanted to participate in the Child Welfare Association of Jamaica, they were told they were not welcome. The upperclass women of the Child Welfare Association suggested that the black women set up an auxiliary for women of their \"shade\". In response, Morris-Knibb joined Amy Bailey, May Farquharson, Dr. Jai Lal Varma, and Dr. Pengelley and others in founding the Save the Children Fund in 1938.\n\nMorris Knibb was one of the leaders in the fight for Jamaican suffrage and as it had been a long-practiced method for women to gain a foothold and show their readiness to vote, she was in favor of women running for local offices. In 1939, the LC organized women and ran a campaign with Morris Knibb as their candidate for parish council. She won the seat for the Kingston/Saint Andrew Parish seat on the council, becoming the first woman to serve as an elected official in Jamaica. Her work on the council focused on education and social services. She advocated for creation of after school programs, night schools, and trade education, utilizing existing school and government buildings for the purpose. She donated property located at 15 Byrnes Street to the Lower St. Andrews Citizen's Association to facilitate creation of a community centre and was active in programs to care for the poor and the aged.\n\nWhen universal franchise was granted to Jamaicans in 1944, Morris Knibb immediately opened a campaign to run for a seat in the House, becoming the first woman to contest a general election in Jamaica. Though she didn't win, she was undaunted, becoming one of the first women sworn in as Justice of the Peace in 1945 and continuing to serve as a councilwoman through the early 1950s. In 1953, she was honored with the Order of the British Empire for her years of social service. Throughout the 1950s, she continued her work with the Moravian Church and served several terms as the vice-chair of the school board.\nMorris Knibb died on 21 September 1964 in Woodford Park, Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica. She donated the building which is used as the headquarters of the Moravian Church, 3 Hector Street, Kingston, Jamaica, to the organization. Generations of students have been educated at the Morris Knibb Preparatory School, including many prominent Jamaicans. In 1984, the school was relocated, from its original location next to the Moravian Church, to Molynes Road in St. Andrew Parish, teaching kindergarten to grade 6. In 2004, as part of the Moravian Church's 250th anniversary, the church worked to have the Postal Corporation of Jamaica issue commemorative stamps of important leaders in their organization. Morris Knibb was one of three honorees recognized in the commemorative stamp series.\n\n"}

Since the establishment of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in 1999 there has been a move to more robust processes, but such decisions always generate controversy. These lists are now decided by clinical commissioning groups in England, but rules differ in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Restrictions on one kind of treatment for a condition may lead to patients getting different, and possibly more expensive treatment. Treatments for back pain, tonsillectomy, in vitro fertilisation, varicose veins and cosmetic surgery commonly appear on these lists.\n\nIn the English National Health Service and NHS Wales the Blacklist (officially Schedule 1 to the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) (Prescription of Drugs etc.) Regulations 2004) is a list published in Part XVIIIA of the NHS Drug Tariff denoting medicines and/or specific brands of medicines that cannot be prescribed on NHS medical prescriptions. If such a prescription is dispensed then NHS Prescription Services will refuse to refund the cost to the dispensing pharmacy. The list was established in 1985. No new items have been added since 2004.\n\nSome brand name medicines on the blacklist can be dispensed against prescriptions for generic drugs (if the approved generic name is not itself included in the blacklist). For example, Calpol can be dispensed for a prescription for paracetamol suspension, but it is generally cheaper to dispense the generic form, and it is at the pharmacy's discretion to do otherwise.\n\nA pharmacist is at liberty to dispense private prescriptions for such items, or to sell over the counter items without a prescription.\n\nFollowing a threat of legal action by the Good Thinking Society campaign group in 2015, the British government has stated that the Department of Health will hold a consultation in 2016 regarding whether homeopathic treatments should be added to the Schedule 1 list.\n\nIn April 2017 it was proposed to restrict the prescription of 3,200 OTC drugs by means of official guidance from NHS England, and to add 18 treatments considered to have 'limited clinical value' – including homeopathy and herbal treatments – to the banned list. The 10 items of low clinical effectiveness:\n\n\n7 items which are clinically effective but not cost-effective:\n\nDr Andrew Green, clinical policy lead on the British Medical Association general practitioners committee objected and demanded that any restricted items should be added to the banned list, so that it was clear that they could not be prescribed. The Royal College of General Practitioners complained that \"imposing blanket policies on GPs, that don’t take into account demographic differences across the country, or that don’t allow for flexibility for a patient’s individual circumstances, risks alienating the most vulnerable in society.\" National Voices said \"The risk is that the NHS would be saying that it will not support poor people to treat their kids’ head lice, or to manage complications such as persistent constipation or the vulnerability of their skin to damaging sunlight.\"\n\nThe final recommendations covering 35 minor, short-term conditions were approved in March 2018, with an exemption for patients where the clinician believes they will struggle to self-manage because of medical, mental health problems or ‘significant social vulnerability’. As this does not change the regulations that govern GP prescribing it is still open to GPs to treat patients according to their individual circumstances and needs, including issuing prescriptions where there are reasons why self-care is inappropriate. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "3072819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3072819", "title": "Owenism", "text": "Owenism\n\nOwenism is the utopian socialist philosophy of 19th-century social reformer Robert Owen and his followers and successors, who are known as Owenites. Owenism aimed for radical reform of society and is considered a forerunner of the cooperative movement. The Owenite movement undertook several experiments in establishment of utopian communities organized according to communitarian and cooperative principles. One of the best known of these efforts, which were largely unsuccessful, was the project at New Harmony, Indiana, which started in 1825 and was abandoned by 1829. Owenism is also closely associated with the development of the British trade union movement, and with the spread of the Mechanics' Institute movement.\n\nOwen’s economic thought grew out of widespread poverty in Britain in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. His thought was rooted in seventeenth century English \"moral economy\" ideals of “fair exchange, just price, and the right to charity.” \"Utopian socialist” economic thought such as Owen’s was a reaction to the laissez-faire impetus of Malthusian Poor Law reform. Claeys notes that \"Owen’s ‘Plan’ began as grandiose but otherwise not exceptionally unusual workhouse scheme to place the unemployed poor in newly built rural communities.\" Owen’s “plan” was itself derivative (and ultimately popularized by) a number of Irish and English trade unionists such as William Thompson and Thomas Hodgskin, co-founder of the London Mechanics Institute. When this poverty led to revolt, as it did in Glasgow in April 1820, a “committee of gentlemen” from the area commissioned the cotton manufacturer and philanthropist, Robert Owen, to produce a “Report to the County of Lanark” in May 1820, which recommended a new form of pauper relief; the cooperative village. Owen's villages thus needed to be compared with the Dickensian \"Houses of Industry\" that were created after the passage of the 1834 Poor Law amendment act. Owen’s report was to spark a widespread “socialist” movement that established co-operatives, labour exchanges, and experimental communities in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. Owen was to disseminate his ideas in North America beginning in 1824. His ideas were most widely received in New York and Philadelphia, where he was greeted by nascent working men’s parties.\n\nOwen was no theoretician, and the Owenite movement drew on a broad range of thinkers such as William Thompson, John Gray, Abram Combe, Robert Dale Owen, George Mudie, John Francis Bray, Dr William King, and Josiah Warren. These men rooted their thought in Ricardian socialism and the labour theory of value.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the early emphasis in Owenism was on the formation of utopian communities, these communities were predicated upon co-operative labour, and frequently, co-operative sales. For example, the Edinburgh Practical Society created by the founders of Orbiston operated a co-operative store to raise the capital for the community. Abram Combe, the leader of that community, was to author the pamphlet \"The Sphere for Joint Stock Companies\" (1825), which made clear that Orbiston was not to be a self-subsistent commune, but a co-operative trading endeavor.\n\nFor the majority of Owenites who did not live in these utopian communities, the working-class Owenite tradition was composed of three overlapping institutions: \"the cooperative store, the labour exchange and the trade union.\"\n\nThe cooperative ideas of Owen and Combe were further developed by the Brighton doctor, William King, publisher of \"The Co-operator.\" Although the paper was only published for two years between 1827–9, it served to unify the movement.\n\nThe next attempt to broaden the cooperative movement was the British Association for the Promotion of Co-operative Knowledge (B.A.P.C.K.) founded in 1829. It was the successor to the London Cooperative Society, and served as a clearing house of information for Britain's 300 cooperatives. It provided pamphlets, lectures and \"missionaries\" for the movement. It held its quarterly meetings in the London Mechanics Institute, with frequent lectures from William Lovett, and many other radical Owenites who would go on to lead the London Working Men's Association. B.A.P.C.K. rejected joint stock cooperative efforts as \"systems of competition.\" Its aim was the establishment of an agricultural, manufacturing or trading community. They recognized that the success of cooperation depended upon parliamentary reform, and this proved the basis for working with the radical reformers who would go on to create the Chartist movement.\n\nThe National Equitable Labour Exchange was founded in London in 1832 and spread to several English cities, most notably Birmingham, before closing in 1834. Beginning from the Ricardian Socialist view that labour was the source of all value, the exchange issued \"Labour Notes\" similar to banknotes, denominated in hours. John Gray proposed a \"National Chamber of Commerce\" as a central bank issuing a \"labour currency\". A similar time-based currency would be created by an American Owenite, Josiah Warren, who founded the Cincinnati Time Store. A short-lived Labour Exchange was also founded in 1836 in Kingston, Upper Canada.\n\nRobert Owen was resolutely apolitical, and initially pursued a non-class based form of community organization. However, as the focus of the movement shifted from the formation of utopian communities to cooperatives, Owenites became active in labour organization in both the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United Kingdom, Owenites became further involved in electoral reform (now envisioned as part of a broader Reform Movement).\n\nBetween 1829 and 1835, Owenite socialism was politicized through two organizations; the British Association for the Promotion of Co-operative Knowledge, and its successor, the National Union of the Working Classes (founded in 1831, and abandoned in 1835). The aim of B.A.P.C.K. was to promote cooperatives, but its members recognized that political reform was necessary if they were to achieve that end. They thus formed a \"Political Union\" which was the principal form of political activity in the period before the Great Reform Act of 1832. Political Unions organized petitioning campaigns meant to sway parliament. The B.A.P.C.K. leadership thus formed the National Union of the Working Classes (N.U.W.C.) to push for a combination of Owenism and radical democratic political reform.\n\nOwen himself resisted the N.U.W.C.'s political efforts at reform, and by 1833, he was an acknowledged leader of the British trade union movement. In February 1834, he helped form Britain’s first national labour organization, the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union. The organisation began to break up in the summer of 1834 and by November, it had ceased to function.\n\nIt was from this heady mix of working class trade unionism, co-operativism, and political radicalism in the disappointed wake of the 1832 Reform Bill and the 1834 New Poor Law, that a number of prominent Owenite leaders such as William Lovett, John Cleave and Henry Hetherington helped form the London Working Men's Association in 1836. The London Working Men's Association led the Chartist movement demanding universal suffrage. Many have viewed Owenite socialism and Chartism as mutually hostile because of Owen's refusal to engage in politics. However, Chartists and Owenites were “many parts but one body” in this initial stage.\n\nRobert Dale Owen emigrated to the United States in 1825 to help his father run New Harmony, Indiana. After the community dissolved, Robert Dale Owen moved to New York City and became the co-editor of the \"Free Enquirer\", a socialistic and anti-Christian weekly, with Frances Wright, the founder of the Nashoba community, from 1828 to 1832. They also founded a \"Hall of Science\" in New York like those being created by Owenites in the United Kingdom. From this base, Owen and Wright sought to influence the Working Men's Party.\n\nThe Working Men's Party emerged spontaneously out of strike action by journeymen in 1829 who protested having to work more than 10 hours a day. They appointed a Committee of Fifty to discuss organization, and they proposed running a ticket of journeymen in the legislative elections. At the same time, Owen and Wright were continuing their own efforts to organize New York City's working classes. The two groups uneasily merged, and were encouraged by their success in the elections. To support the movement, George Henry Evans began publishing the \"Working Man's Advocate\".\n\nThe new party quickly fell victim to factionalism over several controversial proposals. Owen's controversial contribution was a proposed \"state guardianship plan\" where children would be removed from their homes at the age of two and placed in government run schools, to protect them from the degeneracy of slum life and allow their optimum development through free schooling. By late 1830, the party was effectively dead.\n\nOwenism was introduced to Upper Canada (now Ontario) in 1835 by the Rev. Thaddeus Osgood, a Montreal-based evangelical minister. Osgood returned to London in 1829. Deep in debt, he was unable to return to Canada, and spent the succeeding five years preaching in London’s workhouses and prisons. It was in this working class milieu that Osgood met and debated with Robert Owen. Although attracted by the “home colony” model of poverty relief, Osgood was offended by Owens’ anti-religious rhetoric. Drawing on Owenism, rather than Owen, Osgood proposed to found “Relief Unions” for the poor when he finally returned to Canada in 1835. Through Osgood’s influence, Robert Owens’ ideas were widely debated in Toronto. Osgood’s proposal elicited support from across Upper Canada in early 1836, and petitions for the Relief Union’s incorporation were sent to the Assembly and Legislative Council. Significantly, Osgood’s plan was proposed at the same time as the new Lt. Governor, Sir Francis Bond Head was arriving in Toronto. Bond Head was an Assistant Poor Law Administrator, and intent on imposing workhouses for the poor, not Owenite colonies.\n\nThe Owenite doctrine that character was formed by one's social circumstances would initially appear opposed to phrenology's theory of innate mental endowments, or faculties. However, early phrenologists were open to the belief that these faculties – and their physical manifestations on the surface of the skull – could be developed. Phrenology as a science thus provided a way of diagnosing moral and intellectual strengths and weaknesses, and pointed the way to their correction through repetitive exercise.\n\nLast paragraph of Chapter III in \"The Communist Manifesto\" Marx mentions that ″The Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively, oppose the Chartists and Reformists.\"\n\n\n"}

The IPCO, like the original TFP, supports the Tridentine mass and is critical of the Vatican Council II. The IPCO has promoted civil mobilization campaigns in several cities across Brazil against subjects like abortion and same-sex marriage. It has also spoken against agrarian reform in Brazil, environmentalism, and Pope Francis' positions, including the encyclical \"Laudato si'\".\n\nThe IPCO members include the central core of the historical founders of TFP, and the Chief of the Brazilian imperial family, Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza, and his brother Prince Bertrand of Orléans-Braganza.\n\nThe IPCO exposes his activity and ideology at their official website and at their monthly magazine \"Catolicismo\". The IPCO is associated at international level with all the worldwide TFPs and similar organizations, like the original TFP was before their division.\n\n"}

Proletarian revolutions are generally advocated by socialists, communists and most anarchists.\n\nMarxists believe proletarian revolutions can and will likely happen in all capitalist countries, related to the concept of world revolution.\n\nThe Leninist branch of Marxism argues that a proletarian revolution must be led by a vanguard of \"professional revolutionaries\", men and women who are fully dedicated to the communist cause and who form the nucleus of the communist revolutionary movement. This vanguard is meant to provide leadership and organization to the rest of the working class before and during the revolution, which aims to prevent the government from successfully ending it.\n\nOther Marxists such as Luxemburgists disagree with the Leninist idea of a vanguard and insist that the entire working class—or at least a large part of it—must be deeply involved and equally committed to the socialist or communist cause in order for a proletarian revolution to be successful. To this end, they seek to build mass working class movements with a very large membership.\n\nFinally, there are socialist anarchists and libertarian socialists. Their view is that the revolution must be a bottom-up social revolution which seeks to transform all aspects of society and the individuals which make up the society (see Revolutionary Catalonia). In the words of Alexander Berkman, \"there are revolutions and revolutions. Some revolutions change only the governmental form by putting a new set of rulers in place of the old. These are political revolutions, and as such they often meet with little resistance. But a revolution that aims to abolish the entire system of wage slavery must also do away with the power of one class to oppress another. That is, it is not any more a mere change of rulers, of government, not a political revolution, but one that seeks to alter the whole character of society. That would be a social revolution\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1075853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1075853", "title": "Rebecca Riots", "text": "Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Riots took place between 1839 and 1843 in South and Mid Wales. They were a series of protests undertaken by local farmers and agricultural workers in response to perceived unfair taxation. The rioters, often men dressed as women, took their actions against toll-gates, as they were tangible representations of high taxes and tolls. The riots ceased prior to 1844 due to several factors, including increased troop levels, a desire by the protestors to avoid violence and the appearance of criminal groups using the guise of Rebecca for their own purposes. In 1844 a Parliamentary act to consolidate and amend the laws relating to turnpike trusts in Wales was passed.\n\nIn the late 1830s and early 1840s, the agricultural communities of south Wales were in dire poverty. In 1837 and 1838 the whole country suffered from poor harvests, worse in the south west, where atrocious seasons of rain forced farmers to buy corn at famine prices to feed themselves, their animals and their families, which further eroded what little capital they had. Grain harvests collapsed, but the price of butter between 1837 and 1841, and sheep between 1839 and 1841, was relatively high, and even the low cattle prices of 1839 recovered by 1841. But by 1842 a general fall in prices occurred throughout the agricultural markets that continued into 1843. Cattle prices slumped sharply in 1842, and the blame was placed on the Government, and in particular Robert Peel's tariff measures which eased importation of foreign cattle and meat. In 1842, the harvest was one of the most successful in years, and that, combined with the contraction in demand from the Glamorgan ironworks, led to a slump in corn prices. \nThe farmers' economic position had therefore shifted from that of dire grain harvests with life supported by sheep and butter sales, to one where the price of their corn, when the weather was favourable, was very low. The diminution of the Glamorgan ironworks, coupled with the new tariff, also had an adverse effect on the prices of butter, cheese, pigs, horses, sheep and lean cattle, impacting harshly on the Welsh pastoral farmer.\n\nThe farmers were faced with a drastic reduction in their income, but had no financial relief in similar reductions in their outgoings, mainly rents, tithes, county rates, poor rates and the turnpike tolls. Farm rents stayed mainly static, but the tithes, tolls and poor rates increased. Seeing themselves as victims of 'tyranny and oppression', the farmers and their workers took the law into their own hands to rid themselves of these unjust taxes. The first institutions to be attacked were the hated toll-gates.\n\nIn the early 19th century many toll-gates on the roads in Wales were operated by trusts which were supposed to maintain and improve the roads, funding this from tolls. However, many trusts charged extortionate tolls and diverted the money raised to other uses. Even where this was not done, the toll-gate laws imposed an additional financial burden on poor farming communities. The 'oppression', felt by the farmers, began in the late 1830s, when a group of English toll-renters took over the region's trusts. This group was led by Thomas Bullin, an Englishman, who was hated by those who paid his tolls. The main reason for his dislike was the exacting method of the toll collection and the big toll increases of side-bars. The side-bars were simple toll gates, away from the main trunk roads, placed strategically on by-roads to catch any traffic that had tried to bypass the main toll booths via side lanes. These side-bars increased the cost dramatically of farmers' carting lime to their fields that was needed as fertilizer or to counteract acidity in soil: e.g. it was said that it cost an amount to buy a load of lime in Cardiff docks, and then ten times as much in road tolls to cart it to a farm in the hills inland.\n\nThe first appearance of Rebecca, as the members called themselves, occurred in 1839. Although this precedes the economic events of 1842, the early appearances of Rebecca were sporadic isolated outbursts, with the true body of rioting not beginning until the winter of 1842. Although these early 'uprisings' were few and uncommon, they were the first appearance of mobs dressed in the guise of Rebecca. These gangs became known as \"Merched Beca\" (Welsh for \"Rebecca's Daughters\") or merely the \"Rebeccas\". The origin of their name is said to be a verse in the Bible, Genesis 24:60 - 'And they blessed Rebekah and said unto her, Thou \"art\" our sister, be thou \"the mother\" of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them'. This verse was shouted many a time from the religious urban dwellers.\n\nPrior to destroying the toll gates, 'Rebecca' would call to his followers who were also dressed as women and perform a scene which involved the following words:\n\nThis would then in turn lead to the destruction of the toll gates.\n\nAlthough not all members of the mob would wear women's clothes, those that did, often in white gowns, would also blacken their faces or otherwise wear masks. The attacks were accompanied by much noise; and in the earliest attacks, a mock trial would also take place.\n\nThe accepted leader of the first protests, Thomas Rees (Twm Carnabwth), wore women's clothes when leading attacks. Some versions of the story say that these clothes were borrowed from a woman called Rebecca living near his home at the foot of the Preseli Hills. The story states that this woman was an old maid and her clothes were borrowed because she was the only woman tall enough and large enough in the village. Local records do not bear this out—and the wearing of women's clothes was an established part of traditional Welsh justice (the \"Ceffyl Pren\", wooden horse), of which Twm Carnabwth is remembered as a notoriously enthusiastic participant.\n\nThe \"Ceffyl Pren\" bears many similarities to the Rebeccas, with men wearing female clothing, blackening their faces and conducting mock trials; and was on a significant increase in the late 1830s in Wales. The \"Ceffyl Pren\" was a way of frightening and punishing members of a community, of whom wrongdoing was suspected, but little will or evidence existed to bring the person to justice. Normally 'crimes' punished by the \"Ceffyl Pren\" included marital infidelity or informing on a neighbour. Other examples of rebels cross-dressing, destroying toll booths, and adopting shared pseudonyms can be found in British history going back at least as far as the Western Rising.\n\nThe Rebecca Riots are often mistaken as a response solely against the toll gates, ignoring the other factors affecting the Welsh farming communities of the time. The main reason for the choice of toll gates as targets for Rebecca, was that the booths and gates were tangible representations of the system they so despised. The only other options for the rioters would be the union workhouses, as the Poor Law was as hated as the toll roads; but these could be easily defended and were often garrisoned by troops.\n\nThe first protests led by \"Rebecca\" destroyed the toll-gates at Yr Efail Wen in two attacks in Carmarthenshire in 1839. These were believed to be led by Twm, though he did not appear to participate in further riots when the attacks flared again three years later. Other communities later adopted the name and disguise, and other grievances besides the toll gates were aired in the riots. Anglican clergymen from the established Church of England (now the disestablished Church in Wales) were targets on several occasions. The Church of England could demand tithes and other ecclesiastical benefits even though most of the population of Wales were Nonconformists. Other victims were petty local villains such as the fathers of illegitimate children.\n\nThe next time the Rebeccas assembled was roughly three years later, when Tom Bullin was allowed to raise a tollgate by the Mermaid Tavern near St Clears. This was an obvious 'trap' side-bar, and angered the locals, who destroyed it and two other gates. Other tollgates to be target included the Bolgoed tollgate on the outskirts of Pontarddulais. On 6 July 1843 the Bolgoed tollgate was attacked and destroyed by a group of some 200 men. In mid-July 1843, letters were sent from representatives of the Rebeccas, targeting the landlords of farmers. These threatening letters warned the landlords to make reductions in the rent of their tenant farmers. The summer of 1843 also saw farmers conducting open meetings demanding a lowering of rent by at least a third. The threats came to little and the meetings had no effect, and the rents remained the same, though by August farmers had changed tactics to calling for an independent assessment of the regulations of rents.\n\nThe riots caused at least one fatality, in the small village of Hendy on 7 September 1843, in which a young woman and gate keeper named Sarah Williams died. She had been warned beforehand that the rioters were on their way but refused to leave. On the night of her death she could be heard shouting \"I know who you are\" by a family living up the road who had locked their doors from the rioters. Williams called for help at the house of John Thomas, a labourer, to extinguish a fire at the toll gate, but when she returned to the toll house, a shot was heard. Williams returned to the house of John Thomas, and collapsed at the threshold of the house. Two minutes later she was dead.\n\nFrom August 1843, local and open protest meetings were taking the place of riots. Partly due to the farmers scaling back on violent activity, and also due to the increasing presence of troop numbers. Another major factor that saw the riots reduce were the activities of a group of petty criminals masquerading as Rebecca operating from Five Roads near Llanelli. This group, led by known trouble-maker John Jones (Shoni Sguborfawr) and his associate David Davies (Dai'r Cantwr), who were eventually convicted and transported to Australia, turned more respectable people away from Rebecca. Jones, unlike Davies, was not convicted of crimes during the riots, but for a later assault charge.\n\nBy late 1843, the riots had stopped. Although Rebecca had failed to produce an immediate effect on the lives of the farmers she had sought to serve, the very nature of a leaderless uprising of the downtrodden peasantry in an attempt to obtain justice from an unfair system, was an important socio-political event within Wales. In the aftermath of the riots, some rent reductions were achieved, the toll rates were improved (although destroyed toll-houses were rebuilt) and the protests prompted several reforms, including a Royal Commission into the question of toll roads, which led to the Turnpikes, South Wales Act 1844. This Act consolidated the trusts, simplified the rates and reduced the hated toll on lime movement by half. More importantly, the riots inspired later Welsh protests. These included opposition to the privatisation of salmon reserves on the River Wye in the 1860s and 70s, which became known as 'the second Rebecca riots', and the formation in the 1970s of the radical arts collective known as the BECA group. \n\nAs late as December 1910, the historic horn used to gather the Rebeccaites was sounded during the General Election campaign to signify the arrival of the car carrying Liberal candidate John Hinds for a meeting at Bethania Chapel, Talog.\n\nThe Rebecca Riots were the setting for the novel \"Hosts of Rebecca\" by Alexander Cordell.\n\nOne of the earliest novels about the Rebecca Riots was written by Welsh author Amy Dillwyn, who wrote \"The Rebecca Rioter\", first published in 1880. \nA more recent novel is \"Children of Rebecca\" by Vivien Annis Bailey, published by Honno (press) in 1995.\n\nIn 1948 Dylan Thomas wrote the screenplay for a film, \"Rebecca's Daughters\", which was published as a novel of the same name in 1965. The film was not released until 1992, and starred Peter O'Toole, Paul Rhys and Joely Richardson. The 44 years between the writing of the screenplay and the release of the film is the longest on record.\n\nThe name Rebecca is also mentioned in the context of the Merthyr Rising of 1831 in the song \"Ironmasters\" by the British folkpunk band The Men They Couldn't Hang on their album \"Night of a Thousand Candles\".\n\nThe phrase \"The Rebeccas ride at dawn, petticoat ghost and Tom. Working to reclaim the land for no reward\" is found in the song \"Newtown Jericho\" from rock band The Alarm.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "231156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231156", "title": "Richard Pryor", "text": "Richard Pryor\n\nRichard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor (December 1, 1940 – December 10, 2005) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, and social critic. Pryor was known for uncompromising examinations of racism and topical contemporary issues, which employed vulgarities and profanity, as well as racial epithets. He reached a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential stand-up comedians of all time.\n\nPryor's body of work includes the concert movies and recordings: \"Richard Pryor: Live & Smokin'\" (1971), \"That Nigger's Crazy\" (1974), \"...Is It Something I Said?\" (1975), \"Bicentennial Nigger\" (1976), \"\" (1979), \"\" (1982), and \"\" (1983). As an actor, he starred mainly in comedies such as \"Silver Streak\" (1976), but occasionally in dramas, such as Paul Schrader's \"Blue Collar\" (1978), or action films, such as \"Superman III\" (1983). He collaborated on many projects with actor Gene Wilder. Another frequent collaborator was actor/comedian/writer Paul Mooney.\n\nPryor won an Emmy Award (1973) and five Grammy Awards (1974, 1975, 1976, 1981, and 1982). In 1974, he also won two American Academy of Humor awards and the Writers Guild of America Award. The first-ever Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor was presented to him in 1998. He was listed at number one on Comedy Central's list of all-time greatest stand-up comedians. In 2017, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him first on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.\n\nBorn on December 1, 1940 in Peoria, Illinois, Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor grew up in the brothel run by his grandmother, Marie Carter, where his alcoholic mother, Gertrude L. (née Thomas), was a prostitute. His father, LeRoy \"Buck Carter\" Pryor (June 7, 1915 – September 27, 1968), was a former boxer and hustler. After Gertrude abandoned him when he was ten, Pryor was raised primarily by Marie, a tall, violent woman who would beat him for any of his eccentricities. Pryor was one of four children raised in his grandmother's brothel. He was sexually abused at age seven, and expelled from school at the age of fourteen. While in Peoria, he became a Freemason at a local lodge.\n\nPryor served in the U.S. Army from 1958 to 1960, but spent virtually the entire stint in an army prison. According to a 1999 profile about Pryor in \"The New Yorker\", Pryor was incarcerated for an incident that occurred while he was stationed in West Germany. Angered that a white soldier was overly amused at the racially charged scenes of Douglas Sirk's film \"Imitation of Life\", Pryor and several other black soldiers beat and stabbed him, although not fatally.\n\nPryor was married seven times to five women:\n\nPryor also had relationships with actresses Pam Grier and Margot Kidder. In 2018, Quincy Jones and Jennifer Lee claimed that Pryor had a sexual relationship with Marlon Brando, and that Pryor was open about his bisexuality with his friends. Pryor's daughter Rain later disputed the claim. In his autobiography, Pryor admitted to having a two-week sexual relationship with a transvestite, which he called \"two weeks of being gay\".\n\nPryor had seven children with six different women:\n\nIn 1963, Pryor moved to New York City and began performing regularly in clubs alongside performers such as Bob Dylan and Woody Allen. On one of his first nights, he opened for singer and pianist Nina Simone at New York's Village Gate. Simone recalls Pryor's bout of performance anxiety:\n\nInspired by Bill Cosby, Pryor began as a middlebrow comic, with material far less controversial than what was to come. Soon, he began appearing regularly on television variety shows, such as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"The Merv Griffin Show\", and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". His popularity led to success as a comic in Las Vegas. The first five tracks on the 2005 compilation CD \"\", recorded in 1966 and 1967, capture Pryor in this period.\n\nIn September 1967, Pryor had what he described in his autobiography \"Pryor Convictions\" (1995) as an \"epiphany\". He walked onto the stage at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas (with Dean Martin in the audience), looked at the sold-out crowd, exclaimed over the microphone, \"What the fuck am I doing here!?\", and walked off the stage. Afterward, Pryor began working profanity into his act, including the word \"nigger\". His first comedy recording, the eponymous 1968 debut release on the Dove/Reprise label, captures this particular period, tracking the evolution of Pryor's routine. Around this time, his parents died—his mother in 1967 and his father in 1968.\n\nIn 1969, Pryor moved to Berkeley, California, where he immersed himself in the counterculture and rubbed elbows with the likes of Huey P. Newton and Ishmael Reed.\n\nIn the 1970s, Pryor wrote for such television shows as \"Sanford and Son\", \"The Flip Wilson Show\", and a 1973 Lily Tomlin special, for which he shared an Emmy Award. During this period, Pryor tried to break into mainstream television. He also appeared in several popular films, including \"Lady Sings the Blues\" (1972), \"The Mack\" (1973), \"Uptown Saturday Night\" (1974), \"Silver Streak\" (1976), \"Car Wash\" (1976), \"Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings\" (1976), \"Which Way Is Up?\" (1977), \"Greased Lightning\" (1977), \"Blue Collar\" (1978), \"The Muppet Movie\" (1979).\n\nPryor signed with the comedy-oriented independent record label Laff Records in 1970, and in 1971 recorded his second album, \"Craps (After Hours)\". Two years later, the relatively unknown comedian appeared in the documentary \"Wattstax\" (1972), wherein he riffed on the tragic-comic absurdities of race relations in Watts and the nation. Not long afterward, Pryor sought a deal with a larger label, and he signed with Stax Records in 1973.\n\nWhen his third, breakthrough album, \"That Nigger's Crazy\" (1974), was released, Laff, which claimed ownership of Pryor's recording rights, almost succeeded in getting an injunction to prevent the album from being sold. Negotiations led to Pryor's release from his Laff contract. In return for this concession, Laff was enabled to release previously unissued material, recorded between 1968 and 1973, at will. \"That Nigger's Crazy\" was a commercial and critical success; it was eventually certified gold by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album at the 1975 Grammy Awards.\n\nDuring the legal battle, Stax briefly closed its doors. At this time, Pryor returned to Reprise/Warner Bros. Records, which re-released \"That Nigger's Crazy\", immediately after \"...Is It Something I Said?\", his first album with his new label. Like \"That Nigger's Crazy\", the album was a hit with both critics and fans; it was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording at the 1976 Grammy Awards.\n\nPryor's release \"Bicentennial Nigger\" (1976) continued his streak of success. It became his third consecutive gold album, and he collected his third consecutive Grammy for Best Comedy Recording for the album in 1977. With every successful album Pryor recorded for Warner (or later, his concert films and his 1980 freebasing accident), Laff quickly published an album of older material to capitalize on Pryor's growing fame—a practice they continued until 1983. The covers of Laff albums tied in thematically with Pryor movies, such as \"Are You Serious?\" for \"Silver Streak\" (1976), \"The Wizard of Comedy\" for his appearance in \"The Wiz\" (1978), and \"Insane\" for \"Stir Crazy\" (1980).\nPryor co-wrote \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974), directed by Mel Brooks and starring Gene Wilder. Pryor was to play the lead role of Bart, but the film's production studio would not insure him, and Mel Brooks chose Cleavon Little, instead. Before his horribly damaging 1980 freebasing incident, Pryor was about to start filming Mel Brooks' \"History of the World, Part I\" (1981), but was replaced at the last minute by Gregory Hines. Pryor was also originally considered for the role of Billy Ray Valentine on \"Trading Places\" (1983), before Eddie Murphy won the part.\n\nIn 1975, Pryor was a guest host on the first season of \"Saturday Night Live\" and the first black person to host the show. Pryor took longtime girlfriend, actress-talk show host Kathrine McKee (sister of Lonette McKee), with him to New York, and she made a brief guest appearance with Pryor on \"SNL\". He participated in the \"word association\" skit with Chevy Chase. He would later do his own variety show,\"The Richard Pryor Show\", which premiered on NBC in 1977. The show was cancelled after only four episodes probably because television audiences did not respond well to his show's controversial subject matter, and Pryor was unwilling to alter his material for network censors. During the short-lived series, he portrayed the first black President of the United States, spoofed the \"Star Wars\" Mos Eisley cantina, took on gun violence, and in another skit, used costumes and visual distortion to appear nude.\n\nIn 1979, at the height of his success, Pryor visited Africa. Upon returning to the United States, Pryor swore he would never use the word \"nigger\" in his stand-up comedy routine again.\n\nLate in the evening of June 9, 1980, during the making of the film \"Stir Crazy\", and after days of freebasing cocaine, Pryor poured 151-proof rum all over himself and lit himself on fire. While ablaze, he ran down Parthenia Street from his Los Angeles home, until being subdued by police. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for second- and third-degree burns covering more than half of his body. Pryor spent six weeks in recovery at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks Hospital. His daughter, Rain, stated that the incident happened as a result of a bout of drug-induced psychosis.\n\nPryor incorporated a description of the incident into his comedy show \"\" (1982). He joked that the event was caused by dunking a cookie into a glass of low-fat and pasteurized milk, causing an explosion. At the end of the bit, he poked fun at people who told jokes about it by waving a lit match and saying, \"What's that? Richard Pryor running down the street.\"\n\nAfter his \"final performance\", Pryor did not stay away from stand-up comedy long. Within a year, he filmed and released a new concert film and accompanying album, \"\" (1983), which he directed himself. He also wrote and directed a fictionalized account of his life, \"Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling\" (1986), which revolved around the 1980 freebasing incident.\n\nIn 1983, Pryor signed a five-year contract with Columbia Pictures for $40 million and he started his own production company, Indigo Productions. Softer, more formulaic films followed, including \"Superman III\" (1983), which earned Pryor $4 million; \"Brewster's Millions\" (1985), \"Moving\" (1988), and \"See No Evil, Hear No Evil\" (1989). The only film project from this period that recalled his rough roots was Pryor's semiautobiographic debut as a writer-director, \"Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling\" (1986), which was not a major success.\n\nDespite a reputation for constantly using profanity on and off camera, Pryor briefly hosted a children's show on CBS called \"Pryor's Place\" (1984). Like \"Sesame Street\", \"Pryor's Place\" featured a cast of puppets, hanging out and having fun in a surprisingly friendly inner-city environment along with several children and characters portrayed by Pryor himself. However, \"Pryor's Place\" frequently dealt with more sobering issues than \"Sesame Street\". It was cancelled shortly after its debut, despite the efforts of famed puppeteers Sid and Marty Krofft and a theme song by Ray Parker, Jr. of \"Ghostbusters\" (1984) fame.\n\nPryor co-hosted the Academy Awards twice and was nominated for an Emmy for a guest role on the television series \"Chicago Hope\". Network censors had warned Pryor about his profanity for the Academy Awards, and after a slip early in the program, a five-second delay was instituted when returning from a commercial break. Pryor is also one of only three \"Saturday Night Live\" hosts to be subjected to a rare five-second delay for his 1975 appearance (along with Sam Kinison in 1986 and Andrew Dice Clay in 1990).\n\nPryor developed a reputation for being demanding and disrespectful on film sets, and for making selfish and difficult requests. In his autobiography \"Kiss Me Like a Stranger\", co-star Gene Wilder says that Pryor was frequently late to the set during filming of \"Stir Crazy\", and that he demanded, among other things, a helicopter to fly him to and from set because he was the star. Pryor was also accused of using allegations of on-set racism to force the hand of film producers into giving him more money:\n\nOne day during our lunch hour in the last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of watermelon to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during \"Stir Crazy\".\n\nHe appeared in \"Harlem Nights\" (1989), a comedy-drama crime film starring three generations of black comedians (Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and Redd Foxx).\n\nIn his later years starting in the early to mid-1990s, Pryor used a power-operated mobility scooter due to multiple sclerosis (MS, which he said stood for \"More Shit\"). He appears on the scooter in his last film appearance, a small role in David Lynch's \"Lost Highway\" (1997) playing an auto-repair garage manager named Arnie.\n\nRhino Records remastered all of Pryor's Reprise and WB albums for inclusion in the box set \"...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings\" (2000).\n\nIn early 2000, Pryor appeared in the cold open of \"The Norm Show\" in the episode entitled \"Norm vs. The Boxer\". He played an elderly man in a wheelchair who lost the rights to in-home nursing when he kept attacking the nurses before attacking Norm himself.\n\nIn 2002, Pryor and his wife/manager, Jennifer Lee Pryor, won legal rights to all the Laff material, which amounted to almost 40 hours of reel-to-reel analog tape. After going through the tapes and getting Richard's blessing, Jennifer Lee Pryor gave Rhino Records access to the tapes in 2004. These tapes, including the entire \"Craps\" album, form the basis of the February 1, 2005, double-CD release \"\".\n\nIn November 1977, after many years of heavy smoking and drinking, Pryor suffered a mild heart attack. He recovered and resumed performing by January the following year. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1986. In 1990, Pryor suffered a second heart attack while in Australia. He underwent triple heart bypass surgery in 1991.\n\nIn late 2004, his sister said he had lost his voice as a result of his multiple sclerosis. However, on January 9, 2005, Pryor's wife, Jennifer Lee, rebutted this statement in a post on Pryor's official website, citing Richard as saying: \"I'm sick of hearing this shit about me not talking... not true... I have good days, bad days... but I still am a talkin' motherfucker!\"\n\nOn December 10, 2005, nine days after his 65th birthday, Pryor suffered a heart attack in Los Angeles. He was taken to a local hospital after his wife's attempts to resuscitate him failed. He was pronounced dead at 7:58 am PST. His widow Jennifer was quoted as saying, \"At the end, there was a smile on his face.\" He was cremated, and his ashes were given to his family. Forensic pathologist Michael Hunter believes Pryor's fatal heart attack was caused by coronary artery disease that was at least partially brought about by years of tobacco smoking.\n\nJerry Seinfeld called Pryor \"the Picasso of our profession\" and Bob Newhart heralded Pryor as \"the seminal comedian of the last 50 years\". Dave Chappelle said of Pryor, \"You know those, like, evolution charts of man? He was the dude walking upright. Richard was the highest evolution of comedy.\" This legacy can be attributed, in part, to the unusual degree of intimacy Pryor brought to bear on his comedy. As Bill Cosby reportedly once said, \"Richard Pryor drew the line between comedy and tragedy as thin as one could possibly paint it.\"\n\nIn 1998, Pryor won the first Mark Twain Prize for American Humor from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. According to former Kennedy Center President Lawrence J. Wilker, Pryor was selected as the first recipient of the Prize because \n\nas a stand-up comic, writer, and actor, he struck a chord, and a nerve, with America, forcing it to look at large social questions of race and the more tragicomic aspects of the human condition. Though uncompromising in his wit, Pryor, like Twain, projects a generosity of spirit that unites us. They were both trenchant social critics who spoke the truth, however outrageous.\nIn 2004, Pryor was voted number one on Comedy Central's list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time. In a 2005 British poll to find \"The Comedian's Comedian\", Pryor was voted the 10th-greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.\n\nPryor was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.\n\nThe animal rights organization PETA gives out an award in Pryor's name to people who have done outstanding work to alleviate animal suffering. Pryor was active in animal rights and was deeply concerned about the plight of elephants in circuses and zoos.\n\nArtist Preston Jackson created a life-sized bronze statue in dedication to the beloved comedian and named it \"Richard Pryor: More than Just a Comedian\". It was placed at the corner of State and Washington Streets in downtown Peoria, on May 1, 2015, close to the neighborhood in which he grew up with his mother. The unveiling was held Sunday, May 3, 2015.\n\nIn 2002, a television documentary entitled \"The Funny Life of Richard Pryor\" depicted Pryor's life and career. Broadcast in the UK as part of the Channel 4 series \"Kings of Black Comedy\", it was produced, directed and narrated by David Upshal and featured rare clips from Pryor's 1960s stand-up appearances and movies such as \"Silver Streak\" (1976), \"Blue Collar\" (1978), \"\" (1978), and \"Stir Crazy\" (1980). Contributors included George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Whoopi Goldberg, Ice-T, Paul Mooney, Joan Rivers, and Lily Tomlin. The show tracked down the two cops who had rescued Pryor from his \"freebasing incident\", former managers, and even school friends from Pryor's home town of Peoria, Illinois. In the US, the show went out as part of the \"Heroes of Black Comedy\" series on Comedy Central, narrated by Don Cheadle.\n\nA television documentary, \"!!\" (2003) consisted of archival footage of Pryor's performances and testimonials from fellow comedians, including Dave Chappelle, Denis Leary, Chris Rock, and Wanda Sykes, on Pryor's influence on comedy.\n\nOn December 19, 2005, BET aired a Pryor special, titled \"The Funniest Man Dead or Alive\". It included commentary from fellow comedians, and insight into his upbringing.\n\nA retrospective of Pryor's film work, concentrating on the 1970s, titled \"A Pryor Engagement\", opened at Brooklyn Academy of Music Cinemas for a two-week run in February 2013. Several prolific comedians who have claimed Pryor as an influence include George Carlin, Dave Attell, Martin Lawrence, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Colin Quinn, Patrice O'Neal, Bill Hicks, Sam Kinison, Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Jerry Seinfeld, Jon Stewart, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Griffin, and Eddie Izzard.\n\nOn May 31, 2013, Showtime debuted the documentary \"\" directed by Emmy Award–winning filmmaker Marina Zenovich. The executive producers are Pryor's widow Jennifer Lee Pryor and Roy Ackerman. Interviewees include Dave Chappelle, Whoopi Goldberg, Jesse Jackson, Quincy Jones, George Lopez, Bob Newhart, Richard Pryor, Jr., Lily Tomlin, and Robin Williams.\n\nFrom June 7 to 9, 2013, SiriusXM hosted \"Richard Pryor Radio\", a three-day tribute which featured his stand-up comedy and full live concerts. \"Richard Pryor Radio\" replaced The Foxxhole for the duration of the event.\n\nIn the episode \"Taxes and Death or Get Him to the Sunset Strip\"(2012), the voice of Richard Pryor is played by Eddie Griffin in the satirical TV show \"Black Dynamite\".\n\nA planned biopic, entitled \"Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said?\", was being produced by Chris Rock and Adam Sandler. The film would have starred Marlon Wayans as the young Pryor. Other actors previously attached include Mike Epps and Eddie Murphy. The film would have been directed by Bill Condon and was still in development with no release date, as of February 2013.\n\nThe biopic remained in limbo, and went through several producers until it was announced in January 2014 that it was being backed by The Weinstein Company with Lee Daniels as director. It was further announced, in August 2014, that the biopic will have Oprah Winfrey as producer and will star Mike Epps as Pryor.\n\nHe is portrayed by Brandon Ford Green in Season 1 Episode 4 \"Sugar and Spice\" of Showtime's \"I'm Dying Up Here\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1990 he was defeated by Paul Wellstone.\n\nBoschwitz was born November 7, 1930 in Berlin, Germany, the son of Lucy (née Dawidowicz) and Eli Boschwitz. In 1933, when he was three years old, his Jewish family fled from Nazi Germany to the United States, settling in New Rochelle, New York, where he grew up. A graduate of The Pennington School, he attended Johns Hopkins University and graduated from the New York University Stern School of Business in 1950 and the New York University School of Law in 1953.\n\nHe was admitted to the New York State bar in 1954 and the Wisconsin bar in 1959.

The party was launched on 15 July 2015 by three independent TDs, Stephen Donnelly, Catherine Murphy, and Róisín Shortall.\n\nThe Social Democrats was established with a co-leadership arrangement between its three founding members. Róisín Shortall is a former Labour Party TD and former Minister of State for Primary Care. She resigned from the role and from Labour in September 2012, citing lack of support and the lack of an explanation from then-Minister for Health James Reilly concerning his controversial decision to locate a new primary care centre in his own constituency. Catherine Murphy was successively a member of the Workers' Party, Democratic Left and the Labour Party before being elected as an independent TD in 2005. She became widely known for her work as a TD in 2014, when she revealed irregularities within the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, a bad bank, in its dealings with businessman Denis O'Brien. Stephen Donnelly first entered politics as an independent TD in the 2011 general election, having previously worked as a consultant for McKinsey and Company. Both Murphy and Donnelly were members of the Technical Group in the 31st Dáil, with Murphy having served as its Chief Whip.\n\nThe party ran fourteen candidates in the 2016 general election, including its three incumbent TDs, former Labour Party Senator James Heffernan, and county councillors Gary Gannon and Cian O'Callaghan.\n\nIn May 2016, the party formed a technical group within the Dáil with the Green Party.\n\nOn 5 September 2016, Stephen Donnelly resigned as joint leader and left the party, stating that he was doing so “with great sadness, having vested so much together with my parliamentary colleagues, Catherine and Roisin, a small core team and many volunteers across the country, into the establishment of the Social Democrats over the last 20 months”, but referring to his relationship with his fellow leaders, that \"some partnerships simply don't work\".

{"id": "24894509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24894509", "title": "Sămănătorul", "text": "Sămănătorul\n\nSămănătorul or Semănătorul (, Romanian for \"The Sower\") was a literary and political magazine published in Romania between 1901 and 1910. Founded by poets Alexandru Vlahuță and George Coșbuc, it is primarily remembered as a tribune for early 20th century traditionalism, neoromanticism and ethnic nationalism. The magazine's ideology, commonly known as \"Sămănătorism\" or \"Semănătorism\", was articulated after 1905, when historian and literary theorist Nicolae Iorga became editor in chief. While its populism, critique of capitalism and emphasis on peasant society separated it from other conservative groups, \"Sămănătorul\" shared views with its main conservative predecessor, the \"Junimea\" society, particularly in expressing reserve toward Westernization. In parallel, its right-wing agenda made it stand in contrast to the Poporanists, a Romanian populist faction whose socialist-inspired ideology also opposed rapid urbanization, but there was a significant overlap in membership between the two groups. \"Sămănătorul\"s relationship with the dominant National Liberal Party was equally ambiguous, ranging from an alliance between \"Sămănătorul\" and National Liberal politician Spiru Haret to Iorga's explicit condemnation of 20th century Romanian liberalism.\n\nPromoting an idealized interpretation of local history, basing its aesthetic ideals on the work of national poet and conservative essayist Mihai Eminescu, the publication advertised itself as the voice of oppressed Romanians in Transylvania and other areas controlled by Austria–Hungary prior to World War I. Its irredentism, as well as its outspoken criticism of the political and cultural establishment, made \"Sămănătorul\" a popular venue for young Romanian intellectuals from both the Kingdom of Romania and the regions surrounding it. The traditionalist literary faction coalescing around the magazine was generally opposed to modernist literature and the aesthetics of modern art, but was more tolerant of Symbolism. In time, \"Sămănătorul\" became host to a subgroup of the local Symbolist movement.\n\nAlthough short-lived, \"Sămănătorul\" was a major influence on later Romanian literature and culture in general. Its legacy stood at the center of cultural debates between traditionalism and modernism lasting throughout the 20th century. While Iorga personally tried to revive it with the magazines \"Drum Drept\" and \"Cuget Clar\", \"Sămănătorism\" was adopted by other traditionalist or agrarian currents, and was a contributing factor to the cultural tenets of local far right and fascist groups. During the interwar period, it also made a significant impact in Bessarabia (a region since divided between Moldova and Ukraine). The \"Sămănătorist\" ideology itself was traditionally criticized for encouraging isolationism and xenophobia, as well as for its flirtation with antisemitism. In literary and art criticism, the term \"Sămănătorist\" acquired pejorative connotations, denoting specific pastoral and patriotic clichés.\n\nThe establishment of \"Sămănătorul\" was linked by researchers to a set of significant events of \"fin de siècle\" European economic history. Spanish historian Francisco Veiga placed the emergence of \"Sămănătorul\" in direct connection to a European-wide evolution of capitalism and related phenomena affecting the middle class: \"In the traumatic circumstances of late 19th and early 20th century imperialist crises [...] and the rejection of urban-industrial society by the petty and medium bourgeoisie threatened by the crisis of capitalism, \"Sămănătorism\" can be identified with those groups of intellectual movements seeking to preserve national identity in front of threats, by resorting to an idealized past.\" Alongside the \"identity crisis\" provoked by \"the traumatic advance of industrial modernization inside a country with a majority peasant and illiterate population\", researcher Paul Cernat discusses the \"decline\" of local boyar aristocracy as issues preparing the ground for \"Sămănătorul\" and like-minded journals. Likewise, Swedish art historian Tom Sandqvist views \"Sămănătorul\"s focus on the peasant community as a source of legitimate culture as connected with economic change and \"emerging industrialization\": \"In the mid-1870s grain prices had declined catastrophically, and it became more and more obvious that the image of the grateful farmer and the 'natural' village community as bearer of true Romanian culture was false and did not correspond very well with a reality characterized by utmost poverty, misery, autocratic boyars, ruthless profiteers, moneylenders, and village gendarmes\". The emergence of \"Sămănătorism\" and Poporanism, Sandqvist notes, happened \"in spite of this—or rather because of it\", since both still proclaimed \"the special character of Romanian culture as deriving from the traditional village community.\" Researcher Rodica Lascu-Pop presents a similar perspective, discussing \"Sămănătorism\" as \"an echo of mutations occurring in society at the beginning of the century: the acute crisis of the peasant issue [...], the social gap between the urban and rural environments.\"\n\nThe historical moment represented by \"Sămănătorism\" has also been linked by historians with various tendencies in Western culture. Its rejection of industrial society was thus seen as equivalent to the sentiments expressed in the poems of Robert Frost in the United States or Francis Jammes in France. Comparatists John Neubauer and Marcel Cornis-Pope described the magazine as part of the larger phenomenon of \"populism and agrarian nationalism\" in East-Central Europe, together with Poland's \"Głos\" magazine and Slovakia's \"Naturizmu\" current, with the ideologies of Hungary's Dezső Szabó or the \"Népi írók\", \"Válasz\" or \"Kelet Népe\" groups, as well as with the political program of Estonia's Jaan Tõnisson. Commentators have also found specific similarities between \"Sămănătorul\" and various cultural or political movements in Poland, from the Galician intellectuals' interest in the local peasantry during the late 19th century (\"Chłopomania\") to the ideology of Roman Dmowski's National Democracy. Literary critic Mircea Anghelescu also places the \"Sămănătorist\" movement's beginnings in conjunction with intellectual fashions prevalent in Romanian culture during the national revival and before World War I: the patriotic travel literature of Vasile Alecsandri, Grigore Alexandrescu and George Melidon; the Neo-Brâncovenesc style in Romanian architecture; and the rediscovery of national Romanian costume by Romanian Queen Elisabeth (Carmen Sylva). His colleague Valeriu Râpeanu contrasts the initial rise of \"Sămănătorism\" with the moment of \"crisis\" experienced in Romanian letters, at a time when a generation of major writers—Ion Luca Caragiale, Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, Alexandru Vlahuță etc.—were approaching the end of their careers.\n\nIn large measure, the propagation of \"Sămănătorist\" ideas was also helped along by the sentiment that the conservative establishment had abandoned the cause of Romanians living in Transylvania, Bukovina and other regions controlled by Austria–Hungary (particularly those who, the new intellectual leaders cautioned, were threatened by Magyarization policies). The group's protest against the political class' perceived lack of patriotism was joined with what Veiga defines as \"an offshoot of renewed Romanian agitation in Transylvania\". In parallel, Veiga notes, the group was also reacting against \"an opportunistic international policy\" and the penetration of foreign capital on the Kingdom's markets. At the time, however, the National Liberals were reluctantly committed to supporting King Carol I's alliance with the Central Powers, and, through it, with Austria–Hungary. According to literary historian Z. Ornea, the will to demonstrate \"the unity of the Romanian population in matters of specific spiritual life\" formed one of the characteristics of \"Sămănătorism\".\n\nPublished in the capital Bucharest, \"Sămănătorul\" was co-founded by two already established writers, Alexandru Vlahuță, from the \"Old Kingdom\", and the Transylvanian-born George Coșbuc, in late 1901. Both of them were already known as editors of magazines with traditionalist agendas: Vlahuţă had founded and edited the magazine \"Vieața\", while Coșbuc had done the same with \"Vatra\". Among the original staff of writers were several formerly associated with \"Vieața\": Ștefan Octavian Iosif, Dimitrie Anghel, Ion Gorun, Constanța Hodoș and Vasile Pop. The regular contributors included Ion Agârbiceanu, I. A. Bassarabescu, Panait Cerna, Elena Farago, Emil Gârleanu, Octavian Goga, Constantin Sandu-Aldea, Ioan Slavici and I. E. Torouțiu. Other notable collaborators throughout the early years were Zaharia Bârsan, Paul Bujor, Ilarie Chendi, Virgil Cioflec, Alexandru Davila, Sextil Pușcariu and Constantin Xeni, alongside the lesser known Ion Ciocârlan and Maria Cunțan.\n\nThe new publication received support and funds from Spiru Haret, the National Liberal Education Minister, who saw in it an opportunity for improving the lifestyle of peasants, for raising the interest of intellectuals nationwide, and for endorsing planned changes to the state-sponsored education system. It is sometimes described as a successor to \"Semănătorul\", a magazine published in Bârlad during the 1870s, and to a similarly titled magazine published in Galaţi during 1899. In the years after it was set up, \"Sămănătorul\" inspired the creation of like-minded smaller journals published in provincial cities, from Craiova's \"Ramuri\" to Bârlad's \"Făt Frumos\". Its doctrine was largely replicated in Transylvania by the publication \"Luceafărul\", founded in 1902 by Goga and his fellow activists Alexandru Ciura and Octavian Tăslăuanu.\n\nThe new magazine's first-ever issue carried the date of December 2, 1901. Printed in cooperation with Editura Minerva publishing company, it was financed and owned by Iosif, who also worked on the editorial staff. The editorial office itself was located at Regală Street, No. 6, near Calea Victoriei (on present-day Ion Câmpineanu Street) and in the same building as Minerva's printing presses. The editorial piece introducing the first-ever issue, written by the two main editors but left unsigned, carried the title \"Primele vorbe\" (\"The First Words\"), and expressed concern over the lack of positive messages in Romanian literature. This overview was completed in the second issue by Coșbuc's piece, \"Uniți\" (\"United\"), which condemned what he called \"imported\" and \"sick\" literature.\n\nThe paper frequently alternated the spellings of its name over the following years: founded as \"Sămănătorul\", it became \"Semănătorul\" from 1901 to 1902, returned to the original spelling until 1909, and changed back to the \"e\" spelling in its final year. The two were literal synonyms for \"the sower\", but their metaphorical meaning was more complex. Historian Irina Livezeanu wrote: \"The Romanian word and concept is not easy to translate. It derives from the verb \"a semăna\" or to sow, or plant (seeds), and suggests that literature should be fundamentally rural and agrarian, concerning itself with the life and customs of the 90 percent of the Romanian population who were indeed peasants or 'sowers'.\" The term also refers to the dispersion of ideas among the general public, in line with Haret's own agenda. Literary historian George Călinescu connects the programs of \"Vieața\" (whose name, an antiquated spelling for \"viața\", means \"the life\") and its successor by commenting on their titles: \"[\"Sămănătorul\"] was supposed to deal with 'life' and 'plant' ideas into the masses.\" He also notes that the notion had been highlighted by Vlahuţă in one of his poems, also titled \"Sămănătorul\":\nThe finality of this program was seen by Râpeanu as comprised by the poem's final part, which reads:\n\nIn 1903, \"Sămănătorul\" was joined by Mihail Sadoveanu, the future novelist, who was described by critic Tudor Vianu as the group's greatest asset. It was also that year when Nicolae Iorga began publishing his first articles for the paper. In Sanqvist's definition, Iorga, \"one of the most representatives of Romanian ethno-nationalism beside the philosopher and poet Lucian Blaga\", was the publication's \"most important contributor\", while Neubauer and Cornis-Pope refer to him as \"the most powerful and original thinker of the [East-Central European] region.\" By 1904, Sadoveanu had achieved national fame with his debut volumes, published simultaneously by Minerva and praised by Iorga in his chronicles for the magazine (one of which proclaimed 1904 \"the Sadoveanu year\"). In parallel, Iorga's slowly introduced his own tenets, beginning with a May 1903 article titled \"O nouă epocă de cultură\" (\"A New Cultural Epoch\"), which called for setting up a national culture beyond social class distinctions, and referred to the \"wicked monkey business\" and spiritual \"corruption\" arriving from the Western world. He later took charge of a permanent \"Sămănătorul\" column, carrying the title \"Cronică\" (\"Chronicle\").\n\nIorga's other contributions were polemical pieces, targeting various of his colleagues who opposed what he defined as a new direction in historiography (\"școala critică\", \"the critical school\"): Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Grigore Tocilescu, V. A. Urechia and A. D. Xenopol among them. One such piece read: \"With all my powers, I follow a cultural and moral ideal for my country, and whoever shall stand in the way of this, my life's most cherished goal, is my enemy, an enemy I will never spare no matter what, however unpleasant or painful this may prove, no matter what troubles I may encounter as a result.\" His position received endorsement from another \"Sămănătorul\" contributor, literary chronicler Ilarie Chendi, who alleged that, since Romanian literature was facing \"spiritual decadence\", the main exponents of a moral consciousness were historians of the new directions (a reference to Iorga, Ion Bogdan and Dimitrie Onciul).\n\nIorga's criticism of his older peers often focused on topical and personal issues, such as when he argued that Xenopol was a poor judge of literary value, who had promoted mediocre writers (from Xenopol's own wife Cornelia \"Riria\" Gatovschi to Victor Vojen). Elsewhere in his articles for the magazine, he called Tocilescu \"a scholar of the least substantial species and a critic whose norm is the personal gain\". In 1904, also involved in the polemic was Ion Găvănescul. Originally acknowledged by Iorga as a figure of importance on the academic scene, Găvănescul was referred to as \"a scoundrel and a coward\" in one of his new articles for \"Sămănătorul\". Another such piece criticized researcher George Ionescu-Gion, whose published work on the history of Bucharest was judged inconsistent and poorly structured by Iorga (arguments he retracted decades later). In tandem, his articles for the magazine defended linguist Sextil Puşcariu, who had sided with his colleague's methods but was being himself exposed to criticism from \"Luceafărul\". In 1905, Iorga also used \"Sămănătorul\" to express some regret for the tension reached during the conflict between his generation and the older Hasdeu or Xenopol: \"It was also the fault of the young men, all of us being too keen on advertising and enriching ourselves, at the expense of old men who had not been much focused on consuming, and were far from being satisfied.\"\n\nIn 1905, editorial leadership over \"Sămănătorul\" was assumed by Iorga. This moment, Veiga argues, signified a change in policies and appeal: \"\"Sămănătorul\" only managed to acquire have its own force when it progressively transformed itself into a catalyst for a whole series of young discontent intellectuals\". Integrated within such changes of discourse, Veiga writes, were Iorga's \"fickle\" opinions, which had turned into suspicions that the National Liberal Party was endorsing clientelism and a \"camarilla\" regime. Despite its growth in influence, the publication had a modest circulation by Romanian standards, reportedly publishing no more than 300 copies per issue. George Călinescu, who indicates that Iorga was trying to link the venue with \"a clearer program\" and \"his own direction\", assesses that such goals failed to introduce a fundamentally new approach, and contends that the magazine continued to maintain a \"secondary role\" when compared other platforms of its kind.\n\nIorga's form of campaigning produced significant results in March 1906, when, incited by the Bucharest National Theater's decision to host a performance in French (instead of translating the play into Romanian), he organized a boycott and mass student rallies which degenerated into street battles. Later in 1906, Iorga had ended his association with the magazine. On October 22 of that year, \"Sămănătorul\" announced that the split occurred in amiable terms: \"Mr. N. Ioga [...] announces us that his many duties prevent him from carrying on as the magazine's [editorial] director, but that he wishes us best of luck and wants us to triumph\". However, according to one account, he had decided to leave after his editorial policy had made him the target of criticism in other magazines.\n\nIorga went on to publish a new journal, \"Neamul Românesc\", and created, together with the Iași-based agitator A. C. Cuza, the Democratic Nationalist Party, which stood for a similar agenda but added explicitly antisemitic content targeting the Jewish Romanian community. That same year, a left-wing dissident group, comprising Sadoveanu, parted with \"Sămănătorul\" to affiliate with \"Viața Românească\" journal, newly founded by the Poporanists Constantin Stere and Garabet Ibrăileanu. A third dissident wing emerged at the same stage: Chendi, Iorga's former associate, left the circle in 1906 to create the rival periodical \"Viața Literară\" (set up and disestablished in 1907). According to Cernat, \"Sămănătorul\" itself experienced \"reactionary ideologization\" following the breakups.\n\nThe paper steadily declined over the following four years. This phenomenon is described by Râpeanu as owed to a loss of direction: \"[\"Sămănătorul\"] no longer enjoyed the same impact, no longer sparked the interest or the polemics of 1903–1906. It brought nothing new to the landscape of Romanian literature. One could say that, in parting with \"Sămănătorul\", N. Iorga took its soul with him.\" Among the last major issues affecting the journal's history was the peasants' revolt of 1907, which aired the social tensions of the Kingdom and was met with violence by the National Liberal cabinet of Dimitrie Sturdza. According to Sandqvist, traditionalist perspectives \"clashed badly with reality\" during the events, leading \"almost immediately to a regressive approach among many intellectuals [...] who had previously encouraged and endorsed Romania's turn to the West\".\n\nA dominant portion of \"Sămănătorul\"s outlook sought to define and preserve the notion of Romanian specificity through the lens of Romantic nationalism. This vision, Veiga notes, was \"the first systematic attempt\" of its kind in Romania, and implied recourse to \"intellectual myths.\" Attached to the portrayal of peasants as models of excellence was Iorga's own scholarly perspective on Romanian history and the origin of the Romanians. By that moment in his career, Iorga had come to construct a theory according to which Romanian peasants living in the Early and High Middle Ages had organized themselves into communal republics ruled by representative democracy, and was arguing that the Romanian state itself had grown organically around an unattested uncodified constitution. This went in tandem with his suggestion that there was an ancient solidarity between the traditional social classes of free peasants and boyars. Veiga, who views this concept as a major component of \"Sămănătorism\", interprets it as the \"model of \"Volksgemeinschaft\"—real or fictitious\". In order to recover that cohesion, the historian was proposing a specific set of institutions, from political bodies representing the villages (\"obști\") to credit unions working for the benefit of peasants.\n\nA figure who inspired much of \"Sămănătorul\"s outlook was the deceased national poet and cultural critic Mihai Eminescu, who, as both a conservative and nationalist, had been a maverick member of the \"Junimea\" literary club. Researcher Ioana Both describes the \"reactionary\" circle formed around the magazine as a main source for the \"cult of Eminescu\", as well as for some of the earliest Eminescu anthologies. In a 1903 article for the magazine, Iorga welcomed the publication of his posthumous writings as the revelation of a \"new Eminescu\", or \"a complete man\" opposed to the modern times which had \"shattered\" mankind. The same author deemed Eminescu's activism an \"Annunciation\" for the new ideology of a \"healthy race\". According to Iorga's rival, cultural historian and classical liberal thinker Eugen Lovinescu, the historian shared in particular the \"reactionary\" attitudes of Eminescu: a \"hatred\" of the bourgeoisie who endorsed Romanian liberalism, support for \"protectionism\" and the nostalgia for \"patriarchal life\".\n\nAnother main element of \"Sămănătorul\"s preoccupations was didacticism, twinned with calls for education reform: the magazine urged the education system to actively and primarily dedicate itself to the cause of peasants. This closely followed the National Liberal agenda, which had facilitated innovation in the field after 1898, and was in tune with the wide-ranging reforms pushed by Spiru Haret. In Veiga's account, the interest in educating the lower classes was partly owed to European precedents: the Jules Ferry laws in France and the \"Realschule\" system in the German Empire, as well as the efforts of Romanian Transylvanian teachers to compete with the officially-endorsed Hungarian-language institutions of learning. In parallel, the policy reflected Iorga's belief that spreading awareness of Romanian culture would cement the unity of Romanians on either side of the Carpathian Mountains. According to historian and comparatist Ștefan Borbély, an additional reflection of the group's educational theory was its encouragement of a \"public fantasy\" by depicting children as \"nasty\" human beings who need to be kept in tight check.\n\nThe rejection of cosmopolitanism by \"Sămănătorul\" implied the recourse to arguments that many cultural historians have described as samples of \"xenophobia\". Historian of ideas Lucian Boia discusses \"Sămănătorism\" among the earliest nationalist currents which promoted isolationism and promoting the Romanians' \"own specific genius\", rather than trying to remedy Romanian marginality on the world stage by accepting Westernization. He paraphrases this view as: \"[Romanians] are not Western and nor should they try to become Western.\" Cultural historian Lucian Nastasă refers to \"Sămănătorul\"s attitudes as an attempt to impose \"defensive \" on Western ideas, and \"a sort of spiritual autarky\". In criticizing the \"old school\" of historians, Nastasă notes, Iorga was in large part reacting against historians who did not value ethnocentrism in history, as well as airing professional and personal grievances.\n\nThe 1906 campaign against cultural Francophilia was nevertheless explained by Iorga himself not as hostility toward French culture, but mainly as a belief that Romania needed to emancipate itself from foreign influence. Iorga had maintained a poor impression of Parisian society (in particular its Latin Quarter) from the early 1890s, when he had first visited the city. His claim, echoing the sentiments expressed decades earlier by Eminescu, was that France's influence stood for two distinct models: a negative one, of \"coffeehouses and taverns\" which had wrongly been perceived as factors of civilization by \"our youth\"; and a positive one, represented by \"the French literary and scientific societies\", and supported by \"the sacred family of French bourgeoisie, which is the nation's foundation.\" He also claimed that the upper class' preference for French was tantamount to a loss of national character, \"the history of a ruling class' decline and a people's straying away from the natural path indicated by its past and leading into its future.\" Some of these views were echoed by other key affiliates of \"Sămănătorul\", such as Coșbuc (who believed that the commonplace use of foreign languages among the cultivated was expanding the gap between the elite and the mass of the people). Primarily focused on condemning the perceived pessimism of other currents, \"Primele vorbe\" editorial also stated the goal of doing away with the \"mockery\" and \"sullying\" of Romanian language by \"those who scatter empty phrases\".\n\nThe attack on foreign influence was nevertheless limited, being contained by the ambiguous stances of its leaders. According to Valeriu Râpeanu: \"There was talk of [Iorga's] opacity and the fight against translations and literature in general. N. Iorga was nevertheless demanding [...] the expansion of the translated works area to all sets of European literature: German, English, Italian, Russian, Nordic.\" Boia also notes that Iorga was not an isolationist, having already pioneered research into Romania's traditional links with the Eastern European sphere.\n\nIorga's contributions for \"Sămănătorul\" occasionally stood as manifestations of his antisemitism, as was the case with a November 1904 article. The text was structured around the allegation that Iași city had been taken over by the non-emancipated Jews and the policies of Zionism: \"Iaşi is three-quarter Jewish. They own its wealth, its life, its activity. The flame of Zionism was lit and burns more brightly over there. We [Romanians] only have two things in Iaşi: the school and the church. And the King of Romania arrives into [the city] persecuted by the filthy business-minded existence of another nation. Through his acts and his deeds, our past and present are again inextricably linked in opposition to the pagan and hostile alien. For no matter how long the polluted wave of the gain-seeking ones shall be sweeping over us, the land is ours. And the wind shall at once take with it the chaff it brought upon us, and we shall endure.\"\n\nA leading presence among the political theorists contributing to \"Sămănătorul\" was the Transylvanian Aurel Popovici. Political scientist and literary critic Ioan Stanomir notes a paradox in the synthesis of platforms endorsed by Popovici: a proponent of federalization in Austria–Hungary rather than an advocate of the irredentist cause (inventor of the \"United States of Greater Austria\" concept), but a conservative voice in line with those of his \"Sămănătorul\" colleagues, the intellectual leader was also a vocal supporter of scientific racism and racial antisemitism. Popovici's essay \"Naționalism sau democrație\" (\"Nationalism or Democracy\"), serialized by \"Sămănătorul\" from 1909 to 1910, outlined its author's growing admiration for authoritarianism. While the conservative tone was preserved by references to the 18th century theorist Edmund Burke and by an outspoken critique of social contract philosophy, \"Naționalism sau democrație\" mirrored other theories about the organic, popular, nature of Romanian statehood, and borrowed from the racial theories of Eminescu, Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. The approach, Stanomir writes, was \"counterfactual\". The essay also depicted Jews in general as anti-Romanian, profiteering and manipulative, while claiming that they exercised their power by controlling the Cisleithanian and Romanian press (\"Neue Freie Presse\", \"Neues Wiener Tagblatt\", \"Adevărul\", \"Dimineața\"). Its title alluded to its central theme, which is Popovici's belief that democracy was an enemy of national identity (coupled with his claim that Romania had an opportunity to choose between the two systems).\n\nWhile \"Sămănătorul\" had emerged from a partnership with the National Liberals, Iorga's background made him close to Romania's traditionalist conservatism, represented at the time by the \"Junimea\" and the Conservative Party (the National Liberal's competitor within the Kingdom's two-party system). The main point of contention between him and the other groups was irredentist policy: like Nicolae Filipescu and other dissenting Conservative, Iorga objected to the political current's inclination toward preserving the \"status quo\" on the Transylvanian issue. Discussing this ideological transition, Ioan Stanomir noted: \"The hybridization [of Iorga's discourse] allows for the integration of a nationalist and populist seam.\"\n\nIn addition to referencing the \"Junimist\" Eminescu, the arguments put forth by Iorga owed much to the \"Junimea\" doyen and Conservative Party politician Titu Maiorescu. Like Maiorescu, Eminescu and Iorga both cautioned against the National Liberal version of modernization and Westernization, which they viewed as too imitative and fast-pace to be naturally absorbed by Romanian society (\"forms without substance\"). However, Stanomir notes, the newer discourse, with its references to a supposedly ancient legislation and radical criticism of the 1866 Constitution, was a radical break with the \"Junimea\" worldview: \"The distance between Iorga's critique and the \"Junimist\" hypothesis is obvious and can be identified in the weight that national tradition is assigned with the ideological discourse. At no moment in its evolution did \"Junimism\", as an ideal form of conservative liberalism, intend to correlate constitutional deconstruction with the praise of an ancient constitution that would have preceded modernity. The fundamental flaw of the 1866 Constitution [in \"Junimea\"s opinion] was most of all its inadequacy, and this inadequacy could be gradually corrected by stimulating a bourgeois environment and by increasing the constitutional norm's very efficiency.\" Overall, Stanomir proposes, \"Sămănătorism\" stood for a break with \"Junimist\" \"Victorianism\" by the \"imposition of a Romantic paradigm\", a process in which \"the stem of 'reactionarism' [produced] a form of heterodox conservatism\".\n\nWhile Maiorescu and his circle of followers generally upheld the values of art for art's sake and neoclassicism in front of didacticism, there was a measure of overlap with traditionalist currents in Maiorescu's theories about the inspirational value of Romanian folklore, as well as in his endorsement of the \"poporan\" (\"people's\") and realist literature illustrated by the work of \"Junimists\" such as Ion Creangă or Ioan Slavici. There followed numerous rapprochements, made possible by the measure to which \"Junimism\" was opening itself to traditionalism and nationalism shortly after 1900. \"Sămănătorul\"s existence coincided with a final transition in \"Junimist\" ideology, during which the club's magazine, \"Convorbiri Literare\", came to be led by scientist Simion Mehedinţi, who adopted an agenda closer to that of nationalist groups. According to Z. Ornea, the aged founder of \"Junimea\" had, for reasons unknown, chosen not to enter a fight with a didacticist current he would have otherwise been likely to reject. Before Maiorescu's retirement, Mehedinţi had even contributed to Iorga's journal and, Ornea notes, remained \"a \"Sămănătorist\" of strict observance who only lacked the gifts of an apostle.\" In highlighting the closeness between \"Convorbiri Literare\" and the traditionalist venue, George Călinescu also notes that they shared contributors between them, citing the cases of short story writers I. A. Bassarabescu and Nicolae Gane.\n\nThese developments had as their side effect a schism within \"Junimea\" itself, provoked when Maiorescu's disciple Mihail Dragomirescu created his own magazine, \"Convorbiri Critice\". Opposed to \"Convorbiri Literare\", the new publication sought to reinstate and closely follow Maiorescu's early theories, seeking to extend their application into the 20th century. However, Dragomirescu's own ideological approach was also relatively close to that of \"Sămănătorul\", accepting some of its nationalist and didacticist guidelines. \"Convorbiri Critice\" therefore became the center of a club comprising various authors formerly affiliated with either \"Sămănătorul\" or \"Făt Frumos\". Another isolated \"Junimist\" to resist \"Sămănătorist\" literature was novelist Duiliu Zamfirescu, who spoke out against the views on peasantry promoted by current, as well as against Maiorescu's views on \"poporan\" works, and who promoted his own form of conservatism. Reviewing these choices, Ornea argued that there were still essential links between Zamfirescu's views and those of his \"Sămănătorist\" adversaries.\n\nOn the left-wing of the political spectrum, the \"Sămănătorists\" met the advocates of socialism, who had survived the fall of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party. Although the two currents disagreed over central issues, they also held a set of common beliefs, particularly in matters of literary theory. While he had entered a polemic with \"Vieața\", the leading socialist figure and literary critic Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea admired (and probably inspired) Vlahuţă's branch of didacticism, preferring it to early \"Junimism\". According to Călinescu, the entire \"Sămănătorist\" movement was a mutation of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's ideology, which \"subordinated art to a social goal\": \"The nationalists kept the central point which suited them, that is art as a means, and only replaced the goal [...]. Even some of the ideals are shared between them. The socialists display interest in the peasants, this being our proletarian class for the time being; the nationalists, as the peasants they themselves are, are of course revolutionary peasantists.\"\n\nCritic Mihai Zamfir, who notes that Dobrogeanu-Gherea was by then blending his Marxism into a \"more autochthonous\" perspective on politics, also argues that him and his colleagues at \"Contemporanul\" review were by then becoming aware that Romanian socialist literature was failing their expectations. In his assessment, the local product of Marxist guidelines was \"sub-mediocre\", the theorist himself being \"perfectly aware\" of such inadequacies. Zamfir concludes that \"the more and more vociferous nationalists around \"Sămănătorul\"\" were one of the factors to replace \"socially-themed\" currents, and that their success prompted Dobrogeanu-Gherea to part with literature. Likewise, Râpeanu notes that, contrary to the Marxist leader's expectations, \"Contemporanul\" and its 1890s satellite \"Literatură și Știință\" had not \"managed to set up a current\", and that they compensated by publishing traditional authors such as Vlahuță.\n\n\"Sămănătorul\" also competed for the public's attention with the left-leaning populist movement, Poporanism—the latter owing some inspiration for its rural socialism to the Narodnik movement of the Russian Empire. Despite the generic disagreements, the two groups shared views on a number of topical issues, and even a number of partisans. Lucian Boia identified the main difference as one between the \"patriarchal\" views of the \"Sămănătorists\" and the \"more social\" perspective of Poporanism. A similar point was earlier made by Călinescu, who noted that the Poporanists were \"nationalist democrats\" rather than socialists, and that they advocated amending the traditionalist pronouncements for reaching the same basic goals. Historian Ion Ilincioiu describes both movements as being rooted in \"Romantic philosophy\", \"Sămănătorul\"s \"aggressive\" anti-capitalism being opposed to the Poporanists' attempt at reforming the system from within.\n\n\"Sămănătorul\"s views on aesthetics, Romanian literature and Romanian art were closely connected to its discourse about Romanian specificity, the peasant class and didacticism. Discussing the \"Sămănătorist\" stage of Iorga's career, Sandqvist notes: \"In Iorga's opinion literature and culture in general must be oriented toward the specific nature of the Romanian people and [...] bring forth a love for the Romanian village and its people. To him art has a specific ethical-ethnic function, a mission to stimulate and to express the Romanian farmer, in accordance with the notion of the need for the artist and the poet to unite in a 'holy' union with the woods, the rivers and the whole of nature in a constant uprising against a civilization that has alienated man from his natural, original existence.\" Such pronouncements on the matter were reported with critical detachment by historians: Veiga writes that the peasant promoted by \"Sămănătorul\" was \"archaic and eternal, very 'decorative' and bucolic\", while Sandqvist refers to both \"Sămănătorists\" and Poporanists as producing \"nationalistic anthems\", \"unctuous songs of praise to the Romanian peasant and the Romanian village\", as well as \"pathetic glorifying of the past\". According to Paul Cernat, the \"Sămănătorist\" worldview favored, instead of both modernity and art for art's sake, \"an idyllic, rudimentary-populist, picturesque-ethnographic and sentimental moralism.\" Other researchers have also described \"Sămănătorist\" writings as being primarily characterized by excessive patriarchal nostalgia.\n\nOne essential theme of \"Sămănătorist\" literary theory was the imagery of urban alienation. In Călinescu's definition, the group reacted against what it perceived as \"the neuroses [and] the putrefaction of the urban class\", and was demanding instead \"a 'healthy' literary production, which could only be rural.\" Art and literary critic Dan Grigorescu notes in this nationalist guideline the opposition between \"the 'tentacular' city, the 'killer' city, [and] the patriarchal image of rustic life.\" On the margin of the \"Sămănătorul\" circle, this \"Sămănătorist\" sensibility was specifically identified in some poems written by Octavian Goga during the same years. In matters of style, the \"Sămănătorist\" circle was also interested in prolonging the legacy of \"Junimist\" writers, starting with Vlahuţă (who adhered closely to or imitated Eminescu's poetics). The \"Junimist\" affiliate and folk writer Ion Creangă was one of \"Sămănătorul\"s recommended sources of inspiration for prose writers. However, Tudor Vianu notes, this was questionable, since Creangă's uncomplicated \"rural authenticity\" made him \"the least \"Sămănătorist\" among our writers.\"\n\nCommitted to preserving the legacy of painter Nicolae Grigorescu as a mainstay of Romanian visual arts, \"Sămănătorism\" also touched the field of art criticism. Vlahuţă, a great admirer of Grigorescu, had already dedicated him a monograph in which he stated his special appreciation for the painter's pastoral themes: \"And how handsome the shepherds guarding Grigorescu's flocks! And how proud. It's as if they were kings, monarchs of the mountains, that is how they walk, how they stand, how they gaze upon their realms.\" Such praise of Grigorescu was regularly featured in the magazine's art column, signed by writer and collector Virgil Cioflec, and in Iorga's art essays, which describe Grigorescu as a discoverer of Romania's \"genius loci\". The magazine hailed the painter as the model to follow, but only selected those aspects of his work which it could fit within its approach, largely ignoring his urban-themed works. \"Sămănătorism\" directly encouraged visual artists occasionally described as \"Grigorescu's \", who concentrated on rural, pastoral and picturesque subjects. The category notably includes two genre painters, the Transylvanian Ipolit Strâmbu and the Brăila native Arthur Verona, followed closely by Ștefan Popescu. The \"Tinerimea Artistică\" society, which grouped some of the \"Sămănătorist\"-inspired painters alongside older and younger artists, upheld Nicolae Grigorescu's style as an alternative to the academic art of the day, and borrowed elements from newer European-wide manifestations of Art Nouveau, but did not articulate an aesthetic program.\n\nThe rise of \"Sămănătorism\" was hotly contested by cosmopolitan or decadent trends, which were inspired by French-imported Symbolism and set the ground for avant-garde and modernist literature. The magazine found one of its main rivals in poet and theorist Alexandru Macedonski, recognized as the doyen of the Romanian Symbolist school and an enemy of traditionalist literature even before the year 1900, who put out the magazine \"Literatorul\". The controversy was taken to the public sphere: a regular of the Kübler Coffeehouse, Macedonski is reported to have publicly mocked the \"Sămănătorists\" who had reserved the table opposite him. By 1908, criticism of traditionalist currents was taking the forefront in the activities of other Symbolist figures: the rebellious poet Ion Minulescu and the professional critic Ovid Densusianu, who openly suggested a literature based on urban models. As early as 1905, Densusianu had begun a polemic with \"Sămănătorul\" and the Poporanists by means of his own publication, \"Vieața Nouă\", accusing his adversaries of hopelessly trying to cut Romania from the worldwide context and from progress itself.\n\nDespite such heated exchanges, the magazine stressed the importance of a writers' solidarity: Iorga's articles on this topic are credited by some with having helped in the 1909 establishment of a Romanian Writers' Society. By then, \"Sămănătorul\" was itself acquiring a Symbolist section (albeit one more akin to the neoromantic school), primarily illustrated by Iosif and fellow poet Dimitrie Anghel (who also used the magazine as a testing ground for their collaborative poetry experiments, which were signed with the common pen name \"A. Mirea\"). Also included in this faction were other young authors, such as Ştefan Petică, Al. T. Stamatiad, Alice Călugăru and Elena Farago. According to Cernat, such collaborations evidenced the \"identity break among the 'conservative' wing of autochthonous Symbolism.\" Another paradox was the presence of writers with modernist tendencies among the occasional contributors to \"Sămănătorul\", including the radical Minulescu and the moderate Densusianu. Eugen Lovinescu, who moved between currents and later became a figure of eclectic modernism, is also known to have tried his hand at becoming a \"Sămănătorul\" contributor and even to have supported the 1906 campaign against French influence. For part of its existence, the magazine even hosted translations of texts by French Symbolists, decadents or Parnassians. While these associations were seen by George Călinescu as additional proof that \"Sămănătorul\" lacked a coherent program, Cernat discusses them as part of a wider transition at the end of which Symbolism reemerged as classical and assimilable.\n\nThe internalized Symbolist tendency irritated Iorga, who, in 1905, used \"Sămănătorul\" to condemn the floral imagery of Anghel's writings as having been inspired by an urban and \"boyar\" garden. Five years later, when both had ended their association with the magazine, Iorga returned with an article in \"Neamul Românesc\", explaining that he considered Anghel's poems to be a form of \"contempt\" for a traditionalist venue. In Călinescu's opinion, Iorga was by then giving a disproportionately positive reception to writers of little value, which he held to mean that, under Iorga's direction, \"Sămănătorul\" was transforming itself into a venue for the least important traditionalist authors. Râpeanu also writes: \"Like any critic, [Iorga] could be mistaken, particularly in cases where he did not take into consideration the aesthetic criterion and expressed words of sympathy [...] for minor writers who endeavored, with no calling, to apply the magazine's principles.\" A similar assessment was provided by literary critic Ion Simuţ, who noted that Iorga tended to promote all his followers in the literary world, regardless of value, failing to see an actual difference between Vasile Pop and Sadoveanu. Sadoveanu had also noticed this trait, and recalled not having been flattered by Iorga's explicit comparison between his works and those of Pop.\n\nObjections to \"Sămănătorist\" attitudes were also being expressed outside the modernist circles. Romania's celebrated dramatist and comediographer Ion Luca Caragiale, although himself a former \"Junimist\" somewhat close to traditionalist circles such as \"Vatra\", found \"Sămănătorist\" literature amusing, and made it a target of his sarcasm. The left-leaning Henri Sanielevici, a pioneer of sociological criticism, was also known for setting up in 1905 the Galați-based review \"Curentul Nou\", which was in large part dedicated to anti-\"Sămănătorism\". Among the main points of contention between Sanielevici and Iorga were the latter's didacticism and its application: Sanielevici claimed that, by endorsing Sadoveanu's early works, which depicted scenes of adultery and rape, Iorga had effectively contradicted his own views about morality in art. One of the most prominent conflicts was that between Ilarie Chendi and his former colleagues, even though Chendi was still being inspired by \"Sămănătorist\" aesthetics. Chendi and the \"Chendists\" (among them Zaharia Bârsan, George Coșbuc, Ion Gorun and Andrei Naum) are said to have been avoiding their \"Sămănătorist\" rivals at the Kübler, where the \"Sămănătorists\" only held session during mornings.\n\nAmong the first direct ideological successors of \"Sămănătorul\" was Iorga's own Democratic Nationalist Party. According to Veiga: \"In this new phase, Iorga did not resort to very different arguments, but merely sought to render a more politically explicit expression to the literary aesthetics of \"Sămănătorul\".\" In Stanomir's account, the \"avatars\" represented by the Democratic Nationalist program and \"Neamul Românesc\" are, like \"Sămănătorul\", episodes in a \"series marked by the recovery and valorization of the Eminescian assets\". Despite its intention of addressing the peasantry, \"Sămănătorul\" is thought to have mostly appealed to white-collar workers. Călinescu, who contrasted its approach with the elitism and professionalization advocated by \"Junimea\", concluded: \"[\"Semănătorul\"] primarily gathered writers of little culture, officers, young men who did not complete their education [and] autodidacts [...]. The magazine made itself well liked by schoolteachers, provincial professors, Romanians outside the borders, and, in spreading throughout these environments, it educated the masses in view of accepting proper literature. It is true that the very same readers were left with horror for all things 'alien', 'unhealthy', but when did it ever happen that the multitudes reach a level required for the understanding of more refined art? One could say that \"Semănătorul\" and all the other like-minded publications assumed the thankless mission of promoting \"Junimist\" ideas all around, while renouncing the [art for art's sake principle] at the risk of compromising themselves in front of literary historians less sympathetic to a magazine's goals.\" Sandqvist also notes that the main group to be attracted by traditionalism, particularly after the 1907 revolt, mostly comprised \"underpaid classicists, historians, and lawyers who composed the nation's overstaffed bureaucracy\".\n\nBefore and during World War I, \"Sămănătorism\" (like Poporanism) became a favorite target of ridicule for the young modernist or avant-garde writers and artists. In Sandqvist's opinion, this answered to \"a certain exclusivism\" of the two established currents, which, he notes, only served to provoke \"an avant-garde reaction.\" One of the first avant-garde magazines to host articles specifically aiming the traditionalist currents was \"Simbolul\", published by Tristan Tzara, Ion Vinea and Marcel Janco in 1912. Vinea in particular followed up with attacks on the \"Sămănătorist\" legacy by means of other publications, primarily \"Facla\" and \"Chemarea\", while his colleague in Iași, dramatist and future critic Benjamin Fondane, vocally rejected \"Sămănătorists\" and Poporanists as \"talentless writers\" destined to be \"forgotten\". According to Dan Grigorescu, \"Sămănătorul\" magazine and its affiliates had a paradoxical role as a \"catalyst\" for Expressionism, which manifested itself in Romanian art beginning in the 1910s, and which contemplated urban life as a tragic experience: \"However odd it may seem, \"Sămănătorism\" created a favorable atmosphere for ideas akin to those which would lead to the revelation of Expressionist attitudes in the Occident.\" Some former \"Sămănătorists\" migrated toward Symbolist or post-Symbolist publications, as in the cases of traditionalist-inspired prose writers I. Dragoslav (who began collaborating with \"Insula\", a magazine published by Minulescu in 1912) and Gala Galaction (who joined poet Tudor Arghezi and socialist journalist N. D. Cocea in editing a succession of leftist and modernist reviews).\n\nBy the 1920s, \"Sămănătorism\" had firmly established itself as a tendency in Romanian academia, and, according to Lucian Nastasă, held back innovative approaches and promoted conformity. Iorga himself, convinced that the \"Sămănătorist\" tenets were still applicable, set up a series of journals which advertised themselves as reincarnations of the defunct publication; in addition to \"Neamul Românesc\"s literary supplement, these were: \"Drum Drept\" (1913–1947, merged with \"Ramuri\" in 1914) and \"Cuget Clar\" (or \"Noul Sămănător\", \"The New Sower\", 1936–1940). Among the disciples who followed him in this attempt was the journalist Pamfil Șeicaru, noted for his more radical political opinions. The new venues prolonged \"Sămănătorism\" (or \"neo-\"Sămănătorism\"\") as a phenomenon of the interwar period, that is after the Transylvania's union and the creation of Greater Romania, based on Iorga's belief that the movement had survived its political context and was still relevant in setting cultural norms. Cultural historian Ileana Ghemeș notes that Iorga's claim was debatable: \"At the beginning of the 1920s, when modernist artistic formulas where progressively making their offensive [...] felt, Nicolae Iorga was convinced that the 'anarchy' could be quelled by restating the ethical and ethnic factors as ones subordinating the aesthetic. The times were nevertheless different, and the recovery of old \"Sămănătorist\" themes and motifs had less and less powerful effects with a public that was more visibly aligned with the European values of the day.\"\n\nAmong the main purposes of Iorga's new magazines was a campaign against its opponents on the cultural scene, particularly modernism and the new avant-garde. \"Drum Drept\", which stated its respect for the other surviving platforms of traditionalism (including the Poporanist \"Viaţa Românească\"), was noted for its rejection of literary critics who viewed \"Sămănătorist\" aesthetics with dislike or reserve: Densusianu, Dragomirescu, Lovinescu. The anti-modernist campaign was taken to a new level by \"Cuget Clar\", noted for its claim that Lovinescu and Arghezi had together turned Romanian literature into what Iorga deemed \"monstrosities\". It heralded a nationalist offensive, which accused various Romanian writers, usually modernists, of having promoted and endorsed \"pornography\". At the time, Iorga and his followers were also stating that the local avant-garde had an alien, primarily Jewish, source. In the 1930s, the campaign against non-traditionalist literary works made its way into the pages of Iorga's own synthesis of literary history, \"Istoria literaturii româneşti contemporane\" (\"The History of Contemporary Romanian Literature\"), which partly consisted of excerpts from his earlier articles. In tandem, his rival Lovinescu was developing criticism of the neo-\"Sămănătorist\" agenda into an ideology, which fused urban-themed modernism, classical liberalism and literary impressionism with direct references to some of Maiorescu's art for art's sake principles. His essays described \"Sămănătorul\" and its descendants as factors preventing cultural development, and named \"Sămănătorism\" \"the cemetery of Romanian poetry\". Neo-\"Sămănătorism\" had a special impact in Bessarabia, a former province of the Russian Empire which formed part of Greater Romania: soon after the political union, traditionalism acquired a special force, but its position was challenged by young writers who followed Symbolism or Expressionism (Alexandru Robot among them). Although motivated by nationalist didacticism and supportive of \"Cuget Clar\", writer Nicolai Costenco and his \"Viața Basarabiei\" review were more receptive of innovation, and even pioneered a symbiosis between the two cultural extremes.\n\nIn tandem, echoes of \"Sămănătorist\" ideology were fueling some of the new movements aiming to reconfigure Romania's political scene. One such current was the version of agrarianism represented, in a post-land reforms age, by the Peasants' Party and the National Peasants' Party (both of which represented mutations of Poporanism). In tandem, the magazine was also a reference point for the far right or fascist movements which emerged during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The first among such groups was one formed around the poet-philosopher Nichifor Crainic, a sporadic contributor to Iorga's magazines, after he took over leadership of \"Gândirea\" journal. Crainic's main innovation was in linking ethnic nationalism and ethnocracy with the notion that the Romanian Orthodox Church was the guarantee of Romanian identity, therefore discarding the implicit secularism of \"Sămănătorist\" thought. Crainic's \"Orthodoxist\" views, Veiga notes, were closely related to the ideas of Russian \"émigré\" authors, from the Christian existentialism of Nikolai Berdyaev to the political radicalism of the Eurasianist theorists. Defining his group's exact relation to \"Sămănătorism\" in one of his \"Gândirea\" articles, Crainic stated: \"Over the land that we have learned to love from \"Sămănătorul\" we see arching itself the azure tarpaulin of the Orthodox Church. We see this substance of this Church blending in with the ethnic substance.\" His own literary style was seen as a more robust form of neo-\"Sămănătorism\" by Lovinescu, and deemed \"Orthodoxism with \"Semănătorist\" modulations\" by literary historian Mircea A. Diaconu. In tandem, Crainic's rival on the far right, \"Trăirist\" philosopher Nae Ionescu, paid homages to \"Sămănătorul\" and Iorga's thought.\n\nThe \"Gândirist\" claim to \"Sămănătorul\" lineage was received with reserve by Iorga. While \"Istoria literaturii româneşti contemporane\" included Crainic and his magazines with the \"signs of improvement\" from modernism, it also made a point of criticizing \"Othodoxism\" as unrealistic and undesirable, and openly stated a secularist approach to politics. On the other side, the lack of religious ideals in the literature promoted by Iorga's neo-\"Sămănătorist\" magazines was discussed as a negative trait by Crainic and by Petre Pandrea, at the time a colleague and disciple of Nae Ionescu, who also noted that \"the only exception\" to this literary secularism was poet Vasile Voiculescu (published by both \"Cuget Clar\" and \"Gândirea\").\n\nAt the end of this succession was the Iron Guard organization, established and led by A. C. Cuza's former disciple Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Evolving into one of Romania's most notorious fascist groups, the Guard also took inspiration from several other sources, among which \"Sămănătorism\" was present: Codreanu, like his father Ion Zelea, had been convinced by Iorga's views on the peasantry, and, according to Veiga, his propaganda campaigns were ultimately set up in accordance with \"Sămănătorist\" and, to a certain degree, Poporanist models. Like the defunct magazine, Codreanu and his followers referenced Eminescu or borrowed selectively from the ideas of 19th century conservatism or \"Junimism\". Codreanu is also known to have publicly praised Iorga for having first talked about \"the Jewish peril\". As another link with the \"Sămănătorists\", the Iron Guard developed a complex but often close relationship with Crainic's movement, as well as with Nae Ionescu, and supported with them the \"Orthodoxist\" program. Nevertheless, one other group of Guard affiliates, formed by writer Mircea Streinul and \"Iconar\" review, promoted an alternative rural-themed literature which took its distance from \"Sămănătorul\".\n\nWhile he had a degree of sympathy for Italian fascism and corporatism, Iorga viewed the Iron Guard as dangerous for Romania. Having parted with Cuza by the 1920s, he was briefly co-opted by the National Peasants' Party, went on to serve as Premier, and, in the years leading up to World War II, joined those who advocated the authoritarian politics of Codreanu's bitter rival, Carol II. His publicized criticism of Codreanu's methods and the Iron Guard leader's answer played a part in escalating the entire conflict, and, after Codreanu's killing on Carol's orders, made Iorga a potential target for the movement's violent retribution. In November 1940, during the interval when the Guard set up the National Legionary regime (\"see Romania during World War II\"), Iorga became a victim of its assassins. This final action, was seen by Lovinescu, as well as by Stanomir and Veiga, as the equivalent of a political patricide.\n\nA new chapter of the clash between modernists and \"Sămănătorists\" was played out in the post-National Legionary era, following the Guard's clash with its nominal partner, \"Conducător\" Ion Antonescu, who set up a new authoritarian and Axis-aligned regime (\"see Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom\"). Braving the censorship imposed on modernism by Antonescu's rule, and holding Lovinescu as their example, the Sibiu Literary Circle publicized its own critique of \"Sămănătorist\" ideals. Formulated as part of a manifesto drafted by young essayist Ion Negoițescu, it popularized the disparaging term \"pășunism\" (from \"pășune\", \"pasture\") to define neo-\"Sămănătorist\" literature, and alleged that its exponents were demagogues who glorified peasant values without themselves leaving \"the comfortable armchairs of the city\". Shortly after the Royal Coup of 1944, which brought Romania under Allied supervision, voices condemning \"Sămănătorism\" again made themselves heard publicly. Writing for the National Peasants' Party \"Dreptatea\" newspaper, literary critic Vladimir Streinu paid homage to Lovinescu, Densusianu and Dragomirescu for their previous role in bringing up for discussion the negative aspects of the current, and noted that their objections only had to be slightly adapted when reviewing \"Orthodoxism\" or other local nationalist currents. The use of the term \"Sămănătorist\" as a pejorative for the far right's aesthetics was also present in the discourse of Romanian-born modernist essayist and dramatist Eugène Ionesco, better known as a founding figure for the Theatre of the Absurd. Ionesco discussed interwar and wartime \"Sămănătorism\" and other traditionalist trends as symptoms of \"a deep-seated intellectual affliction: the refusal of culture.\"\n\nThe negative assessments were later endorsed by literary historian Georgeta Ene, who noted: \"Iorga's magazines have drawn around them a significantly large 'constellation' of minor writers and have produced a dull, edulcorated, inconsistent literature, which only went as far as to obstinately perpetuate themes originating in \"Sămănătorism\", demonstrating their fundamental inability of aesthetically reaching the grandeur and sublime contained by Iorga's concept\". According to Ileana Ghemeș: \"Certainly, when compared with the modernist offensive, neo-\"Sămănătorist\" literature could appear anchored in entirely antiquated clichés. The section of the reading public to which this literature was addressed, situated far from the debates between ideas addressing the Romanian culture's paths of development after [World War I], ill-prepared for receiving the innovative tendencies supported by the modernist publications which had a very limited degree of propagation in the world of Romanian villages, continued to enjoy those traditionalist literary productions furiously defended by Nicolae Iorga.\"\n\nNew assessments of \"Sămănătorism\" and traditionalism followed the 1947–1948 imposition of a Romanian communist regime. During its first stage, when they created a local socialist realist current, the new cultural authorities imposed selective censorship on Romania's literary trends. There were, however, several meeting points with the aesthetics and policies promoted by \"Sămănătorul\" in matters of social and cultural discourse. The partial liberalization allowed by the Nicolae Ceaușescu in the late 1960s made room for a new aesthetic reaction to both communist guidelines and neo-\"Sămănătorism\", leading from the recovery of interwar modernism and Western influences to the birth of local postmodern literature and the \"Optzeciști\" generation. During the following decades, as Ceaușescu's \"July Theses\" confirmed national communism and opened the path of isolationism, traditionalist and nationalist currents came to be officially reconsidered as ideological precedents. However, the period also saw the publishing of Z. Ornea's influential overview of \"Sămănătorist\" ideology, first printed in 1970. It took critical distance from the trend, and, literary historian Nicolae Manolescu suggests, thus stood against the renewed official endorsement for the \"Sămănătorist\" program. According to Ghemeș, the work also played an essential part in stimulating other such assessments on the current to be published in later decades, including Georgeta Ene's 1984 study of Iorga's neo-\"Sămănătorist\" periodicals.\n\nA parallel recovery of \"Sămănătorist\" views is argued to have taken place in the Soviet Union's Moldavian SSR, formed from the bulk of the Bessarabia upon the 1940 breakup of Greater Romania. While the local population's cultural identification with Romania was officially discouraged and repressed during the adoption of Moldovenist ideology, the rural aesthetics of \"Sămănătorism\" were adapted to the proletarian themes favored by official culture. This phenomenon was later described by literary critic Iulian Ciocan in terms of cultural synthesis: \"\"Sămănătorism\" was harnessed to the rumbling wagon of proletkultism. The original ideology was, of course, retouched. 'National specificity' was replaced with 'social class specificity', subordinated to 'proletarian internationalism', and the contrast between the idyllic village and the dehumanized city [...] is supplanted by the animosity between the agricultural proletariat and the (petty) bourgeoisie. The working class, attenuating the rift between village and city, is called to the forefront.\" According to Ciocan, the reaction against this merger was less significant than in Romania, even though postmodern authors also emerged in the Moldavian SSR.\n\nA critical evaluation of \"Sămănătorism\" and its impact was still an important factor in cultural and political developments after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 succeeded in toppling communism. During the cultural debates of the early 1990s, literary historian and social critic Adrian Marino argued that the European integration of post-Revolution Romania was being held back by issues relating to its \"fundamental social structure\" and \"the psychology specific to all shut-in traditional communities\", since: \"A rural and inescapably ethnicist, conservative, isolationist, traditionalist, \"Sămănătorist\", populist Romania will never feel the need for 'Europe'. On the contrary, it will perceive in it a grave danger for the preservation of the 'national being'.\" In contrast to this situation, he placed his hopes for change with the young, educated and urban middle class familiarizing itself directly with Western culture or pre-communist cultural alternatives to \"Sămănătorism\". Similarly, writer and critic Gheorghe Crăciun negatively assessed that \"Sămănătorul\", alongside other defunct traditionalist publications, continued to dominate the standard reception of Romanian culture, particularly in matters of the Romanian curriculum after the year 2000. State-sponsored education, he assessed, rated Coșbuc and Goga higher than their modernist counterparts Ion Barbu and George Bacovia, and, overall, favored the \"parochial, peasant, epic, ethnographic and dazed-metaphysical\" elements in Romanian literature. In contrast, Valeriu Râpeanu listed \"Sămănătorul\" and \"Gândirea\" among the magazines with \"essential contributions to asserting Romanian thought\", and argued: \"Speaking disparagingly about \"Sămănătorism\", and in particular by deeming \"Sămănătorism\" an obsolete, backward vision lacking any literary value, has even become an act by means of which one invokes one's own aesthetic high ground.\"\n\nCriticism of \"Sămănătorist\" traditionalism and its presence in various contexts was also voiced in later years. In one such case, historian Mihai Sorin Rădulescu argued that such tendencies had made their way into Romanian museology: \"the Museum of the Romanian Peasant [...] and the Village Museum both show Romanians in accordance with \"Semănătorist\" tradition\". In a 2007 article critical of Romania's educational policy, textbook author Dumitriţa Stoica described as an anachronism the presence of topics on \"Sămănătorism\" within the standard baccalaureate examination, noting that such subjects had already been stripped from the regular curriculum. In his 2008 book \"Iluziile literaturii române\" (\"Illusions in Romanian Literature\"), literary historian and theorist Eugen Negrici linked the perpetuation of neo-\"Sămănătorist\" guidelines with another nationalist current, Protochronism, discussing them as equally negative phenomena: \"Even though I feel no pleasure, I must admit that the ideological-literary movements of a \"Sămănătorist\" and Protochronist type appear to be durable, being strictly motivated by the ways in which Romanian society has evolved. They stand for both the protective impulse and the compensatory one [...]. At the first sign of a major peril, we shall be hearing the magmatic rumble of myths rising up again from the deep\".\n\nFollowing the Soviet collapse of 1991 and the emergence of independent Moldova within the Moldavian SSR's borders, the area witnessed a similar conflict of ideas. Discussing the phenomenon as an attempt to link the emergent unionist movement with traditionalist aesthetics still present on the Moldovan literary scene, Iulian Ciocan argued: \"Unfortunately, the great majority of those Bessarabian \"Sămănătorists\" who 'cultivate' the masses are themselves uncultured persons. They view themselves as defenders of national values, but, in reality, nurture and exacerbate technophobia and autochthonism [...]. A large part of those who describe in their books the opposition between the (Moldovan) village and the (Russian) city, and who warn that Russification threatens our national identity have been faithfully serving the preceding Soviet proletkultism.\" A central element of the neo-\"Sămănătorist\" literary trend in Moldova, Ciocan argues, is the importance it assigns to the traditionalist writer Ion Druţă.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25571192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25571192", "title": "Tradition, Family and Property", "text": "Tradition, Family and Property\n\nTradition, Family, and Property (TFP) () is an international movement of political/civic organizations of Traditionalist Catholic inspiration. The first TFP was founded by Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira in Brazil in 1960, inspired by his 1959 book \"Revolution and Counter-Revolution\" which became the TFPs' foundational text, later supplemented by his 1993 \"Nobility and Analogous Traditional Elites in the Allocutions of Pius XII\". He remained president of the Brazilian TFP's national council until his death in 1995. After his death, there was a legal battle upon the title and ownership of the Brazilian TFP, which was ultimately won by João Scognamiglio Clá Dias, in 2004, while he had created previously the Heralds of the Gospel (2001). Those who opposed this action have remained active in the Association of the Founders of TFP and created the Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira Institute (), which claims the legacy of the original TFP. They have taken the legal dispute to the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court. In other countries across the world several organizations have continued to use the name and acronym of TFP, or have adopted other names.\n\nSome see the movement as more cultural and political than religious. From that perspective it can be seen as opposing its values of Tradition, Family, and Property to the French Revolution's values of \"Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité\". Its worldview has been characterized as an \"extreme moralism, against divorce, against Communism, and against change.\" It has been pointed out that the group's citation of Catholic tradition is selective, drawing on speeches and encyclicals from the most conservative popes, including the 1864 Syllabus of Errors, while the social doctrine of the Church formulated from the pontificate of Leo XIII to the present is deliberately ignored. The Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, noted that members of the TFP movement were among the signatories of the \"Fillial Correction\" of Pope Francis.\n\nLöwy's study of the interaction of religion and politics in Latin America used the international TFP to exemplify the most conservative of four tendencies within Latin American Catholicism: the one which \"defend[s] ultra-reactionary and sometimes semi-fascist ideas.\" A recent study pointed out that \"TFP draws on a rigid interpretation of Christianity to offer the faithful an all-encompassing ideological justification for what are, in essence, very conservative politics.\" It has been noted that similar religious movements \"are benign compared to Tradition, Family and Property (TFP)\" which is also \"opposed by the Catholic leadership because of its beliefs and recruiting procedures.\" Some analysts see it as a fringe group within the Latin American Catholic church.\n\nInstitutionally, TFPs have been described as having a \"chameleon-like identity\". When dealing with the church, they describe themselves as a civic association of the laity, and therefore independent of ecclesiastical control; when dealing with civil society, they stress that they are a voluntary association inspired by religious ideals, and therefore not subject to certain civil regulations such as labor laws.\n\nTFP is both a national organization and a transnational movement which shares fundamental beliefs, goals, publications, and even funding. Shortly after its foundation in Brazil in 1960, the TFP began a program of international expansion, beginning with a \"Latin American Congress of Catholicism\" in Serra Negra, Brazil, attended by about 350 Brazilians and about 20 representatives from other countries in Hispanic America. TFP sees this meeting as the beginning of its expansion, with the foundation of TFP offices, national TFPs, and affiliated organizations in 29 countries throughout the world, including Argentina (1967), Chile (1967), Uruguay (1967), Paraguay (1967), Peru (1970), Spain (1971), Bolivia (1973), Colombia (1971), Ecuador (1973), Portugal (1974), the United States (1974), Venezuela (1971), Canada (1975), Italy (1976), France (1977), United Kingdom (1980), Germany (1982), South Africa (1983), Australia (1988), India (1992), Poland (1995), Austria (1999), Ireland (2004), Belgium, Costa Rica, Lithuania, the Philippines, and New Zealand. This expansion produced what is claimed to be \"the world’s largest anticommunist and antisocialist network of Catholic inspiration.\"\n\nAlthough these TFPs described themselves as \"autonomous anticommunist organizations inspired by the traditional teachings of the Popes\", they cooperated effectively to advance their social and political agenda. A striking example occurred in 1981 when thirteen TFPs (and related organizations) published a six-page critique by Oliveira of Francois Mitterrand's Socialist government program to implement what was called \"self-managing socialism\". They were refused space for the essay by six French daily papers but they did publish it in 44 other major newspapers worldwide. The cost of placing each six-page advertisement in \"The Washington Post\" or the Toronto \"Globe and Mail\" was about $100,000.\n\nThe Sociedad Argentina de Defensa de la Tradición, Familia y Propiedad was established in 1967, drawing on a group of conservative Catholics who had previously founded the magazine \"Cruzada\", which opposed liberal Catholicism and socialism. In the late 60s the TFP gained the apparent support of the Argentine military regime when they called for a purge of progressive clergy from the Catholic Church. The publications of the Argentinian TFP have been described as embodying a discourse of violence legitimating the authorities' suppression of civil rights. In 1973 the Buenos Aires provincial police investigated military training activities conducted by the TFP. Around 1976 or 1977 a Father Vicente was forced to flee to Uruguay with the assistance of the Jesuit Provincial, Jorge Bergoglio (later Pope Francis), after having been threatened by TFP for preaching against the murder of three Pallottine priests and two seminarians.\n\nThe Sociedade Brasileira de Defesa da Tradição, Família e Propriedade was founded in 1960 and flourished during conservative opposition to the land reform proposed in Brazil by the government of João Goulart. Goulart's land reform program was criticized by Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira, the economist Luis Mendonca de Freitas, and reactionary bishops Antonio de Castro Mayer and Geraldo de Proença Sigaud in their 1961 book, \"Agrarian Reform—A Question of Conscience\", which treated private property as a moral absolute. The Brazilian TFP's campaign against what it termed \"socialist and confiscatory land reform\", provided the incentives leading to the military coup of 1964 as well as later repressive legislation. In 1968 the Brazilian TFP gathered two million signatures on a continent-wide petition campaign against Communist infiltration of the Catholic Church which placed it in clear opposition to the mainstream of the Brazilian hierarchy. TFP also urged the military government to arrest Archbishop Hélder Câmara for his support of land reform. In 1969 Câmara linked the TFP indirectly to the murder in Recife of his aide, Father Antônio Henrique Pereira Neto.\n\nThese actions, as well as TFP's opposition to liberation theology, led to a string of criticism beginning in 1970 from a number of bishops, including the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, which saw the TFP as destroying ecclesiastical unity. Notably, at their 23rd general assembly in 1985 the Brazilian Bishops criticized TFP for its \"lack of communion … with the Church in Brazil, its hierarchy, and the Holy Father\" and for its \"esoteric character, the religious fanaticism, and the cult given to the personality of its leader and his mother.\" The Brazilian TFP replied the next day that \"justice forbids TFP from accepting as valid vague and generic accusations like those in the NCBB text. Specific facts and proofs must be presented.\" The American TFP attributed the bishops' critique to \"the tragic influence of Marxist liberation theology among Brazilian bishops\".\n\nThe Brazilian TFP split into two factions after the death of its founder in 1995 and a dispute over the rights to the society's name and assets has been progressing through the Brazilian courts. As of 2013 the final decision was waiting on action of the Supreme Court. After an unfavorable court decision in 2004 the remaining, politically active, faction formed the Association of Founders of TFP to continue the original expression of their social ideals and to contest the court case. Since this split, the Association of Founders has received substantial financial support from the American TFP.\n\nIn 1967 a group of conservative Catholics who published the magazine \"Fiducia\", decided to form a Chilean chapter of the TFP. During the late 60s the TFP circulated a book claiming the Prime Minister, Eduardo Frei Montalva, was the Chilean Kerensky. The book was written in Portuguese by Fabio Vidigal Xavier da Silveira, a director of the Brazilian TFP, translated into Spanish by the Argentine affiliate of the TFP, and distributed in Chile and throughout South America. Vidigal argued that the Christian Democratic party was a tool of the communist plan to socialize Latin America. His book was repeatedly confiscated and the TFP was banned by Frei's Christian Democratic government. They opposed the government of Salvador Allende and welcomed the 1973 military coup that overthrew his Popular Unity government.\n\nIn 1976, during the Pinochet dictatorship, the TFP published a book maintaining that Catholics are duty bound to resist pastors and clergy who support the hierarchy, especially the defender of human rights Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez, who they said was leading the country toward Communism. The Chilean TFP can be seen as advocating violence against the \"enemies of the truth\", especially those who were seen as tolerating the infiltration of communism. By March the Chilean Bishops' Conference responded with a formal rebuke of the TFP, maintaining that the bishops have the sole governing responsibility in the Church and that those who participated in this campaign have \"by their actions placed themselves outside the Catholic Church\". Nonetheless, the TFP continued to have strong influence among the conservative political, military, and economic leadership of Chile, many of whom were present at a 1992 anniversary celebration of the founding of TFP.\n\nThe Société française pour la défense de la Tradition, Famille, Propriété grew out of an office established in 1974 by four Latin American members of TFP to disseminate information regarding TFP in Europe. French associates established the \"Jeunes Français pour une Civilisation Chrétienne\" in 1975, which took its present name in January 1977. Its statutes set the goals of defending the fundamental principles of Christian Civilization and opposing the principles of liberal and egalitarian revolution and the communism and socialism which that revolution engendered. With its foundation it established a school, l’École Saint-Benoït, which was closed after two years amid accusations that it was being used as a center of indoctrination and recruitment.\n\nThe society was described as one of the most active of the pseudo-Catholic organizations by The French Assembly's Commission of inquiry into sects. The Commission defined as pseudo-Catholic those organizations that appeal to the Catholic tradition which they maintain against the reforms imposed by Rome. TFP was also seen to exemplify a mastery of commercial fund-raising techniques, with a network of closely related organizations targeting messages to susceptible recipients.\n\nThe Young South Africans for a Christian Civilisation (TFP) was founded in 1984, during the declining years of the apartheid regime, to resist \"the liberal, socialist and communist trends of the times\" and to provide theological support for the idea of a natural inequality in society. Early targets of TFP's expansion into South Africa were the Catholic, Portuguese speaking, refugees from newly independent Mozambique. One of its activities was to oppose the newspaper, \"New Nation\", which had been funded by the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference, advanced liberation theology, and opposed apartheid but which TFP saw as \"communist inspired\". TFP sought to undermine the bishops' popular support and appealed, unsuccessfully, to the Pope that he ban the paper. TFP's efforts were more successful in providing justification for the government's three-month suspension of the newspaper in 1987. The State President and an unnamed government minister wrote the TFP commending them for supporting the goals of the National Party government. The South African bishops issued a strongly worded rebuttal of the accusation that the \"New Nation\" was a \"communist\" newspaper and noted that TFP's critiques ignored the gospel basis of liberation theology. \n\nTFP maintains that they supported the Catholic Bishops' 1952 statement in opposition to Apartheid. They also oppose the excesses of laissez-faire capitalism, but more so the radically liberal and socialist egalitarianism found in Communism which the Catholic Church defines as \"intrinsically evil\". TFP favors natural and harmonious inequalities in an organic society.\n\nThe American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property was founded in the United States in 1973, stemming from a group who in 1971 had founded a magazine, \"Crusade for a Christian Civilization\". This drew from earlier encounters of members of the Brazilian TFP with followers of the American New Right. The American TFP is staffed by 75 full-time volunteers and 60 paid employees, and its national headquarters is in Spring Grove, Penn., with branch offices in McLean, Va., Chicago, Ill., Rossville, Kan., Lafayette, La., and Orange County, Calif.\n\nThe American TFP is active on many social, cultural, and economic issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, homosexuality in the military, socialism, death penalty, sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church, Islam, and many others. It promotes its ideas through newspaper advertisements, direct mail, leafleting, public meetings, online protests and activism, and 'caravans', groups of volunteers that travel across the country for weeks at a time to promote TFP's ideas on city streets and at universities.\n\nSome of its larger campaigns include \"America Needs Fatima\", TFP Student Action, its university student outreach, and the Public Square Rosary Crusade, which organizes annual rosary rallies every year. Approximately 5,900 public rosary rallies were held in all 50 states on 16 October 2010, and 14,108 on 10 October 2015.\n\n"}

Water For People has established a year-round presence in 30 districts of nine developing countries, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Peru, India, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi. In totality, Water For People reaches 4 million people.\n\nWater For People depends on volunteers to fulfill much of its mission. Volunteers raise funds and spread the word about the desperate need for safe drinking water and improved sanitation in the developing world. Their main goal is to improve the access to safe and clean water for developing countries around the world. They provide programs that ensure running sanitized water to prevent water-related illnesses in poorer countries.\n\nThe World Water Corps is Water For People’s volunteer program that sends engineers to the countries where the sanitation projects are being established. This allows the volunteers to use their skills and experience in support of the development of sustainable safe drinking water resources, improved sanitation facilities, and hygiene education programs.\n\nWorld Water Corps volunteers provide professional support to Water For People’s work overseas within the parameters of its specifically-tailored community-based models. As such, they are not involved with the actual design of the water and sanitation systems. This function is left to local government and nongovernmental organization partners, as well as community members themselves, who must take ownership of this system and understand how to operate and maintain them for the long term. Water For People works with local partners and stakeholders to assist rural governments, schools, businesses, and households in emptying septic tanks, installing pumps, wells, and toilets with the proper technology and management strategies to guarantee the durability and sustained functionality of innovations. The organization also collaborates with rural members and local institutions to make sure that sanitary napkin containers and other sanitary services are available for women. Rainwater catchment systems are placed on school properties, gardens are established at hand pumps, trees are planted to increase recharge, deep boreholes are motorized, and water treatment systems are installed.\n\nWorld Water Corps volunteers engage in such activities as data-testing and mapping to provide baseline data for development, monitoring the functionality of past projects, and evaluating overall program effectiveness. Volunteers have conducted scoping studies and needs assessments to determine where Water For People should expand. They might also be called upon to “train the trainers” abroad or provide technical assistance to partners. World Water Corps uses an advanced computer program, called Akvo Flow to monitor and acquire data to measure and calculate data regarding the water quality, pressure, and concentration in the constructed infrastructures. Akvo FLOW conducts intensive handheld data and survey collection using visual map-based reporting tools, web-based dashboards, field-level monitoring, integrated GPS, and custom adaptive surveys. Water For People partners with Akvo to routinely collect, analyze, and report information on water and mineral quality as well as water pressure and flow from aqueducts and nearby bodies of water. Water For People closely monitors and assesses its program outcomes for at least one decade, post-installation, to keep account of its sustainable outcomes and to monitor how local service authorities are managing the infrastructure.\n\nWater For People's global strategic partners are the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Osprey Foundation, LDS Charities, The Rick and Nancy Moskovitz Foundation, and Charity Water. These foundations are its biggest patrons who contribute each over one- million dollars continuously. According to the NGO’s website, it requires local governments to fund some of the infrastructural development in the community that the government oversees. This allows for the local governments to take ownership of the development taking place in their home districts and allows for the NGO to build long-term and trusted relationships with the local authorities. The organization engages in co-investing/financing, in which the Water For People mandates local governments and businesses to invest in the sustainable outcomes that are beneficial to them. The NGO works with local and recipients in deciding the most effective plan for a given community and executing the project together. According to Charity Navigator, the organization is listed as an independent auxiliary, and is not financially affiliated or involved with IRS group ruling with a national, regional, or geographic grouping of organizations. Based on the 2016 financial report from the NGO website, 46% of their proceeds came from foundations, 17% came from private individuals, 4% from In-Kind donation, 7% from committees, 6% from workplace giving, 14% from corporations, 1% from special events, and 5% from other non-governmental- related donors.The organization's website states that it does not receive any money from any type of government entity. Charity Navigator's verifies this claim as well. According to the 2016 IRS tax form on the NGO’s website, they received $20,077,450 in total revenue. Charity Navigator confirms this exact amount, but it goes further to detail that of that amount, $19,239,732 came from contributions, gifts, and grants, $407,327 came from federated campaigns, $206,054 came from fundraising events, $224,337 came from other revenue. On Guidestar.org, you have to pay to access the NGO’s 2016 financial data. However, for 2015, Guidestar recorded that the NGO received $19,045,856. However, in Water For People’s 2015 IRS tax form, it states that the NGO received $18,950,814. This is conflicting in that Water For People's IRS documents are official, however, Guidestar recorder numerical values that do not coincide with the IRS tax forms.\n\nHowever, since much of the gathered financial information presented here comes from the NGO’s official website, it raises skepticism as to whether or not external sources buy into the organization’s self-advocacy for the transparency of its funding and expenditure patterns. According to Charity Navigator using Water For People’s most recent IRS 990 form from 2016, 79.1% of all its revenue in the fiscal year went towards program expenses and services that it delivers.10.9% of the money went towards administrative expenses, 9.9% went toward fundraising expenditures. According to the 2016 financial report from the actual website of Water For People, 79% was spent on programs, 11% spent on administration, and 10% spent on funding. Charity Navigator also conducts fundraising efficiency percentages, which accounts for the amount of money spent to raise $1 in charitable contributions. Based on this calculation, the NGO’s fundraising efficiency was $0.09. Charity Navigator also conducts a working capital ratio score, which measures the number of years a charity can sustain its level of spending using its net available assets or working capital, from its most recent IRS tax form. Water For People got a score of 0.58 years. Water For People got a score of 15.6% for its liabilities to assets score, which measures the financial capacity and sustainability of the NGO looking at the proportion of their total liabilities to their total assets. Charity Navigator reports the NGO’s total expenditures in 2016 as $19,889,740. Of this total, $1,992,727 went towards administrative expenses, $1,944,248 towards fundraising costs, and $15,952,765 was invested into their programs. Its deficit was $187,710 and net assets was $10,351,207. On the NGO’s website, on its IRS 990 tax form, the only numbers that differ from Charity Navigator are the administrative expenses, which are $6,616,063, and the program costs, which are $11,727,731. From 2015, Guidestar reported that Water For People spent a total of $17,115,127, in which out of this amount, $13,330,044 went towards programs, $1,974,794 went to administrative costs, and $1,810,289 went to fundraising. Water For People reported in its 2015 IRS tax form that it spent a total of $18,844,346, in which $5,819,735 in administration, and $1,944,288 in fundraising. There’s a discrepancy here. On Water For People’s website, they have all their audited financial statements from 2005 to 2015. They also have all their IRS Form 990s from 2012 to 2016. They also have their IRS Form 1023 accessible from 1991, where they applied for recognition of tax exemption. They also have their 501 ©(3) document, containing a letter that confirms their tax exemption status from the Internal Revenue Service. On its website, the charity also has its own printed pamphlet, called “Behind the Numbers” from the years 2013 to 2015. The pamphlet explains what the money in the respective fiscal year was able to accomplish in project works around the world. Charity Navigator gave Water For People a financial score of 93.31/100 and a transparency and accountability score of 100/100.\n\nWater For People partners with local governments, the private sector, and other trusted nongovernmental organizations to support their work. They are also partners with Roberts Filter Group, an American water filter production company, and one of the largest suppliers of water-filtration products and services in the United States. The NGO is not politically nor religiously affiliated, as confirmed by the organization’s website and Charity Navigator.\n\nMedium, an online publishing platform, it conducted an investigation on the cost-effectiveness of donating to popular water NGOs in the world today. As it was reporting on the difficulty of investigating NGOs, Medium did a close-up analysis, and among all the water NGO, Water For People provided the most extensive data to the online rating site of its financials and measureable components of impact in the water and sanitation sector. GiveWell, an online organization rating site, conducted a thorough review of water and sanitation organizations in 2011. Water For People declined to give out the very detailed information that Give Well was seeking. Charity Navigator has given Water For People 4 stars out of 4 for the past 15 years. In 2001, the NGO got 3 stars instead.\n\n"}
