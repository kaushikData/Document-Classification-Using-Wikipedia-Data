Three students from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore were burned to death. The Supreme Court of India initially convicted and sentenced the three main accused Muniappan, Nedunchezhian and Ravindran to death observing it was rarest of the rare and earlier the Salem District court had stated that crime was committed \"only for the political career\" .\nBut it was commuted to life imprisonment by the three member bench headed by Justice Gogoi after a review petition in which they accepted , the defence lawyer L. Nageswara Rao's arguments who admitted that the three main accused had indeed taken petrol from a workshop and set fire to the bus which killed the girl students but stated the convicts were acting in mob frenzy and it was case of Diminished responsibility. Tamil Nadu government had recommended the premature release Muniappan, Nedunchezhian and Ravindran ,the Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit rejects the recommendation but the Edappadi K Palaniswami government again recommends there release and the Governor approves it and they was freed from Vellore Jail .\n\nSoon after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party (DMK) came into power in Tamil Nadu in 1996, it filed a series of corruption cases against the former Chief Minister and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) general secretary J. Jayalalithaa, other ministers, and bureaucrats of her government. In the Pleasant Stay hotel case, a Special Court judgement given by Justice V. Radhakrishnan convicted Jayalalithaa and sentenced her to one year of \"rigorous imprisonment\". This led to statewide protests and violence, including damage to public property by AIADMK members. The Protests in Elakiyampatti in Dharmapuri were led by AIADMK Dharmapuri union secretary D.K. Rajendran along with other AIADMK party workers including Nedu alias Nedunchezhiyan, then secretary of the Dharmapuri town unit Madhu alias Ravindran, MGR forum functionary, and P Muniappan, a former panchayat president.\n\nSeventy students from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, were returning from a study tour on two buses with boys and girls in separate buses.While returning they learn the news of Jayalalitha 's conviction in the Pleasant Stay hotel case, Latha one of the lecturers accompanying the students telephones the Vice Chancellor of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University who asks them to go a safe place and travel back to Coimbatore after normally returns.Accordingly they attempt to take the buses to the District Collector’s office.However they unable to go there due to traffic being obstructed due to road roko agitation by AIADMK party men led by Dharmapuri union secretary D.K. Rajendran in violation of prohibitory orders. AIADMK party workers threw petrol bombs inside the bus carrying girls even through it was full of girls with over 44 girls and 2 lecturers and the front-side of the bus caught fire spreading backwards as the back door was locked keys were not handily available , lecturers Latha and Akila and some students manage to come out and through boys from the other bus manage to break the backdoor and pull out some of the girls the fire had spread fast and three girls, Hemalatha from Chennai, V. Gayathri from Virudhachalam and Kokilavani from Namakkal were burned to death, and 16 others were injured. The scenes of the bus burning were captured and broadcast the following day on Sun TV.\n\nThe incident caused anger amongst the student community. Schools and colleges were asked to shut for a week, and students across the state held silent processions and protest marches condemning the act. Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi ordered a CB-CID investigation. Jayalalithaa demanded a CBI probe for a fair trial. During the initial trial held at Krishnagiri court, 20 witnesses became hostile.N.P. Veerasamy the father of Kokilavani one of the girls burnt alive appealed in the Madras High Court seeking a transfer of the case from Dharmapuri as the AIADMK had returned to power in Tamil Nadu and the prosecutor of the case was appointed by it and accused were AIADMK functionaries and party activists.Accepting his appeal the Madras High Court halted the trial and High court Judge V. Kanagaraj calling the trial a `colossal failure and eyewash' he scarped it and ordered a re-trial at Salem court. After a series of delays in appointing a special public prosecutor and problems with missing case bundles, the trial progressed slowly. Seven years after the incident, on 15 February 2007, the Salem court sentenced 3 AIADMK men to death and 25 others to seven years imprisonment. Two others were acquitted, and one person died during the course of the investigation.The judgment was upheld by Madras High Court on December 6, 2007, subsequently by the Supreme Court on August 30, 2010. and later upholding the execution of 3. But it was commuted to life imprisonment after the Defence lawyers L. Nageswara Rao and Sushil Kumar accepted that the AIADMK mob had set fire to the bus but said that the accused only wanted to damage buses and that killing was not pre-planned but a spur of the moment reaction and the Supreme Court of India accepted the argument of Diminished responsibility .\nDharmapuri AIADMK leader D.K. Rajendran and the first accused in the case the then union secretary for Dharmapuri who organised the road roko protest and was originally convicted for 7 years which was later reduced to 2 years courted controversy when it was found he was holding four positions cooperative milk society and he resigned after the Madras High Court \"deep anguish and displeasure\" that a convict could hold positions despite being statutory disqualified due to his conviction.\nA granite structure has been built as a memorial for with names of V. Gayatri, K. Hemalatha and V. Kokilavani engraved for the dead girls in the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University hostel.The girls were aged 20 years at the time of the incident.\n\nThe Tamil Government actually ruled by AIADMK tries to release the three persons involved in this case. Accordingly to prison sources, at least 1,500 prisoners will get the benefit of the general amnesty of the Tamil nadu government. And this list contained these three person (Muniappan, Nedunchezhian and Ravindran) who seems to be AIADMK party members, a tactial and silent move by AIADMK to release their party members. On 19-11-2018, AIADMK men convicted in Dharmapuri college bus burning case set free. \n\nThe Tamil language film \"Kalloori\" was released in December 2007, just days before the Madras High court upheld the judgment of Salem court. The movie is about college life, and climaxed with a bus burning incident. Following public and media demands, the ending was changed.\n\n"}

Abortion is allowed until the 14th week of pregnancy, with abortions after the limit only permitted in special cases. Thoughts on abortions were influenced by the government's One-child policy and pressure from relatives, which led to a high number of sex-selective abortions and abortions after the legal time limit. The human rights activist Chen Guangcheng was arrested for reporting cases of forced abortions in the Shandong province.\n\nTo reduce the high number of sex-selective abortions, the Chinese government banned prenatal sex discernment.\n\nThe Cuban government decriminalized abortion in 1965. Late term abortions (those after 10 weeks), require a formal evaluation that is conducted by a committee of gynecologists and a psychologist. \n\nThe Law of Protection of People's Health passed in 1989 states that: \"Women have the right to have an abortion, to receive gynecological diagnosis and treatment, health check-up during pregnancy, and medical service when giving birth at health facilities.\" \n\nVietnam has also adopted policies to ban and prevent sex-selective abortion, among other countries such as Nepal.\n\nLaos is the has the strictest limitations on legal abortions among current Marxist-Leninist countries; it is only allowed to save the life of the mother.\n\nMany historical Marxist-Leninist countries, primarily in Europe, chose to allow abortion on request or due to socioeconomic factors. The Soviet Union under Stalin and Romania under Ceauşescu, however, took action to further limit abortions, and other Communist countries retained prohibitive laws against them.\n\nDuring the Soviet regime in 1920, Russia legalized abortion, but in 1933, during the Stalinist era, views on it changed. In the Congress of Kiev in 1932, abortion was criticized for decreasing the country's birth rate. Abortion was finally banned in 1933. In her book, \"Sexual Politics\", the radical feminist Kate Millett criticized the Soviet regime for failing to support the social rights of women and homosexual people. The number of officially recorded abortions dropped sharply from 1.9 million in 1935 to 570,000 in 1937, but began to climb just two years later, reaching 755,000 in 1939. On November 23, 1955, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, under Nikita Khrushchev, legalized abortion. \n\nDespite the protests of the Catholic Church, abortion in Poland was allowed on social grounds in 1956, and fully allowed in 1959 to protect the life and morality of women that had unsafe abortions. The abortions were provided by public hospitals.\n\nPrior to 1953, abortion was only allowed to save the mother's life. In 1953 and 1956, the laws legalized abortion until 12 weeks of pregnancy, in cases of socioeconomic factors. In 1973, although abortion was still allowed for social reasons, the list of other acceptable reasons was reduced.\n\nIn East Germany, women under 16 years of age, women over 40, and mothers with at least four children were given the right to abortion after applying to a state commission. Abortion was fully legalized by parliament in 1972.\n\nBefore 1966, Romania had the most liberal laws of abortion in Europe. However, after the rise of power of Nicolae Ceauşescu, Decree 770 only allowed abortion to save the life of the mother. It was also allowed for women over 40 years old or with four or more children. In 1986, the age of tolerance was further raised to 45. The goal of the ban was a larger population that could drive a larger workforce and consumer-led growth, in order to achieve economic independence from the Soviet Union. Over the span of these 23 years, more than 2 million unwanted children, were born and at least 10,000 women died as a result. The 770 Decree was one of the first laws to be repealed right after Ceauşescu's trial and execution on the 25th of December, 1989; more than 1 million abortions were performed the year after, more than three times the number of children born that year.\n\nAn abortion law passed in 1957 allowed termination for, both medical (forming 10% of the cases) and other reasons (the remaining 90%). The law was changed after 1957. The birth ratio decreased, falling below number of abortions. \n\nAbortion was legalized on April 27, 1956. It was only allowed once every 6 months, and no later than the 12th week of pregnancy except for health reasons. To increase the birth rate, the government restricted abortion for certain women in February 1968 by the Decree 188, which discouraged childless women and women with one or two children from having an abortion (although they could possibly have the procedure if they persisted). Only women with three or more children, or women over 45 years ago, had the right to an abortion on request. The time ceiling was also lowered to 10 weeks. In April 1973, women with just one child lost the right to abortion except in cases of rape, incest, medical emergency, if the woman was an unmarried person under the age of 18 with no living children, or if she was over 45 years old with a living child. By 1974, unmarried women were allowed to get an abortion.\n\nAbortion was legalized in 1952. Article 191 of the federal constitution states that \"it is a human right to decide on the birth of children\". All the republics of Yugoslavia passed laws between 1977 and 1979 that regulated abortion; in Croatia, for example, abortion was only allowed until 10 weeks of pregnancy, but in Slovenia it was allowed after the 10 weeks on request.\n\nDuring Enver Hoxha's rule, abortion was only legally allowed to save mother's life, but in practice could be obtained for any reason. The punishment for a woman who had an abortion was social reprimand by re-education through work. By 1989, abortion was officially legalized in cases of rape, incest, and for women under 16 years old, among other reasons.\n\nThe Penal Code from 1950 states that abortion is allowed for \"important reasons\" up to the seventh weeks of pregnancy, but that anyone who performs an abortion for no important reason is subject to up to three years' imprisonment. The lack of specification of \"important reasons\", though, has increased leeway for abortions on request.\n\nInduced abortion in socialist Mongolia was allowed since 1940 to preserve the mother's health, officially recorded in the penal code on July 6, 1960. In 1986, the amendment authorized medical authorities to decide when to perform an abortion, and abortion was fully legalized in 1989.\n\nAccording to the French penal code, abortion in Kampuchea was prohibited, but the general criminal law principles of necessity allowed abortion to save mother's life. Due the period of extended turmoil during the Communist Regime, the laws about abortion then were unclear, and untrained health workers accepted requests for abortions.\n\nThe criminal code from 7 October 1976 only allowed abortion to save the mother's life. The socialist government never changed this law. \n\nThe law of South Yemen only allowed abortion to save the mother's life, as with North Yemen. \n\nAbortion remained prohibited in Angola, and was only allowed in order to save the mother's life.\nBefore 1981, abortion was only allowed to save the mother's life. In 1981, abortion was allowed in case of contraceptive failure. Since then, the law has been interpreted very liberally in some hospitals, leading them to accept women who sign a written statement requesting the abortion.\n\nThe civil code from 8 February 1973 only allowed abortion to save the mother's life, which the socialist government never changed.\n\nAbortion was prohibited, but the general principles of criminal law allowed abortions on grounds of medical necessity, with reports suggesting they were also permitted for less immediately dangerous complications. \n\nAbortion was only allowed to “save the pregnant woman from the grave and permanent danger to life or health that is impossible to avert in any other way”. Although the code does not accept broad health, judicial or socio-economic grounds, and doesn't specify whether a threat to health includes both physical and mental health, it does consider a “grave state of physical or mental distress, especially following rape or incest, or because of extreme poverty” a mitigating circumstance in sentencing.\n\nSince December 16, 1962, abortion was prohibited. The socialist regime never changed the law, but the criminal law's general principles of necessity allowed for an abortion to save the mother's life. \n\nAbortion was prohibited in Madagascar and only allowed to save the mother's life.\n\nThere is no information about the abortion status under the short-lived Grenada socialist government. The current legislation allows abortion to preserve the mother's health.\n\nAlthough Syria only allows abortion to save a mother's life, the de facto autonomous region of the DFNS legalizes abortion for all women. Barbara Anna, a member of the Turkish Communist Party, reflected more broadly on how limits to women’s bodily autonomy relate to the imposition of capitalism and imperialism. She compared the situations in the Middle East where women’s economic activity and sexual freedom is heavily restricted to the situation in the neoliberal capitalist centre, where women’s sexual freedom comes at the expense of constant objectification and commodification.\n\nThe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia supported abortion, despite the laws of Colombia only allowing it in cases of rape, fetal defects, or a need to preserve the mother's health.\n\nArticle XII states that \"The submission of the children and the mother to the authority of the father, who prepares the submission of each one to the authority of the chief, is pronounced dead. The couple consents freely to seek common pleasure. The Commune proclaims freedom of birth: the right to sexual information from childhood, the right to abortion, the right to contraception. As the products cease to be the property of their parents. They live together in their home and run their own lives.\" This was in sharp contrast to the French law at the time, which prohibited abortion.\n"}

{"id": "5772076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5772076", "title": "Blackstone's ratio", "text": "Blackstone's ratio\n\nIn criminal law, Blackstone's ratio (also known as the Blackstone ratio or Blackstone's formulation) is the idea that:\n\nAs expressed by the English jurist William Blackstone in his seminal work, \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", published in the 1760s.\n\nThe idea subsequently became a staple of legal thinking in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions and continues to be a topic of debate. There is also a long pre-history of similar sentiments going back centuries in a variety of legal traditions. The message that government and the courts must err on the side of innocence has remained constant.\n\nThe phrase, repeated widely and usually in isolation, comes from a longer passage, the fourth in a series of five discussions of policy by Blackstone:\n\nThe phrase was absorbed by the British legal system, becoming a maxim by the early 19th century. It was also absorbed into American common law, cited repeatedly by that country's Founding Fathers, later becoming a standard drilled into law students all the way into the 21st century.\nOther commentators have echoed the principle; Benjamin Franklin stated it as, \"it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer\".\n\nDefending British soldiers charged with murder for their role in the Boston Massacre, John Adams also expanded upon the rationale behind Blackstone's Ratio when he stated: \n\nGiven that Hale and Fortescue in English law had made similar statements previously, some kind of explanation is required for the enormous popularity and influence of the phrase across all the Anglo-Saxon legal systems. Cullerne Bown has argued that it \"...can be seen as a new kind of buttress of the law that was required in a new kind of society.\" \n\nThe immediate precursors of Blackstone's Ratio in English law were articulations by Sir Matthew Hale (about 100 years earlier) and Sir John Fortescue (about 200 years before that), both influential jurists in their time.\n\nHale wrote, \"for it is better five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die.\" Fortescue's \"De Laudibus Legum Angliae\" (c. 1470) states that \"one would much rather that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death, than that one innocent person should be condemned and suffer capitally.\" \n\nSome 300 years before Fortescue, the Jewish legal theorist Maimonides wrote that \"the Exalted One has shut this door\" against the use of presumptive evidence, for \"it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.\"\n\nMaimonides argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would progressively lead to convictions merely \"according to the judge's caprice\" and was expounding on both Exodus 23:7 (\"the innocent and righteous slay thou not\") and an Islamic text, [Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi.\n\n[Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi quotes Muhammad as saying, \"Avoid legal punishments as far as possible, and if there are any doubts in the case then use them, for it is better for a judge to err towards leniency than towards punishment\". Another similar expression reads, \"Invoke doubtfulness in evidence during prosecution to avoid legal punishments\". \n\nOther statements, some even older, which seem to express similar sentiments have been compiled by Volokh. A vaguely similar principle, echoing the number ten and the idea that it would be preferable that many guilty people escape consequences than a few innocents suffer them, appears as early as the narrative of the Cities of the Plain in Genesis (at 18:23-32),\n\nWith respect to the destruction of Sodom, the text describes it as ultimately being destroyed, but only after the rescuing of most of Lot's family, the aforementioned \"righteous\" among a city or overwhelming wickedness who, despite the overwhelming guilt of their fellows, were sufficient by their mere presence to warrant a \"stay of execution\" of sorts for the entire region, slated to be destroyed for being uniformly a place of sin. The text continues, \n\nSimilarly, on 3 October 1692, while decrying the Salem witch trials, Increase Mather adapted Fortescue's statement and wrote, \"It were better that Ten Suspected Witches should escape, than that one Innocent Person should be Condemned.\"\n\nParticularly in the United States, Blackstone’s ratio continues to be an active source of debate in jurisprudence. For example Daniel Epps and Laura Appleman exchanged arguments against and in favour of its continuing influence in the Harvard Law Review in 2015. \n\nAuthoritarian personalities tend to take the opposite view; Bismarck is believed to have stated that \"it is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape\". Pol Pot made similar remarks. Wolfgang Schäuble referenced this principle while saying that it is not applicable to the context of preventing terrorist attacks. Former American Vice President Dick Cheney said that his support of American use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against suspected terrorists was unchanged by the fact that 25% of CIA detainees subject to that treatment were later proven to be innocent, including one who died of hypothermia in CIA custody. \"I'm more concerned with bad guys who got out and released than I am with a few that in fact were innocent.\" Asked whether the 25% margin was too high, Cheney responded, \"I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective. ... I'd do it again in a minute.\"\n\nLiberal columnist Ezra Klein supported California's SB 967 \"Affirmative Consent\" law with the same reasoning as Cheney's supported \"enhanced interrogation techniques\". While claiming the law was \"terrible\" and could be used to punish people who did not commit rape, Klein states \"its overreach is precisely its value\" and \"ugly problems don't always have pretty solutions\".\n\nAlexander Volokh cites an apparent questioning of the principle, with the tale of a Chinese professor who responds, \"Better for whom?\"\n"}
{"id": "427484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=427484", "title": "Board of Deputies of British Jews", "text": "Board of Deputies of British Jews\n\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews (historically London Board of Deputies and London Committee of Deputies of British Jews), commonly referred to as the Board of Deputies, is the main representative body of the British Jewish community. Established in London in 1760, when seven Deputies were appointed by the elders of the Sephardi congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews to form a standing committee and pay homage to George III on his accession to the throne; shortly thereafter the Ashkenazi Jewish congregation from Central and Eastern Europe similarly appointed their own \"Secret Committee for Public Affairs\" to deal with any urgent political matters that might arise, and safeguard the interests of British Jews as a religious community, both in the British Isles, and in the colonies. They soon began to meet together as occasions arose, and then on a more frequent basis; by the 1810s they appear to have united as one body.\n\nThe Board has since become a widely recognised forum for the views of the different sectors of the UK Jewish community.\n\nThe Board is led by Marie van der Zyl, who succeeded Jonathan Arkush as President in June 2018.\n\nThe chief executive of the Board is Gillian Merron, a former Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln from 1997 to 2010. From 2009 to 2010 she was Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health at the Department of Health. She leads a team of professional staff including Director of Public Affairs Philip Rosenberg (formerly of Faiths Forum for London).\n\nThe Board receives Deputies elected by affiliated individual synagogues, confederations of synagogues, and other organisations within the Jewish community such as charities and youth groups. It serves as the principal reference point for government, the media and wider society. All matters tending to impact on the life of Jews in Britain fall within the Board's remit, including an active interfaith programme. However some Jews have complained that the board speaks for Jews unaffiliated to synagogues without them being represented on the board. Some ultra-orthodox synagogues have chosen not to be affiliated.\n\nThe Board of Deputies offices are co-located with the United Jewish Israel Appeal in Kentish Town.\n\nThe Board is the British affiliate of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), the world-wide umbrella organisation of Jewish communities and is the UK member of the European Jewish Congress (EJC).\n\nThe most historically notable and longest-serving past president was the Victorian-era banker Moses Montefiore, who in the nineteenth century travelled widely to assist Jewish communities in foreign countries, faced by persecution at the time. A complete list of presidents and interim positions is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIn 2003, the Board, on its web site, reproduced an extract from a US State Department report that suggested that the aid organisation Palestinian Relief and Development Fund (Interpal) was helping to fund terrorist organisations. Interpal threatened to sue for libel, whereupon the Board retracted and apologised for its comments.\n\nThe Board became involved in the Oliver Finegold affair when the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone made comments to a Jewish reporter, Oliver Finegold, comparing him or the newspaper he worked for, to a concentration camp guard. Many individuals and media commentators objected to the remark. Along with the Commission for Racial Equality, the Board filed a complaint to the Standards Board for England, calling for the Mayor to apologise to the reporter. The Mayor made a statement condemning the Holocaust, but stood by his remarks to the journalist, mentioning in passing his belief that the Board of Jewish Deputies only represents a small section of the Jewish community.\n\nIn 2014 at the height of the Israeli military operation in Gaza, the Board received widespread criticism in the Jewish community for a joint statement issued with the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) condemning anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. The statement with its slogan ‘to export peace rather than import conflict’ proved controversial among some on the conservative wing of the Jewish community but was supported by others on the progressive wing and by groups in inter faith circles. The principle of such a statement was approved by the Board by a majority of over 75% at a meeting of the Board on 21 September 2014. In December 2015, the new leadership of the Board distanced itself from the MCB over the latter’s alleged links to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn July 2018, the Board of Deputies suspended Roslyn Pine, deputy for Finchley United Synagogue, for six years following comments described as Islamophobic and admitting to holding anti-Arab views.\n\nAfter Scottish devolution in 1999, the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities was formed to give the Jewish Community of Scotland a single democratically accountable voice in dealings with the Scottish Parliament and Executive, other communities, and other statutory and official bodies. The intention, when it was established was for it to stand in the same relationship to the Scottish Government as the Board of Deputies of British Jews does to the UK Government.\nConsequently, the Council is autonomous in matters devolved by the Scotland Act, such as justice, health and welfare, and community relations, whilst the Board of Deputies speaks for all Britain's Jews on reserved matters such as foreign affairs and equality legislation.\n\n"}
{"id": "13188214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13188214", "title": "Béarlachas", "text": "Béarlachas\n\nBéarlachas () is Irish for \"anglicism\", or words and phrases used in Irish that are influenced by or stem from the English language. The term comes from , the Irish word for the English language, and refers to both simple anglicisms and interlanguage forms. It is a result of bilingualism within a society where there is a dominant, superstrate language (in this case, English) and a minority substrate language with few or no monolingual speakers and a perceived \"lesser\" status (in this case, Irish).\n\n\"Béarlachas\" exists in many forms, from the direct translation of English phrases to the common form of creating verbal nouns from English words by adding the suffix \"-áil\" (this is also used to form verbs from native roots, such as \"trasnáil\", \"cross over\", from \"trasna\" \"across\", \"tuigeáil\" (Connacht, Ulster) \"understanding\" (Munster \"tuiscint\"), from \"tuig\" \"understand\", and so on). \"Táim ag runáil go dtí an siopa\" (\"I'm running towards the shop\") is an example of \"Béarlachas\" as \"runáil\" is a verb created from the English word \"run\" with the Irish suffix \"-áil\" attached; the traditional Irish for this would be \"Táim ag rith go dtí an siopa\".\n\nCalquing also occurs: an English phrase is literally translated into Irish, even though an equivalent Irish phrase already exists. An example of this is \"Moilligh síos\" (\"slow down\" – \"moill\" \"delay\" + \"síos\" \"downwards\", calqued from English), instead of the more traditional \"Maolaigh ar do luas\" (\"reduce your velocity\"), or simply \"Maolaigh!\" (\"Slow down!\").\n\nMany words that are commonly thought by \"purists\" to be \"béarlachas\" have been a part of the Irish language for a long time, and have become \"nativised\". True \"béarlachas\" is where the word or phrase is known to be English and is not felt to be native to the Irish language, just as in the English language certain French or Latin words and phrases are used with the speaker's full knowledge of their \"non-English\" status, such as \"status quo\", \"in situ\", \"plus ça change\", \"c'est la vie\" and \"coup d'état\". At the same time, certain words that are sometimes assumed to be from English are actually from Norse or Norman French, and as such are not \"Béarlachas\". For example:\n\n\nOther words are 'early Béarlachas', having entered the language in the 18th and 19th centuries:\n\n\nWords used for foreign inventions, imports, and so on, where a native Irish word does not exist, are often a macaronic import as well. These are strictly speaking not \"béarlachas\", but examples of loans from foreign languages. In some cases an Irish word has been developed, and in others it has not. This has been a characteristic of word development in the language for as long as written records exist, and is not limited to \"béarlachas\". In some cases the original Irish word is no longer known, or has a different meaning within the same semantic field:\n\nModern forms:\n\nOlder forms:\n\nIn some cases, the foreign loan has an official pronunciation in Irish, and a colloquial one based on English; the colloquial form is \"Béarlachas\", while official form is a Gaelicisation of the foreign word:\n\n\nThe most striking forms of \"Béarlachas\", however, are the names of the letters of the alphabet—the vast majority of which are normally said in the English way, except for —as well as the use of words such as \"bhuel\" (\"well\"), \"dheas\" (\"yes\"), \"no\" (\"no\"), \"jost\" (\"just\"), \"dhiúnó\" (\"you know\" – for \"tá's agat\") and \"álraight\" (\"all right\" – for \"go maith\"). Such words are used with their English syntax in Irish:\n\n\nLetters that are not traditionally used in Irish orthography occur (such as , as well as at the beginning of words), though in older \"Béarlachas\" words the foreign sounds have been gaelicised:\n\n\nMost words that begin with in the language are also foreign loans, as did not exist in prehistoric or early Old Irish (such as \"póg\" \"kiss\" (Old Welsh \"pawg\", Latin \"pacem\" \"peace\"), \"peaca\" (Latin \"pecatum\" \"sin\").\n\nBetween the 1970s and the 1990s, Republican prisoners in Long Kesh (now HM Prison Maze) spoke in Irish. They nicknamed the place \"An Gaoltacht\", a portmanteau replacing the first syllable of the Irish \"Gaeltacht\" (Irish-speaking region) with the English \"gaol/jail\".\n\nIt is thought by some that the Republican slogan \"Tiocfaidh ár lá\" (\"Our day will come\") is a form of \"Béarlachas\", more idiomatic equivalents being \"Beidh ár lá linn\" (\"Our day will be with us\") or \"Beidh ár lá againn\" (\"We will have our day\"). However, the verb \"teacht\", meaning \"come\", is often used in a variety of phrases to express the \"coming\" of days, such as \"tháinig an lá go raibh orm an t-oileán d’fhágaint\" (\"the day came when I had to leave the island)\".\n\nThe same concept also exists within Scottish Gaelic, in which language it is referred to as .

The film chronicles how pro-Palestinian student activists staged a direct action aimed to cancel the former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on campus. The talk by the prime minister had been organized by , a Jewish student organization.\n\nThe documentary portrays the events that took place in a negative light, and reportedly contributed to the ensuing media debate over them. The Concordia Student Union (CSU) responded by taking legal action against its producer.\n\nThe documentary opens with scenes of the violence at the event, depicting fighting between protesters and Jewish students attempting to enter the venue. This is followed by an interview with student Samir Elitrosh, a leader of the Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights and the leader of anti-Israel violence who was later suspended. It also features interviews with Concordia's Hillel president Yoni Petel and Concordia rector Frederick Lowy, and concludes with a discussion of what it sees as the growing trend of anti-Israel activities on North American campuses.\n\nThe documentary presents footage of pro-Palestinian activists breaking windows and pushing and shoving to block the only entry to the lecture hall. The pro-Palestinian students had objected strongly to Netanyahu's attempt to give scheduled speech.\n\nIn a segment of the film Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the conduct of Concordia students:\n\n... what you have is an implantation in North America of this same unforgiving fanaticism that says \"we will not allow the engagement of a contest of ideas, we will not allow a free market of ideas,\" which is precisely a microcosm of the problem that we have in these societies that spawn and produce terrorism. They rigidly control what their people hear and see so that they can control what they think and feel. And this is the essence of the problem. If the real solution to this fanaticism is ventilation, the aeration of various ideas, then you got a whiff of the underlying root cause of terrorism in Concordia. That is the unwillingness to have a free exchange of ideas. The root cause of terrorism is totalitarianism.\n\nIn the film, Thomas Hecht, a former member of the Board of Governors of Concordia University and a Holocaust survivor, states:\n\nIn response to allegations of antisemitism, Elitrosh, leader of the Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, averred that one can be anti-Israel without being antisemitic. He stated that \"Judaism existed before the state of Israel.\"\n\nThe film set off a series of debates regarding student politics and whether anti-Israeli/pro-Palestinian political rallies on campuses were anti-Semitic.\n\nAntonia Zebisias, media critic of the \"Toronto Star\" criticized the documentary for making hyperbolic comparisons between the riot and Kristallnacht, for giving the president of Hillel more air time than was given to the Palestinian side, and for not supporting many of its contentions with facts. It also noted the potential conflict of interests due to the fact that the film was aired on Global TV which is owned by CanWest, the media outlet which in part helped organize the invitation of Netanyahu to speak.\n\nAfter the documentary was broadcast on \"Global Television\", Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) received a number of complaints relating to the program. The complaints were considered under the provisions of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters' (CAB) Code of Ethics and the Radio and Television News Directors Association of Canada (RTNDA) Code of (Journalistic) Ethics. The CBSC concluded that none of the provisions of the either the CAB Code of Ethics or the RTNDA Code of (Journalistic) Ethics were breached.\n\nHimel has defended the film, arguing that \"In my Concordia, we did interview the Arab student, as well as the Jewish student leader Patrick Amar. But Discordia, besides interviewing Elatrash, interviewed a self-hating Jew who agreed with the Arabs. There was no interview with Amar or any other self-respecting Jewish spokesperson.\"\n\n\"Confrontation at Concordia\" was selected as the best international documentary at the 2003 New York International Independent Film and Video Festival.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1876423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876423", "title": "Constituencies of Singapore", "text": "Constituencies of Singapore\n\nConstituencies in Singapore are electoral divisions which may be represented by single or multiple seats in the Parliament of Singapore. Constituencies are classified as either Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) or Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). SMCs are single-seat constituencies but GRCs have between four and six seats in Parliament.\n\nGroup Representation Constituencies (GRCs) are a type of electoral constituency unique to Singaporean politics. GRCs are multi-member constituencies which are contested by teams of candidates from one party - or from independents. In each GRC, at least one candidate or Member of Parliament must be from a minority race: either a Malay, Indian or Other.\n\nIn 1988, the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) amended the Parliamentary Elections Act to create GRCs. The current Act enables the President, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, to create a GRC from three to six electoral wards. In creating GRCs the President is advised by the Elections Department. The initial maximum size for GRCs was three candidates, but this has subsequently been increased. In the 1991 Singaporean general election, the maximum number of candidates was raised from three to four. In 1997 the maximum number of candidates was further raised to six.\n\nGRCs operate with a plurality voting system, voting by party slate, meaning that the party with the largest share of votes wins all seats in the GRC. (This means that even with a one-vote plurality or majority, the winning team gets to win the whole GRC.) All Singaporean GRCs have had a PAP base.\n\nThe official justification for GRCs is to allow minority representation. Former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong argued that the introduction of GRCs was necessary to ensure that Singapore's Parliament would continue to be multiracial in its composition and representation. Opposition parties have criticized GRCs as making it even more difficult for non-PAP candidates to be elected to Parliament. The money required to contest a GRC is considerable as each candidate is required to pay a S$16,000 deposit. This means that contesting a GRC is very costly for opposition parties. The presence of Cabinet Ministers in GRCs is often believed to give the PAP a considerable advantage in the contesting of a GRC. The PAP has used this tactic to its advantage on several occasions. Rather than stand in an uncontested GRC, in 1997, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong shifted his candidacy to where the PAP believed they were most vulnerable, which was the Cheng San GRC. The opposition has charged the government with gerrymandering due to the changing of GRC boundaries at very short notice (see below section on electoral boundaries).\n\nCritics have noted that Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam won the 1981 Anson by-election in a Chinese-majority constituency, and that since the GRC system was implemented, minority representation in Parliament has actually declined.\n\nThe boundaries of electoral constituencies in Singapore are decided by the Elections Department, which is under the control of the Prime Minister's Office. Electoral boundaries are generally announced close to elections, usually a few days before the election itself is announced. There have been accusations of gerrymandering regarding the redrawing of electoral boundaries and the dissolving of constituencies that return a high percentage of votes for parties other than the ruling PAP.\n\nOne of the cases that is often cited as evidence for gerrymandering in Singapore is the case of the Cheng San Group Representation Constituency (GRC). In the 1997 Singaporean general election, the Cheng San GRC was contested by the PAP and the Workers' Party of Singapore (WP). The final results were close, with the PAP winning by 53,553 votes (54.8%) to the WP's 44,132 votes (45.2%). Cheng San GRC had since dissolved thereafter following the 2001 General Elections. Despite the disadvantages assumed by the opposition party in Singapore, the Workers' Party of Singapore would later be successful in taking over a GRC (Aljunied GRC) during the 2011 General Elections, and would later hold on for another term in the subsequent election in 2015 despite winning a tight margin of less than 2%.\n\nAs of the revision of the electorates on August 28, 2017, there were a total of 2,516,608 voters, inclusive of overseas votes. In the most recent General Elections held on September 11, 2015, there were a total of 2,462,926 voters, inclusive of overseas votes.\n\n"}

{"id": "40821009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40821009", "title": "Dialects of Serbo-Croatian", "text": "Dialects of Serbo-Croatian\n\nThe dialects of Serbo-Croatian include the regional varieties of Serbo-Croatian as a whole or as part of its standard varieties: Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian. They are part of the dialect continuum of South Slavic languages that joins the Macedonian dialects to the south, Bulgarian dialects to the southeast and Slovene dialects to the northwest.\n\nThe primary dialects are named after the most common question word for \"what\": Shtokavian (\"štokavski\") uses the pronoun \"što\" or \"šta\", Chakavian (\"čakavski\") uses \"ča\" or \"ca\", Kajkavian (\"kajkavski\"), \"kaj\" or \"kej\". The pluricentric Serbo-Croatian standard language and all four contemporary standard variants are based on the Eastern Herzegovinian subdialect of Neo-Shtokavian. The other dialects are not taught in schools or used by the state media. The Torlakian dialect is often added to the list, though sources usually note that it is a transitional dialect between Shtokavian and the Bulgaro-Macedonian dialects. Burgenland Croatian and Molise Slavic are varieties of the Chakavian dialect spoken outside the South Slavic dialect continuum, which combine influences from other dialects of Serbo-Croatian as well as influences from the dominantly spoken local languages.\n\nAnother common distinction among the dialects is made through the reflex of the long Common Slavic vowel \"jat\" and thus the dialects are divided into Ikavian, Ekavian, and Ijekavian, with the reflects of \"jat\" being /i/, /e/, and /ije/ or /je/ respectively.\n\nThe Proto-Štokavian idiom appeared in the 12th century. In the following century or two, Štokavian was divided into two zones: western, which covered the major part of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slavonia in Croatia, and eastern, dominant in easternmost Bosnia and Herzegovina and greater parts of Montenegro and Serbia. Western Štokavian was principally characterized by three-accentual system, while eastern Štokavian was marked by two-accentual system. According to research of historical linguistics, the Old-Štokavian was well established by the mid-15th century. In this period it was still being mixed with Church Slavonic to varying degrees, as geographically transitory to Čakavian and Kajkavian dialects spoken on the territory of today's Croatia, with which it had constituted a natural dialectal continuum.\n\nOriginally the dialect covered a significantly smaller area than it covers today, meaning that the Štokavian speech had spread for the last five centuries, overwhelmingly at the expense of Čakavian and Kajkavian idioms. Modern areal distribution of these three dialects as well as their internal stratification (Štokavian and Čakavian in particular) is primarily a result of the migrations resulting from the spread of Ottoman Empire on the Balkans. Migratory waves were particularly strong in the 16th–18th century, bringing about large-scale linguistic and ethnic changes on the Central South Slavic area (See: Great Serb Migrations).\n\nBy far the most numerous, mobile and expansionist migrations were those of Ijekavian Štokavian speakers of eastern Herzegovina, who have flooded most of Western Serbia, many areas of eastern and western Bosnia, large swathes of Croatia (Banovina, Kordun, Lika, parts of Gorski kotar, continental parts of northern Dalmatia, some places north of Kupa, parts of Slavonia, southeastern Baranya etc.). This is the reason why Eastern Herzegovinian dialect is the most spoken Serbo-Croatian dialect today, and why it bears the name that is only descriptive of its area of origin. These migrations also played the pivotal role in the spread of Neo-Štokavian innovations.\n\nThe Shtokavian dialect is divided into Old Shtokavian and Neo-Shtokavian subdialects. Subdialects grouped under Old-Shtokavian are the following:\n\nNeo-Shtokavian dialects comprise the following subdialects:\n\nShtokavian is characterized by a number of characteristic historical sound changes, accentual changes, changes in inflection, morphology and syntax. Some of these isoglosses are not exclusive and have also been shared by neighboring dialects, and some of them have only overwhelmingly but not completely been spread on the whole Štokavian area. The differences between Štokavian and the neighboring Eastern South Slavic dialects of Bulgaria and Macedonia are clear and largely shared with other Western South Slavic dialects, while the differences to the neighboring Western South Slavic dialect of Čakavian and Kajkavian are much more fluid in character, and the mutual influence of various subdialects and idioms play a more prominent role.\n\nGeneral characteristics of Štokavian are the following:\n\nAs can be seen from the list, many of these isoglosses are missing from certain Štokavian idioms, just as many of them are shared with neighboring non-Štokavian dialects.\n\nChakavian is the oldest written Serbo-Croatian dialect that had made a visible appearance in legal documents - as early as 1275 (\"Istrian land survey\") and 1288 (\"Vinodol codex\"), the predominantly vernacular Chakavian is recorded, mixed with elements of Church Slavic. Archaic Chakavian can be traced back to 1105 in the Baška tablet. All these and other early Chakavian texts up to 17th century are mostly written in Glagolitic alphabet.\n\nInitially, the Chakavian dialect covered a much wider area than today including about two thirds of medieval Croatia: the major part of central and southern Croatia southwards of Kupa and westwards of Una river, as well as western and southwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina. During and after the Ottoman intrusion and subsequent warfare (15th–18th centuries), the Chakavian area has become greatly reduced and in the Croatian mainland it has recently been almost entirely replaced by Shtokavian, so it is now spoken in a much smaller coastal area than indicated above.\n\nChakavian is now mostly reduced in southwestern Croatia along the eastern Adriatic: Adriatic islands, and sporadically in the mainland coast, with rare inland enclaves up to central Croatia, and minor enclaves in Austria and Montenegro.\n\nThe Chakavian dialect comprises the following subdialects:\n\nThere is no generally accepted opinion on the set of characteristics a dialect has to possess to be classified as Chakavian (rather than its admixture with Shtokavian or Kajkavian), but the following characteristics are most commonly proposed:\n\n\nBesides the usual Chakavian (with typical pronoun \"ča\"), in some Adriatic islands and in eastern Istra another special variant is also spoken which lacks most palatals, with other parallel deviations called \"tsakavism\" (cakavizam):\n\nThe largest area of tsakavism is in eastern Istra at Labin, Rabac and a dozen nearby villages; minor mainland enclaves are the towns Bakar and Trogir. Tsakavism is also frequent in Adriatic islands: part of Lošinj and nearby islets, Baška in Krk, Pag town, the western parts of Brač (Milna), Hvar town, and subentire Vis with adjacent islets.\n\nDialectogical investigations of the Kajkavian dialect had begun at the end of the 19th century: the first comprehensive monograph was written in Russian by Ukrainian philologist A. M. Lukjanenko in 1905 (\"Kajkavskoe narečie\"). Kajkavian is not only a folk dialect, but in the course of history of Serbo-Croatian it has been the written public language (along with the corpus written in Čakavian and Štokavian). Kajkavian was the last to appear on the scene, mainly due to economic and political reasons. Although the first truly vernacular Serbo-Croatian texts (i.e. not mixed with Church Slavonic) go back to the 13th century (Chakavian) and to the 14th century (Shtokavian), the first Kajkavian published work was \"Pergošić\"'s \"Decretum\" from 1574. After that, numerous works appeared in Serbo-Croatian Kajkavian literary language in the following centuries.\n\nKajkavian literary language gradually fell into disuse since Croatian National Revival, ca. 1830–1850, when leaders of the Croatian National Unification Movement (the majority of them being Kajkavian native speakers themselves) adopted the most widespread and developed Serbo-Croatian Shtokavian literary language as the basis for the Croatian standard language. However, after a period of lethargy, the 20th century has witnessed new flourishing of literature in Kajkavian dialect – this time as Croatian dialectal poetry, main authors being Antun Gustav Matoš, Miroslav Krleža, Ivan Goran Kovačić, Dragutin Domjanić, Nikola Pavić etc. Nowadays, Kajkavian lexical treasure is being published by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in \"Rječnik hrvatskoga kajkavskoga književnoga jezika\"/\"Dictionary of the Croatian Kajkavian Literary Language\", 8 volumes (1999).\n\nKajkavian is spoken in North Croatia, including the capital Zagreb, as well as in a few enclaves in Austria, Hungary, and Romania. Though its speakers are ethnic Croats and Kajkavian is thus generally considered a dialect of Serbo-Croatian, it is closer to neighboring Slovene than it is to Chakavian or Shtokavian. The Kajkavian area of Croatia is bordered on the northwest by Slovene language territory. It is bordered on the east and southeast by Shtokavian dialects roughly along a line that was the former division between Civil Croatia and the Habsburg Military Frontier; in southwest along Kupa and Dobra rivers, it persisted in ancient (medieval) contact with Chakavian dialects.\n\nThe major cities in northern Croatia with prevailing urban Kajkavians are chiefly Zagreb (old central city, Sesvete and V. Gorica), Koprivnica, Krapina, Križevci, Varaždin, Čakovec, etc. The typical and archaic Kajkavian is today spoken chiefly in Zagorje hills and Medjimurje plain, and in adjacent areas of northwestern Croatia where other immigrants and Štokavian standard had much less influence. The most peculiar Kajkavian archidiom \"(Baegnunski)\" is spoken at Bednja in northernmost Croatia. The mixed half-Kajkavian towns along the eastern and southern edge of Kajkavian speaking area are Pitomača, Čazma, Kutina, Popovača, Sunja, Petrinja, Ozalj, Ogulin, Fužine, and Čabar, with included newer Štokavian enclaves of Bjelovar, Sisak, Glina, Dubrava, Zagreb and Novi Zagreb. The southernmost Kajkavian villages are Krapje at Jasenovac; and Pavušek, Dvorišče and Hrvatsko selo in Zrinska Gora.\n\nKajkavian dialects have been classified along various criteria: Serbian philologist Aleksandar Belić had divided (1927) the Kajkavian dialect according to the reflexes of Proto-Slavic phonemes /tj/ and /DJ/ into three subdialects: eastern, northwestern and southwestern. However, later investigations have not corroborated Belić's division. Contemporary Kajkavian dialectology originates mainly from Croatian philologist Stjepan Ivšić's work \"Jezik Hrvata kajkavaca\"/The Language of Kajkavian Croats, 1936, which is based on accentuation characteristics. Due to great diversity of Kajkavian speech, primarily in phonetics, phonology and morphology – the Kajkavian dialectological atlas is notable for its bewildering proliferation of subdialects: from four identified by Ivšić, up to six proposed by Croatian linguist Brozović (formerly accepted division) and even as many as fifteen, according to a monograph authored by Croatian linguist Mijo Lončarić (1995).\n\nThe most commonly accepted division of Kajkavian dialect lists the following subdialects:\n\nKajkavian is closely related to Slovene and to the Prekmurje dialect in particular. The speakers of Prekmurje dialect are Slovenes and Hungarian Slovenes who belonged to the Archdiocese of Zagreb during the Habsburg era. Higher amounts of correspondences between the two exist in inflection and vocabulary. Some Kajkavian words also bear a closer resemblance to other Slavic languages (such as Russian) than they do to Shtokavian or Chakavian. For instance \"gda\" seems (at first glance) to be unrelated to \"kada\", however, when compared to the Russian \"когда\", the relationship becomes more apparent, at the same time in Slovene: \"kdaj,\" in Prekmurje Slovene \"gda, kda\". Kajkavian \"kak\" (\"how\") and \"tak\" (\"so\") are exactly like their Russian cognates, as compared to Shtokavian and Chakavian \"kako\" and \"tako,\" in Prekmurje Slovene in turn \"tak, kak\" (in Slovene like Chakavian: \"tako, kako\"). (This vowel loss occurred in most other Slavic languages; Shtokavian is a notable exception, whereas the same feature of Macedonian is probably not a Serbian influence, because the word is preserved in the same form in Bulgarian, to which Macedonian is much more closely related than to Serbian.). Another distinctive feature of Kajkavian is the use of another future tense. Instead of Shtokavian and Chakavian future I (\"ću\", \"ćeš\", and \"će\" + infinitive), Kajkavian speakers use future II (\"bum\", \"buš\" and \"bu\" + active verbal adjective). Future II in Standard Croatian can only be used in subordinate clauses to refer to a condition or an action which will occur before other future action. For example, the phrase \"I'll show you\" is \"Ti bum pokazal\" in Kajkavian whereas in standard Croatian it is \"Pokazat ću ti\". This is a feature shared with Slovene: \"bom\", \"boš\", \"bo\".\n\nThe Serbo-Croatian dialects differ not only in the question word they are named after, but also heavily in phonology, accentuation and intonation, case endings and tense system (morphology) and basic vocabulary. In the past, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have subsequently been replaced by Štokavian during the period of migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 15th and the 16th century. These migrations caused the koinéisation of the Shtokavian dialects, that used to form the West Shtokavian (more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects) and East Shtokavian (transitional towards the Torlakian and the whole Bulgaro-Macedonian area) dialect bundles, and their subsequent spread at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian. As a result, Štokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined, and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where subliterary dialects are still being spoken.\n\nThe main bundle of isoglosses separates Kajkavian and Slovenian dialects on the one hand from Štokavian and Čakavian on the other. These are:\n\nOther characteristics distinguishing Kajkavian from Štokavian, beside the demonstrative/interrogatory pronoun \"kaj\" (as opposed to \"što/šta\" used in Štokavian), are:\n\nCharacteristics distinguishing Čakavian from Štokavian, beside the demonstrative/interrogatory pronoun \"ča\", are:\n\nThe differences among the dialects can be illustrated on the example of Schleicher's fable. Diacritic signs are used to show the difference in accents and prosody, which are often quite significant, but which are not reflected in the usual orthography.\n\nThe Torlakian dialects are intermediate between the Eastern and Western branches of South Slavic, and have been variously described, in whole or in parts, as belonging to either group. In the 19th century, their classification was hotly contested between Serbian and Bulgarian writers.\n\nMost Serbian linguists (like Pavle Ivić and Asim Peco) classify Torlakian as an Old-Shtokavian dialect, referring to it as Prizren-Timok dialect. However, this opinion was not shared by the Croatian linguists and thus Milan Rešetar classified the Torlak dialects (which he called \"Svrlijg\") as a different group from Shtokavian.\n\nAll old Bulgarian scientists as Benyo Tsonev, Gavril Zanetov and Krste Misirkov classified Torlakian as dialect of Bulgarian language. They noted the manner of the articles, the loss of most of the cases, etc. Today Bulgarian linguists (Stoyko Stoykov, Rangel Bozhkov) also classify Torlakian as a \"Belogradchik-Tran\" dialect of Bulgarian, and claim that it should be classified outside the Shtokavian area. Stoykov further argued that the Torlak dialects having a grammar that is closer to Bulgarian was indicative of them being originally Bulgarian.\n\nIn Macedonian dialectology, the Torlakian varieties spoken on Macedonian territory (Kumanovo, Kratovo and Kriva Palanka dialects) are classified as part of a North-Eastern group of Macedonian dialects.\n\nThe Torlakian dialects, together with Bulgarian and Macedonian, display many properties of the Balkan linguistic area, a set of structural convergence features shared also with other languages of the Balkans such as Albanian and Aromanian. In terms of areal linguistics, they have therefore been described as part of a prototypical \"Balkan Slavic\" area, as opposed to other parts of Serbo-Croatian, which are only peripherally involved in the convergence area.\n\nBurgenland Croatian (\"gradišćanskohrvatski jezik\") is a regional variety of the Chakavian dialect spoken in Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is recognized as a minority language in the Austrian state of Burgenland where it is spoken by 19,412 people according to official reports (2001).\n\nThis variety was the language of Croatian refugees who fled Croatia during the Turkish Wars and settled in the western part of what was then Hungary, the area where they still live. Burgenland Croats included speakers of all three dialects of the Croatian language (Shtokavian, Chakavian and Kajkavian), with the majority being the Chakavians who originally came from the northern Adriatic coast. Burgenland Croats did not take part in the shaping of the present Croatian standard language in the 19th century. Instead, they constructed their own written standard based mainly on the local Chakavian speech and adopted the Croatian alphabet, a modified Latin alphabet, as their script.\n\nIt is still a matter of debate whether Burgenland Croatian should be classified as a Slavic micro-language of its own. Burgenland Croatian dialects are mostly viewed as isolated dialects of the Croatian language. Burgenland Croatian and the Prekmurje dialect of Slovene (spoken in Prekmurje and Hungary) was to press with interact. The first Prekmurje Slovene works (for example Old hymn-book of Martjanci) was applied to the Burgenland Croatian books. A few writers of the Prekmurje dialect were of Burgenland Croatian descent (for example Jakab Szabár) and also the Burgenland Croatian language (József Ficzkó).\n\nThe variety uses the Latin alphabet with the same diacritical modifiers as the Croatian alphabet. In the course of language development it acquired some of its own specialised vocabulary, sometimes different from that used in standard Croatian. Sampled differences from standard Croatian are presented in the table in turn.\n\nBurgenland Croatian written language is based mainly on the local Chakavian speech with some influences from the other Croatian dialects spoken in Burgenland. These dialects include:\n\nMolise Slavic or \"Slavomolisano\" is a variety of the Shtokavian dialect with some Chakavian influences spoken in the province of Campobasso, in the Molise Region of southern Italy, in the villages of Montemitro (\"Mundimitar\"), Acquaviva Collecroce (\"Živavoda Kruč\") and San Felice del Molise (\"Štifilić\"). There are fewer than 1,000 active speakers, and fewer than 2,000 passive speakers. The language has been preserved since a group of Croats emigrated from Dalmatia abreast of advancing Ottoman Turks. The residents of these villages speak a Chakavian dialect with Ikavian accent. The Molise Croats, however, consider themselves to be Italians who speak a Slavic language, rather than ethnic Slavs. Some speakers call themselves \"Zlavi\" or \"Harvati\" and call their language simply \"na našo\" (\"our language\").\n\nThe language was preserved until today only in the aforementioned three villages, although several villages in Molise and Abruzzo region are aware of their Slavic and Croat ancestry. The existence of this Croat colony was unknown outside Italy until 1855 when Medo Pucić, a linguist from Dubrovnik, during one of his journeys in Italy overheard a tailor in Naples speaking with his wife in a language very similar to Pucić's own. The tailor then told him that he came from the village of Kruč, then part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Subsequently, the \"Gajica\", the modern Croatian alphabet, was adopted to the language.\n\nThe language is highly Italianized and also retains many archaic features. Because the colony was established before the discovery of the Americas, all the names of animals and plants introduced from the Americas are borrowed from Italian or created from whole cloth. Along with these, Molise Slavic features the following characteristics:\n\nA basic distinction among the dialects is in the reflex of the long Common Slavic vowel \"jat\", usually transcribed as *ě. Depending on the reflex, the dialects are divided into Ikavian, Ekavian, and Ijekavian, with the reflects of \"jat\" being /i/, /e/, and /ije/ or /je/ respectively. The long and short \"jat\" is reflected as long or short */i/ and /e/ in Ikavian and Ekavian, but Ijekavian dialects introduce a \"ije\"/\"je\" alternation to retain a distinction.\n\nStandard Croatian and Bosnian are based on Ijekavian, whereas Serbian uses both Ekavian and Ijekavian forms (Ijekavian for Montenegrin, Croatian and Bosnian Serbs; Ekavian for most of Serbia). Influence of standard language through state media and education has caused non-standard varieties to lose ground to the literary forms.\n\nThe jat-reflex rules are not without exception. For example, when short \"jat\" is preceded by \"r\", in most Ijekavian dialects developed into /re/ or, occasionally, /ri/. The prefix \"prě-\" (\"trans-, over-\") when long became \"pre-\" in eastern Ijekavian dialects but to \"prije-\" in western dialects; in Ikavian pronunciation, it also evolved into \"pre-\" or \"prije-\" due to potential ambiguity with \"pri-\" (\"approach, come close to\"). For verbs that had \"-ěti \" in their infinitive, the past participle ending \"-ěl\" evolved into \"-io\" in Ijekavian Neoštokavian.\n\nThe following are some examples:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966753", "title": "Ecocentrism", "text": "Ecocentrism\n\n\"Ecocentric\"' (; from Greek: οἶκος \"oikos\", \"house\" and κέντρον \"kentron\", \"center\") is a term used in ecological political philosophy to denote a nature-centered, as opposed to human-centered (i.e. anthropocentric), system of values. The justification for ecocentrism usually consists in an ontological belief and subsequent ethical claim. The ontological belief denies that there are any existential divisions between human and non-human nature sufficient to claim that humans are either (a) the sole bearers of intrinsic value or (b) possess greater intrinsic value than non-human nature. Thus the subsequent ethical claim is for an equality of intrinsic value across human and non-human nature, or 'biospherical egalitarianism'.\n\nAccording to Stan Rowe:\n\nand:\n\nThe ecocentric ethic was conceived by Aldo Leopold and recognizes that all species, including humans, are the product of a long evolutionary process and are inter-related in their life processes. The writings of Aldo Leopold and his idea of the land ethic and good environmental management are a key element to this philosophy.\nEcocentrism focuses on the biotic community as a whole and strives to maintain ecosystem composition and ecological processes. The term also finds expression in the first principle of the deep ecology movement, as formulated by Arne Næss and George Sessions in 1984\nwhich points out that anthropocentrism, which considers humans as the center of the universe and the pinnacle of all creation, is a difficult opponent for ecocentrism.\n\nEnvironmental thought and the various branches of the environmental movement are often classified into two intellectual camps: those that are considered anthropocentric, or \"human-centred,\" in orientation and those considered biocentric, or \"life-centred\". This division has been described in other terminology as \"shallow\" ecology versus \"deep\" ecology and as \"technocentrism\" versus \"ecocentrism\". Ecocentrism can be seen as one stream of thought within environmentalism, the political and ethical movement that seeks to protect and improve the quality of the natural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities by adopting environmentally benign forms of political, economic, and social organization and through a reassessment of humanity's relationship with nature. In various ways, environmentalism claims that non-human organisms and the natural environment as a whole deserve consideration when appraising the morality of political, economic, and social policies.\n\nEcocentrism is taken by its proponents to constitute a radical challenge to long-standing and deeply rooted anthropocentric attitudes in Western culture, science, and politics. Anthropocentrism is alleged to leave the case for the protection of non-human nature subject to the demands of human utility, and thus never more than contingent on the demands of human welfare. An ecocentric ethic, by contrast, is believed to be necessary in order to develop a non-contingent basis for protecting the natural world. Critics of ecocentrism have argued that it opens the doors to an anti-humanist morality that risks sacrificing human well-being for the sake of an ill-defined ‘greater good’. Deep ecologist Arne Naess has identified anthropocentrism as a root cause of the ecological crisis, human overpopulation, and the extinctions of many non-human species. Others point to the gradual historical realization that humans are not the centre of all things, that \"A few hundred years ago, with some reluctance, Western people admitted that the planets, Sun and stars did not circle around their abode. In short, our thoughts and concepts though irreducibly anthropomorphic need not be anthropocentric.\"\n\nIndustrocentrism is an ideology that goes hand in hand with today's industrial neoliberal capitalist agenda. It sees all things on earth as resources to be utilized by humans or to be commodified. This view is the opposite of anthropocentrism and ecocentrism. It negatively affects humans, nonhumans, and the environment in the long run in that it only focuses on short term economic gratification.\n\nEcocentrism is also contrasted with technocentrism (meaning values centred on technology) as two opposing perspectives on attitudes towards human technology and its ability to affect, control and even protect the environment. Ecocentrics, including \"deep green\" ecologists, see themselves as being subject to nature, rather than in control of it. They lack faith in modern technology and the bureaucracy attached to it. Ecocentrics will argue that the natural world should be respected for its processes and products, and that low impact technology and self-reliance is more desirable than technological control of nature.\nTechnocentrics, including imperialists, have absolute faith in technology and industry and firmly believe that humans have control over nature. Although technocentrics may accept that environmental problems do exist, they do not see them as problems to be solved by a reduction in industry. Rather, environmental problems are seen as problems to be solved using science. Indeed, technocentrics see that the way forward for developed and developing countries and the solutions to our environmental problems today lie in scientific and technological advancement.\n\nThe distinction between biocentrism and ecocentrism is ill-defined. Ecocentrism recognizes Earth's interactive living and non-living systems rather than just the Earth's organisms (biocentrism) as central in importance.\nThe term has been used by those advocating \"left biocentrism\", combining deep ecology with an \"anti-industrial and anti-capitalist\" position (David Orton et al.).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "934707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=934707", "title": "England First Party", "text": "England First Party\n\nThe England First Party (EFP) was an English nationalist political party. It had two councillors on Blackburn with Darwen council between 2006 and 2007.\n\nThey were formed in 2004 by Mark Cotterill who had been the founder and chairman of American Friends of the British National Party (BNP). However, he began to disagree with the BNP politically, and so formed the EFP, after a spell in the White Nationalist Party.\n\nThe EFP differed from the BNP in its analysis of the United Kingdom. It criticised British nationalism and supported English nationalism instead. Most members of the EFP were former BNP members like their chairman, Cotterill.\n\nThe EFP campaigned against the creation of regional assemblies across England. They also campaigned on issues such as opposing immigration in England and opposing the UK's continued membership of the European Union.\n\nOn the economy, the EFP supported the gradual nationalisation of most national and public services in attempts to achieve autarky. While not aiming to abolish capitalist ownership, the EFP claimed the interests of workers to be paramount and subsequently supported worker co-operatives. The EFP also aimed to end the connections between trade unions and the Labour Party while encouraging trade union membership and re-nationalising and re-opening coalmines which had a \"reasonable working life\".\n\nAccording to the accounts filed with the Electoral Commission the party had 27 full members at year-end 2004 and 85 'supporters'. By the end of 2005 this had increased to 39 paid members and 97 registered supporters. For the year end 2007 the party recognised \"100 supporters\". By year end 2010, England First had 42 full members and recognised 111 supporters.\n\nIt sold a magazine \"Heritage and Destiny\", which ran issues every year from July 1999. It provided news on the progress of racial nationalism in Britain, Europe and America.\n\nThe EFP was criticised for a section of its manifesto that promised \"the abolition of all non-European faiths and religions\". On 4 June 2010 Mark Cotterill issued a statement that \"[f]ar from wishing to ‘abolish’ any religion (from the East or West!), the EFP is committed to traditional English values of religious freedom.\" A later version of the party manifesto, last edited 28 April 2010, did not contain the call for abolition of non-European religions.\n\nIn their first electoral test, a local government by-election in February 2004 for the Heysham South ward in Lancaster, the EFP polled 14%. In the May 2004 local elections, the EFP contested three seats in Blackburn, Preston and Macclesfield, polling an average of 18% of the vote.\n\nTwo candidates contested the May 2006 local elections in Blackburn, polling an average of 37% of the vote and both were elected as councillors. In a by-election in the East Rural ward of Blackburn in September 2006, they polled 13%. They also contested a by-election in the Danehouse and Stoneyholme ward in Burnley in February 2007, polling 7%. Despite the party campaigning for a ban on mixed-race marriages it was revealed that one of the two elected councillors was reported to have a grandfather from Cameroon. Steven Smith and Simon Bennett stood in the Cliviger with Worsthorne and Queensgate wards respectively, at the 2007 Burnley council elections. Smith came a very distant second with Bennett third in a closer vote.\n\nThe EFP fielded seven candidates for the 2010 local elections three of them to compete against the BNP in Stoke, but it did not stand in the general election and they had encouraged EFP supporters to vote for the National Front.\n\nIt came fourth place with 606 votes in the Longton North ward, fifth place with 117 votes in the Weston and Meir ward and sixth place in the Fenton ward with 236 votes in the Stoke-on-Trent local elections.\n\nIn the Preston Ribbleton ward, Mark Cotterill came fourth place with 315 votes; it came fourth place in the St James ward in Oldham with 425 votes, in the Bradley ward of Pendle it received 279 coming fourth place and sixth place in the Ince ward of Wigan with 134 votes.\n\nIn March 2007 the EFP's two councillors announced their intentions to quit. Michael Johnson stated that he would be joining a new party created by himself and Tony Melia For Darwen, while Mark Cotterill signalled his intention to stand down as a councillor and party leader at the 3 May local elections. Johnson's move followed a rift with the party after he objected to an anti-Islamic cartoon of Jesus on YouTube, while Cotterill—who remained a leading EFP activist—has put his decision down to a work-related move to Preston.\n\nOn 1 May 2009, a former British National Party councillor, John Gamble, confirmed that he had defected to the EFP, after criticising the BNP. In the preceding months, he had become increasingly disillusioned with the BNP’s national and local leadership, this resulted in him being expelled from the BNP. He sat as an independent for a few days and then he decided to \"join a party that offers a serious, radical challenge to the corrupt political establishment\".\n\nOn 12 March 2010, John Gamble defected from the EFP to the National Front. This was after he told \"The Star\" newspaper in Sheffield he had 'jumped ship' to the NF because he wanted to join a 'more active' organisation than England First.\n\nOn 1 April 2010, Gamble defected back to England First because he stated to \"The Star\", \"I am not aware of the severity of these opinions\" when some of the NF's recorded views were put to him. On 5 April 2010 England First refused to take him back. England First's chairman, Mark Cotterill, said: \"While we have nothing against Cllr. Gamble, the fact is that despite his various and contradictory public statements he has had no involvement with the EFP – and is no longer an EFP member.\" Mr Cotterill went on to release a statement to \"The Sheffield Star\" saying, \"We don't want anything to do with Councillor Gamble. He has done nothing for the party, and when he left we washed our hands of him.\"\n\nIn May 2009, the England First Party decided to stand a candidate in the County council elections in Lancashire but did not stand any European candidates. For the European Parliament, the England First Party worked with the English Democrats and attended and spoke at the English Democrats' conference in Darwen. Cotterill stated that the parties had differences on race, immigration and independence but they had in common withdrawal from EU and putting England first.\n\nThe party was de-registered on 14 June 2012, and as such the name \"England First Party\" cannot be used on ballot papers by candidates at elections.\n"}
{"id": "42318857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42318857", "title": "Export-oriented employment", "text": "Export-oriented employment\n\nExport-oriented employment refers to employment in multinational corporations' international industrial factories, usually located in developing countries. Such factories produce goods and services for sale in other countries. While these multinational producers have globally expanded women’s access to employment, evidence suggests they do so by reinforcing traditional gender roles or creating new gender inequalities.\n\nWork in international factories has become an option for women in developing countries. This opportunity, which has increased since the latter part of the 1960s, represents the production of goods to be sold explicitly to more developed countries.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, developing countries emerged as the sites to relocate labor-intensive manufacturing industries, as they were moved away from developed countries. This expansionism has forced developing countries to create and sell assembled products and other goods to more developed countries. Upon greater enhancement, developing countries were able to bolster their industrialized processes by swapping imported goods in favor of goods produced domestically. However, within the last 40 years this process eroded due in part to technological development, changes in regulation, and higher employment costs in more developed countries. Additionally, international trade has expanded in a distinct manner that is linked to manufacturing processes.\n\nFrom the 1970s forward, the global marketplace and the makeup of the labor force has had transformations by way of technological innovation, work structure, and new forms of controlling labor. Because of changes in the wider labor market, women have joined the labor force in greater numbers and tended to remain a part of the force. Moreover, many male employees have often been moved to less desirable jobs, if not placed outside of the labor market entirely. Additionally, those characteristics commonly related to female employment such as temporary arrangements, low wages, and job instability have risen. Moreover, these patterns have increased vis-a-vis characteristics identified with male labor, such as unionization and job security. Consequently, the expansion of export-oriented employment is a major contributor to what some have called, \"the global feminization of labor\" in the post-1980 period.\n\nCurrently one of the most significant examples of export-oriented employment is the Bangladesh textile industry. By 2013, about 4 million people, mostly women, worked in Bangladesh's $19 billion-a-year industry, export-oriented ready-made garment (RMG) industry. Sixty percent of the export contracts of western brands are with European buyers and about forty percent with American buyers.\n\nGender roles vary by society, but are often based in social ideas that women have different natural abilities and a more suitable temperament for certain work as compared to men. Typically, women have been the preferred labor force in export-oriented factories because they allow for lower unit labor costs. Additionally, women are often deemed more physically dexterous and are regarded as more tempered in reference to their personality. As a result of which, some have argued that women are stereotyped as being better able to complete tasks that are mundane.\n\nThere is evidence to support the argument that women receive such perceived traits or skills in a non-formal and independent setting. However, as a result of which, women's skills employed in a factory setting are likely to be viewed as less valuable compared to other skill sets. Thus, women can be described as being relegated to an inferior status because their abilities are not equally valued. Finally, while women in factory settings are often unfairly demoted and forced into submissive roles, they are aware of their perceived lower status and do not accept it.\n\nDominguez et al. (2010) note that in processing centers located in Mexico, employers favored hiring married females. In this context, Dominguez et al. note that married women were seen as more dependable and as a result of which, better employees. The same authors also note that employers put forth that such a system allowed the families of those hired to be better supported. However, Dominguez et al. claim such a stance by employers is a decision that relegates women to a specific role based on gender and allows for greater control of the given workers.\n\nIn a 2003 analysis of a Chinese electronics producer, Pun Ngai found that surveyed workers sought employment by migrating from a variety of areas across the country and generally were employed for a period that was less than 36 months. The workers surveyed by Ngai were largely in their early 20s and nearly three-quarters were female.\n\nIn an examination of Chinese factories producing electronic goods for the west, including Apple and Microsoft, reporting indicates that workers are often paid less than 2 USD per hour.\n\nIn the latter part of 2011, weekly payments for minimum wage workers in Cambodia's garment industry totaled 8117 Riel. Despite the fact that workers have others who rely upon their wages, manufacturing entities are well aware that they do not provide sustainable wages. Moreover, for Cambodian garment manufacturers to remain competitive, factory owners must keep wages low. Creating higher wages poses risks for factory owners that other countries accepting export orders will usurp their place. However, despite the allure that factory jobs provide for rural workers, rapidly falling wages risk alienating this mass of people.\n\nBeginning in the at the start of the millennium and ending in 2010, workers in Cambodia's garment sector have seen their inflation adjusted wages decrease by nearly 17%. These wages are expected to continue to fall almost twofold through the year of 2014.\n\nIn 2012, evidence that workers in Cambodia's garment sector were burdened by unreasonable overtime hours was found to be common place in factories monitored by \"Better Factories Cambodia,\" a group originally designated to oversee and improve factory conditions. As product orders often ebb and flow, managers require extended hours from their employees. Additionally, managers can eliminate additional costs by imposing excessive overtime on fewer workers, versus giving a greater share of benefits to a larger population with less overtime.\n\nIn discussions with Cambodia's garment sector workers, many have noted that burdensome overtime was particularly strenuous, but also necessary because of falling wages. Moreover, workers in the industry have called for the option to choose when to engage in overtime hours, versus required overtime work delegated to them.\n\nPun Ngai has analyzed labor systems in Chinese dormitories that are intertwined with production sites and labor. In this analysis, evidence is put forth that details how migrant laborers in export-processing areas have been forced into such residences that allow for complete worker control. This control comes from the dormitory grounds being secured by security guards that prevent worker exits. This structure is often rationalized as a benefit to the workers, whom the factory owners view as being in need of security and extra discipline.\n\nAdditionally, dormitories of this kind can house hundreds of workers, where as many as twenty workers may share a room. While such conditions can be detrimental to workers, it can also be a shared source of discomfort through which workers may more easily unite for common causes.\n\nIn 2012, a fire erupted in a garment factory in Karachi, Pakistan that killed approximately 300 people. Facing imminent death, many workers leapt from upper levels of the factory, leading to many injuries as they landed. Furthermore, tools to fight fires at the factory were lacking, and fire exits had been tampered with or were non-existent. \nIn 2013, 2013 a garment factory in Bangladesh collapsed, killing at least 1000 people and injuring approximately 2500 others. A worker noted a blatant structural flaw before the collapse, however, factory management allowed work to continue.\n\nIn 2013 a shoe factory in Cambodia collapsed killing several people and injuring many others.\n\nIn a report released in 2013, researchers found that industrial Cambodian facilities overseen by \"Better Factories Cambodia\" had numerous issues related to workers' health and safety. Of the factories assessed, the majority had a lack of restroom sanitizing products, excessively high temperature levels, and no access to safe water for drinking.\n\nKalpona Akter, a former Bangladeshi child garment worker and industry activist, has described conditions where garment factory managers lock exit doors while workers are engaging in tasks. Akter notes that factory managers value the goods that are being produced instead of worker well-being.\n\nIn 2005, students at a variety of universities in the United States engaged in protests against colleges that purchase goods created in the industrial apparel sector in order to sell with their personal namesakes. In their quest for better outcomes, some of the students in protest have urged universities to create special independent contracts with international apparel factories that require stringent oversight, as well as a promise to refrain from producing goods other than those created for the noted educational institution. Protesters also argue that because these industrial workers receive payments that are less than or equal to two percent of an item's selling price, the earnings for industrial workers should allotted based on prices in the area of which they work. While activists note that there is an increased cost for consumers, they set forth that in one example that this price change can be under one U.S. dollar in retail price.\n\nRachel Silvey has noted that efforts by college activists force local college administrators to make changes that have international effects. Such university protests challenge global neoliberal policies that are explicitly intertwined with current university policies.\n\nIn the export-oriented industry in Thailand, women make up the majority of those employed, and are often the most vitriolic objectors to workplace injustices. In defying conventional norms that portray women as passive, Mill describes incidents where Thai activists shaved their heads and threaten to write protest letters in their own blood.\n\nIn 2012 Aminul Islam, a Bangladeshi labor supporter, was found murdered. Highlighting the intensity of the struggle between laborers and owners, reports indicate that Islam was tortured prior to his death.\n\nIn 2014, workers employed in Cambodia's garment industry, who are predominantly female, protested against the government's current minimum wage level. Some participants in Cambodia's Garment Manufacturing Association responded to protests by noting that products manufactured in Cambodia would move elsewhere.\n\nIn Cambodian export factories, workers often face hardship in regards to participating in unionization efforts that differ from that of management philosophy. Workers have noted deliberate efforts by managers to dismantle union activities, that have often included threats or the initiation of violence.\n\nAmong other Asian countries, Bangladesh has extremely poor rights regarding unionization. There is evidence that this problem may be connected to, and exacerbated by, Bangladesh's reliance on exporting apparel goods in the past three decades. Highlighting the lack of collectivity, a mere 2 percent of employees were active in unions.\n\nIn light of deteriorating labor market standards abroad, widespread attention and criticism has been leveled at overseas manufacturers in hopes of creating a minimum standard for labor practices that would afford workers rights related to unionization and freedom from workplace discrimination. Intertwined in this attention, critics have looked to connect such minimum standards to broader global trading treaties. This pairing, known as a \"social clause\", aims to force international trade bodies such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) to integrate seven core International Labour Organization (ILO) labour rights conventions into trade agreements and attach penalties to those that do not.\n\nAdvocacy on behalf of labour rights can often come via governments and private groups from the global north. In this regard, many entities may support such a theme because of personal economic interest or indignation toward unfair labor practices. Comparatively, lesser developed countries and private groups in those countries are often skeptical of such trade agreements as they view the implementation of labor rights policies as being designed to further enrich the global north.\n\nDespite the precariousness found in export-oriented factories, research has indicated that women in developing countries are satisfied by the opportunity to have a formal factory job, compared to the limited informal ways of making money. This contentment on the part of women is created via the ability to garner greater independence as well as having increasing oversight within their homes.\n\nIn 1999, Cambodia and the United States entered into a trade agreement known as the U.S./Cambodia Bilateral Textile Trade Agreement. This agreement would initiate a program now known as \"Better Factories Cambodia.\" With initial funding totaling $1.4 million, the program aimed to increase oversight by way of ILO employees in conjunction with bolstering the administrative abilities of the Cambodian government. While the program has yielded positive results in regard to minimum wages and equitable timely payments, there are recurrent problems in regards to safety and excessive overtime.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "219580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=219580", "title": "Freedom of association", "text": "Freedom of association\n\nFreedom of association encompasses both an individual's right to join or leave groups voluntarily, the right of the group to take collective action to pursue the interests of its members, and the right of an association to accept or decline membership based on certain criteria. \"Freedom of Association, The Essentials of Human Rights\" describes the right as coming together with other individuals to collectively express, promote, pursue and/or defend common interests. Freedom of Association is both an individual right and a collective right, guaranteed by all modern and democratic legal systems, including the United States Bill of Rights, article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and international law, including articles 20 and 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work by the International Labour Organization also ensures these rights.\n\nFreedom of association is manifested through the right to join a trade union, to engage in free speech or to participate in debating societies, political parties, or any other club or association, including religious denominations and organizations, fraternities, and sport clubs. It is closely linked with freedom of assembly, particularly under the U.S. Bill of Rights. Freedom of assembly is typically associated with political contexts. However, (e.g. the U.S. Constitution, human rights instruments, etc.) the right to freedom of association may include the right to freedom of assembly.\n\nThe courts and delegated officers of local jurisdictions may, however, impose restrictions on any of the rights of a convicted criminal as a condition of a legal stipulation. Rights to freedom of association and freedom of assembly are waived under certain circumstances, such as a guilty plea or conviction, restraining orders and probationer's search and seizure procedures.\n\nThe general freedom to associate with groups according to the choice of the individual, and for the groups to take action to promote their interests, has been a necessary feature of every democratic society. Because freedom of association necessarily recognizes pluralistic sources of power and organisation, aside from the government, it has been a primary target for repression by all dictatorial societies. In the United Kingdom, all forms of \"combination\" were prohibited and criminal, particularly worker organisations, until the Combination Act 1825. After this, it was still not until the Companies Act 1856, the Trade Union Act 1871 and the Criminal Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 that companies and then trade unions became generally lawful. In Germany, a similar set of repressive laws were put in place against both trade unions and social democrat organisations by the Bismarck government under the \"Sozialistengesetze\" (the \"Socialist Acts\") in 1878. These remained in force until 1890. In 1933, trade unions were once again prohibited by the Fascist dictatorship of Hitler's National Socialist party, and the existing unions were nationalized and combined into a single government controlled German Labor Front. After World War II, free trade unions were quickly resurrected and guaranteed by the German \"Grundgesetz\". In the United States, trade unions were classified by various state courts, at various times, as being in restraint of trade. Under the Clayton Act of 1914, trade unions were given a general freedom to organize and to act collectively to secure collective agreements, however further hurdles were put in place until the National Labor Relations Act 1935 created a comprehensive labor code.\n\nIn Italy the freedom of association is established in Article 18 of the Constitution, which states:\n\nThe South African Constitution's Bill of Rights establishes the right to freedom of association in Section 18, which states \"Everyone has the right to freedom of association.\" Furthermore, Section 17 states \"Everyone has the right, peacefully and unarmed, to assemble, to demonstrate, to picket and to present petitions\", thus establishing the right to freedom of assembly. Workers' right to freedom of association in terms of the right to form trade unions and collective bargaining is recognized separately, in Section 23.\n\nWhile the United States Constitution's First Amendment identifies the rights to assemble and to petition the government, the text of the First Amendment does not make specific mention of a right to association. Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court held in \"NAACP v. Alabama\" (1958) that freedom of association is an essential part of freedom of speech because, in many cases, people can engage in effective speech only when they join with others.\n\nA fundamental element of personal liberty is the right to choose to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships. These intimate human relationships are considered forms of \"intimate association.\" The paradigmatic example of \"intimate association\" is the family. Depending on the jurisdiction it may also extend to abortion, birth control and private, adult, non-commercial and consensual sexual relationships.\n\nIn the United States, expressive associations are groups that engage in activities protected by the First Amendment – speech, assembly, press, petitioning government for a redress of grievances, and the free exercise of religion. In \"Roberts v. United States Jaycees\", the U.S. Supreme Court held that associations may not exclude people for reasons unrelated to the group's expression. However, in the subsequent decisions of \"Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston\", the Court ruled that a group may exclude people from membership if their presence would affect the group's ability to advocate a particular point of view. The government cannot, through the use of anti-discrimination laws, force groups to include a message that they do not wish to convey.\n\nHowever, this concept does not now apply in the University setting due to the Supreme Court's ruling in \"Christian Legal Society v. Martinez\" (2010), which upheld Hastings College of Law policy that the school's conditions on recognizing student groups were viewpoint neutral and reasonable. The policy requires student organizations to allow \"any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions, regardless of their status or beliefs\" and so, can be used to deny the group recognition as an official student organization because it had required its members to attest in writing that \"I believe in: The Bible as the inspired word of God; The Deity of our Lord, Jesus Christ, God's son; The vicarious death of Jesus Christ for our sins; His bodily resurrection and His personal return; The presence and power of the Holy Spirit in the work of regeneration; [and] Jesus Christ, God's son, is Lord of my life.\" The Court reasoned that because this constitutional inquiry occurs in the education context the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums applies. Thus, the college's all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the student organization forum.\n\nThe implicit First Amendment right of association in the U.S. Constitution has been limited by court rulings. For example, it is illegal in the United States to consider race in the making and enforcement of private contracts other than marriage. This limit on freedom of association results from Section 1981 of Title 42 of the United States Code, as balanced against the First Amendment in the 1976 decision of \"Runyon v. McCrary\".\n\nThe holding of \"Runyon\" is that the defendant private schools were free to \"express\" and teach their views, such as white separatism, but could not discriminate on the basis of race in the \"provision\" of services to the general public. So, if the plaintiff African-American children wished to attend such private schools, \"and\" were clearly qualified in all respects (but race) and were able to pay the fees, \"and\" were willing to attend \"despite\" the fact that the school's professed principles were inconsistent with admitting them, then the schools were required by Section 1981 to admit them. This doctrine rests on the interpretation of a private contract as a \"badge\" of slavery when either party considers race in choosing the other.\n\nGovernments often require contracts of adhesion with private entities for licensing purposes, such as with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for stock market trading in the 1938 Maloney Act amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These contracts often bar association with banned members, as can be seen in \"United States v. Merriam\", 108 F.3d 1162.\n\nThe organization of labor was commonly resisted during the 19th century, with even relatively liberal countries such as the United Kingdom banning it for various periods (in the UK's case, between 1820 and 1824).\n\nIn the international labour movement, the freedom of association is a right identified under international labour standards as the right of workers to organize and collectively bargain. Freedom of association, in this sense, is recognized as a fundamental human right by a number of documents including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organization Convention C87 and Convention C98 – two of the eight fundamental, core international labour standards. 'Freedom of association' can also refer to legal bans on private contracts negotiated between a private employer and their employees requiring workers at a particular workplace to join a union as a term and condition of employment. Supporters of this sort of private freedom of association claim that the right to join a union incorporates a right not to join a union. In the United States, the term 'right to work' is more common for this type of law.\n\n\"The Supreme Court today (1-21-1997) sharply limited the ability of labor union organizers to go onto an employer's property to distribute literature or urge workers to join the union. \nIn a 6-to-3 opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court said that the National Labor Relations Board had failed to give adequate protection to employers' property rights when it adopted a rule four years ago that gave union organizers greater access to areas like the parking lots of shopping centers or factories.\" -New York Times\n\nJeremy McBride argues that respect for the freedom of association by all public authorities and the exercising of this freedom by all sections of society are essential both to establish a \"genuine democracy\" and to ensure that, once achieved, it remains \"healthy and flourishing\". In this regard he sees the formation of political parties as a significant manifestation of the freedom of association.\n\nThe freedom of association is however not only exercised in the political sense, but also for a vast array of interests – such as culture, recreation, sport and social and humanitarian assistance. Jeremy McBride argues that the formation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which he equates with civil society, is the \"fruit of associational activity\".\n\nFreedom of association is a term popular in libertarian literature. It is used to describe the concept of absolute freedom to live in a community or be part of an organization whose values or culture are closely related to one's preferences; or, on a more basic level, to associate with any individual or group of one's choosing.\n\nUnder laws in such a system, business owners could refuse service to anyone for whatever reason. Opponents argue that such practices are regressive and would lead to greater prejudice within society. Right-libertarians sympathetic to freedom of association, such as Richard Allen Epstein, respond that in a case of refusing service (which thus is a case of the freedom of contract) unjustified discrimination incurs a cost and therefore a competitive disadvantage. Left-libertarians argue that such refusal would place those businesses at an economic disadvantage to those that provide services to all, making them less profitable and eventually leading them to close down.\n\nLibertarians also argue that freedom of association, in a political context, is merely the extension of the right to determine with whom to associate in one's personal life. For example, somebody who valued good manners or etiquette may not relish associating with someone who was not decent or was uncouth. Or, those opposed to homosexuality may not enjoy associating with gay people. In both instances, a person is voluntarily deciding with whom to associate, based on volition. Libertarians believe that freedom of association, in the political sphere, is not such a fanciful or unrealistic notion, since individual human beings already choose with whom they would like to associate based on a variety of reasons.\n\nLibertarians also hold a strong opinion on labour unions, and some support the workers right to choose in an election whether to join a labour union or not. Right to work legislation has been a hot topic of debate within the party, with a majority of Libertarians opposing the legislation . Among libertarians there is no fixed view of unions beyond the principle of freedom of association. Gary Johnson, who won the Libertarian presidential nomination in 2012, presents this principle one way when he is quoted as saying in a 2014 Reddit interview \"No worker is forced to take a job in a union shop. If the workers who came before them made the decision to organize into a labour union, they did it for a reason. It might be unfair working conditions, unfair wages, favoritism, or general inequality in the workplace.\" Johnson went on to say \"Libertarians love history, but we don't like to see it repeat itself, and the previous decision to organize must be respected by any new hire wishing to seek employment within that shop, or utilize his or her right to seek employment in a non-union shop. Otherwise, the conditions which have been corrected by the presence of a Union will deteriorate.\" Conversely libertarians also believe that while freedom of association includes the right for workers to organise as unions and to withdraw their labour it also recognises the right of an employer to replace that labour. Libertarians also believe that where unions employ coercive or violent tactics such behaviours would be in breach of libertarian principles. Some critics allege that such breaches have frequently been the case with union activity.\n\n"}
{"id": "23681908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23681908", "title": "Galápagos syndrome", "text": "Galápagos syndrome\n\nThe term \"Galápagos syndrome\" has been used as a metaphor outside the field of business jargon. The term \"Galápagosization\", referring to the process of the isolation of Japanese \"Galápagos-thinking\", links this process to the Japanese island mentality.\n\nThe term \"Galápagos syndrome\" was originally coined to refer to Japanese 3G mobile phones, which had developed a large number of specialized features that were widely adopted in the Japanese market, but were unsuccessful abroad. Whilst the original usage of the term was to describe highly advanced phones that were incompatible outside of Japanese networks, as the mobile phone industry underwent drastic changes globally, the term was used to emphasize the associated anxiety about how the development of Japanese mobile phones and those in the worldwide economy went along different paths. A derived term is , blending with , used to refer to Japanese feature phones, by contrast with newer smart phones.\n\nAcross Japan, the majority of the 190,000 ATMs do not accept bank and credit cards that have been issued outside of the country. Currently, only about 20,000 post offices and convenience stores allow retrieving cash using non-Japanese bank cards. Due to pressure from the Japanese government concerning this issue, by 2020 the number of ATMs that accept cards issued outside Japan is estimated to increase from 48,000 to 80,000. Despite increasing numbers of international tourists in Japan, the country still attracts relatively few tourists according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, which ranked Japan 27th in the list of most visited countries 2013.\n\nIn 2004 the wallet phone was introduced in Japan as a means to allow mobile payment alongside numerous other applications. In some ways the wallet phone can be seen as a predecessor of mobile payment tools that were later released on the global market such as Apple Pay or Google Wallet. The complete integration of multiple tools served to make the classical wallet redundant as the phone allows all types of payments, having train tickets or other everyday needs to be organized on the phone. In many ways the Japanese contactless infrastructure has been and is superior as compared to the current state in rest of the world.\n\nKei Cars (\"light cars\") are small four-wheeled vehicles/cars that have an engine of less than 660cc and enjoy preferential treatment in the form of tax advantages and lower insurance cost. Originally the Japanese government encouraged the use of those \"light cars\". This category of cars features a number of different car types including sport cars, minivans and commercial vehicles. However, Kei cars are not seen as profitable in export markets and therefore are only part of the Japanese automobile market. Despite no significant global success, major Japanese car manufacturers such as Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu and Honda still produce models belonging into the Kei car category. Since the Kei car has a significant portion of Japanese car market, Japanese auto makers cannot ignore them. Although the regulatory differences between Kei cars and 1L cars are quite small, the tax benefit of Kei cars is considerable. Until the tax reform in 2013, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate was a quarter of that of 1L cars (¥7200 to ¥29500). This significantly lower tax rate gathered much criticism from European and US auto makers, and as such the EU, the US and Toyota do not make Kei cars. In 2013, the Japanese government revised the vehicle tax law. The new vehicle tax law became effective in 2015. With new vehicle tax law, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate is about 36% of that of 1L cars (¥10800 to ¥29500).\n\nThere are many associated issues with the inability to compete on the international export market. In order to revive the parts of the Japanese economy that have suffered from the \"Galápagosization\", affected businesses had to find the reasons responsible for the development.\n\nThe Galápagosization of Japan continues. According to a survey released today, a shocking two-thirds of the country’s white-collar workers said they didn’t want to work abroad ... ever.\n\nFurthermore, this has led a number of Japanese companies to adapt their business strategies. Hiroshi Mikitani, CEO of e-commerce company Rakuten, sees the exclusive use of Japanese in workplaces at the centre of the problem. Following his belief that \"a language will open your eyes to the 'global', and you will break free from this conventional wisdom of a pure Japan\", the co-founder and CEO of Rakuten made English the main language to be spoken in the company. Dr. Gerhard Fasol, the only European member of Euro Technology Japan's \"Galapagos study group\", stated that another reason for the non-success of some innovative Japanese products is Europe's conservative standpoint when it comes to certain standards. In the belief that it will improve international competitiveness Tadashi Yanai, the founder and president of Fast Retailing, has decided to change the way the firm works against classical Japanese business methods. A shift of the production of some textiles out of Japan to Southeast Asia was a move to the low-wage-labour market, that aimed to enable to price compete on the international textile market. Another factor which McKinsey & Company points out is the need for Japanese companies to adapt to stronger competition when entering global markets. This should be done by accepting to think in \"new and unfamiliar ways about organization, marketing, and strategy\", whilst the traditional practices that helped the companies to become a big player in the Japanese market shall be discontinued. Despite the fact that companies have started to address the issue, which \"could\" have a link to the total value of exports increasing over the past five years, there are concerns about the future Galápagosization of Japan.\n\nWith the aging and shrinking Japanese population, the fact that fewer and fewer students study abroad to acquire a more internationally oriented university education is reason for concerns over the future of the Japanese economy. Furthermore, there is a conception that the younger generation could enhance the Galápagos effect due to a lack of interest in international education and work placements. Kiyoshi Takeuchi, sociology professor at the Sophia university, describes the young generation to have less \"ambition and motivation\" as a result from the fear that a wrong move could have negative effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "379855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379855", "title": "Gerrard Winstanley", "text": "Gerrard Winstanley\n\nGerrard Winstanley (19 October 1609 – 10 September 1676) was an English Protestant religious reformer, political philosopher, and activist during The Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. Winstanley was the leader and one of the founders of the English group known as the True Levellers or Diggers for their beliefs, and for their actions. The group occupied public lands that had been privatised by enclosures and dug them over, pulling down hedges and filling in ditches, to plant crops. True Levellers was the name they used to describe themselves, whereas the term Diggers was coined by contemporaries.\n\nGerrard Winstanley was born on 19 October 1609 and was baptised in the parish of Wigan, then part of the West Derby hundred of Lancashire. He was the son of an Edward Winstanley, mercer. His mother's identity remains unknown and he could have been born anywhere in the parish of Wigan. The parish of Wigan contained the townships of Abram, Aspull, Billinge-and-Winstanley, Dalton, Haigh, Hindley, Ince-in-Makerfield, Orrell, Pemberton, and Upholland, as well as Wigan itself.\n\nHe moved in 1630 to London, where he became an apprentice and ultimately, in 1638, a freeman of the Merchant Tailors' Company or guild. He married Susan King, the daughter of London surgeon William King, in 1639. The English Civil War, however, disrupted his business, and in 1643 he was made bankrupt. His father-in-law helped Winstanley move to Cobham, Surrey, where he initially worked as a cowherd.\n\nIn 1657 Winstanley and his wife Susan received a gift of property in Ham Manor in Cobham, from his father-in-law William King. This marked Winstanley's renovation in social status locally and he became waywarden of the parish in 1659, overseer of the poor in 1660 and churchwarden in 1667–68. He was elected Chief Constable of Elmbridge, Surrey in October 1671. These offices on the face of it conflicted with Winstanley's apparent Quakerism, a religion which later became more quietist.\n\nWhen Susan died about 1664 Winstanley was paid £50 for the land in Cobham by King. Winstanley returned to London trade, whilst retaining his connections in Surrey. In about 1665 he married his second wife Elizabeth Stanley and re-entered commerce as a corn chandler. Winstanley died in 1676, aged 66, vexed by legal disputes concerning a small legacy owed to him in a will.\n\nThere were many factions at work during the period of the three related English civil wars. They included the Royalists who supported King Charles I; the Parliamentary forces led by Sir Thomas Fairfax who would later emerge under the name of the New Model Army; the Fifth Monarchy Men, who believed in the establishment of a heavenly theocracy on earth to be led by a returning Jesus as king of kings and lord of lords; the Agitators for political egalitarian reform of government, who were branded \"Levellers\" by their foes and who were led by John Lilburne; and the True Levellers, who were branded \"Diggers\" because of their actions. The latter were led by Gerrard Winstanley. Whereas Lilburne sought to level the laws and maintain the right to the ownership of real property, Winstanley sought to level the ownership of real property itself, which is why Winstanley's followers called themselves \"True Levellers\".\n\nGerrard Winstanley published a pamphlet called \"The New Law of Righteousness\". The basis of this work came from the Book of Acts, chapter two, verses 44 and 45: \"All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need.\" Winstanley argued that \"in the beginning of time God made the earth. Not one word was spoken at the beginning that one branch of mankind should rule over another, but selfish imaginations did set up one man to teach and rule over another.\"\n\nWinstanley took as his basic texts the Biblical sacred history, with its affirmation that all men were descended from a common stock, and with its scepticism about the rulership of kings, voiced in the Books of Samuel; and the New Testament's affirmations that God was no respecter of persons, that there were no masters or slaves under the New Covenant. From these and similar texts, he interpreted Christian teaching as calling for the abolition of property [in land] and aristocracy.\n\nWinstanley wrote: \"Seeing the common people of England by joynt consent of person and purse have caste out Charles our Norman oppressour, wee have by this victory recovered ourselves from under his Norman yoake.\"\n\nHis theme was rooted in ancient English radical thought. It went back at least to the days of the Peasants' Revolt (1381) led by Wat Tyler, because that is when a verse of the Lollard priest John Ball was circulated:\n\nOn 1st April 1649, Winstanley and his followers took over vacant or common lands on St George's Hill in Surrey. Other Digger colonies followed in Buckinghamshire, Kent, and Northamptonshire. Their action was to cultivate the land and distribute food without charge to any who would join them in the work. Local landowners took fright from the Diggers' activities and in 1650 sent hired armed men to beat the Diggers and destroy their colony. Winstanley protested to the government, but to no avail, and eventually the colony was abandoned.\n\nAfter the failure of the Digger experiment in Surrey in 1650 Winstanley temporarily fled to Pirton, Hertfordshire, where he took up employment as an estate steward for the mystic aristocrat Lady Eleanor Davies. This employment lasted less than a year after Davies accused Winstanley of mismanaging her property and Winstanley returned to Cobham.\n\nWinstanley continued to advocate the redistribution of land. In 1652 he published another pamphlet called \"The Law of Freedom in a Platform\", in which he argued that the Christian basis for society is where property and wages are abolished. In keeping with Winstanley's adherence to biblical models, the tract envisages a communistic society structured on patriarchal lines.\n\nBy 1654 Winstanley was possibly assisting Edward Burrough, an early leader of the Quakers, later called the Society of Friends. It seems that Winstanley remained a Quaker for the rest of his life, since his death was noted in Quaker records. However, his Quakerism may not have been very strong as he was involved in the government of his local parish church from 1659 onwards – though it should be noted that it is not unknown for committed Quakers to retain strong ties to other religious traditions, even including priesthood. He may have been buried in a Quaker cemetery.\n\nWinstanley believed in Christian Universalism, the doctrine that everyone, however sinful, will eventually be reconciled to God; he wrote that \"in the end every man shall be saved, though some at the last hour.\" His book \"The Mysterie of God\" is apparently the first theological work in the English language to state this universalism.\n\nThe Soviet-era Alexander Garden Obelisk in Moscow, Russia, in 1918 included his name among a list of outstanding thinkers and personalities of the struggle for the liberation of workers. \n\nIn 1999, the British activist group The Land is Ours celebrated the Digger movement's 350th anniversary with a march and reoccupation of St George's Hill, the site of the first Digger colony. Like the original colony, this settlement was quickly disbanded.\nSince 2011 a Wigan Diggers Festival has been held annually in Winstanley's birth town of Wigan attracting support across the North of England.\n\n\"The Complete Works of Gerrard Winstanley\", edited jointly by Thomas N. Corns, Ann Hughes and David Loewenstein, were published by the Oxford University Press in December 2009 at £229 ().\n\nA shorter and less comprehensive volume containing all the major works, \"Gerrard Winstanley: A Common Treasury\" edited by Andrew Hopton, was published in 1989 by Aporia () and reprinted several times since, most recently in 2011 (paperback) by Verso Books (UK) with an introduction by Tony Benn ().\n\n1975 saw the release of Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's film \"Winstanley\". As with the duo's previous film, \"It Happened Here\", it had taken several years to produce with a very low budget. \"Winstanley\" was loosely based on a novel by David Caute entitled \"Comrade Jacob\" and was produced in a quasi-documentary style, with great attention to period detail – even to the point of only using breeds of animals which were known to exist at the time, and actual Civil War armour and weapons borrowed from the Tower of London museum.\n\nIn 2009 UKA Press released \"Winstanley: Warts and all\" (), the story of the making of the film \"Winstanley\", written by film director and film historian Kevin Brownlow.\n\nThe song, \"The World Turned Upside Down,\" by English folksinger Leon Rosselson, weaves many of Winstanley's own words into the lyrics. An older song, the \"Diggers' Song\", said to be written by Winstanley was recorded by the English group Chumbawamba on their \"English Rebel Songs 1381–1914\" in 1988.\n\nFrom \"A Declaration from the Poor Oppressed People of England\":\n\nFrom \"A Watch-word to the City of London, and Army\":\n\nFrom \"A New-year's Gift for the Parliament and Army\":\n\nFrom \"The Law of Freedom in a Platform\":\n\nWinstanley and German Protestant revolutionary Thomas Müntzer both supported anarchism. Libertarian socialist scholar Murray Bookchin: \"In the modern world, anarchism first appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry against declining feudal institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman during the Peasant Wars was Thomas Müntzer; in England, Gerrard Winstanley, a leading participant in the Digger movement. The concepts held by Müntzer and Winstanley were superbly attuned to the needs of their time – a historical period when the majority of the population lived in the countryside and when the most militant revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world. It would be painfully academic to argue whether Müntzer and Winstanley could have achieved their ideals. What is of real importance is that they spoke to their time; their anarchist concepts followed naturally from the rural society that furnished the bands of the peasant armies in Germany and the New Model in England.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "41958118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41958118", "title": "Great Eastern Crisis", "text": "Great Eastern Crisis\n\nThe Great Eastern Crisis of 1875–78 began in the Ottoman Empire's territories on the Balkan peninsula in 1875, with the outbreak of several uprisings and wars that resulted in the meddling of international powers, and was ended with the Treaty of Berlin in July 1878.\n\nIt is also called ; Turkish: \"Şark Buhranı\" (\"Eastern Crisis\", for the crisis in general), \"Ramazan Kararnamesi\" (\"Decree of Ramadan\", for the sovereign default declared on 30 October 1875) and \"93 Harbi\" (\"War of 93\", for the wars on the Balkan peninsula between 1877–78, referring in particular to the Russo-Turkish War, the year 1293 on the Islamic Rumi calendar corresponding to the year 1877 on the Gregorian calendar)\n\nThe state of Ottoman administration in the Balkans continued to deteriorate throughout the 19th century, with the central government occasionally losing control over whole provinces. Reforms imposed by European powers did little to improve the conditions of the Christian population, while at the same time managing to dissatisfy a sizable portion of the Muslim population. Bosnia suffered at least two waves of rebellion by the local Muslim population, the most recent in 1850. Austria consolidated after the turmoil of the first half of the century and sought to reinvigorate its longstanding policy of expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the nominally autonomous, de facto independent principalities of Serbia and Montenegro also sought to expand into regions inhabited by their compatriots. Nationalist and irredentist sentiments were strong and were encouraged by Russia and her agents.\n\nOn 24 August 1854, during the Crimean War, the Ottoman Empire took its first foreign loans. The empire entered into subsequent loans, partly to finance the construction of railways and telegraph lines, and partly to finance deficits between revenues and the lavish expenditures of the imperial court, such as the construction of new palaces on the Bosphorus strait in Constantinople. Some financial commentators have noted that the terms of these loans were exceptionally favourable to the British and French banks (owned by the Rothschild family) which facilitated them, whereas others have noted that the terms reflected the imperial administration's willingness to constantly refinance its debts. A large amount of money was also spent for building new ships for the Ottoman Navy during the reign of Sultan Abdülaziz (r. 1861–1876). In 1875, the Ottoman Navy had 21 battleships and 173 warships of other types, which formed the third largest naval fleet in the world after those of the British and French navies. All of these expenditures, however, put a huge strain on the Ottoman treasury. In the meantime, a severe drought in Anatolia in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent in the heart of the empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare a sovereign default on its foreign loan repayments on 30 October 1875 and increase taxes in all of its provinces, including the Balkans.\n\nThe decision to increase taxes for paying the Ottoman Empire's debts to foreign creditors sparked an outrage in the Balkan provinces, which culminated in the Great Eastern Crisis and ultimately the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) that provided independence or autonomy for the Christian nations in the empire's Balkan territories, with the subsequent Treaty of Berlin in 1878. The war, however, was disastrous for the already struggling Ottoman economy and the Ottoman Public Debt Administration was established in 1881, which gave the control of the Ottoman state revenues to foreign creditors. This made the European creditors bondholders, and assigned special rights to the OPDA for collecting various types of tax and customs revenues. During and after the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the Serb army from the Sanjak of Niș and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, Austria-Hungary stationed military garrisons in the Ottoman Vilayet of Bosnia and Ottoman Sanjak of Novi Pazar, which formally (de jure) continued to be Ottoman territories. Taking advantage of the chaos that occurred during the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, Bulgaria declared its formal independence on 5 October 1908. The following day, Austria-Hungary unilaterally annexed Bosnia on 6 October 1908, but pulled its military forces out of Novi Pazar in order to reach a compromise with the Ottoman government and avoid a war (the Ottoman Empire lost the Sanjak of Novi Pazar with the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913.)\n\nIn 1881, France occupied the Ottoman Beylik of Tunisia, with the excuse that Tunisian troops had crossed the border into their colony of Algeria, which also formerly belonged to the Ottoman Empire until 1830. A year later, in 1882, the British Empire occupied the Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt, with the pretext of giving military assistance to the Ottomans for putting down the Urabi Revolt (Britain later declared Egypt a British protectorate on 5 November 1914, in response to the Ottoman government's decision to join World War I on the side of the Central Powers.) It is worth noting that the Ottoman government had frequently declared the tax revenues from Egypt as a surety for borrowing loans from British and French banks. The Ottoman government had earlier leased Cyprus to Britain in 1878, in exchange for British support at the Congress of Berlin in the same year (Cyprus was later annexed by Britain on 5 November 1914, for the same aforementioned reason regarding the Ottoman participation in World War I.) By obtaining Cyprus and Egypt, Britain gained an important foothold in the East Mediterranean and control over the Suez Canal; while France increased its lands in the West Mediterranean coast of North Africa by adding Tunisia to its empire as a French protectorate.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39502474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39502474", "title": "Incredibles 2", "text": "Incredibles 2\n\nIncredibles 2 is a 2018 American computer-animated superhero film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Written and directed by Brad Bird, it is the sequel to \"The Incredibles\" (2004) and the second full-length installment of the franchise. The story follows the Parr family as they try to restore public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, Bob Odenkirk, Catherine Keener and Jonathan Banks. Michael Giacchino returned to compose the score.\n\nFollowing the success of \"The Incredibles,\" Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\n\n\"Incredibles 2\" premiered in Los Angeles on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in Disney Digital 3-D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX and IMAX 3D. The film received largely positive reviews and praise for its animation, voice acting, humor, action sequences, and musical score. The film made $182.7 million in its opening weekend, setting the record for best debut for an animated film, and has grossed over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 2018, the second highest-grossing animated film and the 15th highest-grossing film of all-time. \"Incredibles 2\" was named by the National Board of Review as the Best Animated Film of 2018.\n\nThe Incredibles, a family of superheroes, pursue the Underminer. Although he escapes with stolen bank money, they stop his drill tank from destroying Metroville's City Hall with help from Lucius Best. The government, concerned by the collateral damage, shuts down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs without financial assistance from agent Rick Dicker. After Violet's date Tony Rydinger discovers her superhero identity, Dicker erases her from Tony's memory. Lucius informs Bob and Helen of an offer from Winston Deavor, the owner of DevTech, a telecommunications corporation. Winston and his sister Evelyn propose a publicity stunt to regain public trust in superheroes.\n\nWinston chooses Helen to spearhead the stunt under her old identity, Elastigirl, as she causes less property damage than Bob, and provides the Parr family with a new home. While Helen is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: Dash has trouble with math, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony stands her up, and Jack-Jack wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. Bob brings Jack-Jack to Edna Mode, who develops a suit that controls his abilities. Meanwhile, Elastigirl captures the Screenslaver, a supervillain who projects hypnotic images using television screens. She unmasks him as a deliveryman with no recollection of his actions.\n\nAt a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury ship. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was controlled by a pair of mind-control goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself as the mastermind and true villain behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains she has hated superheroes since Gazerbeam and Fironic failed to rescue her father from being killed by burglars. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using a hypnotized Elastigirl, she lures Mr. Incredible into a trap, then sends other hypnotized superheroes to subdue the Parr children. Frozone tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.\n\nViolet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by Bob during his time as Mr. Incredible, and reach Winston's ship. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship crew, aim the ship at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles, and she frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Parrs and Frozone release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles. With Mr. Incredible swimming underwater to turn the rudder and Frozone creating layers of ice, they slow the ship and prevent it crashing into the city. Evelyn escapes in a jet, but is captured by Elastigirl. Superheroes around the world regain legal status.\n\nLater, Tony accompanies Violet and her family to a movie. Outside the theater, the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit between police and gunmen. Violet leaves Tony at the theater and promises to return in time for the film, before the Parrs give chase in a refurbished Incredibile.\n\n\nFollowing \"The Incredibles\", Brad Bird directed his next film for Pixar, \"Ratatouille\", which was released in June 2007. Near its premiere, Bird said he was open to an idea of a sequel to \"The Incredibles\", but only if it could be better than the original. He stated, \"I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together.\" In a May 2013 interview, Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel: \"I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have—because I love those characters, and love that world ... I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another \"Incredibles\" film, and if I can get 'em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that.\" While publicizing the first film, Bird had already conceptualized the eventual approach where Bob and Helen would switch roles, and Jack-Jack would develop multiple powers unknown to the family.\n\nAt the Disney shareholder meeting in March 2014, Disney CEO and chairman Bob Iger confirmed that Pixar was working on an \"Incredibles\" sequel, and that Bird would return as writer. Bird started the script around April 2015, and said that the \"Incredibles\" sequel would be his next film after \"Tomorrowland\".\n\nOne challenge in writing \"Incredibles 2\" was how to deal with the large number of superhero films and television series that had been released since the first film, such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. To try to differentiate the sequel, Bird wanted to avoid tropes related to the superhero genre: \"I don't think that kind of idea stays interesting for very long. For me, the interesting thing was never the superhero part of it. It was more the family dynamic, and how do superhero things play into that.\" He said he wanted to include some unused ideas from the first film, and that the new story would focus on Helen Parr / Elastigirl.\n\nThough the sequel was released fourteen years after the first, Bird did not want to use a narrative element like a timeskip or to come up with new characters, and instead continued from where the first film left off. This allowed him to keep characters with the same superpowers and not have to develop new ones, nor did he need to figure out how to deal with Violet and Dash being adults. This also allowed him to keep Jack-Jack as an infant with an array of powers, which Bird likened to how infants are able to understand numerous languages. While the plot of the 2005 follow-up video game to \"The Incredibles\", \"\", begins at that same point of time, the film discards the game's continuity. The film was produced with a production budget of $200 million.\n\nOne advantage that Pixar had with \"Incredibles 2\" was the advancement of technology the company had seen since the original film and a team of much more experienced animators. Producer John Walker said, \"I think that one of the things that excited Brad and Ralph Eggleston, the production designer, was the fact that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004. There were no notions of, 'Well, we don't know how to do long hair, we don't know how to do humans, we don't know how to do muscles.' Everybody knows how to do it. It's just now about doing it quickly.\" Because Pixar no longer used the same systems from the first movie, all the characters had to be created from scratch on the computer again. The studio also used physically-based human eye models for the characters for the first time, even if the eyes are larger and more stylized than in real humans.\n\nPixar announced in November 2016 that both Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson would return to reprise their roles, and at the July 2017 D23 Expo that both Craig T. Nelson and Sarah Vowell would also return with them. Spencer Fox, the original voice of Dashiell \"Dash\" Parr, was replaced in the sequel by younger newcomer Huckleberry Milner. Also that July, Brad Bird and John Ratzenberger were confirmed as reprising their characters from the first film.\n\nIn November 2017, Pixar announced that Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener had been signed to the cast, In January 2018, it was announced that Sophia Bush and Isabella Rossellini would voice new characters Voyd and The Ambassador, while Jonathan Banks would voice Rick Dicker after the character's original voice actor Bud Luckey retired in 2014; after his death in 2018, the film was dedicated to Luckey's memory.\n\nIn 2015, Bird confirmed that Michael Giacchino would return to compose the score. Giacchino began work around May 2017. The soundtrack album was released on June 15, 2018. In addition to the film's score, it includes the vocalized theme songs for Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and Elastigirl heard in the credits, as well as bonus versions of the songs sung by Disney's a cappella group, DCappella, and the latter's version of the track \"The Glory Days\" from the first film.\n\nThe official premiere of \"Incredibles 2\" took place in Los Angeles on June 5, 2018. It was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018, including an IMAX release as part of Disney's new distribution deal with IMAX, but only in 2D. It is accompanied by Pixar's short film \"Bao\". The film's release was originally scheduled for June 21, 2019, but the date was moved forward after Pixar handed the 2019 release date over to \"Toy Story 4\", after its production fell behind schedule.\n\nA 53-second teaser trailer premiered on November 18, 2017 during ESPN's broadcast of \"College GameDay\". It received 113 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer for an animated film, and the 7th most-viewed trailer overall. A new sneak peek premiered during the 2018 Winter Olympics on February 14. On April 13, a new trailer was released.\n\nAn \"Incredibles 2\" graphic novel and comic miniseries was published by Dark Horse Comics in 2018. The graphic novel, titled \"Incredibles 2: Heroes at Home\", was written by Liz Marsham and illustrated by Nicoletta Baldari. A comic miniseries, titled \"Incredibles 2: Crisis in Mid-Life! & Other Stories\", was written by Christos Gage and Landry Walker, and illustrated by Gurihiru, J. Bone, Andrea Greppi and Roberta Zanotta.\n\nIn May 2018, a prose novel was released entitled \"Incredibles 2: A Real Stretch: An Elastigirl Prequel Story\", which focuses on the life of the character Elastigirl before the events of the first film.\n\nA Lego video game adaptation of both films was released on the same day as \"Incredibles 2\".\n\"Incredibles 2\" was released on digital copy on October 23, 2018, and on 4K UHD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on November 6, 2018.\n\n, \"Incredibles 2\" has grossed $608.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $632.3 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $1.241 billion.\n\nOn July 1, 2018, the film passed $648 million at the worldwide box office, surpassing the $633 million the original film made in its entire theatrical run. It is currently the ninth highest-grossing film of all-time domestically and the highest-grossing animated film domestically. The film crossed the $1 billion mark on July 30, 2018, becoming the seventh animated film and the 36th film of all-time to reach the milestone. It was also the fifth animated Disney film, the third Pixar film, and Disney's 18th film overall to gross $1 billion worldwide, as well as the fastest animated film to gross $1 billion, doing so in 46 days, surpassing \"Minions\" (49 days). On August 12, the film surpassed \"Toy Story 3\" ($1.067 billion) to become the highest-grossing Pixar film worldwide.\n\nIn April 2018, early box office projections had \"Incredibles 2\" grossing $110 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada. In May 2018, a month before the film's release, tracking revised to an opening weekend of $140 million or more. A week prior to the film's opening, Fandango reported that pre-sale of tickets for the film had exceeded that of previous mid-year blockbusters \"Finding Dory\", \"Wonder Woman\", \"\" and \"Suicide Squad\" at the same point in their release cycles. By the week of its release, opening weekend projections had reached upwards of $150 million. A day before release, it became Fandango's top pre-selling animated film of all-time, outselling the previous record-holder, \"Finding Dory\".\n\nThe film grossed $18.5 million from Thursday night previews, increasing weekend projections to as high as $174 million. The previews set the record for an animated film, doubling \"Finding Dory\"s $9.2 million, and were higher than the likes of fellow superhero films \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\", \"\" and \"Justice League\". It made $71.6 million on its first day, including previews, the best-ever for an animated film (besting \"Dory\"s $54.7 million by 31%) and 14th highest all-time. It went on to debut to $182.7 million, the eighth best opening of all-time, far ahead of \"Finding Dory\"s animated record of $135.1 million and more than the entire lifetime gross of Pixar's \"A Bug's Life\" ($162.8 million), \"Cars 3\" ($152.9 million) and \"The Good Dinosaur\" ($123.1 million).\n\nThe film set animated records for its Monday and Tuesday grosses, making $23.9 million (beating the $23.4 million made by \"Shrek 2\" in May 2004) and $27.1 million (beating \"Finding Dory\"s $23.1 million), respectively. Its Tuesday gross also set a June record, topping \"Jurassic World\" ($24.3 million in 2015). By Thursday, its seventh day of release, the film had grossed $269.4 million, topping the entire lifetime domestic gross of the original, not accounting for inflation ($261.4 million). In its second weekend the film dropped 56% to $80.9 million, finishing second behind newcomer \"\" ($148 million), marking the first time two films opened to over $100 million in back-to-back weekends. It remained in second place in its third and fourth weekends, grossing $45.5 million and $29 million, respectively. On July 7, its 23rd day of release, the film crossed $495 million, passing \"Finding Dory\" to become the highest-grossing animated film and Pixar's highest-grossing film of all-time domestically, and the following day became the first animated film to gross over $500 million domestically. On September 2, its 80th day of release, it became the first animated film to gross over $600 million domestically.\n\nOutside North America, the film made $51.5 million from 25 countries in its opening weekend, for a global debut of $231.5 million. Mexico was the largest debut with $12.3 million, followed by Australia ($7.7 million) and Russia ($5.4 million). In its second weekend of release the film made $58.6 million from 28 countries, bringing its two-week total to $134.7 million. Its largest market was China where it made $21.2 million, the best ever opening for a Pixar film in the country. It was also released in India where it made $3.3 million. In the United Kingdom, the film grossed $12.6 million in its opening weekend, the second biggest opening for Pixar after \"Toy Story 3\". , The biggest markets in terms of total earnings are the United Kingdom ($73.1 million), followed by China ($51.5 million), Japan ($43.9 million), France ($41.7 million), and Brazil ($37.6 million).\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 322 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Incredibles 2\" reunites Pixar's family crimefighting team for a long-awaited follow-up that may not quite live up to the original, but comes close enough to earn its name.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 93% overall positive score and an 83% \"definite recommend\".\n\nRobert Abele of \"TheWrap\" praised the film, saying: \"Whatever the opposite of phoning in a sequel is, that's Brad Bird's progressive-minded, thunderously fun mix of super saves, throwback aesthetics and family comedy.\" A.A. Dowd, writing for \"The A.V. Club\", felt it was \"A sparkling contraption of an animated comedy, funny and often wondrous in its midcentury-modern vision of an alternate America frozen in the amber of a bygone idealism.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \"B+\", saying: \"When the Parrs are pushed out of their comfort zone, Bird settles into his... [after] inciting a Spielberg-level monorail chase that reaffirms Bird's lucid gift for kinetic and character-driven action filmmaking, the movie blasts off and never looks back.\" Stephanie Zacharek from \"Time\" considered it \"bold [and] rapturously entertaining,\" while David Sims at \"The Atlantic\" dubbed it \"dazzling, thought-provoking, and sometimes overwhelming in terms of plotting.\"\n\n\"Variety\"s Owen Gleiberman called the film \"fun but far from incredible\" and wrote \"It's true that the \"Toy Story\" films, all three of which are fantastic, did variations on the same theme of a toy's obsolescence, but as movies they kept the emotions close to the surface. In \"Incredibles 2\", we never get that rush of feeling.\" Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"\"Incredibles 2\" is content to punch the clock and stick to straight, bombastic action mode. In that mode, composer Giacchino's music is the most successful element, running nimble, beautifully orchestrated variations on themes that feel familiar in the best ways while retaining their spark. The animation is bright and visually dynamic. The script, well ... if the title were \"Satisfactories 2\", it'd be about right.\" Ty Burr for \"The Boston Globe\" called it a \"clattery, unfocused affair that at times is more irritating than fun.\"\n\nMany disability advocates, including the Epilepsy Foundation, have raised concerns that scenes with flashing lights, particularly the scene of Elastigirl's fight with the Screenslaver, can trigger seizures in viewers affected by photosensitive epilepsy. As a result, several theaters posted warnings for audiences. Disney issued a statement to \"USA Today\" stating that they appreciated the efforts the theaters had already made in making signs warning people seeing the movie. They then asked theaters to warn audiences about the scene in a memo that read, \"\"Incredibles 2\" contains a sequence of flashing lights, which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities.\"\n\nIn response to this, the UK released a re-edited version of the film with all affected sequences altered so that any flashing lights and strobe effects now pass the Harding test.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Incredibles 2\", director Brad Bird acknowledged that the film's truncated production schedule resulted in many plotlines and ideas he had for the film being cut from the final version. He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of \"Toy Story 4\" and \"Incredibles 2\", which meant that Bird's film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another \"Incredibles\" film, or something else.\" Cast members including Samuel L. Jackson and Sophia Bush have expressed interest in reprising their roles. Producer John Walker would not \"rule [a third film] out\".\n\n"}
{"id": "5161334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5161334", "title": "Intervention (law)", "text": "Intervention (law)\n\nIn law, intervention is a procedure to allow a nonparty, called intervenor (also spelled intervener) to join ongoing litigation, either as a matter of right or at the discretion of the court, without the permission of the original litigants. The basic rationale for intervention is that a judgment in a particular case may affect the rights of nonparties, who ideally should have the right to be heard.\n\nIntervenors are most common in appellate proceedings, but can also appear at other types of legal proceeding such as a trial.\n\nIn general, it is within the discretion of the court to allow or refuse an application to intervene. There are exceptions to this however (for example, under subrule 61(4) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, if the court has stated a constitutional question then the attorney general of any province or territory, or of the federal government, may intervene \"as of right\", i.e. without the need to be granted leave to intervene).\n\nCourts will tend to allow an application to intervene if the applicant will provide a \"different perspective\" on the issues before the court, without \"expanding\" those issues.\n\nIntervenors are permitted in criminal matters as well as civil matters. However, courts sometimes express concern in allowing applications for intervention in criminal matters where the applicant will make arguments against the position of the accused. It sometimes is seen as unfair that the accused in a criminal matter be required to meet arguments from sources other than the prosecution.\n\nThere are several distinct reasons why someone might wish to intervene in a proceeding:\n\n\nIt is often said that the role of intervenors is to \"assist\" the court in making a just decision on the dispute at hand. While it is true that judges sometimes do indicate that intervenors have been of aid to the court in reaching a decision, the use of the word \"assist\" can be seen as misleading in that it implies the intervenor is acting altruistically. In general, the goal of the intervenor is to influence the court in making its decision, not just to \"assist\" the court.\n\nCanadian courts (also courts in UK) use the term \"amicus curiae\" in a more limited sense. Generally, in Canada, an amicus curiae is someone who has been specifically commissioned by the court to provide a viewpoint which the court believes is necessary and otherwise lacking. By contrast, an intervenor is someone who has applied to the court to be heard on a matter. For example, the \"Quebec Secession Reference\" (a case in the Supreme Court of Canada) had one amicus curiae and several intervenors.\n\nThe Attorney-General has the right to intervene in a private lawsuit if the lawsuit may affect \"the prerogatives of the Crown, including its relations with foreign states\". Furthermore, the Attorney-General may intervene with leave of the court where \"the suit raises any question of public policy on which the executive may have a view which it may desire to bring to the notice of the court\".\n\nIn the United States federal courts, intervention is governed by Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\nIn both intervention of right and permissive intervention, the applicant must make a timely application to be heard. The applicant cannot sit on its rights; it must intervene as soon as it has reason to know that its interest may be adversely affected by the outcome of the pending litigation. The applicant must serve its motion to intervene on the parties to the case and explain its reasons for intervening in the motion papers. In addition, U.S. federal law does not allow the procedure of intervention to violate the requirements of diversity jurisdiction. The court must have either diversity jurisdiction or federal question jurisdiction over the intervenor's claim. Supplemental jurisdiction is not permitted for intervention claims under (b) when the original claim's federal jurisdiction was based solely on diversity and exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the intervening claim would be inconsistent with the diversity requirements of . However, supplemental jurisdiction is permitted when the claims are so related that they form the same case or controversy.\n\nIn the courts of the State of Texas, a jurisdiction whose rules of civil procedure differ considerably from the rules of civil procedure in federal court, a nonparty may intervene in a pending lawsuit by filing a pleading, which is typically called “plea in intervention” or “petition in intervention” without leave of the court, but any party in the pending lawsuit may object and ask for the intervention to be struck for cause. TEX. R. CIV. P. 60 (\"Any party may intervene by filing a pleading, subject to being stricken out by the court for sufficient cause on the motion of any party.\"). While the Texas rules of civil procedure require no judicial permission and impose no intervention deadline, the common law dictates that a party may not intervene post-judgment unless the trial court first sets aside the judgment. See State v. Naylor, 466 S.W.3d 783, 788 (Tex. 2015). For the same reason, an intervenor must enter the lawsuit before final judgment to have standing to bring an appeal.\n\n\nSubrin, Stephen N., Minow, Martha L., Brodin, Mark S., and Main, Thomas O. \"Civil Procedure: Doctrine, Practice, and Context\".

{"id": "113021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113021", "title": "Intrusion detection system", "text": "Intrusion detection system\n\nAn intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources, and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.\n\nIDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks. The most common classifications are network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware); and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of \"good\" traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention system.\n\nAlthough they both relate to network security, an IDS differs from a firewall in that a firewall looks outwardly for intrusions in order to stop them from happening. Firewalls limit access between networks to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network. An IDS describes a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm. An IDS also watches for attacks that originate from within a system. This is traditionally achieved by examining network communications, identifying heuristics and patterns (often known as signatures) of common computer attacks, and taking action to alert operators. A system that terminates connections is called an intrusion prevention system, and is another form of an application layer firewall.\n\nIDS can be classified by where detection takes place (network or host) and the detection method that is employed.\n\nFor IDS related to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), readers may refer to Butun et al.'s work.\n\nNetwork intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network. It performs an analysis of passing traffic on the entire subnet, and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks. Once an attack is identified, or abnormal behavior is sensed, the alert can be sent to the administrator. An example of an NIDS would be installing it on the subnet where firewalls are located in order to see if someone is trying to break into the firewall. Ideally one would scan all inbound and outbound traffic, however doing so might create a bottleneck that would impair the overall speed of the network. OPNET and NetSim are commonly used tools for simulating network intrusion detection systems. NID Systems are also capable of comparing signatures for similar packets to link and drop harmful detected packets which have a signature matching the records in the NIDS.\nWhen we classify the design of the NIDS according to the system interactivity property, there are two types: on-line and off-line NIDS, often referred to as inline and tap mode, respectively. On-line NIDS deals with the network in real time. It analyses the Ethernet packets and applies some rules, to decide if it is an attack or not. Off-line NIDS deals with stored data and passes it through some processes to decide if it is an attack or not.\n\nNIDS can also combined with other technologies to increase detection, and prediction, rates. Artificial Neural Network based IDS are capable of analyzing huge volumes of data, in a smart way, due to the self-organizing structure that allows INS IDS to more efficiently recognize intrusion patterns. Neural networks assist IDS in predicting attacks by learning from mistakes; INN IDS help develop an early warning system, based on two layers. The first layer accepts single values, while the second layer takes the first's layers output as input; the cycle repeats and allows the system to automatically recognize new unforeseen patterns in the network. This system can average 99.9% detection and classification rate, based on research results of 24 network attacks, divided in four categories: DOS, Probe, Remote-to-Local, and user-to-root.\n\nHost intrusion detection systems (HIDS) run on individual hosts or devices on the network. A HIDS monitors the inbound and outbound packets from the device only and will alert the user or administrator if suspicious activity is detected. It takes a snapshot of existing system files and matches it to the previous snapshot. If the critical system files were modified or deleted, an alert is sent to the administrator to investigate. An example of HIDS usage can be seen on mission critical machines, which are not expected to change their configurations.\n\nIntrusion detection systems can also be system-specific using custom tools and honeypots.\n\nSignature-based IDS refers to the detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic, or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware. This terminology originates from anti-virus software, which refers to these detected patterns as signatures. Although signature-based IDS can easily detect known attacks, it is difficult to detect new attacks, for which no pattern is available.\nIn Signature-based IDS, the signatures are released by a vendor for its all products. On-time updation of the IDS with the signature is a key aspect\n\nAnomaly-based intrusion detection systems were primarily introduced to detect unknown attacks, in part due to the rapid development of malware. The basic approach is to use machine learning to create a model of trustworthy activity, and then compare new behavior against this model. Although this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attacks, it may suffer from false positives: previously unknown legitimate activity may also be classified as malicious. Most of the existing IDSs suffer from the time-consuming during detection process that degrades the performance of IDSs. Efficient feature selection algorithm makes the classification process used in detection more reliable.\n\nNew types of what could be called anomaly-based intrusion detection systems are being viewed by Gartner as User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) (an evolution of the user behavior analytics category) and network traffic analysis (NTA). In particular, NTA deals with malicious insiders as well as targeted external attacks that have compromised a user machine or account. Gartner has noted that some organizations have opted for NTA over more traditional IDS.\n\nSome systems may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, and reporting attempts. In addition, organizations use IDPS for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IDPS have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization.\n\nIDPS typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports. Many IDPS can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g. reconfiguring a firewall) or changing the attack's content.\n\nIntrusion prevention systems (IPS), also known as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), are network security appliances that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity. The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it and attempt to block or stop it..\n\nIntrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent or block intrusions that are detected. IPS can take such actions as sending an alarm, dropping detected malicious packets, resetting a connection or blocking traffic from the offending IP address. An IPS also can correct errors, defragment packet streams, mitigate TCP sequencing issues, and clean up unwanted transport and network layer options..\n\nIntrusion prevention systems can be classified into four different types:\n\n\nThe majority of intrusion prevention systems utilize one of three detection methods: signature-based, statistical anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of techniques which attackers are using, the following are considered 'simple' measures which can be taken to evade IDS:\n\nThe earliest preliminary IDS concept was delineated in 1980 by James Anderson at the National Security Agency and consisted of a set of tools intended to help administrators review audit trails. User access logs, file access logs, and system event logs are examples of audit trails.\n\nFred Cohen noted in 1987 that it is impossible to detect an intrusion in every case, and that the resources needed to detect intrusions grow with the amount of usage.\n\nDorothy E. Denning, assisted by Peter G. Neumann, published a model of an IDS in 1986 that formed the basis for many systems today. Her model used statistics for anomaly detection, and resulted in an early IDS at SRI International named the Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES), which ran on Sun workstations and could consider both user and network level data. IDES had a dual approach with a rule-based Expert System to detect known types of intrusions plus a statistical anomaly detection component based on profiles of users, host systems, and target systems. The author of \"IDES: An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders,\" Teresa F. Lunt, proposed adding an Artificial neural network as a third component. She said all three components could then report to a resolver. SRI followed IDES in 1993 with the Next-generation Intrusion Detection Expert System (NIDES).\n\nThe Multics intrusion detection and alerting system (MIDAS), an expert system using P-BEST and Lisp, was developed in 1988 based on the work of Denning and Neumann. Haystack was also developed in that year using statistics to reduce audit trails.\n\nIn 1986 the National Security Agency started an IDS research transfer program under Rebecca Bace. Bace later published the seminal text on the subject, \"Intrusion Detection\", in 2000.\n\nWisdom & Sense (W&S) was a statistics-based anomaly detector developed in 1989 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. W&S created rules based on statistical analysis, and then used those rules for anomaly detection.\n\nIn 1990, the Time-based Inductive Machine (TIM) did anomaly detection using inductive learning of sequential user patterns in Common Lisp on a VAX 3500 computer. The Network Security Monitor (NSM) performed masking on access matrices for anomaly detection on a Sun-3/50 workstation. The Information Security Officer's Assistant (ISOA) was a 1990 prototype that considered a variety of strategies including statistics, a profile checker, and an expert system. ComputerWatch at AT&T Bell Labs used statistics and rules for audit data reduction and intrusion detection.\n\nThen, in 1991, researchers at the University of California, Davis created a prototype Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS), which was also an expert system. The Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter (NADIR), also in 1991, was a prototype IDS developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Integrated Computing Network (ICN), and was heavily influenced by the work of Denning and Lunt. NADIR used a statistics-based anomaly detector and an expert system.\n\nThe Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced Bro in 1998, which used its own rule language for packet analysis from libpcap data. Network Flight Recorder (NFR) in 1999 also used libpcap.\n\nAPE was developed as a packet sniffer, also using libpcap, in November, 1998, and was renamed Snort one month later. Snort has since become the world's largest used IDS/IPS system with over 300,000 active users. It can monitor both local systems, and remote capture points using the TZSP protocol.\n\nThe Audit Data Analysis and Mining (ADAM) IDS in 2001 used tcpdump to build profiles of rules for classifications. In 2003, Yongguang Zhang and Wenke Lee argue for the importance of IDS in networks with mobile nodes.\n\nIn 2015, Viegas and his colleagues proposed an anomaly-based intrusion detection engine, aiming System-on-Chip (SoC) for applications in Internet of Things (IoT), for instance. The proposal applies machine learning for anomaly detection, providing energy-efficiency to a Decision Tree, Naive-Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors classifiers implementation in an Atom CPU and its hardware-friendly implementation in a FPGA. In the literature, this was the first work that implement each classifier equivalently in software and hardware and measures its energy consumption on both. Additionally, it was the first time that was measured the energy consumption for extracting each features used to make the network packet classification, implemented in software and hardware.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jäätteenmäki accused Paavo Lipponen, the then Prime Minister of Finland, of attaching Finland to George W. Bush's 'coalition of the willing' that was in preparation for the 2003 war in Iraq. Lipponen had visited Washington on 9 December 2002.\n\nAccording to Jäätteenmäki, Finland had taken part in a meeting where 'those countries that had promised cooperation and aid' had been invited. It was later discovered that Jäätteenmäki had acquired the information from secret foreign ministry documents, which she had received from Martti Manninen, an advisor to the President of Finland and a member of Jäätteenmäki's party.\n\nPrime Minister Lipponen's actions were suggested to be influenced by the fact that Finland was about to sell AMOS mortars to the U.S. military as part of its Land Warrior program.\n\nThe Left Alliance member of parliament Jaakko Laakso, together with other representatives, had posted a public question on Lipponen's statements in Washington already on 19 December 2002. There was no public inquiry on the matter, even though the documents cast doubt on the legality of mortar deals during the 2001 war in Afghanistan. The Green member Ulla Anttila and others questioned an authorisation to export arms that was granted to Patria-Hägglunds shortly before the war started.\n\nThe Centre Party won the parliamentary election and became the largest party in the Parliament. Jäätteenmäki was appointed Prime Minister of Finland by President Tarja Halonen on 17 April 2003. However, the lack of confidence in Jäätteenmäki caused by her use of secret documents in the campaign and her flat-out denial before the Parliament of having solicited them, despite incriminating evidence, forced her to resign as Prime Minister on 24 June. Jäätteenmäki claimed to have received the documents unexpectedly and without solicitation, which Manninen denied. A new cabinet was formed by Matti Vanhanen, who also became the leader of the Centre Party. Manninen was also sacked from his job as advisor to the president.\n\nOn 19 December 2003, criminal charges were pressed against Martti Manninen for leaking secret documents and against Anneli Jäätteenmäki for incitement and aid to the same. Manninen was found guilty, and had to pay 80 day fines, but Jäätteenmäki was not found guilty, as she did not specifically request the documents.\n\nDavid Schlaefer, spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, denied in 2003 after Jäätteenmäki's resignation that there was ever any understanding on cooperation or assistance between Finland and the U.S. during Lipponen's meetings in Washington, stating at a conference at University of Helsinki that \"it is simply not true, it did not happen.\" \n\nA number of comments made by Prime Minister Jäätteenmäki during the unfolding of her part of the scandal remain as popular phrases in Finland.

Its first chairman was Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. Jewish communal affairs were generally conducted through a hierarchy of representative organizations, including the JNC. Another of these organizations was the National Assembly, which had three hundred members. These three hundred delegates selected from among themselves the members of the National Council, which was also known as the Va'ad Leumi.\nThe members of the JNC also participated in meetings of the Zionist General Council. The organization represented almost all major Jewish factions, however a few smaller groups at first objected to the creation of centralized leadership. Notably, Agudat Israel joined only in 1935. It was announce only in 1946 that the Sephardic Jews and the Zionist Revisionists, would stop refusing to participate in the JNC.\n\nThe Political Department of the JNC was responsible for relations with the Arabs, ties with the Jewish Agency and negotiations with the British government. As the yishuv grew, the JNC adopted more functions, such as education, health care and welfare services, internal defense and security matters, and organized recruitment to the British forces during World War II. In the 1940s, departments for physical training, culture and press and information were added. \n\nThe report of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry issued in 1946, stated: \n\n\"The Jews have developed, under the aegis of the Jewish Agency and the JNC, a strong and tightly-woven community.

The affair was initially reported in late-2007 by \"The National Enquirer\" (a U.S. supermarket tabloid newspaper), but was given little attention outside the tabloid press and political blogosphere. The \"Enquirer\" cited claims from an anonymous source that Edwards had engaged in an affair with Rielle Hunter, a filmmaker hired to work for his presidential campaign, and that Hunter had a child from the relationship. ABC News reported that Andrew Young, a member of Edwards' campaign team, stated that Edwards asked him to \"Get a doctor to fake the DNA results ... and to steal a diaper from the baby so he could secretly do a DNA test to find out if this [was] indeed his child.\"\n\nThe allegations were initially published in late-2007 and were denied by both Edwards and Hunter. Young claimed paternity of Hunter's daughter, although no father is listed on the child's birth certificate, and Young has subsequently denied it.\n\nIn July 2008, several U.S. mainstream media news outlets cited the allegations in relation to Edwards' future political career, as well as in relation to his chances of being selected as a running mate in Barack Obama's 2008 presidential bid. Then, on August 7, 2008, Edwards admitted to ABC News correspondent, Bob Woodruff, that he did have an extended affair with Hunter, but denied that he was the father of Hunter's baby girl. Hunter's sister claimed that Edwards was the father and publicly asked Edwards to take a paternity test to determine whether the child was his.\n\nOn January 21, 2010, Edwards issued a statement admitting that he was the father of Hunter's child. After the admission from Edwards that he fathered a child with Hunter, Edwards' wife, Elizabeth Edwards, announced a separation from her husband, with an intention to file for divorce. On January 25, 2010, the existence of an explicit sex tape, featuring Edwards and Hunter, was publicly reported.\n\nWhen Edwards first admitted to the affair, he stated that Elizabeth was in remission from breast cancer. However, it became clear that the affair was still ongoing, even after he and his wife made a joint announcement that her cancer had returned and was found to be incurable. Elizabeth Edwards died on December 7, 2010.\n\nIn December 2006, \"Newsweek\" reported that Hunter had been hired by the Edwards campaign to produce a series of webisodes that portrayed behind-the-scenes life on the campaign trail. Hunter had pitched the idea of creating the series to Edwards when she met him at a bar in New York, where the politician was attending a business meeting. The campaign paid Hunter's production company, Midline Groove, over USD$100,000 for the short documentaries that were uploaded to YouTube upon completion. In 2006, \"Business Week\" included one of the episodes as a feature in a web video.\n\nThe first apparent mention, in print form, of a possible Edwards/Hunter affair, appeared in the \"New York Post\" on August 27, 2007. The page-six feature published a blind gossip item that asked: \"Which political candidate enjoys visiting New York because he has a girlfriend who lives downtown? The poll tells her he'll marry her when his current wife is out of the picture.\" The mention in the \"Post\" started a tabloid and blogosphere investigation that eventually led to accusations against Hunter and Edwards.\n\nIn September 2007, Sam Stein, a political reporter for \"The Huffington Post\", reported that the Hunter web documentaries had been removed from the internet and were no longer accessible. Representatives from the Edwards campaign stated that the material could not be used due to campaign finance law. Several days later, \"The Huffington Post\" reported that the videos had been reposted to YouTube by an anonymous user.\n\nOn October 10, 2007, the \"Enquirer\" published an article claiming that Edwards had engaged in an extramarital affair with an unnamed female campaign worker. On the same day, Stein published another article in \"The Huffington Post\" that contained additional details about Hunter, including Hunter's name and the web videos that she had produced. The following day, October 11, \"New York\" magazine published a piece linking Hunter to the \"Enquirer\" allegations.\n\nBoth Edwards and Hunter denied the relationship claims. Edwards said the \"Enquirer\" story was \"made up\", further stating, \"I've been in love with the same woman for 30-plus years,\" referring to his wife Elizabeth, \"and as anybody who's been around us knows, she's an extraordinary human being, warm, loving, beautiful, sexy and as good a person as I have ever known. So the story's just false.\" Hunter's attorney issued a denial via Jerome Armstrong, a political blogger and founder of MyDD, stating, \"The innuendos and lies that have appeared on the internet (sic) and in the \"National Enquirer\" concerning John Edwards are not true, completely unfounded and ridiculous.\" David Perel, the Editor-in-Chief at the \"Enquirer\", did not back down from the paper's allegations, stating, \"The original story was 100% accurate.\"\n\nThe \"Enquirer\" published a follow-up story that included a photograph of a visibly pregnant Hunter on December 19, 2007. The \"Enquirer\" alleged that, according to its anonymous source, Hunter was claiming that Edwards was the father of her child. The article also claimed that Hunter had relocated to a gated community in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, near Andrew Young, a former official with the Edwards campaign, who had claimed paternity of Hunter's child. As with Hunter's initial denial of the affair, Young's paternity claim had been issued to Armstrong and published on MyDD.\n\nCBS News journalist, Bob Schieffer, asked about the allegations on \"Imus in the Morning\", stating, \"I believe that's a story that we will be avoiding, because it appears to me that there's absolutely nothing to it ... This seems to be just sort of a staple of modern campaigns, that you got through at least one love child, which turns out not to be a love child. And I think we can all do better than this one.\" Mickey Kaus, a journalist at \"Slate\", speculated that the lack of mainstream coverage was motivated by a desire not to harm Elizabeth Edwards, who was fighting cancer at the time. Kaus also considered the possibility of news organizations taking a \"wait-and-see\" attitude, pending the results of the Iowa caucuses.\n\nAccording to Perel, the \"Enquirer\" had received information stating that Edwards would be visiting Hunter and her child at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on the evening of July 21, 2008, and the paper dispatched several reporters to the hotel. The team of \"Enquirer\" reporters encountered Edwards on the hotel premises sometime after 2 a.m. on the morning of July 22. According to Perel, Edwards, who was not a registered guest of the hotel, retreated from the reporters to a washroom, where he remained until being escorted from the premises by hotel security. The encounter between Edwards and the \"Enquirer\" reporters was later confirmed by a hotel guard interviewed by Fox News. Edwards' spokespeople did not respond to Fox's request for comment on the incident.\n\nIn articles published immediately after the hotel encounter, the \"Enquirer\" claimed to be in possession of evidence showing that Edwards had visited Hunter and her child in the Hilton for several hours, including a videotape of Hunter entering the room, where she allegedly met Edwards, and one of Edwards leaving the same room. However, the paper declined a request from Fox News to release photos or videotape of the incident. In an interview with \"Radar\", Perel said that the \"Enquirer\" would release the photos when \"the time is right.\" The \"Enquirer\" later stated that it had filed a \"criminal complaint\" against the hotel's security over its conduct during the encounter, but the Beverly Hills Police Department said that there was no criminal complaint and that only an \"incident report\" was under investigation.\n\nWhen Edwards was questioned at a New Orleans event on July 23, 2008, he stated, \"I have no idea what you're asking about. I've responded, consistently, to these tabloid allegations by saying I don't respond to these lies and you know that ... and I stand by that.\" On the same day, Hunter appeared on the television program, \"Extra\", describing the \"Enquirer\" story as \"completely unfounded and ridiculous\".\n\nOn August 6, 2008, the \"Enquirer\" published a blurry photo that allegedly portrayed Edwards holding Hunter's baby.\n\nAside from the Fox News story on July 25, mainstream news sources did not immediately report the story. Articles describing the \"Enquirer\" allegations were eventually published by the magazines, \"New York\" and \"Radar\". The claims were also mentioned in opinion columns and in-house blogs of several other papers. On July 23, Glenn Beck talked about the story on his program, Headline News, recommending that Edwards sue the \"Enquirer\" if its story was proven false. On that same day, Roxanne Roberts, a style writer for \"The Washington Post\", said, \"We have no evidence this is true. Lots of juicy details—enough so Edwards may feel he has to address the issue, especially if it's not true and there's an innocent explanation. Or not. That won't stop anyone from talking about it, but let's assume, until we know the facts, that this could be false.\"\n\nOn July 25, in response to a question as to whether \"The Washington Post\" was investigating the claims, political reporter, Jonathan Weisman, stated, \"Yes, and to be quite honest, we're waiting to see the pictures the \"Enquirer\" says it will publish this weekend. That said, Edwards is no longer an elected official and is not running for any office now. Don't expect wall-to-wall coverage.\" Meanwhile, on that same day, Kaus, at \"Slate\", published an e-mail sent to him the day before from Tony Pierce, an editor at the \"Los Angeles Times\". It was sent to the \"Times\"' in-house bloggers, and, referring to the Edwards allegations, stated, \"I am asking you all not to blog about this topic until further notified.\" Kaus portrayed the email as a \"gag\" order. In an online interview, Pierce defended the e-mail, stating that it was the result of a decision by senior editors at the \"Times\" to allow time for the newspaper's Metro Desk to investigate the allegations. Pierce also pointed out that a \"Times\" blogger had already posted a story on the \"Enquirer\" claims.\n\nOn August 8, 2008, in response to a high number of e-mails to the \"Times\", National Editor, Scott Kraft, stated that \"this strikes us as a legitimate story\". \"Times\" bloggers subsequently posted a story on the topic.\n\nOver the period of July 27–28, the claims and speculation about the possible impact on Edwards' political career, from the incident thus far, were picked up by several papers outside the U.S., including \"The Times\", \"The Independent\", \"Der Spiegel\", \"The Irish Independent\", and \"The Times of India\".\n\nIn the American political blogosphere, the story was covered by The Drudge Report, Jack Shafer, Kaus at \"Slate\", Alex Coppelman at Salon.com, Rachel Sklar Lee Stranahan; (Stranahan also cross-posted his article to \"Daily Kos\") at \"The Huffington Post\", independent political pundit, James Joyner, Rod Dreher at \"The Dallas Morning News\", Paul Mulshine at \"The Star-Ledger\", and Guy Adams at \"The Independent\".\n\nSome of the coverage alleged mainstream media bias due to Edwards' Democratic affiliation. Others voiced contempt for tabloid papers like the \"Enquirer\" and compared the coverage to that of a scandal involving Republican Senator Larry Craig. Others claimed that the \"Enquirer\" was reliable in regard to scandal reporting, noting the reporting on the Gary Hart/Donna Rice affair, the O. J. Simpson murder case, Jesse Jackson's out-of-wedlock child, and Rush Limbaugh's prescription drug addiction.\n\nNon-coverage was also discussed. Some stated that the non-coverage was motivated by sympathy for Elizabeth Edwards. Several prominent sites criticized the omission of information about the allegations, most notably Gawker.com and Roger L. Simon of Pajamas Media, whose posts were linked by Glenn Reynolds at the high-traffic weblog, \"Instapundit\". For instance, as of August 6, cable television news network, CNN, had not mentioned the story, and MSNBC had mentioned it once. Several pundits stated that Edwards was \"fair game\" for reporting on the allegations because he had been recently identified as a potential candidate for vice president or attorney general for Obama, and that Edwards himself had made his marital fidelity an issue in his campaign.\n\nBlogosphere claims of a media \"blackout\" extended to the online reference site, Wikipedia, and its biographical article on Edwards. The Wikipedia biography was later changed to include a mention of the allegations' potential impact on Edwards' political career. The controversy over the Wikipedia page was covered by \"Wired\" magazine and \"Kansas City Star\" columnist Aaron Barnhart, who opined the addition of the information to the Wikipedia article influenced later media coverage of the allegations.\n\nOn July 31, 2008, a late-night talk program played part of a David Letterman \"Top 10\" list that alluded to the charges. On the same night, \"The O'Reilly Factor\" played a clip of a Jay Leno monologue from the \"Tonight Show\" that mentioned it. Altogether, Fox News had run stories or discussed the matter six times by August 6, more than any other cable news organization.\n\nOn August 8, 2008, in a statement that coincided with the Opening Ceremonies of the 2008 Olympic Games, Edwards admitted to the affair but denied he was the father of the child, expressing his willingness to take a paternity test. His statement included:\n\nIn 2006, I made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough ...\n\nOn the same day, Elizabeth Edwards released a statement that first appeared on the liberal blog, \"The Daily Kos\". The statement said that, in 2006, \"John had made a terrible mistake,\" though she went on to praise her husband for \"courage in the face of shame.\" She also said that she hoped people would watch the interview that aired later that night on the ABC News late-night program, \"Nightline\", in which her husband admitted the affair to Woodruff. She did, in her statement, criticize the claims that her husband fathered a child as an \"absurd lie in a tabloid publication.\" Elizabeth Edwards' seemingly willing participation in the efforts to cover up the affair have also been called into question. \"I think she's complicit,\" said Brad Crone, a Raleigh-based Democratic consultant. \"Obviously, she knew. While she's the victim, she clearly didn't stand in the way of the cover-up.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2008, a friend of Hunter's, Pigeon O'Brien, informed CBS News that Edwards had lied about the timeline of the affair. She claimed the affair began in February 2006, six months earlier than the time Edwards had hired Hunter to start working on his political action committee and when he had claimed that the affair had begun. O'Brien also stated that the affair was not a brief liaison, but a mutual, committed relationship based on love; or so Edwards had led Hunter to believe.\n\nOn August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, participated in an interview with CBS, in which she personally apologized to John Edwards' wife for her sister's behavior. She also claimed Edwards had lied in his confession, because the affair was of a longer duration than the timeframe that he had claimed and was still ongoing. Marshall also stated that, in the days after the story broke, Edwards provided Hunter and her baby with a new and secret domicile to prevent media reporters from finding her. She also called upon Edwards to tell the complete truth about the affair. During that same day, an article from CBS News was published saying, \"CBS News legal analyst, Mickey Sherman, told \"Early Show\" co-anchor, Maggie Rodriguez, that Edwards may be in legal jeopardy if it could be shown that the funds were used for purposes other than the ones that they had been assigned for. \"If you raise money to run for (office)\", Sherman explained, \"and if you take that money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their money is going to a presidential candidate, and you give it to a girlfriend of a God-knows-what ... that's a crime. The \"New York Daily News\" also reported on that same day that, when questioned about the affair by reporters, Mimi Hockman, Hunter's partner in the Midline Groove video production company, \"said the contract they signed with John Edwards had a 'hefty' confidentiality clause that bars her from talking.\" Two days earlier, on August 11, 2008, Hockman had been questioned by reporters from the \"Star-Ledger\" at her home. According to reporter, John Mooney, \"Mary 'Mimi' Hockman [told reporters], 'Don't waste your time. ... I'm contractually prohibited from talking to you.\n\nOn August 18, 2008, David Carr, news media columnist for \"The New York Times\", wrote that while the \"Enquirer\" can be inaccurate, its revelations about the Edwards affair were a service to the public:\n\n\"There are some stories, especially ones that occur in the bedroom, where mainstream media outlets sometimes can't venture—or at least they can't find it in themselves to lead the charge. But it would be hard to argue that the body politic is not enriched by the recent revelations that Mr. Edwards is not who we thought he was, even balanced against the many stories the Enquirer gets wrong.\" (Even in his confession, Mr. Edwards wrinkled his nose and suggested that the allegations had originated with \"supermarket tabloids\", as if the method of conveyance absolved him of the deeds described.)\n\nOn August 1, 2008, the \"Enquirer\" published an article naming Hunter's child and mainstream news organizations subsequently obtained a copy of the birth certificate, confirming that a girl had been born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital on February 27, 2008. The birth certificate listed the mother's name as \"Rielle Jaya James Druck,\" while the child was given the surname \"Hunter\"; no father's name was listed. Media reports linked the Druck and Hunter surnames on the birth certificate to conclude that the mother was Rielle Hunter; the reports also noted that the child was born approximately two months after Young's claimed paternity had been announced by Hunter and Young.\n\nWhen questioned about the omission of the father's name from the birth certificate, Hunter's attorney stated, \"A lot of women do that\", and that the issue was \"a personal matter\" between Hunter and Young, before declining to comment further.\n\nIn late-July and early-August 2008, news outlets reported that Edwards was avoiding further questions from reporters about the \"Enquirer\" claims. WCNC-TV, a North Carolina television station, reported that Edwards' political career was \"effectively frozen\", pending resolution of the allegations.\n\nIn August 2008, Fred Baron, Edwards' campaign finance chairman, told NBC News that he had been providing financial assistance to both Hunter and Young without Edwards' knowledge; he further stated that no campaign funds had been used. Reportedly, Young had also successfully solicited funds from Rachel Lambert Mellon, also known as \"Bunny\" Mellon, a 99-year-old heiress to the Mellon fortune. Baron passed away two months later.\n\nIn August 2008, senior figures in the Democratic Party warned that Edwards' failure to respond to the allegations could affect his role at the 2008 Democratic convention. According to Don Fowler, former Democratic National Committee chair, \"If there is not an explanation that's satisfactory, acceptable and meets high moral standards, the answer is 'no,' [Edwards] would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention.\" Gary Pearce, who ran Edwards' 1998 Senate race, said, \"It's a very damaging thing. ... If it's not true, [Edwards] has got to stand up and say, 'This is not true. That is not my child and I'm going to take legal action against the people who are spreading these lies.' It's not enough to say, 'That's tabloid trash. Edwards' admission that he engaged in an affair came less than a day after these warnings were published.\n\nFormer congressman, David Bonior, Edwards' 2008 presidential campaign manager, stated: \"Thousands of friends of the senator and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him, and he's let them down. They've been betrayed by his action.\" When asked about Edwards' future in public service, Bonior further stated, \"You can't lie in politics and expect to have people's confidence.\"\n\nIn May 2009, ABC News political correspondent, George Stephanopoulos, reported that campaign staff members became cognizant of the affair in early-2008. Staff members said that if it appeared Edwards was on his way to winning the Democratic Party nomination, they intended to sabotage it for the benefit of the party. Edwards' senior adviser, Joe Trippi, said this report was \"complete bullshit\". He added, \"No one that I know had such a plan. I wasn't involved in a plan like that, it didn't exist, it's a fantasy.\" However, in August 2006, several staffers—including Josh Brumberger, Kim Rubey, and David Ginsberg—had strong suspicions about the affair and left the campaign over concerns about Hunter. Rubey and Ginsberg later discussed their obligation to the party to come forward with what they knew, after finding Young's paternity claim unconvincing.\n\nA federal grand jury investigated whether any of Edwards' campaign funds were misspent on covering up the affair and, on August 6, 2009, Hunter testified before a federal grand jury in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nOn January 21, 2010, John Edwards admitted that he was, indeed, Quinn's father. In late January 2010, John and Elizabeth separated. In February 2010, \"The National Enquirer\" reported that Edwards had proposed to Hunter, but that report was categorically denied by an Edwards spokesperson.\n\nAlthough Young had previously stated he was the father, he recanted in a book proposal. In a pre-release copy of Young's book, obtained by the \"Wall Street Journal\", Young revealed that after Edwards and Hunter returned from a trip to Uganda in 2006, Elizabeth answered Edward's mobile to hear Hunter \"launch into a romantic monologue.\" Edwards confessed to having had a one-night stand but did not say with whom. He returned the call in front of his wife to end the affair, but later called Hunter back to say he did not mean it. Young also revealed that Edwards had confided in him about wanting to leave \"crazy Elizabeth\", but could not, as she engaged with American voters better than he did.\n\nRielle Hunter also released a book about the relationship and announced her breakup with Edwards on the day of the book's release in 2012.\n\nOn February 9, 2016, Hunter spoke on \"Steve Harvey\" in her first televised interview in almost five years, Hunter, 51, said that the couple were actually still together up until February 2015.\n\nOn June 3, 2011, Edwards was indicted by a North Carolina grand jury on six felony charges. Edwards faced a maximum sentence of thirty years in prison and a $1.5 million fine, or a USD250,000 fine and/or five years imprisonment per charge. The indictment came after the failure of intensive negotiations for a plea bargain agreement. The agreement would have meant that Edwards would have been required to plead guilty to three misdemeanor campaign finance law violations, in addition to a six-month prison sentence, but would have allowed Edwards to keep his law license.\n\nAfter delays, due to John Edwards' medical condition, jury selection for the trial began on April 12, 2012. Opening arguments began on April 23, 2012. A verdict (not guilty on one count and a mistrial on the remaining five) to the trial was reached on May 31, 2012.\n\nThe trial was criticized by Republicans, such as Michael Steele and Joe Scarborough, who referred to the procedure as \"an absolute waste of resources.\"\n"}
{"id": "8337513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8337513", "title": "John Salvi", "text": "John Salvi\n\nJohn C. Salvi III (March 2, 1972 – November 29, 1996) was a Catholic abortion opponent who carried out fatal shootings at two reproductive health clinics in Brookline, Massachusetts, on December 30, 1994, killing two and wounding five. He later died in 1996 of an apparent suicide.\n\nIn the mid-morning of December 30, 1994, John Salvi walked into the Planned Parenthood clinic on Beacon Street in Brookline, Massachusetts, carrying a black duffle bag. In the waiting room, he took a modified semiautomatic .22 rifle from the bag and wordlessly opened fire. A clinic assistant, Arjana Agrawal, was hit in the abdomen. Salvi then shot Shannon Lowney, the receptionist who had greeted him, in the neck, killing her instantly. Approximately forty people were in the room during the assault; of these, three were wounded. \n\nSalvi left Planned Parenthood, and drove west on Beacon Street to the Preterm Health Services office. He asked receptionist Leeann Nichols, \"Is this Preterm?\" When she said yes, witnesses report that Salvi responded,\"This is what you get! You should pray the rosary!\" before he shot her multiple times. As he had at Planned Parenthood, Salvi continued to fire. Among those injured was part-time security guard, Richard J. Seron. Seron returned fire while protecting injured clinic worker Jane Sauer, who had been hit and was on the floor. Seron himself was shot four times in the arms, and once in the left hand. Salvi then dropped the black duffle bag, which contained a gun, receipts from a gun dealer in New Hampshire, and 700 rounds of ammunition. He fled in his Audi. Police were able to identify him from the gun shop receipt in the abandoned bag.\n\nJohn Salvi was captured in Norfolk, Virginia, after firing over a dozen bullets into the Hillcrest Clinic. The clinic was open at the time, however, Salvi was captured before making his way up to the second floor where Hillcrest was located. \n\nOn March 19, 1996, he was found guilty of murdering receptionists Lee Ann Nichols and Shannon Lowney. After an unsuccessful defense strategy related to Salvi's mental state, he was convicted in both killings.\n\nSalvi had long shown signs of mental illness. Despite erratic outbursts, difficulty living alone, earlier threats of violence, and the possibility that he was involved in an arson in Florida, neither the anti-abortion protestors who saw Salvi become distraught at their vigils, nor his family who had witnessed glaring signs of his illness, took steps to prevent Salvi from hurting himself or others. Salvi's parents were concerned that he was troubled, but they did not seek professional psychiatric assistance with their son, as they thought that the stigma of mental illness could impair Salvi's ability to live on his own.\n\nThen-Cardinal of the Archdiocese of Massachusetts, Bernard Law, called for a moratorium on clinic protests following the shooting. Part of his reasoning was that other disturbed individuals could be inspired to commit violence during the protests. However, the moratorium was ignored by aggressive anti-abortionists in the archdiocese, including Catholic members of the local Operation Rescue group.\n\nHillcrest Clinic, in Virginia, had been a target of pickets by Donald Spitz, a known supporter of anti-abortion violence, before Salvi attacked it. The Boston Globe reported that Salvi had Spitz's name and unlisted phone number on his person at the time of his arrest. Spitz was never charged in connection with Salvi's activities. Spitz held a rally in support of Salvi outside of Norfolk City Jail. The Massachusetts Citizens for Life requested that Spitz not attend Salvi's trial, because of his outspoken endorsement of anti-abortion violence.\n\nAt Salvi's trial, the defense argued that Salvi suffered from schizophrenia. Several expert witnesses, including noted forensic psychiatrist Phillip J. Resnick, M.D., testified that Salvi exhibited schizophrenic behavior and was not competent to stand trial. John's mother, Anne Marie Salvi, testified that her son had told her that he, \"was the thief on the cross with Jesus.\" The defense argued that Salvi told his parents that \"...the mafia and KKK are out to get me\".\n\nThe prosecution used the testimony of Bridgewater State Hospital psychologist Joel Haycock, who spent eleven days with Salvi out of his sixty days under observation. Haycock determined that during the time of his observation of Salvi in a hospital setting, Salvi had no hallucinations, could speak in a non-digressive linear way, and was capable of understanding guilt. Haycock observed no signs of psychotic disorder during his time with Salvi. Haycock also asserted that Salvi had no mental disease at the time of the crime and was competent to stand trial. \n\nOn March 19, 1996, Salvi was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and five counts of armed assault with intent to murder.\n\nJohn Salvi believed in a number of farfetched conspiracy theories. While considered by his defense as evidence of severe mental illness, many elements of his conspiracy beliefs reflected those of others on the extreme end of anti-abortion activism : \"Shortly after his arrest he released a handwritten note alleging conspiracies of Freemasons, conspiracies to manipulate paper currency, and conspiracies against Catholics. ... He has talked about the Vatican printing its own currency and a specific conspiracy of the Ku Klux Klan, the Freemasons, and the Mob.\"\n\nSalvi was found dead in his prison cell at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts with a garbage bag over his head tied around his neck on November 29, 1996. The official report states that Salvi's death was a suicide.\n\nFollowing Salvi's suicide, his conviction was overturned by the sentencing judge. Judge Barbara Dortch-Okara invoked the legal principle of abatement ab initio, which says that a conviction may not stand if the accused dies before his appeals are exhausted.\n\n"}
{"id": "1118652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1118652", "title": "Junior State of America", "text": "Junior State of America\n\nThe Junior State of America (formerly, the Junior Statesmen of America, or JSA) is an American non-partisan youth organization. The purpose of JSA is to help high school students acquire leadership skills and the knowledge necessary to be effective debaters and civic participants. JSA is sponsored by the Junior State of America Foundation Inc. (JSAF, a 501c(3) non-profit corporation), which also operates the JSA Summer Schools.\n\nStudents organize every aspect of the organization, from the local chapter level to the regional level. The members elect local, regional, and state leaders to organize JSA conventions, conferences, and political awareness events.\n\nJSA is both a local and a national organization. The JSA is organized by regions, somewhat congruous with the real geographic United States regions. At the high school chapter level, chapter presidents organize local activities and meetings. On the regional level, mayors and vice mayors organize regional one-day conferences. On the state level, governors and lieutenant governors organize overnight conventions and other activities. On the national level, governors are in communication with each other planning convention themes and steering the direction of the organization.\n\nThe JSA program includes debates, \"thought talks\", problem solving, and a variety of simulations designed to provide members with an informed viewpoint and the ability to analyse important issues. Simulations include, for example, Model United Nations, Model Congress (with a Senate and House of Representatives), crisis simulations, and other activities. JSA provides an opportunity to meet other students from outside their home communities who share similar interests; furthermore, debate conventions usually include various evening activities like dining downtown or impromptu debate.\n\nIn addition to sponsoring the JSA, the JSF sponsors three- and four-week Summer School sessions for JSA members and other high school students. These are held at Princeton, Stanford, and Georgetown and week-long symposium on state and local politics are held in several states. (In years past, JSF has held Summer School sessions at Yale, Northwestern University, University of Texas at Austin, University of California, Davis and University of California, Santa Cruz). Sessions include college-level courses on political science, economics, history and public speaking. Students from all over the world, (most notably England, France, Turkey, Micronesia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hong Kong) attend Summer School. The revenue from these programs help fund the school-year JSA program.\n\nJSA was founded in 1934 by Professor E. A. Rogers at the Montezuma Mountain School in Los Gatos, California, as an experiment in self-government. Students at the Montezuma Mountain School set up their own tree-branch government, complete with a student court, police force, executive officer, and legislative branch. The students would draft, pass, and enforce their own rules.\n\nThe JSA has had liaisons with other similar organizations outside of the United States. For example, throughout the 1980s the Pacific-Northwest State developed close ties with the British Columbia Youth Parliament (BCYP). \"Ambassadors\" were invited from the Pacific-Northwest State to attend the December BCYP legislative session in Victoria, British Columbia, as well a number of BCYP sponsored events, including the \"Vernon Conference\" held in 1985, a project to celebrate the United Nations International Year of the Youth, involving the BCYP, the TUXIS Parliament of Alberta, and the JSA. In turn, the BCYP would send delegates to attend Pacific-Northwest Spring and Fall State. The Southern California state also added the American School in Honduras as a chapter in 2006 and the school's chapter attended the annual Congress convention. There are two active chapters in St. Kitts and St. Thomas, USVI. Puerto Rico has traditionally one or two chapters. All Caribbean chapters attend either the Northeast State or Mid-Atlantic State conventions.\n\nSince its inception in 1934, more than 500,000 student members have participated in the JSA.\n\nMost notable former members include Leon Panetta (Former Secretary of Defense, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, White House Chief of Staff, United States Congressman, and Member of the California State Senate), Mike McCurry (Press Secretary under President Bill Clinton), Edwin Meese (Attorney General under President Ronald Reagan), Jennifer Palmieri (White House Communication Director under President Barack Obama) businessman and inventor Charles R. Schwab, and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\n\n\nThe JSA consists of 10 states which correspond roughly to the geographic territories in the United States: the Arizona State, Mid-Atlantic State, Midwest State, Northeast State, Northern California State, Ohio River Valley State, Pacific Northwest State, Southeast State, Southern California State, and the Texas State. Each state is broken into one or more regions. If a state contracts below a certain operational level, the Council of Governors may vote to make the state a territory. The Council may also break states into multiple territories if they become too large to be effectively managed.\n\nThe current Council of Governors has ten members:\n\nJoshua Garay: Arizona State\n\nDev Patel: Mid-Atlantic State\n\nMax Zhang: Midwest State\n\nOliver Soglin: Northern California\n\nJenny Wang: Northeast\n\nGene Kim: Ohio River Valley\n\nMia Barkenaes: Pacific Northwest\n\nKatelin Zhou: Southern California\n\nMatt Jenkins: Southeast\n\nDominic Beck: Texas\n\nThe sponsoring JSF is a non-profit organization with an adult board of directors, trustees and paid staff. The JSA receives administrative and programming support from the JSF.\n\nFall and Spring State are statewide overnight conventions at regional hotels and convention centers. Both consist of debates, thought talks, and special activities, including political fairs and a casual dance. Fall State is one night, students typically arrive at the hotel on a Saturday and return home the following day. Spring State, by comparison, usually takes place over three days, students arriving at the hotel on a Friday and returning on Sunday. At this longer spring convention JSA members in attendance elect regional leaders for the upcoming year. Both Fall and Spring State conventions are highlighted by prestigious keynote speakers, with past speakers including Pat Robertson, Ralph Nader, Colin Powell, and Joe Trippi.\n\nWinter Congress is structured more like an actual Congress: students are divided into Senate and House of Representative committees. They pass bills in committees and then in floor sessions of the Senate and House. If a bill passes both houses, it becomes JSA law.\n\nThere are also smaller, regional conferences and chapter-conferences (\"chapter-cons\") which occur on a local level. Regionals are run by the Mayors and Vice-Mayors of Regions along with the Regional Cabinet members that they appoint. Chapter-cons are usually hosted by chapters at individual schools and are not officially JSA-sponsored events.\n\nAs a student-run organization, each JSA state holds elections yearly at the Spring State conventions to elect student elected officials who serve one-year terms. Each state elects a Governor and Lieutenant Governor, as well as various other offices that differ from state to state. These officials each appoint a small cabinet that helps them run the organization by completing tasks such as organizing convention logistics, writing debates, producing publicity materials, founding new chapters, and running websites. There is also a National Cabinet appointed by the Council of Governors. JSA officials and cabinet members are typically extremely dedicated to JSA, and often spend many hours per week doing their jobs.\n\nAfter the school year is over, JSA and JSF offer numerous summer programs. The biggest programs, which are held at major universities, are Summer Schools, which are conducted by the Junior Statesmen Foundation and offer students an opportunity to study local, state, or national government at an advanced level. These programs are meant to prepare young leaders for active participation in public affairs.\n\nThese programs, at which students take a full semester of two courses over three or four weeks, for which they can receive high school credit, take place at Stanford, Georgetown, Princeton, and Beijing. Along with debate and regular classes (including Advanced Placement and Law Classes), students participate in a vigorous Speaker's Program in which notable speakers talk about current issues to the students. Past speakers have included Mike McCurry, Andy Card, Ben Bernanke, Lee H. Hamilton, Norman Mineta, Joe Trippi, Dennis Kucinich, Chuck Hagel, Katie Couric, Brian Williams, Geraldine Ferraro, John Kerry, Harry Reid, Barack Obama, Ted Rall, George H.W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Ed Meese, William Perry, Bernie Sanders, Brian Williams, Karl Rove, Sebastian Gorka, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nSummer institutes are also held in different regions, such as the summer symposium of Arizona State, Stanford, UCLA, Princeton University and University of Texas. These events are four- to five-days long and venture into politics, world studies, history, national security and discussions of current events. Princeton's event is nicknamed \"Princetitute.\" These events used to be known as symposia.\n\nEvery summer, the newly elected governors each choose a select few from their states or territories to attend the Montezuma National Leadership Summit (affectionately known as \"Zuma\"). The summit is held in early-to-mid August at Presentation Center in Los Gatos, California, the former site of the Montezuma Mountain School where JSA was founded in 1934. Students who are selected to attend this summit learn more about the history and national dynamics of JSA. Being selected for attendance is considered one of the ultimate JSA honors, and many of the students that attend lead future years of the Junior State. Subsequently, two or three students are selected out of class to become a National Montezuma Foundation Student Advisor, working with the Junior State Foundation to preside over budget and funding allocations for the National Montezuma Summit.\n\n"}

{"id": "28069984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28069984", "title": "Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut", "text": "Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut\n\nMohegan Indians v. Connecticut (1705–1773) was the first indigenous land rights litigation in history in a common law jurisdiction. James Youngblood Henderson, professor of law, calls the case \"the first major legal test of indigenous tenure.\" Robert Clinton calls it the \"first formal litigation of North American Indian rights.\"\n\nMark Walters has noted that the case established that \"in certain circumstances native nations on reserved lands in British colonies were subject, not to colonial jurisdictions established for settlers, but to their own traditional customs.\" The Mohegan claim was not a claim to aboriginal title, but a claim that certain lands were held in trust by the descendants of John Mason on behalf of the Mohegan.\n\nIn 1979, the Mohegan Indian Tribe filed a suit against the state for possession of lands in Montville, Connecticut. In this re-litigation, the judge held in 1980 that the 1790 Non-Intercourse Act applied to the case, a ruling upheld on appeal. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case. In 1994 the tribe gained federal recognition by the Department of Interior; in addition, that year Congress passed the \"Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act\", which authorized the US to take 800 acres of land into trust for the tribe for use as its reservation, and allowed it to have gambling operations on the property.\n\nEnglish settlers arrived on the coast of Connecticut in the 1630s, coming into contact with the Mohegan people, who had been part of the Pequot. Following the Pequot War of 1637, in which the Mohegan had been allied with the English in the near destruction of the Pequot, the \"sachem\" Uncas ceded all Mohegan lands to the colonists in 1640, with the exception of a reserve of farms and hunting grounds.\n\nIn 1659, the Mohegan conveyed the reserved lands to Major John Mason, the future deputy governor. The conveyance was to Mason and his heirs \"as their Protector and Guardian In Trust for the whole Moheagan Tribe.\" Mason transferred the land to the colonial government in 1660, on the condition that sufficient land be left for the Mohegan to farm. Both the Mohegan and Mason's heirs argued—during the century-long dispute—that this last transfer was invalid, and that his heirs continued to hold the land in trust for the Mohegan.\n\nConnecticut was incorporated by royal charter in 1662, with its boundaries including the disputed lands. A 1681 treaty between the Mohegan and the colony acknowledged a Mohegan interest in the land; it provided that the colony would administer \"Equal Justice\" to the Mohegan \"as our own people\" if they \"before hand declared their Subjection to our Laws.\" In 1687, the colony began granting the disputed land to settlers by legislation and orders in council.\n\nIn 1704, the Masons petitioned the Crown, on behalf of the Mohegan, arguing that the land grants to colonists violated the treaties with the tribe. In February 1704, Sir Edward Northey, the Attorney General, opined to the Board of Trade, which administered the colony, that the Crown could establish a court with the authority to hear the dispute, and enforce its decision upon the colony should the Mohegan prevail. Northey also expressed his opinion that the act of Connecticut in granting the land was \"illegal and void.\" In March 1704, the Board of Trade agreed and referred Northey's advice to the Crown. The Board of Trade also recommended that the Crown cover the legal fees of the Mohegan.\n\nThe Crown agreed in April 1704. It referred the dispute to Governor Joseph Dudley and the council of Massachusetts, with a Commission empowering them to form a tribunal. The Commission's ruling was to be legally binding without subsequent approval by the Crown, but the right of appeal to the Privy Council was reserved.\n\nWalters argues that the Mohegan must have been considered a \"component of the Empire\" in order for the Crown to have original jurisdiction over a dispute between them and Connecticut. In refusing to create a similar Commission to mediate a dispute between settlers in New Jersey and the colony of New Jersey over the purchase of Native American lands, the Attorney General later opined that the situations were inapposite because there was \"no common Court of Justice\" between the Mohegan and Connecticut.\n\nConnecticut contested the jurisdiction of the Commission and did not participate further. Dudley and the Commission unanimously sided with the Mohegan in 1705.\n\nOn appeal from the colony, the Privy Council appellate committee granted a Commission of Review in 1706. This Commission never met.\n\nA second such Commission was established in 1737. The second Commission consisted of the Governor of Rhode Island, and members from the councils of Rhode Island and New York. That Commission sided with Connecticut in 1738, on the grounds that Ben Uncas—who was embroiled in a \"sachem\" succession dispute—was the valid \"sachem\" and had recently released Connecticut from the land claim. After the Commission determined that Ben Uncas was the \"sachem\", before reaching the merits, the New York council members (who had dissented on the \"sachem\" issue) accused the Rhode Island council members of bias and left. The merits decision was ultimately set aside because of \"alleged irregularities.\" A third Commission was called.\n\nMeeting in 1743, the third Commission sided with Connecticut. The \"sachem\" issue was not re-litigated because Connecticut withdrew its objection. Third-party tenants were allowed to raise an objection to the jurisdiction of the original tribunal. The Commission eventually reached the merits and decided that the deeds to the colonial settlers were valid.\n\nThe Mohegan appealed to the Privy Council. The appeal began in 1770 and the Privy Council sided with Connecticut in 1772, without a written opinion. The Crown confirmed this decision in 1773.\n\nThe decision was not reported in a law reporter. No reported judicial decisions from the 17th or 18th centuries recognized or applied Aboriginal customary law.\nJ.H. Smith provides a detailed history of the legal proceedings of the case, but only sporadically includes quotes from the decision.\n\nA summary of \"Mohegan Indians\" was included by Chief Justice John Marshall in his opinion in \"Johnson v. M'Intosh\" (1823):\n\nThe controversy between the colony of Connecticut and the Mohegan Indians, depended on the nature and extent of a grant made by those Indians to the colony; on the nature and extent of the reservations made by the Indians, in their several deeds and treaties, which were alleged to be recognised by the legitimate authority; and on the violation by the colony of rights thus reserved and secured. We do not perceive, in that case, any assertion of the principle, that individuals might obtain a complete and valid title from the Indians.\n\nThis has been considered the first case to rule on indigenous land tenure. In 1995, Robert N. Clinton described it as \"the first major eighteenth century challenge to local colonial control of relations with Indian tribes,\" and \"the greatest cause ever heard at the Council Board.\"\n\nSome commentators have suggested that \"Mogehan Indians\" demonstrated that British law recognized indigenous tribal nations as having rights of sovereignty. For example, in 1950 J.H. Smith claims that the Mohegan were \"juristically regarded as sovereign.\" Mark Walters, a lecturer at Oxford, disagrees with these claims. Walters agrees that, if true, that interpretation of the decision would \"revolutionize the traditional understanding of Aboriginal legal status in Canada.\"\n\nIn 1979, the Mohegan Indian Tribe filed a complaint against the state of Connecticut in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut for possession of lands in the northeast portion of Montville, Connecticut. In his ruling of 1980, Judge Blumenfeld rejected the state's motion to dismiss, holding that the 1790 Indian Non-intercourse Act applied to the entire country, including the lands in question.\n\nThe Second Circuit upheld this ruling on interlocutory appeal. The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari and let the Appeals decision stand.\n\nOn remand, Blumenfeld granted the Mohegan's motion to strike the state's affirmative defenses, holding that the state's title—acquired from private parties who acquired the land in violation of the Non-intercourse Act—was void, and that the Tenth and Eleventh amendments did not bar the suit. Finally, Blumenfeld struck the state's defense of \"res judicata\" based on the 18th-century lawsuit, holding—\"inter alia\"—that \"the 1743 judgment itself recognizes the Indians' possessory right to the lands at issue in this action.\"\n\nOn March 15, 1994, the Department of the Interior granted the Mohegan Indian Tribe (MITC) federal recognition. On October 19, 1994, the U.S. Congress passed the \"Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act\", extinguishing all of the Mohegan aboriginal title in Connecticut and all claims of the Mohegan Nation against the state, in exchange for its approval of Mohegan gaming operations. It authorized the transfer of 800 acres, the remaining Mohegan reservation lands, which had been used as the United Nuclear site (and cleaned up), to the United States in trust for the tribe.\n\nThe MITC opened the Mohegan Sun casino on October 12, 1996. It has since expanded the facility to a full resort, including a hotel, conference facility, restaurants and shops.\n"}

It is designated as a terrorist organisation by the Government of India.\n\nNDFB traces its origin to Bodo Security Force, a militant group formed in 1986. The current name was adopted in 1994, after the group rejected Bodo Accord signed between the Government of India and ABSU-BPAC. The group has carried out several attacks in Assam, targeting non-Bodo civilians as well as the security forces. In particular, Due to arm conflict between Adivasi Cobra Force and NDFB it has targeted Santhal, Munda and Oraon adivasis (tribals), whose ancestors had been brought to Assam as tea labourers during British Raj. It involved in attacks on Adivasis during Bodo-Adivasi ethnic clash during the 1996 Assam Legislative Assembly elections led to the formation of Adivasi Cobra Force, a rival militant group. After 1996, NDFB was also involved in conflicts with the militant group Bodo Liberation Tigers Force (which surrendered in 2003). Since 2000, NDFB has increasingly targeted Bangladeshi migrants in what it claims to be the Boro territory.\n\nDuring the 1990s, NDFB established 12 camps on the Bhutan-Assam border. After suffering major reverses during Royal Bhutan Army's Operation All Clear, NDFB signed a ceasefire with the Indian authorities in May 2005.\n\nThis was followed by a split in the group: NDFB(P), the progressive faction supported peace talks with the government, while the faction led by Nabla opposed the talks. In 2012, following the arrest of their chairman, NDFB of Nabla faction split further, leading to the formation of another new faction, which was led by a non-Bodo I K Songbijit as an interim president of the interim council. This faction continued to indulge in militancy, and has been blamed by the government for May and December 2014 attacks.\n\nThe general assembly of the outfit held on 14 and 15 April, 2015 has vowed to revamp their national struggle and declared that the former interim national council of NDFB led by Songbijit is dissolved and a new national council was formed to fight for the liberation of sovereign, independent Boroland.\n\nThe main grievances of the group are the under-development in the region and the influx of immigrants. It aims to address these issues by seceding from India, and establishing a sovereign Boroland. The NDFB constitution, adopted on 10 March 1998, lists its objectives as the following:\n\nThe promotion of the Roman script for the Bodo language is also a significant objective of NDFB and are against the use of Devanagari script for the language. \n\nThe Bodos are an ethno-linguistic community native to the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam state of India. In the mid-1980s, Bodo politicians, alleging discrimination against Bodos in Assam, intensified their campaign for the creation of Bodo-majority Bodoland. While majority of the Bodos envisaged Bodoland as an autonomous territory or state within India, a small section demanded complete sovereignty. NDFB was formed by secessionist Bodos on 3 October 1986 as the Bodo Security Force (BdSF), under the leadership of Ranjan Daimary, in Odla Khasibari village (near Udalguri). BdSF carried out several violent attacks against non-Bodo civilians. On 12 December 1992, it attacked the 7th Assam Police Battalion headquarters at Choraikhola in Kokrajahar District, and decamped with 160 self-loading Rifles(SLR) and 5 Light Machine Guns(LMG).\n\nThe Bodoland movement was mainly led by the political organisations All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) and Bodo Peoples' Action Committee (BPAC). In 1993, these two groups signed the Bodo Accord with Indian government, agreeing to the formation of Bodoland Autonomous Council within Assam. BdSF opposed this Accord. Shortly after the Accord, the Assam State Government refused to hand over 2,750 villages to the proposed Council, arguing that Bodos formed less than 50% of the population in these villages. Following this, the BdSF was renamed to National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) on 25 November 1994. The NDFB then launched an ethnic cleansing campaign, attacking non-Bodo communities in these villages. During the 1996 Assam Legislative Assembly elections, it killed hundreds of Santhal, Munda and Oraon adivasis (tribals), whose ancestors had been brought to Assam as tea labourers during British Raj. In response, the tribals formed Adivasi Cobra Force, their own militant group.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, NDFB also faced a rival within the Bodo community, in form of Bodo Liberation Tigers Force (BLTF). The BLTF had evolved from an older militant group called the Bodo Volunteer Force. It considered NDFB's secessionist agenda unrealistic and unattainable, and focused on establishment of an autonomous Bodo territory within India. After 1996, the two groups clashed violently for supremacy. BLTF allied with Bengali Tiger Force to protect Bengalis from NDFB attacks, and also supported Indian security forces against NDFB. The conflicts between Christian-dominated NDFB and Hindu-dominated BLTF polarised the Bodoland movement along religious lines. In 2003, BLTF surrendered en masse in return for the establishment of the Bodoland Territorial Council.\n\nNDFB had established 12 camps on the Bhutan-Assam border. During 2003-2004, the Royal Bhutan Army destroyed these camps as part of its Operation All Clear. NDFB chief Ranjan Daimary was offered amnesty by the Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi in December 2003, but rejected the offer. On 8 October 2004, the NDFB announced a 6-month long unilateral ceasefire, that came into effect on 15 October. However, the Government continued its operations against the group. On 15 April 2005, NDFB extended the ceasefire. The Government released its general secretary Govinda Basumatary to open a channel of communication with the organisation's Bangladesh-based leadership. This resulted in a ceasefire agreement between NDFB and the Government on 25 May 2005. The agreement stated that the NDFB agree to cease hostile action against security forces and civilians. In return, the security forces would not carry out operations against the group's members. The agreement also stipulated that NDFB members would disarm and live in camps protected by the military for a year, and would refrain from assisting other militant groups. The pact came into force on 1 June 2005. However, certain factions of NDFB continued militancy. In May 2006, five members of the security forces were abducted and killed by suspected NDFB members in Assam's Udalguri District. The group also continued to clash with cadres of the ex-BLTF (Bodo Liberation Tiger Force). On June 5, 2006, two former BLTF cadres were killed by NDFB militants in the Karbi Anglong District, and one former member of the disbanded group was lynched by suspected NDFB militants in Golaghat District on June 3, 2007.\n\nIn 2008, the group split into two after Ranjan Daimary's name appeared in the 2008 Assam bombings case. NDFB(P), the pro-talks factions led by B Sungthagra supported peace talks with the governments. NDFB(R), led by Daimary, refused to give up militancy. In December 2008, the NDFB(P) indicated its plans to indirectly or directly participate the Lok Sabha elections. In 2012, I K Songbijit, the chief of the NDFB(R) faction's \"Boroland Army\", announced the formation of a nine-member \"interim national council\", resulting in a split. NDFB(S), the faction led by Songibijit, is now the most dreaded faction.\n\nAfter the Operation All Clear in 2003 the then united NDFB decided to go for ceasefire and talk to resolve the political issue in the year 2004. The proposal was submitted in 2008 and there was a meeting of the joint military council in Manipur. The secretary in the ministry of development of north east region, Naveen Verma, told the general secretary of the outfit that they must amend their proposition instead of negotiation at table or in other words they were forced to revise it, amend it and write a new memorandum.\n\nThere would have been no talks and extension of ceasefire unless the proposition was revised and amended which was submitted by the faction now known as National Democratic Front of Boroland - Progressive and the faction led by Ranjan Daimary who rejected it was then known as the Anti-Talks Faction, which further split into two factions.\n\n\n\nNDFB have a sizeable number of sophisticated weapons including AK-series rifles. Since they have camps in Myanmar across Arunachal Pradesh, they have easy access to the latest weapons. \n\nNDFB has carried out bombings, kidnappings and murders in Assam. Due to arm conflict between NDFB and Adivasi Cobra Force, Many times NDFB attacked on Adivasi. The Assam Government has accused it of launching an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Oriya Adivasis and Bengali Muslim settlers in the region. \n\nThe group primarily operates in the region to the north and north-west of the Brahmaputra river. It is active in the Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Darrang, Barpeta, Dhubri, Nalbari and Sonitpur Districts of Assam. It has also been active in the Garo Hills region of Meghalaya. It has used the neighbouring Bhutan as a refuge, crossing the border in the Manas National Park area. In December 2003, the Royal Bhutan Army initiated a crackdown on the group's activities in Bhutan.\n\nBetween 1992 and 2001, the violence involving NDFB resulted in the deaths of 167 security forces personnel and over 1200 civilians:\n\nThe attacks attributed to the NDFB include (SATP). Some incident don't have evidence but NDFB is believed to be involved. \n\n"}

{"id": "60562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60562", "title": "Redlining", "text": "Redlining\n\nIn the United States and Canada, redlining is the systematic denial of various services to residents of specific, often racially associated, neighborhoods or communities, either directly or through the selective raising of prices. While the best known examples of redlining have involved denial of financial services such as banking or insurance, other services such as health care or even supermarkets have been denied to residents. In the case of retail businesses like supermarkets, purposely locating impractically far away from said residents results in a redlining effect. Reverse redlining occurs when a lender or insurer targets particular neighborhoods that are predominantly nonwhite, not to deny residents loans or insurance, but rather to charge them more than in a non-redlined neighborhood where there is more competition.\n\nIn the 1960s, sociologist John McKnight coined the term \"redlining\" to describe the discriminatory practice of fencing off areas where banks would avoid investments based on community demographics. During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were black inner city neighborhoods. For example, in Atlanta in the 1980s, a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles by investigative reporter Bill Dedman showed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle-income or upper-income blacks. The use of blacklists is a related mechanism also used by redliners to keep track of groups, areas, and people that the discriminating party feels should be denied business or aid or other transactions. In the academic literature, redlining falls under the broader category of credit rationing.\n\nAlthough informal discrimination and segregation had existed in the United States, the specific practice called \"redlining\" began with the National Housing Act of 1934, which established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Racial segregation and discrimination against minorities and minority communities pre-existed this policy. The implementation of this federal policy aggravated the decay of minority inner-city neighborhoods caused by the withholding of mortgage capital, and made it even more difficult for neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes. The assumptions in redlining resulted in a large increase in residential racial segregation and urban decay in the United States.\n\nIn 1935, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) asked Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create \"residential security maps\" to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments in each surveyed city. On the maps, the newest areas—those considered desirable for lending purposes—were outlined in green and known as \"Type A\". These were typically affluent suburbs on the outskirts of cities. \"Type B\" neighborhoods, outlined in blue, were considered \"Still Desirable\", whereas older \"Type C\" were labeled \"Declining\" and outlined in yellow.\n\"Type D\" neighborhoods were outlined in red and were considered the most risky for mortgage support. These neighborhoods tended to be the older districts in the center of cities; often they were also black neighborhoods. Urban planning historians theorize that the maps were used by private and public entities for years afterward to deny loans to people in black communities. But, recent research has indicated that the HOLC did not redline in its own lending activities and that the racist language reflected the bias of the private sector and experts hired to conduct the appraisals.\n\nSome redlined maps were also created by private organizations, such as J.M. Brewer's 1934 map of Philadelphia. Private organizations created maps designed to meet the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration's underwriting manual. The lenders had to consider FHA standards if they wanted to receive FHA insurance for their loans. FHA appraisal manuals instructed banks to steer clear of areas with \"inharmonious racial groups\", and recommended that municipalities enact racially restrictive zoning ordinances.\n\nFollowing a National Housing Conference in 1973, a group of Chicago community organizations led by The Northwest Community Organization (NCO) formed National People's Action (NPA), to broaden the fight against disinvestment and mortgage redlining in neighborhoods all over the country. This organization, led by Chicago housewife Gale Cincotta and Shel Trapp, a professional community organizer, targeted The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the governing authority over federally chartered Savings & Loan institutions (S&L) that held at that time the bulk of the country's home mortgages. NPA embarked on an effort to build a national coalition of urban community organizations to pass a national disclosure regulation or law to require banks to reveal their lending patterns.\n\nFor many years, urban community organizations had battled neighborhood decay by attacking blockbusting, forcing landlords to maintain properties, and requiring cities to board up and tear down abandoned properties. These actions addressed the short-term issues of neighborhood decline. Neighborhood leaders began to learn that these issues and conditions were symptoms of a disinvestment that was the true, though hidden, underlying cause of these problems. They changed their strategy as more data was gathered.\n\nWith the help of NPA, a coalition of loosely affiliated community organizations began to form. At the Third Annual Housing Conference held in Chicago in 1974, eight hundred delegates representing 25 states and 35 cities attended. The strategy focused on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), which oversaw S&L's in cities all over the country.\n\nIn 1974, Chicago's Metropolitan Area Housing Association (MAHA), made up of representatives of local organizations, succeeded in having the Illinois State Legislature pass laws mandating disclosure and outlawing redlining. In Massachusetts, organizers allied with NPA confronted a unique situation. Over 90% of home mortgages were held by state-chartered savings banks. A Jamaica Plain neighborhood organization pushed the disinvestment issue into the statewide gubernatorial race. The Jamaica Plain Banking & Mortgage Committee and its citywide affiliate, The Boston Anti-redlining Coalition (BARC), won a commitment from Democratic candidate Michael S. Dukakis to order statewide disclosure through the Massachusetts State Banking Commission. After Dukakis was elected, his new Banking Commissioner ordered banks to disclose mortgage-lending patterns by ZIP code. The suspected redlining was revealed.\n\nNPA and its affiliates achieved disclosure of lending practices with the passage of The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975. The required transparency and review of loan practices began to change lending practices. NPA began to work on reinvestment in areas that had been neglected. Their support helped gain passage in 1977 of the Community Reinvestment Act.\n\nAccording to blackpast.org contributor Brent Gaspaire:\n\nRedlining paralyzed the housing market, lowered property values in certain areas and encouraged landlord abandonment. As abandonment increased, the population density became lower. Abandoned buildings served as havens for drug dealing and other illegal activity, increasing social problems and reluctance of people to invest in these areas.\nBecause areas were redlined residents in them were unable to obtain loans to improve their homes or get loans to move to a different area. Obviously, the neighborhoods had zero investment while neighborhoods around them improved. When the GI Bill was created during World War II, veterans who once lived in redlined areas were unable to get zero interest loans to build new homes like the rest of the returning soldiers. This forced them to stay in the areas that were poor and uninvested in while the rest of America was growing and moving to the suburbs. Around the same time the GI Bill was created, the Federal Highway Act was also created. Because the areas that were redlined were so poor, many cities chose to destroy these areas to create the highways. The residents were displaced and forced to move into different uninvested neighborhoods while their homes and businesses were destroyed by the highways.\n\nA 2017 study by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economists found that the practice of redlining—the practice whereby banks discriminated against the inhabitants of certain neighborhoods—had a persistent adverse impact on the neighborhoods, with redlining affecting homeownership rates, home values and credit scores in 2010. Since many African-Americans could not access conventional home loans, they had to turn to predatory lenders (who charged high interest rates). Due to lower home ownership rates, slumlords were able to rent out apartments that would otherwise be owned.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a $200 million settlement with Associated Bank over redlining in Chicago and Milwaukee in May 2015. The three-year HUD observation led to the complaint that the bank purposely rejected mortgage applications from black and Latino applicants. The final settlement required AB to open branches in non-white neighborhoods, just like HCSB.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced a settlement with Evans Bank for $825,000 on September 10, 2015. An investigation had uncovered the erasure of black neighborhoods from mortgage lending maps. According to Schneiderman, of the over 1,100 mortgage applications the bank received between 2009 and 2012, only four were from African Americans. Following this investigation, the Buffalo News reported that more banks could be investigated for the same reasons in the near future. The most notable examples of such DOJ and HUD settlements have focused heavily on community banks in large metropolitan areas, but banks in other regions have been the subject of such orders as well, including First United Security Bank in Thomasville, Alabama, and Community State Bank in Saginaw, Michigan.\n\nThe United States Department of Justice announced a $33 million settlement with Hudson City Savings Bank, which services New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, on September 24, 2015. The six-year DOJ investigation had proven that the company was intentionally avoiding granting mortgages to Latinos and African Americans and purposely avoided expanding into minority-majority communities. The Justice Department called it the \"largest residential mortgage redlining settlement in its history.\" As a part of the settlement agreement, HCSB was forced to open branches in non-white communities. As U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman explained to Emily Badger for The Washington Post, \"[i]f you lived in a majority-black or Hispanic neighborhood and you wanted to apply for a mortgage, Hudson City Savings Bank was not the place to go.\" The enforcement agencies cited additional evidence of discrimination Hudson City's broker selection practices, noting that the bank received 80 percent of its mortgage applications from mortgage brokers but that the brokers with whom the bank worked were not located in majority African-American and Hispanic areas.\n\nIn the United States, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was passed to fight the practice. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development \"The \"Fair Housing Act\" makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin.\" The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity was tasked with administering and enforcing this law. Anyone who suspects that their neighborhood has been redlined is able to file a housing discrimination complaint.\n\nThe Community Reinvestment Act passed by Congress in 1977 to reduce discriminatory credit practices against low-income neighborhoods further required banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities. Although open redlining was made illegal in the 1970s through community reinvestment legislation, the practice may have continued in less overt ways. AIDS activists allege redlining of health insurance against the LGBT community in response to the AIDS crisis.\n\nShoreBank, a community-development bank in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood, was a part of the private-sector fight against redlining. Founded in 1973, ShoreBank sought to combat racist lending practices in Chicago's African-American communities by providing financial services, especially mortgage loans, to local residents. In a 1992 speech, then-Presidential candidate Bill Clinton called ShoreBank \"the most important bank in America.\" On August 20, 2010, the bank was declared insolvent, closed by regulators and most of its assets were acquired by Urban Partnership Bank.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, community organizations, under the banner of the NPA, worked to fight against redlining in South Austin, Illinois. One of these organisations was SACCC (South Austin Coalition Community Council), formed to restore South Austin's neighbourhood and to fight against financial institutions accused of propagating redlining. This got the attention of insurance regulators in the Illinois Department of Insurance, as well as federal officers enforcing anti-racial discrimination laws.\n\nRetail redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among retailers. Taxicab services and delivery food may not serve certain areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition and assumptions about business (and perceived crime), rather than data and economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Consequently, consumers in these areas are vulnerable to prices set by fewer retailers. They may be exploited by retailers who charge higher prices and/or offer them inferior goods.\n\nA 2012 study by the \"Wall Street Journal\" found that Staples, Home Depot, Rosetta Stone and some other online retailers displayed different prices to customers in different locations (distinct from shipping prices). Staples based discounts on proximity to competitors like OfficeMax and Office Depot. This generally resulted in higher prices for customers in more rural areas, who were on average less wealthy than customers seeing lower prices.\n\nSome service providers target low-income neighborhoods for nuisance sales. When those services are believed to have adverse effects on a community, they may considered to be a form of \"reverse redlining.\" The term \"liquorlining\" is sometimes used to describe high densities of liquor stores in low income and/or minority communities relative to surrounding areas. High densities of liquor stores are associated with crime and public health issues, which may in turn drive away supermarkets, grocery stores, and other retail outlets, contributing to low levels of economic development. Controlled for income, nonwhites face higher concentrations of liquor stores than do whites.\n\nIn December 2007, a class action lawsuit was brought against student loan lending giant Sallie Mae in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The class alleged that Sallie Mae discriminated against African American and Hispanic private student loan applicants.\n\nThe case alleged that the factors Sallie Mae used to underwrite private student loans caused a disparate impact on students attending schools with higher minority populations. The suit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose loan terms to private student loan borrowers.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled in 2011. The terms of the settlement included Sallie Mae agreeing to make a $500,000 donation to the United Negro College Fund and the attorneys for the plaintiffs receiving $1.8 million in attorneys' fees.\n\nCredit card redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among credit card issuers, of providing different amounts of credit to different areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Scholars assess certain policies, such as credit card issuers reducing credit lines of individuals with a record of purchases at retailers frequented by so-called \"high-risk\" customers, to be akin to redlining.\n\nGregory D. Squires wrote in 2003 that data showed that race continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry. Racial profiling or redlining has a long history in the property-insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry. Home-insurance agents may try to assess the ethnicity of a potential customer just by telephone, affecting what services they offer to inquiries about purchasing a home insurance policy. This type of discrimination is called linguistic profiling. There have also been concerns raised about redlining in the automotive insurance industry. Reviews of insurance scores based on credit are shown to have unequal results by ethnic group. The Ohio Department of Insurance in the early 21st century allows insurance providers to use maps and collection of demographic data by ZIP code in determining insurance rates. The FHEO Director of Investigations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sara Pratt, wrote:\n\nLike other forms of discrimination, the history of insurance redlining began in conscious, overt racial discrimination practiced openly and with significant community support in communities throughout the country. There was documented overt discrimination in practices relating to residential housing—from the appraisal manuals which established an articulated \"policy\" of preferences based on race, religion and national origin. to lending practices which only made loans available in certain parts of town or to certain borrowers, to the decision-making process in loans and insurance which allowed the insertion of discriminatory assessments into final decisions about either.\n\nReverse redlining occurs when a lender or insurer particularly targets minority consumers, not to deny them loans or insurance, but to charge them more than would be charged to a similarly situated white consumer, specifically marketing the most expensive and onerous loan products. These communities had largely been ignored by most lenders just a couple of decades earlier. In the 2000s some financial institutions considered black communities as suitable for subprime mortgages. Wells Fargo partnered with churches in black communities, where the pastor would deliver \"wealth building\" seminars in their sermons, and the bank would make a donation to the church in return for every new mortgage application. Working-class blacks wanted a part of the nation's home-owning trend. Instead of contributing to homeownership and community progress, predatory lending practices through reverse redlining stripped the equity homeowners struggled to build and drained the wealth of those communities for the enrichment of financial firms. The growth of subprime lending (higher cost loans to borrowers with flaws on their credit records) prior to the 2008 financial crisis, coupled with growing law enforcement activity in those areas, clearly showed a surge in a range of manipulative practices. Not all subprime loans were predatory, but virtually all predatory loans were subprime. Some subprime loans certainly benefit high-risk borrowers who would not qualify for conventional, prime loans. Predatory loans, however, charge unreasonably higher rates and fees by compared to the risk, trapping homeowners in unaffordable debt and often costing them their homes and life savings.\n\nA survey of two districts of similar incomes, one being largely white and the other largely black, found that bank branches in the black community offered largely subprime loans and almost no prime loans. Studies found out that high-income blacks were almost twice as likely to end up with subprime home-purchase mortgages as did low-income whites. Some loan officers referred to blacks as \"mud people\" and to subprime lending as \"ghetto loans.\" A lower savings rate and a distrust of banks, stemming from a legacy of redlining, may help explain why there are fewer branches in minority neighborhoods. In the early 21st century, brokers and telemarketers actively pushed subprime mortgages. A majority of the loans were refinance transactions, allowing homeowners to take cash out of their appreciating property or pay off credit card and other debt.\n\nRedlining has helped preserve segregated living patterns for blacks and whites in the United States, as discrimination is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods and the race of the applicant. Lending institutions such as Wells Fargo have been shown to treat black mortgage applicants differently when they are buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods.\n\nDan Immergluck writes that in 2002 small businesses in black neighborhoods received fewer loans, even after accounting for business density, business size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses.\n\nSeveral state attorneys general have begun investigating these practices, which may violate fair lending laws. The NAACP filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination by more than a dozen banks.\n\nPolicies related to redlining and urban decay can also act as a form of environmental racism, which in turn affect public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities. This may have an indirect effect on health, since young people have fewer places to play, and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.\n\nRobert Wallace writes that the pattern of the AIDS outbreak during the 80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of \"planned shrinkage\" directed at African-American and Hispanic communities. It was implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire protection resources, essential to maintain urban levels of population density and ensure community stability. Institutionalized racism affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The over-representation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the 80s and 90s, showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services.\n\nWorkers living in American inner cities have more difficulty finding jobs than do suburban workers.\n\nFair Housing Act\n\nThe Fair Housing Act (also known as the Civil Rights Act) of 1968 was passed in order to help protect minority individuals from the discriminatory practices of financial institutions and agents.\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe Human Relations Commissions of Pennsylvania adopted guidelines regarding redlining. The guidelines demonstrate practices that are to be prohibited in the selling of property to people.\n\nThe film \"Revolution '67\" examines the practice of redlining that occurred in Newark, New Jersey in the 1960s.\n\n\n\nGreenwald, Carol S., \"Banks are Dangerous to your Wealth\", Prentice-Hall 1980.\n\nHallahan, Kirk. \"The Mortgage Redlining Controversy 1972–1975\" https://web.archive.org/web/20130809022759/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf\n\nWestgate, Michael and Ann Vick., \"Gale Force, The Battles For Disclosure and Community Reinvestment\", Harvard Book Store, 2nd edition, 2011. \n\nRothstein, Richard, \"The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America\", Liveright, 1st Ed.

However, the complexity of these systems and how the designers integrate them, the roles and responsibilities of the humans that interact with the systems, and the cyber security of these highly networked systems has led to a new paradigm in research philosophy for next generation control systems. Resilient Control Systems consider all of these elements and those disciplines that contribute to a more effective design, such as cognitive psychology, computer science, and control engineering to develop interdisciplinary solutions. These solutions consider such things such as how to tailor the control system operating displays to best enable the user to make an accurate and reproducible response, how to design in cyber security protections such that the system defends itself from attack by changing its behaviors, and how to better integrate widely distributed computer control systems to prevent cascading failures that result in disruptions to critical industrial operations. In the context of cyber-physical systems, resilient control systems are an aspect that focuses on the unique interdependencies of a control system, as compared to information technology computer systems and networks, due to its importance in operating our critical industrial operations.\n\nOriginally intended to provide a more efficient mechanism for controlling industrial operations, the development of digital control systems allowed for flexibility in integrating distributed sensors and operating logic while maintaining a centralized interface for human monitoring and interaction. This ease of readily adding sensors and logic through software, which was once done with relays and isolated analog instruments, has led to wide acceptance and integration of these systems in all industries. However, these digital control systems have often been integrated in phases to cover different aspects of an industrial operation, connected over a network, and leading to a complex interconnected and interdependent system. While the control theory applied is often nothing more than a digital version of their analog counterparts, the dependence of digital control systems upon the communications networks, has precipitated the need for cybersecurity due to potential effects on confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. To achieve resilience in the next generation of control systems, therefore, addressing the complex control system interdependencies, including the human systems interaction and cyber security, will be a recognized challenge.\n\nResearch in resilience engineering over the last decade has focused in two areas, organizational and information technology. Organizational resilience considers the ability of an organization to adapt and survive in the face of threats, including the prevention or mitigation of unsafe, hazardous or compromising conditions that threaten its very existence. Information technology resilience has been considered from a number of standpoints . Networking resilience has been considered as quality of service. Computing has considered such issues as dependability and performance in the face of unanticipated changes . However, based upon the application of control dynamics to industrial processes, functionality and determinism are primary considerations that are not captured by the traditional objectives of information technology. .\n\nConsidering the paradigm of control systems, one definition has been suggested that \"Resilient control systems are those that tolerate fluctuations via their structure, design parameters, control structure and control parameters\". However, this definition is taken from the perspective of control theory application to a control system. The consideration of the malicious actor and cyber security are not directly considered, which might suggest the definition, \"an effective reconstitution of control under attack from intelligent adversaries,\" which was proposed. However, this definition focuses only on resilience in response to a malicious actor. To consider the cyber-physical aspects of control system, a definition for resilience considers both benign and malicious human interaction, in addition to the complex interdependencies of the control system application .\n\nThe use of the term “recovery” has been used in the context of resilience, paralleling the response of a rubber ball to stay intact when a force is exerted on it and recover its original dimensions after the force is removed. Considering the rubber ball in terms of a system, resilience could then be defined as its ability to maintain a desired level of performance or normalcy without irrecoverable consequences. While resilience in this context is based upon the yield strength of the ball, control systems require an interaction with the environment, namely the sensors, valves, pumps that make up the industrial operation. To be reactive to this environment, control systems require an awareness of its state to make corrective changes to the industrial process to maintain normalcy. With this in mind, in consideration of the discussed cyber-physical aspects of human systems integration and cyber security, as well as other definitions for resilience at a broader critical infrastructure level, the following can be deduced as a definition of a resilient control system:\n\nConsidering the flow of a digital control system as a basis, a resilient control system framework can be designed. Referring to the left side of Fig. 1, a resilient control system holistically considers the measures of performance or normalcy for the state space. At the center, an understanding of performance and priority provide the basis for an appropriate response by a combination of human and automation, embedded within a multi-agent, semi-autonomous framework. Finally, to the right, information must be tailored to the consumer to address the need and position a desirable response. Several examples or scenarios of how resilience differs and provides benefit to control system design are available in the literature.\n\nSome primary tenets of resilience, as contrasted to traditional reliability, have presented themselves in considering an integrated approach to resilient control systems. These cyber-physical tenants complement the fundamental concept of dependable or reliable computing by characterizing resilience in regard to control system concerns, including design considerations that provide a level of understanding and assurance in the safe and secure operation of an industrial facility. These tenants are discussed individually below to summarize some of the challenges to address in order to achieve resilience.\n\nThe benign human has an ability to quickly understand novel solutions, and provide the ability to adapt to unexpected conditions. This behavior can provide additional resilience to a control system, but reproducibly predicting human behavior is a continuing challenge. The ability to capture historic human preferences can be applied to bayesian inference and bayesian belief networks, but ideally a solution would consider direct understanding of human state using sensors such as an EEG. Considering control system design and interaction, the goal would be to tailor the amount of automation necessary to achieve some level of optimal resilience for this mixed initiative response. Presented to the human would be that actionable information that provides the basis for a targeted, reproducible response.\n\nIn contrast to the challenges of prediction and integration of the benign human with control systems, the abilities of the malicious actor (or hacker) to undermine desired control system behavior also create a significant challenge to control system resilience. Application of dynamic probabilistic risk analysis used in human reliability can provide some basis for the benign actor. However, the decidedly malicious intentions of an adversarial individual, organization or nation make the modeling of the human variable in both objectives and motives. However, in defining a control system response to such intentions, the malicious actor looks forward to some level of recognized behavior to gain an advantage and provide a pathway to undermining the system. Whether performed separately in preparation for a cyber attack, or on the system itself, these behaviors can provide opportunity for a successful attack without detection. Therefore, in considering resilient control system architecture, atypical designs that imbed active and passively implemented randomization of attributes, would be suggested to reduce this advantage.\n\nWhile much of the current critical infrastructure is controlled by a web of interconnected control systems, either architecture termed as distributed control systems (DCS) or supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), the application of control is moving toward a more decentralized state. In moving to a smart grid, the complex interconnected nature of individual homes, commercial facilities and diverse power generation and storage creates an opportunity and a challenge to ensuring that the resulting system is more resilient to threats. The ability to operate these systems to achieve a global optimum for multiple considerations, such as overall efficiency, stability and security, will require mechanisms to holistically design complex networked control systems. Multi-agent methods suggest a mechanism to tie a global objective to distributed assets, allowing for management and coordination of assets for optimal benefit and semi-autonomous, but constrained controllers that can react rapidly to maintain resilience for rapidly changing conditions.\n\nEstablishing a metric that can capture the resilience attributes can be complex, at least if considered based upon differences between the interactions or interdependencies. Evaluating the control, cyber and cognitive disturbances, especially if considered from a disciplinary standpoint, leads to measures that already had been established. However, if the metric were instead based upon a normalizing dynamic attribute, such a performance characteristic that can be impacted by degradation, an alternative is suggested. Specifically, applications of base metrics to resilience characteristics are given as follows for type of disturbance:\nSuch performance characteristics exist with both time and data integrity. Time, both in terms of delay of mission and communications latency, and data, in terms of corruption or modification, are normalizing factors. In general, the idea is to base the metric on “what is expected” and not necessarily the actual initiator to the degradation. Considering time as a metrics basis, resilient and un-resilient systems can be observed in Fig. 2.\n\nDependent upon the abscissa metrics chosen, Fig. 2 reflects a generalization of the resiliency of a system. Several common terms are represented on this graphic, including robustness, agility, adaptive capacity, adaptive insufficiency, resiliency and brittleness. To overview the definitions of these terms, the following explanations of each is provided below: \nOn the abscissa of Fig. 2, it can be recognized that cyber and cognitive influences can affect both the data and the time, which underscores the relative importance of recognizing these forms of degradation in resilient control designs. For cybersecurity, a single cyberattack can degrade a control system in multiple ways. Additionally, control impacts can be characterized as indicated. While these terms are fundamental and seem of little value for those correlating impact in terms like cost, the development of use cases provide a means by which this relevance can be codified. For example, given the impact to system dynamics or data, the performance of the control loop can be directly ascertained and show approach to instability and operational impact.\n\n The very nature of control systems implies a starting point for the development of resilience metrics. That is, the control of a physical process if based upon quantifiable performance and measures, including first principles and stochastic. The ability to provide this measurement, which is the basis for correlating operational performance and adaptation, then also becomes the starting point for correlation of the data and time variations that can come from the cognitive, cyber-physical sources. Effective understanding is based upon developing a manifold of adaptive capacity that correlates the design (and operational) buffer. For a power system, this manifold is based upon the real and reactive power assets, the controllable having the latitude to maneuver, and the impact of disturbances over time. For a modern distribution system (MDS), these assets can be aggregated from the individual contributions as shown in Fig. 3 . For this figure, these assets include: a) a battery, b) an alternate tie line source, c) an asymmetric P/Q-conjectured source, d) a distribution static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM), and e) low latency, four quadrant source with no energy limit.\n\n1) When considering the current digital control system designs, the cyber security of these systems is dependent upon what is considered border protections, i.e., firewalls, passwords, etc. If a malicious actor compromised the digital control system for an industrial operation by a man-in-the-middle attack, data can be corrupted with the control system. The industrial facility operator would have no way of knowing the data has been compromised, until someone such as a security engineer recognized the attack was occurring. As operators are trained to provide a prompt, appropriate response to stabilize the industrial facility, there is a likelihood that the corrupt data would lead to the operator reacting to the situation and lead to a plant upset. In a resilient control system, as per Fig. 1, cyber and physical data is fused to recognize anomalous situations and warn the operator.\n\n2) As our society becomes more automated for a variety of drivers, including energy efficiency, the need to implement ever more effective control algorithms naturally follow. However, advanced control algorithms are dependent upon data from multiple sensors to predict the behaviors of the industrial operation and make corrective responses. This type of system can become very brittle, insofar as any unrecognized degradation in the sensor itself can lead to incorrect responses by the control algorithm and potentially a worsened condition relative to the desired operation for the industrial facility. Therefore, implementation of advanced control algorithms in a resilient control system also requires the implementation of diagnostic and prognostic architectures to recognize sensor degradation, as well as failures with industrial process equipment associated with the control algorithms.\n\nIn our world of advancing automation, our dependence upon these advancing technologies and the skill sets needed to keep the United States at the forefront of innovation. The challenges may appear rooted in design of better means to better control our infrastructures for greater safety and efficiency in generation and use of energy. However, the evolution of the technologies developed to achieve the current design of automation has achieved a complex environment where a cyber-attack, human error in design or operation, or a damaging storm can wreak havoc on the infrastructure we depend as a Nation. The next generation of systems will need to consider the broader picture to ensure as a path forward, failures do not lead to ever greater catastrophic events. As a critical resource are the students of tomorrow who will be expected to advance these designs, and require both a perspective on the challenges and the contributions of others to fulfill the need. Addressing this need, courses have been developed to provide the perspectives and relevant examples to overview the issues and provide opportunity to create resilient solutions at such universities as George Mason University and Northeastern. The tie to critical infrastructure operations is an important aspect of these courses.\n\nThrough the development of technologies designed to set the stage for next generation automation, it has become evident that effective teams are comprised several disciplines. However, developing a level of effectiveness can be time consuming, and when done in a professional environment can expend a lot of energy and time that provides little obvious benefit to the desired outcome. It is clear that the earlier these STEM disciplines can be successfully integrated, the more effective they are at recognizing each other’s contributions and working together to achieve a common set of goals in the professional world. Team competition at venues such as Resilience Week will be a natural outcome of developing such an environment, allowing interdisciplinary participation and providing an exciting challenge to motivate students to pursue a STEM education.\n\nStandards and policy that define resilience nomenclature and metrics are needed to establish a value proposition for investment, which includes government, academia and industry. The IEEE Industrial Electronics Society has taken the lead in forming a technical committee toward this end. The purpose of this committee will be to establish metrics and standards associated with codifying promising technologies that promote resilience in automation. This effort is distinct from more supply chain community focus on resilience and security, such as the efforts of ISO and NIST\n\n\n"}

The returning officer is responsible for handling the electoral process in the riding, and updating the National Register of Electors with current information about voters in the electoral district to which they are appointed. Before enactment of the Canada Elections Act in 2000, in the case of a tie between the two leading candidates in an election, the returning officer would cast the deciding vote. Since 2000, a tie between two leading candidates automatically results in a by-election.\n\nThe provinces and territories of Canada each have their own returning officers.\n\nGermany has a Federal Returning Officer and a returning officer in each State.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the returning officer is usually an administrative officer of the government.\n\nThe returning officer of a parliamentary or assembly constituency is responsible for the conduct of elections in the parliamentary or assembly constituency concerned as per the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Returning officer is the statutory authority to conduct the polling, counting process and to decide validity of ballot paper and election commission has no power to overrule him or her.\n\nThe Election Commission of India nominates or designates an officer of the government or a local authority as the returning officer for each of the assembly and parliamentary constituencies in consultation with the state government/union territory administration. In addition, the Election Commission of India also appoints one or more assistant returning officers for each of the assembly and parliamentary constituencies to assist the returning officer in the performance of his functions in connection with the conduct of elections.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the post of returning officer in Dublin and Cork is held by the city sheriff, and in the other areas by the county registrar of the area (a senior court official). For local elections, the position is held by the administrative head of the local council. The returning officer for presidential elections and referendums is a senior official in the franchise section of the Department of the Environment.\n\nThe Returning Officer in Singapore is in charge of overseeing the conduct of parliamentary (by-elections and general elections) and presidential elections. The RO declares results for the parliamentary general elections and the presidential elections in the following manner:\n\nFor SMCs:\n\nFor GRCs:\n\nFor presidential elections:\n\nFor SMCs with a walkover:\n\nFor GRCs with a walkover:\n\nSection 49, Subsection 7E, Paragraph A of the Parliamentary Elections Act [or Section 32, Subsection 8D, Paragraph A of the Presidential Elections Act], are stated, only if the total number of overseas electors lawfully entitled to vote at the election in that electoral division is less than the difference between the number of votes given to the two best-performing candidates or group of candidates. In the event where the total of overseas voters is more than the difference between the number of votes given to the two best-performing candidates, the RO may declare the number of votes cast in Singapore for the candidates, and announce the date and premises for the counting of overseas votes, in accordance with Section 49, Subsection 7E, Paragraph B of the Parliamentary Elections Act [or Section 32, Subsection 8D, Paragraph B of the Presidential Elections Act]. The RO's duties also encompasses announcing the best-performing losing candidates as NCMP post-elections in the government gazette.\n\n\nIn Sri Lanka, returning officers are appointed by the Commissioner of Elections under the Registration of Electors Act, No. 44 of 1980 for all Presidential, General (Parliamentary), Provincial and Local government elections held in the island. Normally public officers are appointed as returning officers and they may appoint assistant returning officers to assist them. \n\nIn the Parliament of Sri Lanka, the Secretary-General acts as the returning officer for votes conducted within the Parliament.\n\nIn England and Wales the post of returning officer for general elections is an honorary one, held by the high sheriff of the county for a county constituency or the mayor or chairman of the local council for a borough constituency. If a constituency overlaps district and county borders, the returning officer is designated by the Secretary of State for Justice.\n\nIn practice, the task of conducting the election is delegated to an acting returning officer, who is usually a senior officer in the local authority (the only duties which can be reserved and undertaken by the returning officer are related to the receipt of the writ and the declaration of the result, and only if written notice is given by the returning officer to the acting returning officer). In an English or Welsh constituency where the returning officer is the chairman of the local district council or the mayor if a borough council, the electoral registration officer is automatically the acting returning officer. In an English or Welsh constituency where the high sheriff or mayor is returning officer, the acting returning officer is designated by the Secretary of State for Justice.\n\nIn Scotland, there is no office of acting returning officer and the position of returning officer is not an honorary one. The returning officer for general elections is the same person who has been appointed returning officer for the election of councillors in the local authority in which the constituency is situated. If a constituency covers more than one local authority area, the Secretary of State for Justice designates which local authority returning officer will discharge the function.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the Chief Electoral Officer acts as the returning officer.\n\nReturning officers normally announce the results after the count in the following manner:\n\nIn England and Wales, every district council or unitary authority is required to appoint an officer of the council to be the returning officer for the election of councillors to their local authority, and any parish councils in their area.

{"id": "9719407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9719407", "title": "Scientific imperialism", "text": "Scientific imperialism\n\nScientific imperialism is a term that appears to have been coined by Dr. Ellis T. Powell when addressing the Commonwealth Club of Canada on 8 September 1920. Though he defined imperialism as \"the sense of arbitrary and capricious domination over the bodies and souls of men,\" yet he used the term \"scientific imperialism\" to mean \"the subjection of all the developed and undeveloped powers of the earth to the mind of man.\"\n\nIn modern parlance, however, scientific imperialism refers to situations in which critics perceive science to act imperiously. Philosopher of science John Dupré described it (in his 2001 book \"Human Nature and the Limits of Science\", p. 74) as \"the tendency to push a good scientific idea far beyond the domain in which it was originally introduced, and often far beyond the domain in which it can provide much illumination.\" He also wrote (in his 1994 paper \"Against Scientific Imperialism\", p. 374) that \"devotees of these approaches are inclined to claim that they are in possession not just of one useful perspective on human behavior, but of the key that will open doors to the understanding of ever wider areas of human behavior.\"\n\nScientific imperialism has also been charged against \"those who believe that the study of politics can and should be modelled on the natural sciences, a position defended most forcibly in the United States, and those who have dissented, viewing this ambition as methodologically unjustified and ethically undesirable.\"\n\nWriting about scientific exploration by James Cook in the 18th century, the textbook \"Worlds Together, Worlds Apart\" defined scientific imperialism as the \"pursuit of power through the pursuit of knowledge,\". Arthur Peacocke wrote that its later pejorative use may reflect the frustration felt by some with \"the limitations of reductive scientism (scientific imperialism).\" He also questions the notion that \"successful scientific theories are true or approximately true models of the world,\" and expresses a desire to \"dethrone science from an imperialistic stance over philosophy and theology.\" Theologian and Christian apologist J. P. Moreland argues that \"the myth that science is the model of truth and rationality still grips the mind of much of our popular and scientific culture\", stating that \"though philosophers of science over the past few decades have gutted many of the claims of this scientific imperialism, many thinkers, knee-jerk agnostics, and even judges persist in the grip of this notion.\"\n\nBehavioral psychologist J. E. R. Staddon defined scientific imperialism as \"the idea that all decisions, in principle, can be made scientifically\" and stated that it has become a \"religion of the intellectuals\". John Dupré also criticised \"a natural tendency, when one has a successful scientific model, to attempt to apply it to as many problems as possible\", and described these extended applications as being \"dangerous\". Such notions have been compared to cultural imperialism, and to a rigid and intolerant form of intellectual monotheism.\n\nMedical doctor Peter Wilmshurst has used the term to describe \"poor people in developing countries...being exploited in research for the benefit of patients in the developed world\", and advised that \"the scientific community has a responsibility to ensure that all scientific research is conducted ethically\". Another accusation lies in the alleged misappropriation of indigenous drugs in poor countries by drug companies in the developed world. Pharmacologist Elaine Elisabetsky wrote that \"ethnopharmacology involves a series of sociopolitical, economic and ethical dilemmas, at various levels...frequently host country scientists, visiting scientists, and informants disagree...research efforts are (often) perceived as scientific imperialism; scientists are accused of stealing plant materials and appropriating traditional plant knowledge for financial profit and/or professional advancement. Many governments, as well as indigenous societies are increasingly reluctant to permit such research...historically neither native populations nor host countries have shared to a significant extent the financial benefits from any drug that reaches the market...unless these issues are amply discussed and fairly resolved, medicinal plant research runs the risk of serving ethically questionable purposes.\"\n\n\n"}

Strijdom, which took 103 seats in the House of Assembly. It was the first election in South Africa with a whites-only electorate, following the removal of the Cape Qualified Franchise in the late 1950s to be replaced by four (white) MPs elected to represent Coloured voters in separate constituencies.\n\nThe third term of the (white MPs) elected to represent black voters, from special electoral districts in Cape Province under the Representation of Natives Act 1936, expired on 30 June 1954. These seats were not vacated by a dissolution of Parliament, so they were not contested at the 1953 general election.\n\nThe three representative seats were filled by elections on 1 December 1954. Two Liberal Party of South Africa MPs (A.W.P. Stanford of Transkei and Mrs V.M.L. Ballinger of Cape Eastern) were returned. Stanford took his seat from an Independent. Ballinger had been elected as an Independent at the three previous representative elections, before becoming the first President of the Liberal Party, when it was formed on 9 May 1953. The third seat was taken by L.B. Lee-Warden, an Independent candidate.\n\nThe term of these members expired on 30 June 1960 (the first 30 June to fall after five years from the date of election). The Native Representative Members seats were to be abolished in 1960, at the end of the current term.\n\nThe Separate Representation of Voters Act 1951, had provided for coloured voters in Cape Province to be removed from the general voters rolls and placed on a separate roll. The coloured voters lost the right to participate in general roll elections and were given four (white) representative members in Parliament.\n\nThe implementation of the 1951 Act was delayed in what is known as the Coloured vote constitutional crisis, due to legal arguments about whether Parliament had complied with the requirement for a two-thirds majority in joint session, before it could remove the coloured voters from the general roll.\n\nEventually legislation to change the size and electoral system for the Senate was enacted, which the courts accepted as enabling the 1951 Act to be validated by the constitutionally required margin.\n\nThe Coloured Representative Members were elected, for the first time, on 3 April 1958, for a term expiring with the next dissolution of Parliament. Four supporters of the United Party were elected to fill the new seats.\n\nThe South Africa Act 1909 had provided for a delimitation commission to define the boundaries for each electoral division, for general roll voters in the four provinces. The representation by province, under the eleventh delimitation report of 1958, is set out in the table below. The figures in brackets are the number of electoral divisions in the previous (1953) delimitation. If there is no figure in brackets then the number was unchanged.\n\nAt the end of the 11th Union Parliament, when it was dissolved in 1958, the House of Assembly consisted of two types of members. White voters were represented by 156 members and black voters in Cape Province by three white MPs (known at the time as Native Representative Members). A third type of MP was about to be elected, so that four white MPs would represent coloured voters in Cape Province. They were known as the Coloured Representative Members (CRM).\n\nThe general election, on 16 April 1958, only affected the representatives of white voters. The other members were elected on different dates (see above).\n\nThe representation by party and province, at the dissolution was:- \n\nAbbreviations in the province list.\n\nThe general election, for 156 seats in the 12th Union Parliament, was the first in South African history when only voters classified as white took part. In the eleven previous general elections, the Cape Province and Natal general electoral roll had included some black (until 1938 in the Cape), Asian (until 1948) and coloured electors.\n\nThe vote totals in the table below may not give a complete picture of the balance of political opinion, because of unopposed elections (where no votes were cast) and because contested seats may not have been fought by a candidate from all major parties.\n\nThe total registered electorate was 1,563,426. The votes cast were 1,162,576 (including 7,573 spoilt votes).\n\nThe election saw the collapse of the South African Labour Party which lost all 5 of its seats and whose vote dropped from almost 35,000 votes in 1953 to 2,670 votes in 1958. The drop in support is largely attributed to the party leader Alex Hepple's growing outspokenness in opposition to apartheid and his co-operation with the African National Congress, positions which were not supported at the time by white workers who were the bulk of the Labour Party's electorate. \n\nThe overall composition of the House, after the general election, was as below. There were boundary changes, from the delimitation of seats in the previous Parliament, so no attempt is made to identify changes.\n\n"}

WPA is a systematic technique for reducing water consumption and wastewater generation through integration of water-using activities or processes. WPA was first introduced by Wang and Smith. Since then, it has been widely used as a tool for water conservation in industrial process plants. Water Pinch Analysis has recently been applied for urban/domestic buildings. It was extended in 1998 by Nick Hallale at the University of Cape Town, who developed it as a special case of mass exchange networks for capital cost targeting.\n\nTechniques for setting targets for maximum water recovery capable of handling any type of water-using operation including mass-transfer-based and non-mass-transfer based systems include the source and sink composite curves (Nick Hallale (2002). A New Graphical Targeting Method for Water Minimisation. Advances in Environmental Research. 6(3): 377–390) and water cascade analysis (WCA). The source and sink composite curves is a graphical tool for setting water recovery targets as well as for design of water recovery networks.\n\n\n5. Hallale, Nick. (2002).

He was the son of William Everad, a yeoman of Reading and had been baptized on 9 May 1602 in the parish of St Giles, Reading, as William Evered. This Evered took the Protestation Oath in the parish of St Lawrence, Reading on 20 February 1642. Less than a year later a William Everard was serving as a Parliamentary scout for Sir Samuel Luke in the Berkshire and Oxfordshire area. Hessayon speculates that he may have been captured by the Royalists as he there is no record of him until May 1647 when an ensign by the name of William Everard signed a petition voicing the grievances of the army under the command of Sir Thomas Fairfax. He was cashiered out of the army in late 1647 or early 1648 for plotting to kill Charles I. \n\nIn 1648 he was briefly imprisoned in Kingston, Surrey, for causing a disturbance, and Gerrard Winstanley wrote \"Truth Lifting up its Head above Scandals\" in his defence. In March 1649 he appeared before a Justice of the Peace for causing a disturbance in Staines Church.\n\nEarly the next month (April 1649) Everard went to St. George's Hill Weybridge, Surrey with four others and started the Diggers commune. By the end of the week they had been joined by about thirty others. The group called themselves True Levellers, before the month was out complaints had been made to the Council of State over their behaviour. A troop of cavalry was sent to disperse the group and escorted Everard and Winstanley the acknowledged leaders to London to see General Fairfax. They appeared before him on 20 April and famously refused to remove their hats in his presence (an act that, at that time, was seen as showing a lack of respect for his authority). They justified their commune's actions to him using the same arguments as they presented in the Diggers first manifesto, \"The True Levellers Standard Advanced\", which was published around the same date. Everard's name appeared as one of the subscribers on the first manifesto, but that was his last involvement with the group.\n\nIn May contemporary newspapers and pamphlets reported that William Everard was mixed up in the Levellers inspired Burford Mutiny, but this seems to have been a case of mistaken identity with the army agitator, Captain Robert Everard.\n\nIn August 1649 Everard was reported to be in the parish of Bradfield, Berkshire the rector of which was John Pordage. Pordage had been curate and vicar of St Lawrence, Reading so they may have been old acquaintances. At the end of the next summer Everard returned to the parish as a harvest worker. There was serious disruption in the village, with people running around in trances and acting in strange ways. The local population accused Everard of being a conjurer or witch (and so presumably considered to be ultimately responsible).\n\nLater the same month Everard was in London where he was seen to be in a \"frantick posture\". Shortly afterwards (in October 1650) he was detained and imprisoned in Bridewell on the instructions of the Council of State as they thought his rantings to be affected (see Ranters). He was not the only one so detained and the end of December it was reported \"many of Ranting Everard's party are lunatick, and exceedingly distracted; they talk very high against the Parliament, and this present Government; for which some of them have received the lash\". During the next few months Everard's behaviour deteriorated and, as his wife had previously requested, in March 1651 he was moved to Bethlem Hospital for his and others protection. What happened to him after that is unknown.\n\n"}

It was formed by members who broke away from the Socialist Party of Canada in Vancouver over becoming members-at-large and the Ahrens-Cannon controversy.\nThe WSPC was more active propagating socialism than the SPC's three official locals. For a few months, it probably had slightly more members than SPC. On 15 March 1970, the GEC passed a resolution \"that the WSPC be informed it is unacceptable they join the SPC as anything other than new members\". The resolution continued, that the applicant no longer belongs to the WSPC, or that the WSPC no longer exists. It was the beginning of the end for the World Socialist Party of Canada.\n"}
