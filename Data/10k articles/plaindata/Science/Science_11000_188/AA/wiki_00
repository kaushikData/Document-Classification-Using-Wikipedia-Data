For example, as an aircraft flies, its mass will slowly decrease as a result of fuel consumption; a control law is needed that adapts itself to such changing conditions. Adaptive control is different from robust control in that it does not need \"a priori\" information about the bounds on these uncertain or time-varying parameters; robust control guarantees that if the changes are within given bounds the control law need not be changed, while adaptive control is concerned with control law changing itself.\n\nThe foundation of adaptive control is parameter estimation, which is a branch of system identification. Common methods of estimation include recursive least squares and gradient descent. Both of these methods provide update laws which are used to modify estimates in real time (i.e., as the system operates). Lyapunov stability is used to derive these update laws and show convergence criteria (typically persistent excitation; relaxation of this condition are studied in Concurrent Learning adaptive control). Projection (mathematics) and normalization are commonly used to improve the robustness of estimation algorithms.\n\nIn general, one should distinguish between:\n\n\nas well as between\n\nDirect methods are ones wherein the estimated parameters are those directly used in the adaptive controller. In contrast, indirect methods are those in which the estimated parameters are used to calculate required controller parameters. Hybrid methods rely on both estimation of parameters and direct modification of the control law.\n\nThere are several broad categories of feedback adaptive control (classification can vary):\n\n\nSome special topics in adaptive control can be introduced as well:\n\nAdaptive control has even been merged with intelligent techniques such as fuzzy and neural networks and the new terms like fuzzy adaptive control has been generated.\n\nWhen designing adaptive control systems, special consideration is necessary of convergence and robustness issues. Lyapunov stability is typically used to derive control adaptation laws and show convergence.\n\nTypical applications of adaptive control are (in general):\n\n\nUsually these methods adapt the controllers to both the process statics and dynamics. In special cases the adaptation can be limited to the static behavior alone, leading to adaptive control based on characteristic curves for the steady-states or to extremum value control, optimizing the steady state. Hence, there are several ways to apply adaptive control algorithms.\n\nA particularly successful application of adaptive control has been adaptive flight control. This body of work has focused on guaranteeing stability of a model reference adaptive control scheme using Lyapunov arguments. Several successful flight-test demonstrations have been conducted, including fault tolerant adaptive control.\n\n\n\n"}

It is used in materials research to study nanometer sized differences in structure.\n\nIn X-ray diffraction the scattering factor \"f\" for an atom is roughly proportional to the number of electrons that it possesses. However, for wavelengths that approximate those for which the atom strongly absorbs radiation the scattering factor undergoes a change due to anomalous dispersion. The dispersion not only affects the magnitude of the factor but also imparts a phase shift in the elastic collision of the photon. The scattering factor can therefore best be described as a complex number\n\nThe anomalous aspects of X-ray scattering have become the focus of considerable interest in the scientific community because of the availability of synchrotron radiation. In contrast to desktop X-ray sources that work at a limited set of fixed wavelengths, synchrotron radiation is generated by accelerating electrons and using an undulator(device of periodic placed dipole magnets) to \"wiggle\" the electrons in their path, to generate the wanted wavelength of X-rays. This allows scientists to vary the wavelength, which in turn makes it possible to vary the scattering factor for one particular element in the sample under investigation. Thus a particular element can be highlighted. This is known as \"contrast variation\". In addition to this effect the anomalous scatter is more sensitive to any deviation from sphericity of the electron cloud around the atom. This can lead to resonant effects involving transitions in the outer shell of the atom: resonant anomalous X-ray scattering.\n"}

An autonym might not be mentioned in the publication that creates it as a side-effect. Autonyms \"repeat unaltered\" the genus name or species epithet of the taxon being subdivided, and no other name for that same subdivision is validly published (article 22.2). For example, \"Rubus\" subgenus \"Eubatus\" is not validly published, and the subgenus is known as \"Rubus\" subgen. \"Rubus\".\n\nAutonyms are cited without an author. The publication date of the autonym is taken to be the same as that of the subdivision(s) that automatically established the autonym, with some special provisions (the autonym is considered to have priority over the other names of the same rank established at the same time (article 11.6)).\n\nArticles 6.8, 22.1-3 and 26.1-3 relate to establishing autonyms.\n\nAutonyms are not created if the name of the genus or species being subdivided is illegitimate.\n\nThe definition of an autonym is in Art. 6.8 of the ICN:\n\nThe application of names of taxonomic groups is determined by means of nomenclatural types (Principle II of the ICN). For all taxa, nomenclatural types are preserved specimens or illustrations.\n\nIn the case of an infraspecific taxon, if a botanist described a new taxon and publishes a new name at infraspecific level, all elements that previously belonged to the species (and are not included in the newly described taxon) now become a new infraspecific taxon. But as neither the type nor the final epithet has changed, there is no need for a change in author citation.\n\nThe same goes for a subdivision of a genus. If a botanist creates a new subdivision of a genus, for example by dividing a large genus into two or more subgenera, sections, or series, then a new subdivision of the genus at each of the new ranks will share the type of the genus and have as its epithet the name of the genus.\n\nAs will be clear from the definition, an autonym can be one of two kinds:\n\nThe name of a subdivision of a genus that includes the type of the genus is not validly published if its epithet does not repeat the generic name unaltered, in other words: it may not be anything other than an autonym, for example\n\nThe same goes, \"mutatis mutandis\", for infraspecific taxa.\n\nAn autonym is considered to have been published at exactly the same time as the earliest name(s) in that particular rank under the genus or species.\n\nThe autonym has nomenclatural priority over the name (or the names, as the case may be) that established it (Art. 11.6).\n\nThe type of an autonym is the same as that for the corresponding genus or species (Art. 7.6): \"The type of an autonym is the same as that of the name from which it is derived.\" As an autonym is automatically created (without an author being involved), no author citation follows the name.\n\n"}

The dynamic equilibrium of the molecular system is achieved through the balance of forces between the forces of attraction of nuclei to the plane of the ring of electrons and the forces of mutual repulsion of the nuclei. The Bohr model of the chemical bond took into account the Coulomb repulsion - the electrons in the ring are at the maximum distance from each other.\n\nThus, according to this model, the methane molecule is a regular tetrahedron, in which center the carbon nucleus locates, and in the corners - the nucleus of hydrogen. Chemical bond between them form four two-electron rings, rotating around the lines connecting the center with the corners.\n\nThe Bohr model of the chemical bond could not explain the properties of the molecules. Attempts to improve it have been undertaken many times, but have not led to success.\n\nA working theory of chemical bonding was formulated only by quantum mechanics on the basis of the principle of uncertainty and the Pauli exclusion principle. In contrast to the Bohr model of chemical bonding, it turned out that the electron cloud mainly concentrates on the line between the nuclei, providing a Coulomb attraction between them. For many-electron atoms, the valence bond theory, laid down in 1927 by Walter Heitler and Fritz London, was a successful approximation.\n\n"}

It is important not to confuse concept testing with advertising testing, brand testing and packaging testing; as is sometimes done. Concept testing focuses on the basic product idea, without the embellishments and puffery inherent in advertising.\n\nIt is important that the instruments (questionnaires) to test the product have a high quality themselves. Otherwise, results from data gathered surveys may be biased by measurement error. That makes the design of the testing procedure more complex. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire. This can be done by:\n\nConcept testing in the new product development (NPD) process is the concept generation stage. The concept generation stage of concept testing can take on many forms. Sometimes concepts are generated incidentally, as the result of technological advances. At other times concept generation is deliberate: examples include brain-storming sessions, problem detection surveys and qualitative research. While qualitative research can provide insights into the range of reactions consumers may have, it cannot provide an indication of the likely success of the new concept; this is better left to quantitative concept-test surveys.\n\nIn the early stages of concept testing, a large field of alternative concepts might exist, requiring concept-screening surveys. Concept-screening surveys provide a quick means to narrow the field of options; however they provide little depth of insight and cannot be compared to a normative database due to interactions between concepts. For greater insight and to reach decisions on whether or not pursue further product development, monadic concept-testing surveys must be conducted.\n\nFrequently concept testing surveys are described as either monadic, sequential monadic or comparative. The terms mainly refer to how the concepts are displayed:\n\n1.) Monadic. The concept is evaluated in isolation.\n2.) Sequential monadic. Multiple concepts are evaluated in sequence (often randomized order).\n3.) Comparative. Concepts are shown next to each other. \n4.) Proto-monadic. Concepts are first shown in sequence, and then next to each other.\n\n\"Monadic testing is the recommended method for most concept testing. Interaction effects and biases are avoided. Results from one test can be compared to results from previous monadic tests. A normative database can be constructed.\" However, each has its specific uses and it depends on the research objectives. The decision as to which method to use is best left to experience research professionals to decide, as there are numerous implications in terms of how the results are interpreted.\n\nTraditionally concept-test survey results are compared to 'norms databases'. These are databases of previous new-product concept tests. These must be 'monadic' concept tests, to prevent interaction effects. To be fair, it is important that these databases contain 'new' concept test results, not ratings of old products that consumers are already familiar with; since once consumers become familiar with a product the ratings often drop. Comparing new concept ratings to the ratings for an existing product already on the market would result in an invalid comparison, unless special precautions are taken by researchers to reduce or adjust for this effect quantitatively. Additionally, the concept is usually only compared to norms from the same product category, and the same country.\n\nCompanies that specialize in this area, tend to have developed their own unique systems, each with its own standards. Keeping to these standards consistently is important to preventing contamination of the results.\n\nPerhaps one of the famous concept-test systems is the Nielsen Bases system, which comes in different versions. Other well-known products include Decision Analyst's 'Concept Check', Acupoll's 'Concept Optimizer', Ipsos Innoquest and GFK. Examples of smaller players include Skuuber and Acentric Express Test.\n\nThe simplest approach to determining attribute importance is to ask direct open-ended questions. Alternatively checklists or ratings of the importance of each product attribute may be used.\n\nHowever, various debates have existed over whether or not consumers could be trusted to directly indicate the level of importance of each product attribute. As a result, correlation analysis and various forms of multiple regression have often been used for identifying importance - as an alternative to direct questions.\n\nA complementary technique to concept testing, is conjoint analysis (also referred to as discrete choice modelling). Various forms of conjoint analysis and discrete choice modelling exist. While academics stress the differences between the two, in practice there is often little difference. \nThese techniques estimate the importance of product attributes indirectly, by creating alternative products according to an experimental design, and then using consumer responses to these alternatives (usually ratings of purchase likelihood or choices made between alternatives) to estimate importance. The results are often expressed in the form of a 'simulator' tool which allows clients to test alternative product configurations and pricing.\n\nVolumetric concept testing\n\nVolumetric concept testing falls somewhere between traditional concept testing and pre-test market models (simulated test market models are similar but emphasize greater realism) in terms of the level of complexity. The aim is to provide 'approximate' sales volume forecasts for the new concept prior to launch. They incorporate other variables beyond just input from the concept test survey itself, such as the distribution strategy.\n\nExamples of volumetric forecasting methodologies include 'Acupoll Foresight' and Decision Analyst's 'Conceptor'.\n\nSome models (more properly referred to as 'pre-test market models' or 'simulated test markets') gather additional data from a follow-up product testing survey (especially in the case of consumer packaged goods as repeat purchase rates need to be estimated). They may also include advertisement testing component that aims to assess advertising quality. Some such as Decision Analyst, include discrete choice models / conjoint analysis.\n\n"}

A common type of dry etching is reactive-ion etching. Unlike with many (but not all, see isotropic etching) of the wet chemical etchants used in wet etching, the dry etching process typically etches directionally or anisotropically.\n\nDry etching is used in conjunction with photolithographic techniques to attack certain areas of a semiconductor surface in order to form recesses in material, such as contact holes (which are contacts to the underlying semiconductor substrate) or via holes (which are holes that are formed to provide an interconnect path between conductive layers in the layered semiconductor device) or to otherwise remove portions of semiconductor layers where predominantly vertical sides are desired. Along with semiconductor manufacturing, micromachining and display production, the removal of organic residues by oxygen plasmas is sometimes correctly described as a dry etch process. The term plasma ashing can be used instead.\n\nDry etching is particularly useful for materials and semiconductors which are chemically resistant and could not be wet etched, such as silicon carbide or gallium nitride.\n\nDry etching is currently used in semiconductor fabrication processes due to its unique ability over wet etch to do anisotropic etching (removal of material) to create high aspect ratio structures (e.g. deep holes or capacitor trenches). \n\nThe dry etching hardware design basically involves a vacuum chamber, special gas delivery system, RF waveform generator and an exhaust system.\n\n"}

Originally, Garcia targeted syphilis, and later tried the treatment for chronic degenerative diseases and some types of cancer.\n\nGenerally, a dose of insulin is injected into a vein, followed by a low dose of chemotherapy drugs when the insulin has been absorbed. The chemotherapy dose is usually 10% to 25% of the proven dose. Then sugar water is injected to stop the hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) caused by the insulin injection.\n\nIPT has not been proven to work. Long-term outcomes, such as survival, have never been published. Four individual case studies, one small, uncontrolled clinical trial and one small prospective, randomized controlled trial have shown temporary reductions in the size of tumors for some patients.\n\nThe immediate risk is hypoglycemia.\n\nThe use of lower than normal doses of chemotherapy can cause drug resistance, which could make future treatment at standard, proven doses ineffective. For some cancers, especially breast and colon cancers, insulin may promote tumor growth.\n\nTwo main ideas about how it might work have been proposed. The first idea is that insulin makes cells more permeable, so that the chemotherapy drugs are absorbed faster into cells. The other idea is that insulin might cause the cells to start dividing, which makes them more susceptible to destruction of many cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs.\n\nCosts run up to US $2,000 per treatment session. Multiple sessions are normal. Patients often pay the full cost out of pocket, because it is an unproven therapy that is not covered by health insurance.\n\n"}

It is one of four species of three-toed sloth.\n\nThe maned sloth is now found only in the Atlantic coastal rainforest of southeastern Brazil, although it was once also found further north. It has been identified predominantly from evergreen forests, although, being able to eat a wide range of leaves, it can also inhabit semi-deciduous and secondary forest. It is typically found in hot, humid climates without any dry season, and with annual rainfall of at least . There are no recognised subspecies.\n\nManed sloths have a pale brown to gray pelage. Long outer hair covers a short, dense, black and white underfur. The coarse outer coat is usually inhabited by algae, mites, ticks, beetles, and moths. The maned sloth's small head features fur-covered pinnae and anterior oriented eyes that are usually covered by a mask of black hair. The sides of the maned sloth's face and neck feature long hair covering the short hair of the sloth's snout. Facial vibrissae on the maned sloth are sparse. The maned sloth earns its name from a mane of black hair running down its neck and over its shoulders. The mane is usually larger and darker in males than in females, and in the latter, may be reduced to a pair of long tufts. Other than the mane, the fur is relatively uniform in color, and, in particular, the males lack the patch of bright fur found on the back of other, closely related, sloths.\n\nAdult males have a total head-body length of , with a tail about long and a weight of . Females are generally larger, measuring , and weighing . Like all other sloths, the maned sloth has very little muscle mass in comparison to other mammals its size. This reduced muscle mass allows it to hang from thin branches.\n\nManed sloths are solitary diurnal animals, spending from 60â€“80% of their day asleep, with the rest more or less equally divided between feeding and travelling. Sloths sleep in crotches of trees or by dangling from branches by their legs and tucking their head in between their forelegs.\n\nManed sloths are folivores, and feed exclusively on tree and liana leaves, especially \"Cecropia\". Although individual animals seem to prefer leaves from particular species of tree, the species as a whole is able to adapt to a wide range of tree types. Younger leaves are preferred to older, and tree leaves are preferred to liana leaves. Individual maned sloths have reported to travel over a home range of , with estimated population densities of .\n\nManed sloths rarely descend from the trees because, when on a level surface, they are unable to stand and walk, only being able to drag themselves along with their front legs and claws. They travel to the ground only to defecate or to move between trees when they cannot do so through the branches. The sloth's main defenses are to stay still and to lash out with its formidable claws. It can swim well.\n\nAlthough some reports indicate that maned sloths are able to breed year round, others have observed that the majority of births occur between February and April. The mother gives birth to a single young, which initially weighs around and lacks the distinctive mane found on adults. The young begin to take solid food at two weeks, and are fully weaned by two to four months of age. The young leave the mother at between nine and eleven months of age. Although their lifespan has not been studied in detail, they have been reported to live for at least twelve years.\n\nIn 1955, the maned sloth occurred only in Bahia, EspÃ­rito Santo and Rio de Janeiro in eastern Brazil, in the Bahia coastal forests. It has declined since then as these forests have dwindled. The major threat to the maned sloth is the loss of its forest habitat as a result of lumber extraction, charcoal production, and clearance for plantations and cattle pastures. Excessive hunting is also a threat.\n"}

It seeks to understand biomolecular systems and explain biological function in terms of molecular structure, structural organization, and dynamic behaviour at various levels of complexity (from single molecules to supramolecular structures, viruses and small living systems). This discipline covers topics such as the measurement of molecular forces, molecular associations, allosteric interactions, Brownian motion, and cable theory. Additional areas of study can be found on Outline of Biophysics. The technical challenges of molecular biophysics are formidable, and the discipline has required development of specialized equipment and procedures capable of imaging and manipulating minute living structures, as well as novel experimental approaches. \n\nIn order to be classified as molecular biophysics, the subject studied needs to relate to biophysics and use mathematics at an engineering level, not only to explain the phenomenon, but also to predict future outcomes. \n\nSpectroscopic techniques like FT-NMR, spin label electron spin resonance, laser Raman, FT-infrared, circular dichroism, etc. have been widely used to understand structural dynamics of important bio-molecules and inter-molecular interactions.\n\n"}

The work contains Newcomb's mathematical development of the position of the Earth in the Solar System, which is constructed from classical celestial mechanics as well as centuries of astronomical measurements. The bulk of the work, however, is a collection of tabulated precomputed values that provide the position of the sun at any point in time.\n\nNewcomb's \"Tables\" were the basis for practically all ephemerides of the Sun published from 1900 through 1983, including the annual almanacs of the U.S. Naval Observatory and the Royal Greenwich Observatory. The tables are seldom used now; since the Astronomical Almanac for 1984 they have been superseded by more accurate numerically-integrated ephemerides developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, based on much more accurate observations than were available to Newcomb. Also, the tables did not account for the effects of general relativity which was unknown at the time. Nevertheless, his tabulated values remain accurate to within a few seconds of arc to this day.\n\nNewcomb's work was no small accomplishment, especially considering that it predated the advent of digital computers by more than a half century. Emphasis is often placed on the tables themselves, rather than the underlying theory. The latter may turn out to be the more enduring work because the formulas he developed are still used in astronomical software and other computer algorithms.\n\nNewcomb developed similar formulas and tables for the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Uranus and Neptune; those of the inner planets have proved to be the most accurate.\n\nCertain expressions have been cited in a number of other works over a long period, and are listed below.

In contrast to the presumption by officials that religious organizations benefit humanity without evidence (for instance Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption), he points to a letter he received from the British Charity Commission requesting evidence for the claim that the advancement of science is connected to the public good.\n\nTheist author Marion Ledwig suggests that the foundation may have been set up as an atheist counterpart to the John Templeton Foundation, an organization which Dawkins has publicly criticized, especially in \"The God Delusion\", for corrupting science. In a TED talk prior to writing \"The God Delusion\", Dawkins had called for the need for an \"anti-Templeton\" to step up, saying that if his books sold better, he would take the initiative himself.\n\nDawkins describes his foundationâ€™s purpose this way:â€œCritical thinking is the real saviour of humankind. My foundation promotes respect for people who hold critical thinking as a cherished personal value and use it in day-to-day life. The logical counter to religious extremism is people who rely on evidence to make decisions. Yet the voice of secular people is maligned in this country. Forty-five percent of Americans think you have to believe in God to be moral. Secular voices are considered immoral. They are not listened to on that basis. We must counter this baseless hostility to allow the contributions of secular people in vital national debates to count. Making secular views and people welcome in politics and policy-making will advance human safety, security, health, achievement, prosperity and most of all, \"science\".\"The organization began accepting members in April 2015.\nAmong its activities, RDFRS finances research into the psychology of belief and religion, finances scientific education programs and materials, and publicizes and supports secular charitable organisations.\n\nThe foundation has been granted charitable status in the United Kingdom and status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit private operating foundation in the United States. RDFRS financed research on the psychology of belief and religion, financed scientific education programs and materials, and publicised and supported charitable organisations that are secular in nature. The foundation also offers humanist, rationalist, and scientific materials through its website.\n\nDawkins has said the \"trend toward theocratic thinking in the United States is a danger not only for America but for the entire world.\" Connected to this concern, Dawkins invited Sean Faircloth to serve as opening speaker on Dawkins's 2011 US book tour. Faircloth is author of the book \"Attack of the Theocrats, How the Religious Right Harms Us All and What We Can Do About It\". The Richard Dawkins Foundation (United States branch) later hired Faircloth, who has ten years experience as a state legislator, as Director of Strategy and Policy.\n\nRDFRS also invests in creating, producing and influencing the development of entertainment products for general audiences that support secularism and fight scientific illiteracy.\n\nIn March 2009, following proposed anti-evolution resolutions by Oklahoma State Representative Todd Thomsen, including condemning a visit by Dawkins to Oklahoma, he instructed the U.S. branch of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science to donate $5,000 to Oklahomans for Excellence in Science Education.\n\nIn March 2011, the RDFRS along with the Freedom From Religion Foundation began The Clergy Project which is a confidential on-line community that supports members as they move from their faith.\n\nIn 2014 RDFRS joined several similar organizations, including the Stiefel Freethought Foundation, the Secular Student Alliance, and the Secular Coalition for America, to form Openly Secular, an initiative which aims to combat and draw attention to anti-atheist discrimination and to encourage more people to openly self-identify as nonbelievers. Among the strategies is to get celebrities to come forward as openly secular. Videos have been posted by Penn & Teller, Bill Maher, NFL star Arian Foster, Julia Sweeney, John Davidson and others.\n\nIn April 2015, RDFRS launched the Teacher Institute for Evolutionary Science (TIES) to provide middle school teachers with workshops and free online tools to teach evolution and answer its critics. TIES is led by Bertha Vazquez, an award-winning middle school science teacher in Miami, FL.\n\nIn January 2016, RDFRS announced that it was merging with the Center for Inquiry, with Robyn Blumner as the CEO of the combined organizations.\n\nThe merger was completed in December 2016, with RDFRS becoming a division of CFI.\n\n\n"}

He argued that the UK Conservative party governments of the early 1980s, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, were not motivated by ideological position. Instead, he controversially argued that they were motivated by winning power. What motivates politicians, he argued, was their objective of statecraft. This was defined as the â€˜art of winning elections and art of winning elections and achieving some necessary degree of governing competence in officeâ€™..\n\nIn response to criticisms of the approach, later scholars sought to reflect on the philosophical underpinnings, provided more information about how it could be applied using empirical research and introduced new concepts.

{"id": "140841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140841", "title": "Sufficient statistic", "text": "Sufficient statistic\n\nIn statistics, a statistic is \"sufficient\" with respect to a statistical model and its associated unknown parameter if \"no other statistic that can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter\". In particular, a statistic is sufficient for a family of probability distributions if the sample from which it is calculated gives no additional information than does the statistic, as to which of those probability distributions is that of the population from which the sample was taken.\n\nA related concept is that of linear sufficiency, which is weaker than \"sufficiency\" but can be applied in some cases where there is no sufficient statistic, although it is restricted to linear estimators. The Kolmogorov structure function deals with individual finite data; the related notion there is the algorithmic sufficient statistic.\n\nThe concept is due to Sir Ronald Fisher in 1920. Stephen Stigler noted 1973 that the concept of sufficiency had fallen out of favor in descriptive statistics because of the strong dependence on an assumption of the distributional form (see Pitmanâ€“Koopmanâ€“Darmois theorem below), but remained very important in theoretical work.\n\nRoughly, given a set formula_1 of independent identically distributed data conditioned on an unknown parameter formula_2, a sufficient statistic is a function formula_3 whose value contains all the information needed to compute any estimate of the parameter (e.g. a maximum likelihood estimate). Due to the factorization theorem (see below), for a sufficient statistic formula_3, the probabilty density can be written as formula_5. From this factorization, it can easily be seen that the maximum likelihood estimate of formula_2 will interact with formula_7 only through formula_3. Typically, the sufficient statistic is a simple function of the data, e.g. the sum of all the data points.\n\nMore generally, the \"unknown parameter\" may represent a vector of unknown quantities or may represent everything about the model that is unknown or not fully specified. In such a case, the sufficient statistic may be a set of functions, called a \"jointly sufficient statistic\". Typically, there are as many functions as there are parameters. For example, for a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variance, the jointly sufficient statistic, from which maximum likelihood estimates of both parameters can be estimated, consists of two functions, the sum of all data points and the sum of all squared data points (or equivalently, the sample mean and sample variance).\n\nThe concept is equivalent to the statement that, conditional on the value of a sufficient statistic for a parameter, the joint probability distribution of the data does not depend on that parameter. Both the statistic and the underlying parameter can be vectors.\n\nA statistic \"t\"Â =Â \"T\"(\"X\") is sufficient for underlying parameter \"Î¸\" precisely if the conditional probability distribution of the data \"X\", given the statistic \"t\"Â =Â \"T\"(\"X\"), does not depend on the parameter \"Î¸\".\n\nAs an example, the sample mean is sufficient for the mean (\"Î¼\") of a normal distribution with known variance. Once the sample mean is known, no further information about \"Î¼\" can be obtained from the sample itself. On the other hand, for an arbitrary distribution the median is not sufficient for the mean: even if the median of the sample is known, knowing the sample itself would provide further information about the population mean. For example, if the observations that are less than the median are only slightly less, but observations exceeding the median exceed it by a large amount, then this would have a bearing on one's inference about the population mean.\n\n\"Fisher's factorization theorem\" or \"factorization criterion\" provides a convenient characterization of a sufficient statistic. If the probability density function is Æ’(\"x\"), then \"T\" is sufficient for \"Î¸\" if and only if nonnegative functions \"g\" and \"h\" can be found such that\n\ni.e. the density Æ’ can be factored into a product such that one factor, \"h\", does not depend on \"Î¸\" and the other factor, which does depend on \"Î¸\", depends on \"x\" only through \"T\"(\"x\").\n\nIt is easy to see that if \"F\"(\"t\") is a one-to-one function and \"T\" is a sufficient\nstatistic, then \"F\"(\"T\") is a sufficient statistic. In particular we can multiply a\nsufficient statistic by a nonzero constant and get another sufficient statistic.\n\nAn implication of the theorem is that when using likelihood-based inference, two sets of data yielding the same value for the sufficient statistic \"T\"(\"X\") will always yield the same inferences about \"Î¸\". By the factorization criterion, the likelihood's dependence on \"Î¸\" is only in conjunction with \"T\"(\"X\"). As this is the same in both cases, the dependence on \"Î¸\" will be the same as well, leading to identical inferences.\n\nDue to Hogg and Craig. Let formula_10, denote a random sample from a distribution having the pdf \"f\"(\"x\",Â \"Î¸\") for \"Î¹\"Â <Â \"Î¸\"Â <Â \"Î´\". Let \"Y\"Â =Â \"u\"(\"X\",Â \"X\",Â ...,Â \"X\") be a statistic whose pdf is \"g\"(\"y\";Â \"Î¸\"). Then \"Y\"Â =Â \"u\"(\"X\", \"X\",Â ...,Â \"X\") is a sufficient statistic for \"Î¸\" if and only if, for some function \"H\",\n\nFirst, suppose that\n\nWe shall make the transformation \"y\"Â =Â \"u\"(\"x\",Â \"x\",Â ...,Â \"x\"), for \"i\"Â =Â 1,Â ...,Â \"n\", having inverse functions \"x\"Â =Â \"w\"(\"y\",Â \"y\",Â ...,Â \"y\"), for \"i\"Â =Â 1,Â ...,Â \"n\", and Jacobian formula_13. Thus,\n\nThe left-hand member is the joint pdf \"g\"(\"y\", \"y\", ..., \"y\"; Î¸) of \"Y\" = \"u\"(\"X\", ..., \"X\"), ..., \"Y\" = \"u\"(\"X\", ..., \"X\"). In the right-hand member, formula_15 is the pdf of formula_16, so that formula_17 is the quotient of formula_18 and formula_15; that is, it is the conditional pdf formula_20 of formula_21 given formula_22.\n\nBut formula_23, and thus formula_24, was given not to depend upon formula_2. Since formula_2 was not introduced in the transformation and accordingly not in the Jacobian formula_27, it follows that formula_28 does not depend upon formula_2 and that formula_16 is a sufficient statistics for formula_2.\n\nThe converse is proven by taking:\n\nwhere formula_33 does not depend upon formula_2 because formula_35 depend only upon formula_36, which are independent on formula_37 when conditioned by formula_16, a sufficient statistics by hypothesis. Now divide both members by the absolute value of the non-vanishing Jacobian formula_27, and replace formula_40 by the functions formula_41 in formula_42. This yields\n\nwhere formula_44 is the Jacobian with formula_45 replaced by their value in terms formula_46. The left-hand member is necessarily the joint pdf formula_47 of formula_48. Since formula_49, and thus formula_50, does not depend upon formula_2, then\n\nis a function that does not depend upon formula_2.\n\nA simpler more illustrative proof is as follows, although it applies only in the discrete case.\n\nWe use the shorthand notation to denote the joint probability density of formula_54 by formula_55. Since formula_56 is a function of formula_57, we have formula_58, as long as formula_59 and zero otherwise. Therefore:\n\nwith the last equality being true by the definition of sufficient statistics. Thus formula_61 with formula_62 and formula_63.\n\nConversely, if formula_61, we have\n\nWith the first equality by the definition of pdf for multiple variables, the second by the remark above, the third by hypothesis, and the fourth because the summation is not over formula_66.\n\nLet formula_67 denote the conditional probability density of formula_57 given formula_69. Then we can derive an explicit expression for this:\n\nWith the first equality by definition of conditional probability density, the second by the remark above, the third by the equality proven above, and the fourth by simplification. This expression does not depend on formula_2 and thus formula_56 is a sufficient statistic.\n\nA sufficient statistic is minimal sufficient if it can be represented as a function of any other sufficient statistic. In other words, \"S\"(\"X\") is minimal sufficient if and only if\n\nIntuitively, a minimal sufficient statistic \"most efficiently\" captures all possible information about the parameter \"Î¸\".\n\nA useful characterization of minimal sufficiency is that when the density \"f\" exists, \"S\"(\"X\") is minimal sufficient if and only if\n\nThis follows as a direct consequence from Fisher's factorization theorem stated above.\n\nA case in which there is no minimal sufficient statistic was shown by Bahadur, 1954. However, under mild conditions, a minimal sufficient statistic does always exist. In particular, in Euclidean space, these conditions always hold if the random variables (associated with formula_75 ) are all discrete or are all continuous.\n\nIf there exists a minimal sufficient statistic, and this is usually the case, then every complete sufficient statistic is necessarily minimal sufficient(note that this statement does not exclude the option of a pathological case in which a complete sufficient exists while there is no minimal sufficient statistic). While it is hard to find cases in which a minimal sufficient statistic does not exist, it is not so hard to find cases in which there is no complete statistic.\n\nThe collection of likelihood ratios formula_76 is a minimal sufficient statistic if formula_77 is discrete or has a density function.\n\nIf \"X\",Â ...,Â \"X\" are independent Bernoulli-distributed random variables with expected value \"p\", then the sum \"T\"(\"X\") =Â \"X\"Â +Â ...Â +Â \"X\" is a sufficient statistic for \"p\" (here 'success' corresponds to \"X\"Â =Â 1 and 'failure' to \"X\"Â =Â 0; so \"T\" is the total number of successes)\n\nThis is seen by considering the joint probability distribution:\n\nBecause the observations are independent, this can be written as\n\nand, collecting powers of \"p\" and 1Â âˆ’Â \"p\", gives\n\nwhich satisfies the factorization criterion, with \"h\"(\"x\")Â =Â 1 being just a constant.\n\nNote the crucial feature: the unknown parameter \"p\" interacts with the data \"x\" only via the statistic \"T\"(\"x\") =Â Î£Â \"x\".\n\nAs a concrete application, this gives a procedure for creating a fair coin from a biased coin.\n\nIf \"X\", ..., \"X\" are independent and uniformly distributed on the interval [0,\"Î¸\"], then \"T\"(\"X\") = max(\"X\", ..., \"X\") is sufficient for Î¸ â€” the sample maximum is a sufficient statistic for the population maximum.\n\nTo see this, consider the joint probability density function of \"X\"=(\"X\"...,\"X\"). Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities\n\nwhere 1 is the indicator function. Thus the density takes form required by the Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem, where \"h\"(\"x\")Â =Â 1, and the rest of the expression is a function of only \"Î¸\" and \"T\"(\"x\")Â =Â max{\"x\"}.\n\nIn fact, the minimum-variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) for \"Î¸\" is\n\nThis is the sample maximum, scaled to correct for the bias, and is MVUE by the Lehmannâ€“ScheffÃ© theorem. Unscaled sample maximum \"T\"(\"X\") is the maximum likelihood estimator for \"Î¸\".\n\nIf formula_83 are independent and uniformly distributed on the interval formula_84 (where formula_85 and formula_86 are unknown parameters), then formula_87 is a two-dimensional sufficient statistic for formula_88.\n\nTo see this, consider the joint probability density function of formula_89. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e.\n\nThe joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem, by letting\n\nSince formula_92 does not depend on the parameter formula_93 and formula_94 depends only on formula_95 through the function formula_96\n\nthe Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem implies formula_97 is a sufficient statistic for formula_88.\n\nIf \"X\",Â ...,Â \"X\" are independent and have a Poisson distribution with parameter \"Î»\", then the sum \"T\"(\"X\") =Â \"X\"Â +Â ...Â +Â \"X\" is a sufficient statistic forÂ \"Î»\".\n\nTo see this, consider the joint probability distribution:\n\nBecause the observations are independent, this can be written as\n\nwhich may be written as\n\nwhich shows that the factorization criterion is satisfied, where \"h\"(\"x\") is the reciprocal of the product of the factorials. Note the parameter Î» interacts with the data only through its sum \"T\"(\"X\").\n\nIf formula_102 are independent and normally distributed with expected value formula_2 (a parameter) and known finite variance formula_104 then \n\nis a sufficient statistic for formula_106\n\nTo see this, consider the joint probability density function of formula_107. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e. -\n\nThe joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem, by letting\n\nSince formula_92 does not depend on the parameter formula_2 and formula_112 depends only on formula_95 through the function \n\nthe Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem implies formula_115 is a sufficient statistic for formula_2.\n\n(If formula_117 is unknown: since formula_118, the above likelihood can be rewritten as:\n\nthe Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem still holds and implies that formula_120 is a joint sufficient statistic for formula_121.\n\nIf formula_48 are independent and exponentially distributed with expected value \"Î¸\" (an unknown real-valued positive parameter), then formula_123 is a sufficient statistic for Î¸.\n\nTo see this, consider the joint probability density function of formula_107. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e. -\n\nThe joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem, by letting\n\nSince formula_92 does not depend on the parameter formula_2 and formula_112 depends only on formula_95 through the function formula_123\n\nthe Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem implies formula_123 is a sufficient statistic for formula_2.\n\nIf formula_48 are independent and distributed as a formula_135, where formula_85 and formula_86 are unknown parameters of a Gamma distribution, then formula_138 is a two-dimensional sufficient statistic for formula_93.\n\nTo see this, consider the joint probability density function of formula_107. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e. -\n\nThe joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem, by letting\n\nSince formula_92 does not depend on the parameter formula_88 and formula_94 depends only on formula_95 through the function formula_147\n\nthe Fisherâ€“Neyman factorization theorem implies formula_148 is a sufficient statistic for formula_149\n\nSufficiency finds a useful application in the Raoâ€“Blackwell theorem, which states that if \"g\"(\"X\") is any kind of estimator of \"Î¸\", then typically the conditional expectation of \"g\"(\"X\") given sufficient statistic \"T\"(\"X\") is a better estimator of \"Î¸\", and is never worse. Sometimes one can very easily construct a very crude estimator \"g\"(\"X\"), and then evaluate that conditional expected value to get an estimator that is in various senses optimal.\n\nAccording to the Pitmanâ€“Koopmanâ€“Darmois theorem, among families of probability distributions whose domain does not vary with the parameter being estimated, only in exponential families is there a sufficient statistic whose dimension remains bounded as sample size increases. Less tersely, suppose formula_150 are independent identically distributed random variables whose distribution is known to be in some family of probability distributions with fixed support. Only if that family is an exponential family there is a (possibly vector-valued) sufficient statistic formula_151 whose number of scalar components does not increase as the sample size \"n\" increases.\n\nThis theorem shows that sufficiency (or rather, the existence of a scalar or vector-valued of bounded dimension sufficient statistic) sharply restricts the possible forms of the distribution.\n\nAn alternative formulation of the condition that a statistic be sufficient, set in a Bayesian context, involves the posterior distributions obtained by using the full data-set and by using only a statistic. Thus the requirement is that, for almost every \"x\",\n\nMore generally, without assuming a parametric model, we can say that the statistics \"T\" is \"predictive sufficient\" if\n\nIt turns out that this \"Bayesian sufficiency\" is a consequence of the formulation above, however they are not directly equivalent in the infinite-dimensional case. A range of theoretical results for sufficiency in a Bayesian context is available.\n\nA concept called \"linear sufficiency\" can be formulated in a Bayesian context, and more generally. First define the best linear predictor of a vector \"Y\" based on \"X\" as formula_154. Then a linear statistic \"T\"(\"x\") is linear sufficient if\n\n\n"}
