Armstrong\n\nFirst Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong is the official biography of Neil Armstrong, the astronaut who became the first man to walk on the Moon, on July 20, 1969. The book was written by James R. Hansen, and was first published in 2005, by Simon & Schuster. The book describes Armstrong's involvement in the United States space program (culminating with the historic Apollo 11 mission), and details his personal life and upbringing.\n\nThe book has received a warm reception from several individuals associated with astronomy and the promotion of spaceflight. Examples include the broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite, and the English public intellectual Sir Patrick Moore.\n\nAcademic and author James Hansen is also known for serving as a professor of history at Auburn University in Alabama. He additionally serves as director of that institution's Honors College. The writing process began in October 1999, when Hansen first wrote to Armstrong asking if he could author the book. At first, Armstrong told him that he was too busy, and the astronaut mentioned how he had already turned down several previous offers from well-known authors such as Stephen Ambrose and James A. Michener. Hansen persisted, sending what he described as a \"goody box\" of his work. One of the items included was the author's well-received biography, titled \"From the Ground Up\", of seminal aviation pioneer Fred Weick.\n\nArmstrong felt impressed with the style of Hansen's work. In June 2002, Armstrong and Hansen signed a formal agreement. Two months later, Armstrong signed an official letter for Hansen that said Hansen had his full support and encouraged others to provide what he needed to write a book. While numerous publications had described aspects of Armstrong's long career and personal endeavors, to varying degrees, \"First Man\" became the first official book to detail the astronaut's life, including much information both before and after the Apollo program.\n\nAfter questioning as to why, after years of reluctance, he had finally consented to a full biography, Armstrong replied simply: \"It was time.\"\n\nThe book describes Armstrong's pleasant and broadly conventional early life. The young man becomes more and more fascinated by aircraft and flying, and he even earns his pilot's licence before he has qualifications to drive an automobile. Armstrong's father remarks that his son \"never had a girl\" and \"didn't need a car\" but simply \"had... to get out to that airport.\"\n\nThe young Armstrong becomes a naval aviator. Management of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) takes an interest in Armstrong's combination of calmness and personal skill coupled with his above-average intellect. Although contrasting somewhat with many of his colleagues, the Apollo 11 crew winding up as \"amiable strangers\", he attracts widespread respect. The fact that Armstrong gets chosen to be \"first down\" on the lunar surface is a surprise, with astronaut Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin Jr. being expected to get priority. The mission itself proceeds spectacularly well, and Armstrong gives his famous line: \"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\nThe historic nature of the event means that Armstrong must adapt to being one of the most famous men on the planet, a peculiar situation which the astronaut finds challenging. Given the gravity of the Apollo program and the sacrifices made so that the lunar mission succeeded, Armstrong feels determined to make sure that his status as the 'first man on the moon' is never exploited for anyone's petty gain. Interested in spreading his knowledge to younger generations, he eschews a celebrity status by serving as a lecturer in engineering at the University of Cincinnati. While shying away from the personal spotlight, as an individual, the astronaut spends decades advancing the cause of further spaceflight in terms of providing advice to those at NASA, being in close touch with multiple figures.\n\nEnglish astronomer and public intellectual Sir Patrick Moore praised the book. Writing for the publication \"Times Higher Education\", Moore stated that he considered the work an \"outstanding success\", finding it \"immaculately researched and is packed with detail\" while still being \"written in a way that will appeal to readers of all kinds\". He concluded, \"This is an important book and should be in every scientific library.\"\n\nAmerican media figure Walter Cronkite lauded \"First Man\" as well, remarking:\n\nIn early 2003, actor-director Clint Eastwood and production people at the studio Warner Bros. bought the film rights to \"First Man\". Eastwood had previously directed as well as starred in the 2000 space-themed movie \"Space Cowboys\", though he stated that he would likely not appear on camera in \"First Man\". However, the project wound up in development hell despite significant interest. Armstrong himself died on August 25, 2012, before any actual filming took place.\n\nUniversal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures ultimately took up the \"First Man\" project in the mid-2010s. Damien Chazelle, a director receiving critical acclaim for his work in 2016's \"La La Land\", signed onto the film's production. Actor Ryan Gosling, who starred in \"La La Land\", joined as well. Given his role as the book's author, Hansen was attached to co-produce the movie.\n\n\n"}

For millennia, it was not clear whether perpetual motion devices were possible or not, but modern theories of thermodynamics have shown that they are impossible. Despite this, many attempts have been made to construct such machines, continuing into modern times. Modern designers and proponents sometimes use other terms, such as \"overunity\", to describe their inventions.\n\nThere are some unsourced claims that a perpetual motion machine called the \"magic wheel\" (a wheel spinning on its axle powered by lodestones) appeared in 8th-century Bavaria. This historical claim appears to be unsubstantiated though often repeated.\n\nEarly designs of perpetual motion machines were done by Indian mathematician–astronomer Bhaskara II, who described a wheel (Bhāskara's wheel) that he claimed would run forever.\n\nA drawing of a perpetual motion machine appeared in the sketchbook of Villard de Honnecourt, a 13th-century French master mason and architect. The sketchbook was concerned with mechanics and architecture. Following the example of Villard, Peter of Maricourt designed a magnetic globe which, if it were mounted without friction parallel to the celestial axis, would rotate once a day. It was intended to serve as an automatic armillary sphere.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci made a number of drawings of devices he hoped would make free energy. Leonardo da Vinci was generally against such devices, but drew and examined numerous overbalanced wheels.\n\nMark Anthony Zimara, a 16th-century Italian scholar, proposed a self-blowing windmill.\n\nVarious scholars in this period investigated the topic. In 1607 Cornelius Drebbel in \"Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh\" dedicated a Perpetuum motion machine to James I of England. It was described by Heinrich Hiesserle von Chodaw in 1621. Robert Boyle devised the \"perpetual vase\" (\"perpetual goblet\" or \"hydrostatic paradox\") which was discussed by Denis Papin in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" for 1685. Johann Bernoulli proposed a fluid energy machine. In 1686, Georg Andreas Böckler, designed a \"self operating\" self-powered water mill and several perpetual motion machines using balls using variants of Archimedes' screws. In 1712, Johann Bessler (Orffyreus), claimed to have experimented with 300 different perpetual motion models before developing what he said were working models.\n\nIn the 1760s, James Cox and John Joseph Merlin developed Cox's timepiece. Cox claimed that the timepiece was a true perpetual motion machine, but as the device is powered by changes in atmospheric pressure via a mercury barometer, this is not the case.\n\nIn 1775, the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris made the statement that the Academy \"will no longer accept or deal with proposals concerning perpetual motion.\"\n\nIn 1812, Charles Redheffer, in Philadelphia, claimed to have developed a \"generator\" that could power other machines. The machine was open for viewing in Philadelphia, where Redheffer raised large amount of money from the admission fee. Redheffer moved his machine to New York, after his cover was blown in Philadelphia, while applying for government funding. It was there that Robert Fulton exposed Redheffer's schemes during an exposition of the device in New York City (1813). Removing some concealing wooden strips, Fulton found a catgut belt drive went through a wall to an attic. In the attic, a man was turning a crank to power the device.\n\nIn 1827, Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet devised a machine running on capillary action that would disobey the principle that water seeks its own level, so to produce a continuous ascent and overflow. The device had an inclined plane over pulleys. At the top and bottom, there travelled an endless band of sponge, a bed and, over this, again an endless band of heavy weights jointed together. The whole stood over the surface of still water. Congreve believed his system would operate continuously.\nIn 1868, an Austrian, Alois Drasch, received a US patent for a machine that possessed a \"thrust key-type gearing\" of a rotary engine. The vehicle driver could tilt a trough depending upon need. A heavy ball rolled in a cylindrical trough downward, and, with continuous adjustment of the device's levers and power output, Drasch believed that it would be possible to power a vehicle.\n\nIn 1870, E.P. Willis of New Haven, Connecticut made money from a \"proprietary\" perpetual motion machine. A story of the overcomplicated device with a hidden source of energy appears in the \"Scientific American\" article \"The Greatest Discovery Ever Yet Made\". Investigation into the device eventually found a source of power that drove it.\n\nJohn Ernst Worrell Keely claimed the invention of an induction resonance motion motor. He explained that he used \"etheric technology\". In 1872, Keely announced that he had discovered a principle for power production based on the vibrations of tuning forks. Scientists investigated his machine which appeared to run on water, though Keely endeavoured to avoid this. Shortly after 1872, venture capitalists accused Keely of fraud (they lost nearly five million dollars). Keely's machine, it was discovered after his death, was based on hidden air pressure tubes.\n\nIn 1900, Nikola Tesla claimed to have discovered an abstract principle on which to base a perpetual motion machine of the second kind. No prototype was produced. He wrote:\n"}

Membership is open to all sociologists as well as to scholars in neighbouring disciplines.\n\nCreated in Paris in 1893 by René Worms, it is the oldest continuous sociological association in existence. Its first congress was held in Paris in October 1894 under the chairmanship of René Worms, which formalised the foundation of this institution. The \"Révue internationale de sociologie\", founded the year before, became the printed organ of the Institute. Since its foundation the goal of the IIS has been to bring together sociologists from around the world. It has a longstanding tradition of promoting discussions on the most crucial theoretical issues of the day and on the practical use of social scientific knowledge. Among its members and associates were prominent scholars such as: Franz Boas, Roger Bastide, Lujo Brentano, Theodor Geiger, Gustave Le Bon, Karl Mannheim, William F. Ogburn, Pitirim Sorokin, Georg Simmel, Werner Sombart, Gabriel Tarde, Ferdinand Toennies, Thorstein Veblen, Lester F.

Depending on the flow configurations, the kinematic wave can be linear or non-linear, which depends on whether the wave celerity is a constant or a variable. Kinematic wave can be described by a simple partial differential equation with a single unknown field variable (e.g., the flow or wave height, formula_1) in terms of the two independent variables, namely the time (formula_2) and the space (formula_3) with some parameters (coefficients) containing information about the physics and geometry of the flow. In general, the wave can be advecting and diffusing. However, in simple situation, the kinematic wave is mainly advecting.\n\nNon-linear kinematic wave for debris flow can be written as follows with complex non-linear coefficients:\nwhere formula_1 is the debris flow height, formula_2 is the time, formula_3 is the downstream channel position, formula_8 is the pressure gradient and the depth dependent nonlinear variable\nwave speed, and formula_9 is a flow height and pressure gradient dependent variable diffusion term.\nThis equation can also be written in the conservative form:\nwhere formula_11 is the generalized flux that depends on several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient.

{"id": "192566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192566", "title": "Machiavellian intelligence", "text": "Machiavellian intelligence\n\nIn cognitive science and evolutionary psychology, Machiavellian intelligence is the capacity of an entity to be in a successful political engagement with social groups. The first introduction of this concept to primatology came from Frans de Waal's book \"Chimpanzee Politics\" (1982), which described social maneuvering while explicitly quoting Machiavelli. Also known as machiavellianism, it is the art of manipulation in which others are socially manipulated in a way that benefits the user.\n\nMachiavellian intelligence may be demonstrated by behaviors including:\n\nThe claim that large brains are linked to large social groups in primates and cetaceans, on which the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis is based, is criticized by a number of researchers for overlooking the availability of food as a common limiting factor for brain size and social group size. Among primates as well as cetaceans, there are some opportunistic species that eat most types of food and other species that are specialised in particular types of food, as well as differences in the overall availability of food between different geographical regions in which the animals live. Some critics of Machiavellian intelligence argue that species that have to keep their use of nutrients down due to food poverty or specialisation in a rare type of food lowers average brain size for species that live in smaller groups, making big brains falsely appear to be linked to large groups due to the common causes of opportunistic foraging for nutritious food and a rich supply of food. These critics also cite that the \"exceptions\" in the form of small-brained primates in very large groups typically eat abundant but nutrient-poor foods (such as geladas that eat grass), as predicted by the food-based model, and argue that the higher individual need for nutrients put on by large brains causes groups to become smaller if the species have the same degree of digestive specialisation and environmental availability of food.\n\nAnother criticism that relates to food regards the assumption that modern hunters and gatherers are living in marginal environments displaced by farming peoples and that people in paleolithic times supposedly lived in larger social groups than hunters and gatherers do today. The researchers who put forward that criticism cite observations that hunters and gatherers often trade with farmers who live nearby and/or steal food from them, opportunities that were not available before agriculture was invented. The critics therefore argue that our prehistoric ancestors before agriculture lived in even smaller groups than hunters and gatherers do today, in groups smaller than those of the most opportunistic non-human apes as a result of the greater requirement for nutrients in human brains.\n\nSome researchers criticize the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis from observations of social insects that form societies that are organized and yet have very small brains. Some of these insects, such as Jack jumpers and paper wasps have hierarchical societies in which each individual treat every other in accordance with their status, as opposed to the disorganized herds as which the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis depict social animals with small brains.\n\nThe term refers to Niccolò Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" (1513) and to the hypothesis that the techniques which lead to certain kinds of political success within large social groups are also applicable within smaller groups, including the family-unit. The term \"everyday politics\" was later introduced in reference to these various methods. These arguments are based on research by primatologists such as Nicholas Humphrey (1975).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5873785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5873785", "title": "Manned Venus flyby", "text": "Manned Venus flyby\n\nA number of proposals for a crewed Venus flyby have been considered since the start of the space age.\n\nNASA considered a manned flyby of Venus in the mid-1960s as part of the Apollo Applications Program, using hardware derived from the Apollo program. Launch would have taken place on October 31, 1973, with a Venus flyby on March 3, 1974 and return to Earth on December 1, 1974.\n\nThe proposed mission would use a Saturn V to send three men to fly past Venus in a flight which would last approximately one year. The S-IVB stage would be a 'wet workshop' similar to the original design of Skylab. In this concept, the interior of the fuel tanks would be filled with living quarters and various equipment that did not take up a significant amount of volume. The S-IVB would then be filled with fuel as normal and used to accelerate the craft on its way to Venus. Once the burn was complete, any remaining fuel was vented to space, and then the tank could be used as living space.\n\nOnly so much equipment could be carried in the hydrogen tank without taking up too much room, while other pieces could not be immersed in liquid hydrogen and survive. These sorts of systems would instead be placed in the interstage area between the S-IVB and the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM), known as the Spacecraft-LM Adapter (SLA), which normally held the Apollo Lunar Module on lunar missions. To maximize the amount of space available in this area, the Service Propulsion System engine of the CSM would be replaced by two LM Descent Propulsion System engines. These had much smaller engine bells, and would lie within the Service Module instead of extending out the end into the SLA area. This also provided redundancy in the case of a single-engine failure. These engines were responsible for both course correction during the flight as well as the braking burn for Earth re-entry.\n\nUnlike the Apollo lunar missions, the CSM would perform its transposition and docking maneuver with the S-IVB stage before the burn to leave Earth orbit rather than after. This meant the astronauts would fly 'eyeballs-out', the thrust of the engine pushing them out of their seats rather than into them. This was required because there was only a short window for an abort burn by the CSM to return to Earth after a failure in the S-IVB, so all spacecraft systems needed to be operational and checked out before leaving the parking orbit around Earth to fly to Venus.\n\nPrecursors to the Venus flyby would include an initial orbital test flight with an S-IVB 'wet workshop' and basic docking adapter, and a year-long test flight taking the S-IVB to a near-geostationary orbit around the Earth.\n\nThe mission would measure:\n\nThe mission would have been implemented in a series of two development flights and one production flight, designated as phases A through C.\n\nPhase A of the plan would have launched a 'wet workshop' S-IVB and a standard Block II Apollo CSM into orbit on a Saturn V. The crew would separate the CSM from the S-IVB by blowing off the SLA panels, then perform a Transposition and Docking maneuver similar to that conducted on the lunar flights, in order to dock with the docking module attached to the front of the S-IVB. Optionally they could then use the S-IVB engine to launch them into a high orbit before they vented any remaining fuel into space and entered the S-IVB fuel tanks to conduct experiments for a few weeks. After evaluating the use of the S-IVB as a long-term habitat for astronauts, they would separate the CSM from the S-IVB and return to Earth.\n\nPhase B would test the Venus flyby spacecraft in a long duration mission in high orbit. A Saturn V would launch a Block III CSM designed for long-term spaceflight and a modified S-IVB with the Environmental Support Module required for the real Venus flyby, and following the transposition and docking maneuver the S-IVB engine would carry the spacecraft to a circular orbit at an altitude of about 25,000 miles around the Earth. This altitude would be high enough to be clear of Earth's radiation belts while exposing the spacecraft to an environment similar to that of a trip to Venus, yet close enough to Earth that the astronauts could use the CSM to return in a few hours in an emergency.\n\nPower would probably be provided by solar panels similar to those used on Skylab, as fuel cells would require a very large amount of fuel to operate for a year. Similarly the fuel cells in the SM used to provide power on lunar flights would be replaced by batteries which would provide enough power for the duration of launch and re-entry operations.\n\nPhase C would be the actual crewed flyby, using a Block IV CSM and an updated version of the Venus flyby S-IVB which would carry a large radio antenna for communication with Earth and two or more small probes which would be released shortly before the flyby to enter the atmosphere of Venus. The Block IV CSM has LM engines replacing the Service Propulsion System engines, batteries to replace the fuel cells, and other modifications to support long-range communication with Earth and the higher re-entry velocities required for the return trajectory compared to a return from lunar orbit.\n\nThe Phase C mission was planned to launch in late October or early November 1973, when the velocity requirements required to reach Venus and the duration of the resulting mission would be at their lowest. After a brief stay in Earth parking orbit to check out the spacecraft the crew would head for Venus: in the event of a major problem during the Trans-Venus Injection burn, they would have roughly an hour to separate the CSM from the S-IVB and use the SM engine to cancel out most of the velocity they gained from the burn. This would put them into a highly elliptical orbit which would typically bring them back to Earth for a re-entry two to three days later. Beyond that time the SM engine would not have enough fuel to bring the CSM back to Earth before the SM batteries ran out of power: it would literally be 'Venus or Bust'.\n\nAfter a successful S-IVB burn, the spacecraft would pass approximately 3000 miles from the surface of Venus about four months later. The flyby velocity would be so high that the crew would only have a few hours for detailed study of the planet. At this point, one or more robotic probe landers would separate from the main craft and land on Venus.\n\nDuring the rest of the mission the crew would perform astronomical studies of the Sun and Mercury, which they would approach within 0.3 astronomical units.\n\nA variation of the Soviet Union's TMK mission planning for a crewed mission to Mars involved a flyby of Venus on the return voyage, and was given the code name \"MAVR\" (MArs - VeneRa), meaning Mars - Venus. However, the TMK program was cancelled after the N1 rocket that was needed to loft the mission failed to fly successfully.\n\nAs a \"Plan B\" in case the proposed Inspiration Mars fly-by of Mars misses its 2018 launch window, in November 2013 Dennis Tito proposed a different mission architecture whereby the mission craft would first fly-by Venus, using Venus in a gravitational slingshot to speed the craft's onward journey to Mars. The proposed mission, which would launch in 2021, would take the Inspiration Mars craft to within 800 kilometres of the Venusian surface.\n\n\n\n"}

In other words, the numerical/face value (nominal value) of money is mistaken for its purchasing power (real value) at a previous point in the general price level (in the past). This is false, as modern fiat currencies have no intrinsic value and their real value is derived from all the underlying value systems in an economy, e.g., sound government, sound economics, sound education, sound legal system, sound defence, etc. The change in this real value over time is indicated by the change in the Consumer Price Index over time.\n\nThe term was coined by Irving Fisher in \"Stabilizing the Dollar\". It was popularized by John Maynard Keynes in the early twentieth century, and Irving Fisher wrote an important book on the subject, \"The Money Illusion\", in 1928. The existence of money illusion is disputed by monetary economists who contend that people act rationally (i.e. think in real prices) with regard to their wealth. Eldar Shafir, Peter A. Diamond, and Amos Tversky (1997) have provided empirical evidence for the existence of the effect and it has been shown to affect behaviour in a variety of experimental and real-world situations.\n\nShafir et al. also state that money illusion influences economic behaviour in three main ways:\n\n\nMoney illusion can also influence people's perceptions of outcomes. Experiments have shown that people generally perceive an approximate 2% cut in nominal income with no change in monetary value as unfair, but see a 2% rise in nominal income where there is 4% inflation as fair, despite them being almost rational equivalents. This result is consistent with the 'Myopic Loss Aversion theory'. Furthermore, the money illusion means nominal changes in price can influence demand even if real prices have remained constant.\n\nExplanations of money illusion generally describe the phenomenon in terms of heuristics. Nominal prices provide a convenient rule of thumb for determining value and real prices are only calculated if they seem highly salient (e.g. in periods of hyperinflation or in long term contracts).\n\nSome have suggested that money illusion implies that the negative relationship between inflation and unemployment described by the Phillips curve might hold, contrary to more recent macroeconomic theories such as the \"expectations-augmented Phillips curve\". If workers use their nominal wage as a reference point when evaluating wage offers, firms can keep real wages relatively lower in a period of high inflation as workers accept the seemingly high nominal wage increase. These lower real wages would allow firms to hire more workers in periods of high inflation.\n\nMoney illusion is believed to be instrumental in the Friedmanian version of the Phillips curve. Actually, money illusion is not enough to explain the mechanism underlying this Phillips curve. It requires two additional assumptions. First, prices respond differently to modified demand conditions: an increased aggregate demand exerts its influence on commodity prices sooner than it does on labour market prices. Therefore, the drop in unemployment is, after all, the result of decreasing real wages and an accurate judgement of the situation by employees is the only reason for the return to an initial (natural) rate of unemployment (i.e. the end of the money illusion, when they finally recognize the actual dynamics of prices and wages). The other (arbitrary) assumption refers to a special informational asymmetry: whatever employees are unaware of in connection with the changes in (real and nominal) wages and prices can be clearly observed by employers. The new classical version of the Phillips curve was aimed at removing the puzzling additional presumptions, but its mechanism still requires money illusion.\n\n\n"}

Beginning with the first manned Gemini mission in 1965, commemorative medallions were prepared for the astronauts at their request. These were produced by a company only known as Fliteline and were struck either in a pewter-colored base metal, sometimes painted a gold color, or sterling silver, and were flown on all 10 manned Gemini missions. A Fliteline medallion was designed and produced for Apollo 1, but was never officially flown after a disastrous cabin fire during a launch rehearsal killed the flight crew. \n\nThe Robbins Company of Attleboro, Massachusetts, was contracted in 1968 to produce commemorative medallions beginning with Apollo 7, the first manned Apollo flight since the Apollo 1 disaster. These were purchased by astronauts and support crew personnel at NASA Astronaut Flight Office, and a total of over 3,000 sterling silver Robbins medallions were flown into space across the 12 manned flights of the Apollo program. Some of these were later sold in public auction for up to $60,000. The basic elements of the medallion design are consistent throughout the 12 medallions in the series, with the main design element and the mission name on the obverse, mission dates on the reverse, primary flight crew names on either the obverse or reverse, and a serial number either on the lower reverse or on the rim. A very small number of Apollo Robbins medallions were also struck in 14k gold, generally ordered by the mission crew as a personal memento. Sterling silver Robbins medallions have continued to be struck for every manned NASA spaceflight, including Skylab and Space Shuttle missions.\n\nNumismatic souvenirs have accompanied astronauts on nearly every early spaceflight. Mercury astronauts carried small light-weight mementos on their missions, often in the form of US coins or banknotes. On the first sub-orbital flight (Mercury-Redstone 3), Alan Shepard carried with him four one-dollar silver certificates which were subsequently signed by him, other Mercury astronauts, and support staff becoming short snorters. John Glenn, piloting the first manned U.S. orbital spaceflight Mercury-Atlas 6 also carried several one-dollar silver certificates. \n\nSpace-flown numismatic items are also known for early Gemini missions. On the first manned Gemini flight (Gemini 3), Grissom and Young brought 50 two-dollar bills. Young also made history for smuggling \"contraband\" on board the flight, in the form of a corned-beef sandwich.\nBeginning with the first manned Gemini mission in March 1965, commemorative medallions were prepared for the astronauts at their request. It is unclear who prepared these early medallions, only that each individual box containing a medallion bore the word \"Fliteline\". It is unknown how many gold and silver colored medallions were prepared for each mission, and how many were space-flown versus unflown. Fliteline medallions were prepared for each of the manned Gemini flights, as well as the ill-fated Apollo 1 mission.\n\nThe Robbins Company was founded in 1892 by jeweler Charles M. Robbins, in Attleboro, Massachusetts. They began designing and producing commemorative badges for Ohio in 1913, and South Dakota in 1917. In 1935, the first 1,000 badges of a new design for the Federal Bureau of Investigation were produced by Robbins. The Robbins Company also struck the Olympic medals for the 1932 Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York.\n\nThe Apollo 1 cabin fire in January 1967 put manned spaceflight on hold. The crew of Apollo 7, designated to be the return to manned spaceflight, began working with the Robbins Company later in 1967 to produce commemorative mission medallions. Commissioned by the NASA Astronaut Flight Office (AFO), the medallions were financed entirely through the orders placed by astronauts and support crew personnel. Only those directly affiliated with the AFO were eligible as purchasers, and they were bound by their employment contract not to commercialize the medallions, as NASA was concerned about any appearance that the astronauts might profit from the flown medallions.\n\nOne (or more) of the astronauts from the flight crew worked directly with the Robbins Company to design the mission medallion. The basic elements of the medallion design are consistent throughout the Project Apollo series. The main design element along with the mission name is located on the obverse. The names of the flight crew can be found on either the obverse or reverse. The mission dates are located on the reverse. Beginning with Apollo 11, special fields were designed for the reverse of the medallion that allowed for engraved dates of launch, lunar landing, and return. Also on the reverse (or sometimes the edge) is the medallion serial number. The size of most Robbins Apollo medallions falls roughly between a current US quarter () and a Kennedy half dollar ().\n\nThe medallions were struck in sterling silver two to three months prior to the scheduled mission, though it is unclear whether serial numbers were added pre or post-flight. The medallions were stored in the Command Service Module during flight and on missions involving a lunar landing, a small number were brought to the lunar surface aboard the Lunar Module. The flown medallions were returned to the Robbins Company after the flight to have the dates engraved and for a final polishing. Except where noted, all medallions struck for Apollo 7–14 were flown, and serial numbers for Apollo 14–17 medallions appear on the rim.\n\nApollo Robbins medallions were also struck, in very small numbers, in 14k gold. These medallions were generally ordered by the mission crew as a personal memento of their flight and were often taken to the lunar surface in the Landing Module. For the duration of the Apollo program, Robbins medallions (3–7 gold and 80–450 silver per mission) were flown into space.\n\nDespite the NASA prohibition on commercializing the medallions, since 1995 there have been over 500 internet or live auction appearances of Apollo mission Robbins medallions. Two auction companies account for a majority of the sales: Heritage Auctions (over 200 since 2007) and RR Auction (over 100 since 2011). Between both auction companies, the top 10 prices realized range from US$30,000 to nearly $62,000, all for sterling silver medallions from either Apollo 11 or Apollo 17.\n\n"}
{"id": "4848448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4848448", "title": "National symbols of Pakistan", "text": "National symbols of Pakistan\n\nPakistan has several official national symbols including a historic document, a flag, an emblem, an anthem, a memorial tower as well as several national heroes. The symbols were adopted at various stages in the existence of Pakistan and there are various rules and regulations governing their definition or use. The oldest symbol is the Lahore Resolution, adopted by the All India Muslim League on 23 March 1940, and which presented the official demand for the creation of a separate country for the Muslims of India. The Minar-e-Pakistan memorial tower which was built in 1968 on the site where the Lahore Resolution was passed. The national flag was adopted just before independence was achieved on 14 August 1947. The national anthem and the state emblem were each adopted in 1954. There are also several other symbols including the national animal, bird, flower and tree.\n\nThe Lahore Resolution (\"Qarardad-e-Lahore\")) (), also known as the Pakistan Resolution, was a formal political statement adopted by the All India Muslim League at the occasion of its three-day general session on 22–24 March 1940 at Minto Park (now Iqbal Park), Lahore. The resolution called for greater Muslim autonomy in British India and has been largely interpreted as a demand for a separate Muslim state. The idea of separate state for Indian Muslims was first suggested by Muhammad Iqbal in 1930 and the name of Pakistan was proposed by Choudhary Rahmat Ali in his Pakistan Declaration pamphlet in 1933. Initially, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and other leaders were in favour of Hindu-Muslim unity, but the volatile political climate and religious hostilities of the 1930s made the idea more appealing.\nIn his speech, Jinnah criticised the Indian National Congress and the nationalist Muslims, and espoused the Two-Nation Theory and the reasons for the demand for separate Muslim homelands. Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, the Chief Minister of the Punjab, drafted the original resolution, but that was not fully acceptable to all the Working Committee, so extensive redrafting followed, by the Subject Committee of the Muslim League. The text is ambiguous in accepting the concept of various Muslim 'zones' within a \"United India\" due to communal concerns and it does not clearly recommend the creation of a separate, fully independent Muslim state. The resolution was moved in the general session by A.K. Fazlul Huq, Chief Minister of Bengal and was supported seconded by several leaders. The principle text of the Lahore Resolution was passed on 24 March 1940. In 1941 it became part of the Muslim League's constitution. By 1946, it formed the basis for the struggle of the Muslim League for a separate Muslim state. The statement declared:\n\nThe Minar-e-Pakistan (Urdu: ; \"Mīnār-ĕ Pākistān\") or \"Tower of Pakistan\" is a 60 metre tall concrete minaret in Iqbal Park in Lahore. The Minar was built on the site where the Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding the creation of Pakistan. Pakistan now celebrates this day as a national holiday each year under the name of Pakistan Day which is also the day in 1956 when the country became the first Islamic Republic in the world. It was designed by Muhammad Wali Ullah Khan and built by Mian Abdul Khaliq Company. The base of the tower is raised about 4 metres from the ground. The next 13 metres form a sculpted, flower-like base and from this point, the Minar tapers as it rises. The base platform is shaped like a five-pointed star and it encloses crescent-shaped pools. It is constructed of reinforced concrete, with the floors and walls rendered in stone and marble.\n\nThe national flag was designed by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and was based on the original flag of the Muslim League. It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 11 August 1947, just days before independence. The flag is referred to in the national anthem as \"Parcham-e-Sitāra-o-Hilāl\" in Urdu (\"lit.\" Flag of the Crescent and Star). The flag comprises a dark green field, representing the Muslim majority of Pakistan, with a vertical white stripe in the hoist, representing religious minorities. In the centre is a white crescent moon, representing progress, and a white five-pointed star, representing light and knowledge. The flag symbolizes Pakistan's commitment to Islam, the Islamic world and the rights of religious minorities. The flag is flown on several important days of the year including Republic Day and Independence Day. The flag is also flown on the residences and motor vehicles of many public officials including the President and the Prime Minister.\n\nThe national anthem of Pakistan or \"Qaumī Tarāna\" Urdu: , is played during any event involving the hoisting of the flag, for example Republic Day (23 March) and Independence Day (14 August). The Constituent Assembly had not adopted a national anthem by the time Pakistan became independent, so when the flag was hoisted at the independence ceremony it was accompanied by the song, \"Pakistan Zindabad, Azadi Paendabad\". Muhammad Ali Jinnah asked a Lahore-based Hindu writer, Jagan Nath Azad, to write a national anthem for Pakistan. Jinnah may have done this to promote a more secular idealism for Pakistan. The anthem written by Azad was quickly approved by Jinnah, and it was played on Radio Pakistan. Azad's work remained as Pakistan's national anthem for about eighteen months.\n\nA National Anthem Committee was formed in 1948, but it had difficulty finding suitable music and lyrics. The impending state visit of the Shah of Iran in 1950, resulted in the hasty adoption of a three stanza composition by Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla. Initially it was performed without lyrics for the Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan on 10 August 1950 and was approved for playing during the visit of the Shah. However, the anthem was not officially adopted until August 1954. The National Anthem Committee eventually approved lyrics written by Abu-Al-Asar Hafeez Jullandhuri and the new national anthem was first played properly on Radio Pakistan on 13 August 1954. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 16 August 1954 followed by a performance of the national anthem in 1955 involving eleven major singers of Pakistan including Ahmad Rushdi.\n\nThe State Emblem was adopted in 1954 and symbolizes Pakistan's ideological foundation, the basis of its economy, its cultural heritage and its guiding principles. The four components of the emblem are a crescent and star crest above a shield, which is surrounded by a wreath, below which is a scroll. The crest and the green colour of the emblem are traditional symbols of Islam. The quartered shield in the centre shows cotton, wheat, tea and jute, which were the major crops of Pakistan at independence and signify the agricultural base of the economy. The floral wreath, surrounding the shield, represents the floral designs used in traditional Mughal art and emphasizes the cultural heritage of Pakistan.\n\nThe scroll supporting the shield contains Muhammad Ali Jinnah's motto in Urdu, which reads from right to left: () \"Iman, Ittehad, Nazm\" translated as \"Faith, Unity, Discipline\" and are intended as the guiding principles for Pakistan.\n\n"}

The project was directed by Lukasz Swierczewski, an IT student at the College of Computer Science and Business Administration in Lomza, Computer Science and Automation Institute. As of 2016 it seems to have been abandoned.\n\n\nShor's Algorithm and Shor's Algorithm DP were the main subprojects of OProject@Home. The objective was to test quantum algorithms (e.g. Shor's algorithm) of quantum computing. GSCE-SV verifies the correctness of Goldbach's conjecture, while ALX is a Non-CPU-intensive (nci) subproject capable of running on ARM-based CPUs running Android or Linux. It is used to research and develop artificial intelligence and computer networks. The project supports the PlayStation 3.\nThe Weird Engine subproject calculates the weird numbers . Numbers are available in the project database. According to the OEIS it is the largest publicly available database of such numbers.\n\nThese ongoing work on the application analyzing status of water on Earth. OProject@Home uses data from NASA and NOAA satellites. Analyzed data are taken from devices AVHRR and AMSR that are used to measure the Earth's radiation predominantly in the infrared. Based on the information is easy to calculate the sea surface temperature and ice concentration at any point on Earth. This information will enable to perform the analysis and simulations climate.\n\nThe subprojects running on the platform OProject@Home are important to science because they address difficult and unsolved problems in physics and theoretical mathematics. For example, Goldbach's conjecture, proposed in 1742 has never been disproven. It is not even clear whether the problem can be solved, as the range of numbers are infinite. It's also not known if there are any odd weird numbers. All calculated weird numbers are even. Climate change and global warming has also raised a number of controversies, and a future goal is to effectively analyze the entire Earth to predict the probability of various possible threats to people. Such systems can warn against natural disasters such as hurricanes or cyclones that may arise in the future. Although this is a future development, a sample video showing the sea surface temperature for 1982 has been generated in order to show what this can result in. The simulation is based on publicly available databases from organisations such as NOAA and NASA.\n\nAs with most other volunteer computing projects, progress relies on recruiting a number of users willing to donate computing power to the project. These projects are usually run in the background and when the computer is idle and have little or no performance impact when a person is using the computer.\n\nA side effect of the project is to develop high-performance algorithms for the various subprojects. The source code of the programs are open and available for public download on Google Code, licensed under the GPL license. All the data generated by the project is also available from the project website, also distributed under the GPL license. The project is also open to new subprojects, although the current focus is on the continued development of the software, in order to ensure a more stable platform.\n\nThe project was officially launched on 13 August 2012. As of 9 October 2012, over 2243 volunteers with over 1779 hosts have participated in the project. The Oproject has 9th place between all BOINC projects by the amount of new hosts after well-known WCG, SETI@Home, MilkyWay, Collatz conjecture, PrimeGrid projects. On September 30, 2012 the project lead released the news about the launch OProject@Home in BOINC official website, and later on the same day the project was added to the overall list of distributed systems.\n"}
{"id": "43972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43972", "title": "Partial pressure", "text": "Partial pressure\n\nIn a mixture of gases, each constituent gas has a partial pressure which is the notional pressure of that constituent gas if it alone occupied the entire volume of the original mixture at the same temperature. The total pressure of an ideal gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture.\n\nThe partial pressure of a gas is a measure of thermodynamic activity of the gas's molecules. Gases dissolve, diffuse, and react according to their partial pressures, and not according to their concentrations in gas mixtures or liquids. This general property of gases is also true in chemical reactions of gases in biology. For example, the necessary amount of oxygen for human respiration, and the amount that is toxic, is set by the partial pressure of oxygen alone. This is true across a very wide range of different concentrations of oxygen present in various inhaled breathing gases or dissolved in blood. The partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are important parameters in tests of arterial blood gases, but can also be measured in, for example, cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nThe symbol for pressure is usually P or p which may use a subscript to identify the pressure, and gas species are also referred to by subscript. When combined these subscripts are applied recursively.\n\nExamples:\n\nDalton's law expresses the fact that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the mixture. This equality arises from the fact that in an ideal gas the molecules are so far apart that they do not interact with each other. Most actual real-world gases come very close to this ideal. For example, given an ideal gas mixture of nitrogen (N), hydrogen (H) and ammonia (NH):\n\nIdeally the ratio of partial pressures equals the ratio of the number of molecules. That is, the mole fraction of an individual gas component in an ideal gas mixture can be expressed in terms of the component's partial pressure or the moles of the component:\n\nand the partial pressure of an individual gas component in an ideal gas can be obtained using this expression:\n\nThe mole fraction of a gas component in a gas mixture is equal to the volumetric fraction of that component in a gas mixture.\n\nThe ratio of partial pressures relies on the following isotherm relation:\n\nThe partial volume of a particular gas in a mixture is the volume of one component of the gas mixture. It is useful in gas mixtures, e.g. air, to focus on one particular gas component, e.g. oxygen.\n\nIt can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction:\n\nVapor pressure is the pressure of a vapor in equilibrium with its non-vapor phases (i.e., liquid or solid). Most often the term is used to describe a liquid's tendency to evaporate. It is a measure of the tendency of molecules and atoms to escape from a liquid or a solid. A liquid's atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the normal boiling point.\n\nThe higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid.\n\nThe vapor pressure chart displayed has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids. As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.\n\nFor example, at any given temperature, methyl chloride has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (-24.2 °C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere (atm) of absolute vapor pressure. Note that at higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is less than that at sea level, so boiling points of liquids are reduced. At the top of Mount Everest, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.333 atm, so by using the graph, the boiling point of Diethyl ether would be approximately 7.5 °C versus 34.6 °C at sea level (1 atm).\n\nIt is possible to work out the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction involving a mixture of gases given the partial pressure of each gas and the overall reaction formula. For a reversible reaction involving gas reactants and gas products, such as:\n\nthe equilibrium constant of the reaction would be:\n\nFor reversible reactions, changes in the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the equilibrium so as to favor either the right or left side of the reaction in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle. However, the reaction kinetics may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift. In some cases, the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider.\n\nGases will dissolve in liquids to an extent that is determined by the equilibrium between the undissolved gas and the gas that has dissolved in the liquid (called the \"solvent\"). The equilibrium constant for that equilibrium is:\n\nThe form of the equilibrium constant shows that the concentration of a solute gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution. This statement is known as Henry's law and the equilibrium constant formula_15 is quite often referred to as the Henry's law constant.\n\nHenry's law is sometimes written as:\n\nwhere formula_17 is also referred to as the Henry's law constant. As can be seen by comparing equations (1) and (2) above, formula_17 is the reciprocal of formula_15. Since both may be referred to as the Henry's law constant, readers of the technical literature must be quite careful to note which version of the Henry's law equation is being used.\n\nHenry's law is an approximation that only applies for dilute, ideal solutions and for solutions where the liquid solvent does not react chemically with the gas being dissolved.\n\nIn underwater diving the physiological effects of individual component gases of breathing gases is a function of partial pressure.\n\nUsing diving terms, partial pressure is calculated as:\n\nFor the component gas \"i\":\n\nFor example, at underwater, the total absolute pressure is (i.e., 1 bar of atmospheric pressure + 5 bar of water pressure) and the partial pressures of the main components of air, oxygen 21% by volume and nitrogen approximately 79% by volume are:\n\nThe minimum safe lower limit for the partial pressures of oxygen in a gas mixture is absolute. Hypoxia and sudden unconsciousness becomes a problem with an oxygen partial pressure of less than 0.16 bar absolute. Oxygen toxicity, involving convulsions, becomes a problem when oxygen partial pressure is too high. The NOAA Diving Manual recommends a maximum single exposure of 45 minutes at 1.6 bar absolute, of 120 minutes at 1.5 bar absolute, of 150 minutes at 1.4 bar absolute, of 180 minutes at 1.3 bar absolute and of 210 minutes at 1.2 bar absolute. Oxygen toxicity becomes a risk when these oxygen partial pressures and exposures are exceeded. The partial pressure of oxygen determines the maximum operating depth of a gas mixture.\n\nNarcosis is a problem when breathing gases at high pressure. Typically, the maximum total partial pressure of narcotic gases used when planning for technical diving may be around 4.5 bar absolute, based on an equivalent narcotic depth of .\n\nThe effect of a toxic contaminant such as carbon monoxide in breathing gas is also related to the partial pressure when breathed. A mixture which may be relatively safe at the surface could be dangerously toxic at the maximum depth of a dive, or a tolerable level of carbon dioxide in the breathing loop of a diving rebreather may be come intolerable within seconds during descent when the partial pressure rapidly increases, and could lead to panic or incapacitation of the diver.\n\nThe partial pressures of particularly oxygen (formula_20) and carbon dioxide (formula_20) are important parameters in tests of arterial blood gases, but can also be measured in, for example, cerebrospinal fluid. \n\n"}
{"id": "81986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81986", "title": "Pioneer 1", "text": "Pioneer 1\n\nOn October 11, 1958, Pioneer 1 became the first spacecraft launched by NASA, the newly formed space agency of the United States. The flight was the second and most successful of the three Thor-Able space probes.\n\n\"Pioneer 1\" was fabricated by Ramo-Wooldridge Corp.(TRW), and consisted of a thin cylindrical midsection with a squat truncated cone on each side. The cylinder was in diameter and the height from the top of one cone to the top of the opposite cone was . Along the axis of the spacecraft and protruding from the end of the lower cone was an 11 kg solid propellant injection rocket and rocket case, which formed the main structural member of the spacecraft. Eight small low-thrust solid propellant velocity adjustment rockets were mounted on the end of the upper cone in a ring assembly which could be jettisoned after use. A magnetic dipole antenna also protruded from the top of the upper cone. The shell was composed of laminated plastic. The total mass of the spacecraft after vernier separation was 34.2 kg, after injection rocket firing it would have been 23.2 kg.\n\nThe three-stage Thor-Able vehicle consisted of a modified Air Force Thor IRBM (liquid propellant, thrust about 153,000 pounds) as the first stage. A liquid-propellant rocket engine powered the second stage (modified Vanguard second stage, thrust about 7500 pounds). The third stage was a solid-propellant unit based on Vanguard design, rated at 116,500 lb*sec total impulse.\n\nThe scientific instrument package had a mass of 17.8 kg and consisted of an image scanning infrared television system to study the Moon's surface to a resolution of 0.5 degrees, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a spin-coil magnetometer to measure magnetic fields to 5 microgauss, and temperature-variable resistors to record the spacecraft's internal conditions. The spacecraft was powered by nickel-cadmium batteries for ignition of the rockets, silver cell batteries for the television system, and mercury batteries for the remaining circuits. Radio transmission was on 108.06 MHz through an electric dipole antenna for telemetry and doppler information at 300 mW and a magnetic dipole antenna for the television system at 50 W. Ground commands were received through the electric dipole antenna at 115 MHz. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized at 1.8 rps, the spin direction was approximately perpendicular to the geomagnetic meridian planes of the trajectory.\n\nTwo days after the failure of \"Pioneer 0\" on August 17, Thor 129, the backup vehicle, was erected on LC-17B in preparation for a September attempt. The postflight investigation of \"Pioneer 0\" pointed to a turbopump failure, which had also caused the loss of Thor-Able 116 in April. This was followed by the failure of an Atlas launch on September 18, so the Air Force moved to replace the turbopumps in their inventory of Thor and Atlas missiles. Thor 129 was pulled from the pad for modifications and replaced with Thor 130. On October 11, \"Pioneer 1\" lifted off smoothly, but the guidance system steered the Thor slightly too high and fast, causing the second stage to be lofted 3° higher than intended. As a result, it shut off 10 seconds earlier than planned, and also bumped the third stage during separation. The third stage was left pitched up about 15° and suffering a velocity shortfall of about 500 feet per second. The vernier engines on the third stage were fired to make up for the thrust deficit, but added only 150 feet per second of velocity, insufficient to escape Earth orbit. As a last resort, ground controllers decided that if they could not get \"Pioneer 1\" to the Moon, they would place it in a high Earth orbit by firing the attached solid rocket motor. The inaccurate launch trajectory, however, had placed the probe on an orbital track that resulted in thermal heating and cooling beyond what the primitive temperature control system could handle. The probe's internals fell to near freezing temperatures, rendering the solid motor igniter inoperable. Pioneer 1 reached a total distance of before beginning its descent back to Earth.\n\nThe spacecraft was launched from LC-17A at 08:42:00 UTC on October 11, 1958 but it did not reach the Moon as planned due to a programming error in the upper stage causing a slight error in burnout velocity and angle (3.5 deg.). This resulted in a ballistic trajectory with a peak altitude of around 13:00 local time. The real-time transmission was obtained for about 75% of the flight, but the percentage of data recorded for each experiment was variable. Except for the first hour of flight, the signal-to-noise ratio was good. The spacecraft ended transmission when it reentered the Earth's atmosphere after 43 hours of flight on October 13, 1958 at 03:46 UT over the South Pacific Ocean. A small quantity of useful scientific information was returned, showing the radiation surrounding Earth was in the form of bands and measuring the extent of the bands, mapping the total ionizing flux, making the first observations of hydromagnetic oscillations of the magnetic field, and taking the first measurements of the density of micrometeorites and the Interplanetary Magnetic Field.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4121234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4121234", "title": "Science in Action (book)", "text": "Science in Action (book)\n\nScience in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society () is an influential book by Bruno Latour. The English edition was published in 1987 by Harvard University Press. It is written in a textbook style, and contains a full-featured approach to the empirical study of science and technology. Moreover, it also entertains ontological conceptions and theoretical discussions making it a research monograph and not a methodological handbook per se.\n\nIn the first chapter Latour develops the methodological dictum that science and technology must be studied \"in action\", or \"in the making\". Because scientific discoveries turn esoteric and difficult to understand, it has to be studied where discoveries are made in practice. For example, Latour turns back time in the case of the discovery of the \"double helix\". Going back in time, deconstructing statements, machines and articles, it is possible to arrive at a point where scientific discovery could have chosen to take many other directions (contingency). Also the concept of \"black box\" is introduced. A black box is a metaphor borrowed from cybernetics denoting a piece of machinery that \"runs by itself\". That is, when a series of instructions are too complicated to be repeated all the time, a black box is drawn around it, allowing it to function only by giving it \"input\" and \"output\" data. For example, a CPU inside a computer is a black box. Its inner complexity doesn't have to be known; one only needs to use it in his/her daily activities.\nLatour's work, including \"Science in Action\", has received heavy criticism from some scholars. Olga Amsterdamska's highly critical book review concluded with the following sentence: \"Somehow, the ideal of a social science whose only goal is to tell inconsistent, false, and incoherent stories about nothing in particular does not strike me as very appealing or sufficiently ambitious.\"\n\n"}

It is an updated version of Second Generation Multiplex. SGM Plus has been used by the UK National DNA Database since 1998.\n\nAn SGM Plus profile consists of a list of 10 number pairs, one number pair for each of 10 genetic markers, along with two letters (XX or XY) which show the result of the gender test. Each number pair denotes the two allele values for the marker - one value is inherited from each of the subject's parents. If both alleles are the same, then only a single number, rather than a pair, is recorded.\n\nThe genetic markers (or loci) used by SGM Plus are all Short tandem repeats (STRs). The markers used are: VWA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, TH01, FGA, D3S1358, D16S539, D2S1338 and D19S433. Where a marker's designation begins with D, the digits immediately following the D indicate the chromosome that contains the marker. For example, D21S11 is on chromosome 21. SGM Plus also uses the Amelogenin (Amelo) sex-indicating test.\n\nSGM Plus differs from SGM in that SGM does not use the markers D3S1358, D16S539, D2S1338 and D19S433.\n\nSGM Plus has eight markers in common with CODIS FGA, TH01, VWA, D3S1358, D8S1179, D16S539, D18S51, and D21S11. It differs from CODIS in that it uses the additional markers D2S1338 and D19S433 and does not use the five markers CSF1PO, TPOX, D5S818, D7S820, D13S317.\n\nThe primers are tagged with the following fluorescent dyes for detection under electrophoresis:\n\n\nThe primers for each locus are arranged on the dyes in the following order, from low molecular weight to large molecular weight:\n\n\nThe dyes to which each primer is attached differ from those of the original SGM DNA profiling system.\n\nThe SGM Plus profile of subject GT36865 from a National Institute of Standards and Technology paper is given below:\n\nAn SGM Plus profile retrieved from a DNA database would just list the allele values:\n\n15,18; 6,9; 11,13; 22,22; 31,32.2; 14,17; 17,20; 11,12; 13,16.3; 15,16; XY\n\nEach value is the number of tandem repeats within the allele. A non-standard repeat is designated by the number of complete repeat units and the number of base pairs of the partial repeat, separated by a decimal point.\n\nThe probability of identify (also known as the random match probability) is the probability that two individuals selected at random will have an identical genetic profile.\n\nApplied Biosystems estimates the probability of identity for SGM Plus to be approximately 1 in 13 trillion for African-Americans and 1 in 3.3 trillion Caucasian Americans.\n\nThe Human Genetics Commission has reported that the random match probability is in the region of 1 in a trillion. However it stated \"When the SGM Plus profiling system was first introduced, there was agreement within the scientific community that identifications with match probabilities lower than one in a billion would not be quoted in the courts of law, so as to avoid overstating the value of the DNA evidence to take into account that match probabilities are only estimates, and to make sure that the figure used was one that was meaningful to non-specialists.\"\nThe UK Crown Prosecution Service states \"SGM Plus DNA profiling is very discriminating between individuals. The probability of obtaining a match between the profiles of two unrelated individuals by chance is very low, of the order of 1 in a billion [note this is a UK billion, ie a US trillion]. However, it has not yet been possible to carry out the required statistical testing to be able to quote this match probability, and in practice a more conservative chance match figure of 1 in 1,000 million is used.\"\n\n\n"}

Inside the reentry capsule were a monkey, a dog and a rabbit in a test of the spaceship's life support systems. The reentry module separated from the rest of the spacecraft after just over seven days in orbit, with the orbital module staying in orbit for another 220 days.\n\n\"Shenzhou 2\" tested the spacecraft much more rigorously than its predecessor \"Shenzhou 1\". After being launched into a 196.5 by 333.8 km orbit, 20.5 hours after launch it circularised its orbit to 327.7 by 332.7 km. Around 1220 UTC on January 12 it once again changed its orbit to 329.3 by 339.4 km. A third orbit change came on January 15 328.7 by 345.4 km.\n\nAs well as the animal cargo, there were 64 different scientific payloads. 15 were carried in the reentry module, 12 in the orbital module and 37 on the forward external pallet. These included a microgravity crystallography experiment; animal species including six mice, and small aquatic and terrestrial organisms; cosmic ray and particle detectors and a gamma ray burst detectors. To test the radio transmitting systems taped messages were broadcast from the spacecraft.\n\nThe signal for retrofire was sent at about 1015 UTC on January 16 as the spacecraft passed over the South Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Africa.

No photos were released of the landing capsule leading to some speculation that the reentry was not completely successful, though this was denied by Chinese officials. The Swedish Space Center news site reported that an unnamed source said one of the connections from the capsule to the single parachute failed leading to a hard landing.\n\nThe mission of the orbital module continued until it was commanded to fire its rockets to initiate reentry on August 24.

Detonation velocity is the speed with which the detonation shock wave travels through the explosive. It is a key, directly measurable indicator of explosive performance, but depends on density which must always be specified, and may be too low if the test charge diameter is not large enough. Especially for little studied explosives there may be divergent published values due to charge diameter issues. In liquid explosives, like nitroglycerin, there may be two detonation velocities, one much higher than the other. The detonation velocity values presented here are typically for the highest practical density which maximizes achievable detonation velocity.\n\nThe velocity of detonation is an important indicator for overall energy and power of detonation, and in particular for the brisance or shattering effect of an explosive which is due to the detonation pressure. The pressure can be calculated using Chapman-Jouguet theory from the velocity and density.\n\n"}
{"id": "41997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41997", "title": "Twin prime", "text": "Twin prime\n\nA twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number—for example, either member of the twin prime pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two. Sometimes the term \"twin prime\" is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair.\n\nTwin primes become increasingly rare as one examines larger ranges, in keeping with the general tendency of gaps between adjacent primes to become larger as the numbers themselves get larger. However, it is unknown if there are infinitely many twin primes or if there is a largest pair. The work of Yitang Zhang in 2013, as well as work by James Maynard, Terence Tao and others, has made substantial progress towards proving that there are infinitely many twin primes, but at present it remains unsolved.\nThe question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one of the great open questions in number theory for many years. This is the content of the twin prime conjecture, which states that there are infinitely many primes \"p\" such that \"p\" + 2 is also prime. In 1849, de Polignac made the more general conjecture that for every natural number \"k\", there are infinitely many primes \"p\" such that \"p\" + 2\"k\" is also prime. The case \"k\" = 1 of de Polignac's conjecture is the twin prime conjecture.\n\nA stronger form of the twin prime conjecture, the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture (see below), postulates a distribution law for twin primes akin to the prime number theorem.\n\nOn April 17, 2013, Yitang Zhang announced a proof that for some integer \"N\" that is less than 70 million, there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by \"N\". Zhang's paper was accepted by \"Annals of Mathematics\" in early May 2013. Terence Tao subsequently proposed a Polymath Project collaborative effort to optimize Zhang's bound. As of April 14, 2014, one year after Zhang's announcement, the bound has been reduced to 246. Further, assuming the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture and its generalized form, the Polymath project wiki states that the bound has been reduced to 12 and 6, respectively. These improved bounds were discovered using a different approach that was simpler than Zhang's and was discovered independently by James Maynard and Terence Tao. This second approach also gave bounds for the smallest \"f\"(\"m\") needed to guarantee that infinitely many intervals of width \"f\"(\"m\") contain at least \"m\" primes.\n\nUsually the pair (2, 3) is not considered to be a pair of twin primes. Since 2 is the only even prime, this pair is the only pair of prime numbers that differ by one; thus twin primes are as closely spaced as possible for any other two primes.\n\nThe first few twin prime pairs are:\n\nFive is the only prime in two distinct pairs.\n\nEvery twin prime pair except formula_1 is of the form formula_2 for some natural number \"n\"; that is, the number between the two primes is a multiple of 6. As a result, the sum of any pair of twin primes (other than 3 and 5) is divisible by 12.\n\nIn 1915, Viggo Brun showed that the sum of reciprocals of the twin primes was convergent. This famous result, called Brun's theorem, was the first use of the Brun sieve and helped initiate the development of modern sieve theory. The modern version of Brun's argument can be used to show that the number of twin primes less than \"N\" does not exceed\n\nfor some absolute constant \"C\" > 0. In fact, it is bounded above by :formula_4, where formula_5, where \"C\" is the twin prime constant, given below.\n\nIn 1940, Paul Erdős showed that there is a constant \"c\" < 1 and infinitely many primes \"p\" such that where \"p\"′ denotes the next prime after \"p\". This result was successively improved; in 1986 Helmut Maier showed that a constant \"c\" < 0.25 can be used. In 2004 Daniel Goldston and Cem Yıldırım showed that the constant could be improved further to \"c\" = 0.085786… In 2005, Goldston, János Pintz and Yıldırım established that \"c\" can be chosen to be arbitrarily small, i.e.\n\nBy assuming the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture or a slightly weaker version, they were able to show that there are infinitely many \"n\" such that at least two of \"n\", \"n\" + 2, \"n\" + 6, \"n\" + 8, \"n\" + 12, \"n\" + 18, or \"n\" + 20 are prime. Under a stronger hypothesis they showed that for infinitely many \"n\", at least two of \"n\", \"n\" + 2, \"n\" + 4, and \"n\" + 6 are prime.\n\nThe result of Yitang Zhang,\n\nis a major improvement on the Goldston–Graham–Pintz–Yıldırım result. The Polymath Project optimization of Zhang's bound and the work of Maynard has reduced the bound to \"N\" = 246.\n\nThe Hardy–Littlewood conjecture (named after G. H. Hardy and John Littlewood) is a generalization of the twin prime conjecture. It is concerned with the distribution of prime constellations, including twin primes, in analogy to the prime number theorem. Let π(\"x\") denote the number of primes \"p\" ≤ \"x\" such that \"p\" + 2 is also prime. Define the twin prime constant \"C\" as\n\n(here the product extends over all prime numbers \"p\" ≥ 3). Then the conjecture is that\n\nin the sense that the quotient of the two expressions tends to 1 as \"x\" approaches infinity. (The second ~ is not part of the conjecture and is proven by integration by parts.)\n\nThe conjecture can be justified (but not proven) by assuming that 1 / ln \"t\" describes the density function of the prime distribution, an assumption suggested by the prime number theorem and would imply the twin prime conjecture, but remains unresolved.\n\nThis first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture on prime \"k\"-tuples implies that the \"second\" Hardy–Littlewood conjecture is false.\n\nPolignac's conjecture from 1849 states that for every positive even natural number \"k\", there are infinitely many consecutive prime pairs \"p\" and \"p′\" such that \"p\"′ − \"p\" = \"k\" (i.e. there are infinitely many prime gaps of size \"k\"). The case \"k\" = 2 is the twin prime conjecture. The conjecture has not yet been proven or disproven for any specific value of \"k\", but Zhang's result proves that it is true for at least one (currently unknown) value of \"k\". Indeed, if such a \"k\" did not exist, then for any positive even natural number \"N\" there are at most finitely many \"n\" such that \"p\" − \"p\" = \"m\" for all \"m\" < \"N\" and so for \"n\" large enough we have \"p\" − \"p\" > \"N\", which would contradict Zhang's result.\n\nBeginning in 2007, two distributed computing projects, Twin Prime Search and PrimeGrid, have produced several record-largest twin primes. , the current largest twin prime pair known is 2996863034895 · 2 ± 1, with 388,342 decimal digits. It was discovered in September 2016.\n\nThere are 808,675,888,577,436 twin prime pairs below 10.\n\nAn empirical analysis of all prime pairs up to 4.35 · 10 shows that if the number of such pairs less than x is f(x)·x/(log x) then f(x) is about 1.7 for small x and decreases towards about 1.3 as x tends to infinity. The limiting value of f(x) is conjectured to equal twice the twin prime constant () (not to be confused with Brun's constant), according to the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture.\n\nEvery third odd number is divisible by 3, which requires that no three successive odd numbers can be prime unless one of them is 3. Five is therefore the only prime that is part of two twin prime pairs. The lower member of a pair is by definition a Chen prime.\n\nIt has been proven that the pair (\"m\", \"m\" + 2) is a twin prime if and only if\n\nIf \"m\" − 4 or \"m\" + 6 is also prime then the three primes are called a prime triplet.\n\nFor a twin prime pair of the form (6\"n\" − 1, 6\"n\" + 1) for some natural number \"n\" > 1, \"n\" must have units digit 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 8 ().\n\nAn isolated prime (also known as single prime or non-twin prime) is a prime number \"p\" such that neither \"p\" − 2 nor \"p\" + 2 is prime. In other words, \"p\" is not part of a twin prime pair. For example, 23 is an isolated prime, since 21 and 25 are both composite.\n\nThe first few isolated primes are\n\nIt follows from Brun's theorem that almost all primes are members of this sequence.\n\n\n"}

The family moved to Bonn later that year. His father was the first engineer in a long line of merchants. After graduating from the Beethoven School in Bonn in 1936, he studied aerodynamics and aircraft design at the Technical University in Aachen, and later in Munich when the Nazis had closed other technical universities. In Munich he was one of just four students, out of several hundred, who refused to join the Nazi student club. He said he first simply pretended not to find it, and then since it was formally listed as a dueling club he avoided it by claiming religious objections. For this he was denied access to certain advanced aircraft courses, so he focused on courses relevant to rocketry. Before completing his degree he was drafted at the end of 1939, and sent with a signal corps unit to France and then to Czechoslovakia. In between, he was granted a one-semester break to complete the major part of his aerodynamics degree.\n\nAs a result of his technical background, in late 1941 he was assigned to the German rocket development effort at Peenemünde, led by Wernher von Braun. There, as the youngest member of the rocket team, he worked in the future projects division, a group composed mainly of physicists who needed a specialist in aerodynamics. At the time, theoretical understanding of high-speed aerodynamics was still in its infancy. He was one of a group that conducted pioneering experiments in a small supersonic wind tunnel to obtain essential insights and data to support designs for proposed new rockets. Among these was the A9/A10 rocket, designed to be the first intercontinental ballistic missile, based on a Mach 6 boost-glide approach using a winged derivative of the V2 rocket. He soon recognized in the wind tunnel results that a shift occurred in the aerodynamic center-of-pressure as the rocket transitioned to supersonic speeds, which would cause it to become unstable. This led to experiments and theories to understand the shift and determine aerodynamic configurations that would allow the rocket to remain stable.\n\nHe also worked on the Wasserfall rocket, a radar-guided supersonic anti-aircraft missile, in which the same center-of-pressure shift was being encountered. Along the way, he developed a conical rocket propellant tank that successfully overcame liquid fuel sloshing problems, for which he won an internal prize with a monetary award that he proudly never cashed. In August 1943, when Allied forces bombed the Peenemuende facilities, he received a commendation for saving critical wind tunnel data during the ensuing fires. The Wasserfall project continued almost to the war's end, and the rocket was successfully flown but never went into production. In 1944, he and others in the group were granted civilian status, and resumed the A9/A10 development effort. In January 1945, near the end of the war, two A9 test rockets were launched with control surface designs based on the group's solution to the center-of-pressure shift. The second of these achieved stable transition to supersonic flight.\n\nFacing advancing Russian forces at the beginning of February 1945, he and most others on the rocket team moved to Oberammergau to allow a surrender to American forces. After his release in August 1945, he briefly worked in a candle factory of family friends in Bonn, until accepting an invitation from the U.S. as part of Operation Paperclip to join the U.S. Army's nascent rocket program with other members selected from von Braun's team. He insisted, however, on first being allowed to finish his degree, which was officially awarded in mechanical engineering due to postwar restrictions on further rocket work in Germany. In August 1947 he rejoined the other scientists from the von Braun team at Fort Bliss, Texas to begin work on the U.S. rocket program.\n\nIn the U.S. he was initially involved in tests at White Sands Missile Range using V2 rockets. These results led directly to the Redstone rocket and laid the basis for every other rocket developed in the United States since. The White Sands work included a Mach 3 cruise missile known as the Hermes II, based on a V2 first stage with a radical linear ramjet concept for the second stage. His work on the Hermes II continued after he moved in 1950 with much of the von Braun team to Huntsville, Ala. as part of the Army's ballistic missile program. There he developed the external aerodynamic design for the Army's Redstone missile, which served as the launch rocket for the nation's first live nuclear missile tests and later also launched the first U.S. astronaut into space. He developed a successful Mach 5 ballistic re-entry nose cone using a purely theoretical approach, at a time when no hypersonic wind tunnels existed to test the theories or provide needed data. He subsequently continued pioneering contributions in high-speed aerothermochemistry in the Army's Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile program, and then on the Army's Pershing medium-range ballistic missile and the large Saturn I booster rocket.\n\nFollowing the Russian Sputnik launch, in July 1960 he moved with other von Braun rocket scientists from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency to the newly founded NASA. There, as part of the Apollo moon-landing program, he made major contributions working on the Saturn V booster rocket, on aerothermodynamics, and on liquid hydrogen propellant systems. He subsequently was involved in numerous projects contributing to the nation's manned and unmanned space flight programs, especially Skylab and the Space Shuttle. In the Shuttle development effort he led a team working on vehicle aerodynamics and the main engines, which included developing full-scale component tests and scaling methodologies, and applying computational fluid dynamics to overcome a wide range of aerothermochemistry problems.\n\nHe was Chief of the Aerophysics Division at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center until 1992, when he became Chief Aerodynamicist at the NASA Center. He was awarded the AIAA Aerodynamics Award in 1997 for his exceptional lifetime contributions to the aerodynamic design and analysis of strategic missiles and manned/unmanned launch rockets, and received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 2003. He continued working in science positions at NASA until his retirement, at 89, in 2006. David King, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, said \"America's space program is preeminent because folks like Mr. Dahm contributed to building it into the best in the world. His life and life's work are an example of his energy, dedication and humble leadership, which has played a significant role in humanity's peaceful use of space.\"\n"}
