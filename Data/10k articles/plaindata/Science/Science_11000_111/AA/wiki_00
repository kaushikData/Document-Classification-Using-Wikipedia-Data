The road continues as Fleetwood Road in a roughly northerly direction for a further , through Esprick and Greenhalgh. This section is rural and fairly winding, although some curves were straightened in the 1970s when container traffic began using the road, most notably the series of bends in Thistleton at the B5269 turnings to Singleton and Elswick. These were notoriously known as 'Hellfire Corner'. \n\nThe road meets the A586 Garstang New Road near Larbreck, where it turns west, sharing with the A586 for one mile (1.6 km), until a traffic light controlled junction at Little Singleton. It continues north-west as Mains Lane for a further , passing the A588 turning to Shard Bridge and Over Wyre, then sharing with the A588 until the River Wyre roundabout, where the A588 diverts south-west towards Poulton-le-Fylde. At this point, the road becomes Amounderness Way, which was built in the 1970s to allow container traffic to bypass Thornton. It continues through Norcross Roundabout, initially as a national speed limit road until Cleveleys, at which point the speed limit is reduced due to more urban surroundings. The road continues north, acting as a border between Thornton and Cleveleys.\n\nThe road then enters Fleetwood, first reaching Broadwater Roundabout, a total distance of about from the start of the newer section of the road. Broadwater Roundabout is surmounted by a statue of Eros, a copy of that standing in Piccadilly Circus, London. From here, the road begins its last and newest section, a stretch of Amounderness Way built on the old railway bed in the 1990s.

The test took place on September 18, 1964, lasting for five orbits (about seven and a half hours). The spacecraft and its upper stage completed 59 orbits before reentering the atmosphere and crashing in the Indian Ocean on September 22, 1964.\n\nAS-102 was designed to repeat the flight of AS-101. It would once again carry a boilerplate Apollo Command and Service Module. The only difference from Boilerplate 13 carried on AS-101 was that on Boilerplate 15, one of the simulated Reaction Control System thruster quads (attitude control thrusters) was instrumented to record launch temperatures and vibrations. Another major difference on AS-102 was that the Launch Escape System (LES) tower would be jettisoned using the launch escape and pitch control motors. The mission used Apollo boilerplate BP-15.\n\nAS-102 was the first time a Saturn rocket carried a programmable guidance computer. Previous launches had used an onboard \"black box\" that was preprogrammed. On AS-102 it would be possible to reprogram the computer during flight so that any anomalous behavior could potentially be corrected.\n\nIn early July, a small crack in engine number six was found. This meant removing the engine, the first time that the ground crew had to do this with a Saturn rocket. It was then decided to return all eight engines to the manufacturer, which meant a job that would take about ten hours because of the large number of tubes, hoses and wires that connected each engine to the rocket. The replacement delayed the launch by about two weeks, followed by another delay of several days because of Hurricanes Cleo and Dora.\n\nLaunch was on 18 September from Cape Kennedy, Florida just before noon local time. The first stage burned for 147.7 seconds, with separation 0.8 seconds later. The second stage ignited 1.7 seconds later, and the LES jettisoned at 160.2 seconds after launch. It burned until +621.1 seconds with the stage and boilerplate in a 212.66 by 226.50 km orbit.\n\nThe flight met all its objectives. The spacecraft continued to transmit telemetry for five orbits and was tracked until re-entry on its 59th orbit over the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe only anomalous event on the flight was the failure to recover the eight film-camera pods. They had landed downrange of the expected area, where Hurricane Gladys ruled out a continued search. However, two of the pods did wash ashore two months later. The pods were covered with barnacles, but the film inside was undamaged.\n\n"}

This species is believed to be the ancestor of the domestic donkey, which is usually placed within the same species. They live in the deserts and other arid areas of the Horn of Africa, in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia. It formerly had a wider range north and west into Sudan, Egypt, and Libya. About 570 individuals exist in the wild.\n\nThe African wild ass is long and (12 to 14 hands) tall at the shoulders, with a tail long. It weighs between . The short, smooth coat is a light grey to fawn colour, fading quickly to white on the undersides and legs. There is a slender, dark dorsal stripe in all subspecies, while in the Nubian wild ass (\"E. a. africanus\"), as well as the domestic donkey, there is a stripe across the shoulder. The legs of the Somali wild ass (\"E. a. somaliensis\") are horizontally striped with black, resembling those of a zebra. On the nape of the neck, there is a stiff, upright mane, the hairs of which are tipped with black. The ears are large with black margins. The tail terminates with a black brush. The hooves are slender and approximately of the diameter as the legs.\n\nThe genus \"Equus\", which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from \"Dinohippus\", via the intermediate form \"Plesippus\". One of the oldest species is \"Equus simplicidens\", described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged \"Equus livenzovensis\" documented from western Europe and Russia.\n\nMolecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus \"Equus\") lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus \"E. (Asinus)\", including the kulan, onager, and kiang), followed by the African zebras (subgenera \"E. (Dolichohippus)\", and \"E. (Hippotigris)\"). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus \"E. (Equus)\" which diverged ~4.8 (3.2–6.5) million years ago.\n\nDifferent authors consider the African wild ass and the domesticated donkey one or two species; either view is technically legitimate, though the former is phylogenetically more accurate.\n\nThe species name for the African wild ass is sometimes given as \"asinus\", from the domestic donkey, whose specific name is older and usually would have priority. But this usage is erroneous since the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature has conserved the name \"Equus africanus\" in Opinion 2027. This was done to prevent the confusing situation of the phylogenetic ancestor being taxonomically included in its descendant.\n\nThus, if one species is recognized, the correct scientific name of the donkey is \"E. africanus asinus\".\n\nThe first published name for the African wild ass, \"Asinus africanus\", Fitzinger, 1858, is a nomen nudum. The name \"Equus taeniopus\" von Heuglin, 1861 is rejected as indeterminable, as it is based on an animal that cannot be identified and may have been a hybrid between a domestic donkey and a Somali wild ass; the type has not been preserved. The first available name thus becomes \"Asinus africanus\" von Heuglin & Fitzinger, 1866. A lectotype is designated: a skull of an adult female collected by von Heuglin near Atbarah River, Sudan, and present in the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, MNS 32026. The two subspecies recognized are the Nubian wild ass \"Equus africanus africanus\" (von Heuglin & Fitzinger, 1866), and the Somali wild ass \"Equus africanus somaliensis\" (Noack, 1884).\n\nAfrican wild asses are well suited to life in a desert or semidesert environment. They have tough digestive systems, which can break down desert vegetation and extract moisture from food efficiently. They can also go without water for a fairly long time. Their large ears give them an excellent sense of hearing and help in cooling.\nBecause of the sparse vegetation in their environment wild asses live somewhat separated from each other (except for mothers and young), unlike the tightly grouped herds of wild horses. They have very loud voices, which can be heard for over , which helps them to keep in contact with other asses over the wide spaces of the desert.\n\nThe African wild ass is primarily active in the cooler hours between late afternoon and early morning, seeking shade and shelter amongst the rocky hills during the day. The Somali wild ass is also very agile and nimble-footed, capable of moving quickly across boulder fields and in the mountains. On the flat, it has been recorded reaching speeds of . In keeping with these feats, its soles are particularly hard and its hooves grow very quickly.\n\nMature males defend large territories around 23 square kilometres in size, marking them with dung heaps – an essential marker in the flat, monotonous terrain. Due to the size of these ranges, the dominant male cannot exclude other males. Rather, intruders are tolerated – recognized and treated as subordinates, and kept as far away as possible from any of the resident females. In the presence of estrous females, the males bray loudly. These animals live in loose herds of up to fifty individuals.\n\nIn the wild, breeding of African wild ass occurs in wet season. Gestation period lasts for 11 to 12 months, given birth one foal from October to February. The foal weaning on 6 to 8 month after birth, with sexual maturity at 2 years in 2 years after birth. Lifespan is up to 40 years in captivity.\n\nWild asses can run swiftly, almost as fast as a horse. However, unlike most hoofed mammals, their tendency is to not flee right away from a potentially dangerous situation, but to investigate first before deciding what to do. When they need to, they can defend themselves with kicks from both their front and hind legs. Equids were used in ancient Sumer to pull wagons circa 2600 BC, and then chariots on the Standard of Ur, circa 2000 BC. These have been suggested to represent onagers, but are now thought to have been domestic asses.\n\nThe African wild asses' diet consists of grasses, bark, and leaves. Despite being primarily adapted for living in an arid climate, they are dependent on water, and when not receiving the needed moisture from vegetation, they must drink at least once every three days. However, they can survive on a surprisingly small amount of liquid, and have been reported to drink salty or brackish water.\n\nThough the species itself is under no threat of extinction, due to abundant domestic stock (donkey and burros), the two extant wild subspecies are both listed as critically endangered. African wild asses have been captured for domestication for centuries, and this, along with interbreeding between wild and domestic animals, has caused a distinct decline in population numbers. There are now only a few hundred individuals left in the wild. These animals are also hunted for food and for traditional medicine in both Ethiopia and Somalia. Competition with domestic livestock for grazing, and restricted access to water supplies caused by agricultural developments, pose further threats to the survival of this species. The African wild ass is legally protected in the countries where it is currently found, although these measures often prove difficult to enforce. A protected population of the Somali wild ass exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve in Israel, to the north of Eilat. This reserve was established in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species. Populations of horses and asses are fairly resilient and, if the species is properly protected, it may well recover from its current low.\n\nThere are about 150 individual Somali wild asses living in zoos around the globe, of which 36 were born at Zoo Basel, where this species's breeding program started with Basel's first Somali wild asses in 1970 and the first birth in 1972.\n\nZoo Basel manages the European studbook for the Somali wild ass and coordinates the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP). All European and American wild donkeys are either descendants of the original group at Zoo Basel or of 12 others that came from the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve in Israel in 1972.\n\n\nThis article incorporates CC BY-3.0 text from the reference.\n\n"}

One scale measures the density of liquids heavier than water and the other, liquids lighter than water. The Baumé of distilled water is 0. The API gravity scale is based on errors in early implementations of the Baumé scale.\n\nThe relationship between specific gravity (s.g.) (relative density) and degrees Baumé is function of the temperature. Different versions of the scale may use different reference temperatures. Different conversions formulae can therefore be found in various handbooks.\n\nAs an example, a recent handbook states the conversions between specific gravity and degrees Baumé at a temperature of :\n\nAn older handbook gives the following formulae (no reference temperature being mentioned): \n\nBaumé degrees (heavy) originally represented the percent by mass of sodium chloride in water at . Baumé degrees (light) was calibrated with 0°Bé (light) being the density of 10% NaCl in water by mass and 10°Bé (light) set to the density of water.\n\nBecause of vague instructions or errors in translation a large margin of error was introduced when the scale was adopted. The API gravity scale is a result of adapting to the subsequent errors from the Baumé scale. The Baumé scale is related to the Balling, Brix, Plato and 'specific gravity times 1000' scales.\n\nBefore standardisation on specific gravity around the time of World War II the Baumé scale was generally used in industrial chemistry and pharmacology for the measurement of density of liquids. Today the Baumé scale is still used in various industries such as brewing, sugar beet processing, ophthalmics, starch industry, winemaking and printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication.

It is a multi-causal approach where the core variables and their linkages are delineated. The idea behind it is that a change in one form of an institution will lead to successive changes in other institutions. These changes are circular in that they continue in a cycle, many times in a negative way, in which there is no end, and cumulative in that they persist in each round. The change does not occur all at once as that would lead to chaos, rather the changes occur gradually.\n\nGunnar Myrdal developed the concept from Knut Wicksell and developed it with Nicholas Kaldor when they worked together at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Myrdal concentrated on the social provisioning aspect of development, while Kaldor concentrated on demand-supply relationships to the manufacturing sector.\n\nIn the characteristics that are relevant to the development process of an economy Myrdal mentioned the availability of natural resources, the historical traditions of production activity, national cohesion, religions and ideologies, economic, social and political leadership. Myrdal stated that the immediate effect of closing down certain lines of production in a community is the reduction of employment, income and demand. Through the analysis of the multiplier he pointed out that other sectors of the economy are also affected.\n\nThen he argued that the contraction of the markets in that area tends to have a depressing effect on new investments, which in turn causes a further reduction of income and demand and, if nothing happens to modify the trend, there is a net movement of enterprises and workers towards other areas. Among the further results of these events, fewer local taxes are collected in a time when more social services is required and a vicious downward cumulative cycle is started and a trend towards a lower level of development will be further reinforced.\n\nA status of non-equilibrium is shaped, or as he writes:\n\nAbout Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions Myrdal \nwrote that ‘the argument moves on a general and methodological plane in the sense that the theory is discussed as a complex of broad structures of thought’ (His aim was to submit ‘broad generalisations, as a ‘theory’ is permitted to be, (in order to) grasp the social \nfacts as they organize themselves into a pattern when viewed under a bird’s-eye perspective Into this general vision, the specific \ncharacteristic. source:(Myrdal, G. 1957, Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions, London: University Paperbacks, Methuen))\n\nMyrdal developed further the circular cumulative causation concept and stated that it makes different assumptions from that of stable equilibrium on what can be considered the most important forces guiding the evolution of social processes.\nThese forces characterise the dynamics of these processes in two diverse ways.\n\nYet, the provision of data or other information regarding single economies was beyond the scope of his work. He claimed that in the normal case there is no such a tendency towards automatic self-stabilisation in the social system. The system is by itself not moving towards any sort of balance between forces, but is constantly on the move away from such a situation\nMyrdal used the expressions ‘approach’, ‘theory’ and ‘general \ntheory’ as synonyms. In his subsequent writings, however, he mainly \nreferred to ‘approach’, defining it as something containing, among other things, theories. He wrote that by this term he meant a collection of devices, like ‘the concepts, models, and theories we use, and the way in which we select and arrange observations and present the results of our research’.\n\nIn the preface to his Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions Myrdal \nwrote that \nMyrdal called for economists \nto proceed by confronting the ‘facts of life’ with theories.

The term \"fuzzy\" refers to the fact that the logic involved can deal with concepts that cannot be expressed as the \"true\" or \"false\" but rather as \"partially true\". Although alternative approaches such as genetic algorithms and neural networks can perform just as well as fuzzy logic in many cases, fuzzy logic has the advantage that the solution to the problem can be cast in terms that human operators can understand, so that their experience can be used in the design of the controller. This makes it easier to mechanize tasks that are already successfully performed by humans.\n\nFuzzy logic was first proposed by Lotfi A. Zadeh of the University of California at Berkeley in a 1965 paper. He elaborated on his ideas in a 1973 paper that introduced the concept of \"linguistic variables\", which in this article equates to a variable defined as a fuzzy set. Other research followed, with the first industrial application, a cement kiln built in Denmark, coming on line in 1975.\n\nFuzzy systems were initially implemented in Japan.\n\n\nWork on fuzzy systems is also proceeding in the United State and Europe, although on a less extensive scale than in Japan.\n\n\nResearch and development is also continuing on fuzzy applications in software, as opposed to firmware, design, including fuzzy expert systems and integration of fuzzy logic with neural-network and so-called adaptive \"genetic\" software systems, with the ultimate goal of building \"self-learning\" fuzzy-control systems. These systems can be employed to control complex, nonlinear dynamic plants, for example, human body.\n\nThe input variables in a fuzzy control system are in general mapped by sets of membership functions similar to this, known as \"fuzzy sets\". The process of converting a crisp input value to a fuzzy value is called \"fuzzification\".\n\nA control system may also have various types of switch, or \"ON-OFF\", inputs along with its analog inputs, and such switch inputs of course will always have a truth value equal to either 1 or 0, but the scheme can deal with them as simplified fuzzy functions that happen to be either one value or another.\n\nGiven \"mappings\" of input variables into membership functions and truth values, the microcontroller then makes decisions for what action to take, based on a set of \"rules\", each of the form:\n\nIn this example, the two input variables are \"brake temperature\" and \"speed\" that have values defined as fuzzy sets. The output variable, \"brake pressure\" is also defined by a fuzzy set that can have values like \"static\" or \"slightly increased\" or \"slightly decreased\" etc.\n\nThis rule by itself is very puzzling since it looks like it could be used without bothering with fuzzy logic, but remember that the decision is based on a set of rules:\n\n\nThis combination of fuzzy operations and rule-based \"inference\" describes a \"fuzzy expert system\".\n\nTraditional control systems are based on mathematical models in which the control system is described using one or more differential equations that define the system response to its inputs. Such systems are often implemented as \"PID controllers\" (proportional-integral-derivative controllers). They are the products of decades of development and theoretical analysis, and are highly effective.\n\nIf PID and other traditional control systems are so well-developed, why bother with fuzzy control? It has some advantages. In many cases, the mathematical model of the control process may not exist, or may be too \"expensive\" in terms of computer processing power and memory, and a system based on empirical rules may be more effective.\n\nFurthermore, fuzzy logic is well suited to low-cost implementations based on cheap sensors, low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and 4-bit or 8-bit one-chip microcontroller chips. Such systems can be easily upgraded by adding new rules to improve performance or add new features. In many cases, fuzzy control can be used to improve existing traditional controller systems by adding an extra layer of intelligence to the current control method.\n\nFuzzy controllers are very simple conceptually. They consist of an input stage, a processing stage, and an output stage. The input stage maps sensor or other inputs, such as switches, thumbwheels, and so on, to the appropriate membership functions and truth values. The processing stage invokes each appropriate rule and generates a result for each, then combines the results of the rules. Finally, the output stage converts the combined result back into a specific control output value.\n\nThe most common shape of membership functions is triangular, although trapezoidal and bell curves are also used, but the shape is generally less important than the number of curves and their placement. From three to seven curves are generally appropriate to cover the required range of an input value, or the \"universe of discourse\" in fuzzy jargon.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the processing stage is based on a collection of logic rules in the form of IF-THEN statements, where the IF part is called the \"antecedent\" and the THEN part is called the \"consequent\". Typical fuzzy control systems have dozens of rules.\n\nConsider a rule for a thermostat:\n\nThis rule uses the truth value of the \"temperature\" input, which is some truth value of \"cold\", to generate a result in the fuzzy set for the \"heater\" output, which is some value of \"high\". This result is used with the results of other rules to finally generate the crisp composite output. Obviously, the greater the truth value of \"cold\", the higher the truth value of \"high\", though this does not necessarily mean that the output itself will be set to \"high\" since this is only one rule among many. \nIn some cases, the membership functions can be modified by \"hedges\" that are equivalent to adverbs. Common hedges include \"about\", \"near\", \"close to\", \"approximately\", \"very\", \"slightly\", \"too\", \"extremely\", and \"somewhat\". These operations may have precise definitions, though the definitions can vary considerably between different implementations. \"Very\", for one example, squares membership functions; since the membership values are always less than 1, this narrows the membership function. \"Extremely\" cubes the values to give greater narrowing, while \"somewhat\" broadens the function by taking the square root.\n\nIn practice, the fuzzy rule sets usually have several antecedents that are combined using fuzzy operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, though again the definitions tend to vary: AND, in one popular definition, simply uses the minimum weight of all the antecedents, while OR uses the maximum value. There is also a NOT operator that subtracts a membership function from 1 to give the \"complementary\" function.\n\nThere are several ways to define the result of a rule, but one of the most common and simplest is the \"max-min\" inference method, in which the output membership function is given the truth value generated by the premise.\n\nRules can be solved in parallel in hardware, or sequentially in software. The results of all the rules that have fired are \"defuzzified\" to a crisp value by one of several methods. There are dozens, in theory, each with various advantages or drawbacks.\n\nThe \"centroid\" method is very popular, in which the \"center of mass\" of the result provides the crisp value. Another approach is the \"height\" method, which takes the value of the biggest contributor. The centroid method favors the rule with the output of greatest area, while the height method obviously favors the rule with the greatest output value.\n\nThe diagram below demonstrates max-min inferencing and centroid defuzzification for a system with input variables \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" and an output variable \"n\". Note that \"mu\" is standard fuzzy-logic nomenclature for \"truth value\":\n\nNotice how each rule provides a result as a truth value of a particular membership function for the output variable. In centroid defuzzification the values are OR'd, that is, the maximum value is used and values are not added, and the results are then combined using a centroid calculation.\n\nFuzzy control system design is based on empirical methods, basically a methodical approach to trial-and-error. The general process is as follows:\n\n\nAs a general example, consider the design of a fuzzy controller for a steam turbine. The block diagram of this control system appears as follows:\n\nThe input and output variables map into the following fuzzy set:\n\n—where:\n\nThe rule set includes such rules as:\n\nIn practice, the controller accepts the inputs and maps them into their membership functions and truth values. These mappings are then fed into the rules. If the rule specifies an AND relationship between the mappings of the two input variables, as the examples above do, the minimum of the two is used as the combined truth value; if an OR is specified, the maximum is used. The appropriate output state is selected and assigned a membership value at the truth level of the premise. The truth values are then defuzzified. \nFor an example, assume the temperature is in the \"cool\" state, and the pressure is in the \"low\" and \"ok\" states. The pressure values ensure that only rules 2 and 3 fire:\n\nThe two outputs are then defuzzified through centroid defuzzification: \nThe output value will adjust the throttle and then the control cycle will begin again to generate the next value .\n\nConsider implementing with a microcontroller chip a simple feedback controller:\n\nA fuzzy set is defined for the input error variable \"e\", and the derived change in error, \"delta\", as well as the \"output\", as follows:\n\nIf the error ranges from -1 to +1, with the analog-to-digital converter used having a resolution of 0.25, then the input variable's fuzzy set (which, in this case, also applies to the output variable) can be described very simply as a table, with the error / delta / output values in the top row and the truth values for each membership function arranged in rows beneath:\n\nSuppose this fuzzy system has the following rule base:\n\nThese rules are typical for control applications in that the antecedents consist of the logical combination of the error and error-delta signals, while the consequent is a control command output. \nThe rule outputs can be defuzzified using a discrete centroid computation:\n\nNow, suppose that at a given time we have: \n\nThen this gives:\n\nPlugging this into rule 1 gives:\n\n-- where:\n\n\nThe other rules give:\n\nThe centroid computation yields:\n\nIf you have problems figuring out the centroid equation, remember that a centroid is defined by summing all the moments (location times mass) around the center of gravity and equating the sum to zero. So if formula_4 is the center of gravity, formula_5 is the location of each mass, and formula_6 is each mass, this gives:\n\nIn our example, the values of mu correspond to the masses, and the values of X to location of the masses \n(mu, however, only 'corresponds to the masses' if the initial 'mass' of the output functions are all the same/equivalent. If they are not the same, i.e. some are narrow triangles, while others maybe wide trapizoids or shouldered triangles, then the mass or area of the output function must be known or calculated. It is this mass that is then scaled by mu and multiplied by its location X_i).\n\nThis system can be implemented on a standard microprocessor, but dedicated fuzzy chips are now available. For example, Adaptive Logic INC of San Jose, California, sells a \"fuzzy chip\", the AL220, that can accept four analog inputs and generate four analog outputs. A block diagram of the chip is shown below:\n\nAs a first example, consider an anti-lock braking system, directed by a microcontroller chip. The microcontroller has to make decisions based on brake temperature, speed, and other variables in the system.\n\nThe variable \"temperature\" in this system can be subdivided into a range of \"states\": \"cold\", \"cool\", \"moderate\", \"warm\", \"hot\", \"very hot\". The transition from one state to the next is hard to define.\n\nAn arbitrary static threshold might be set to divide \"warm\" from \"hot\". For example, at exactly 90 degrees, warm ends and hot begins. But this would result in a discontinuous change when the input value passed over that threshold. The transition wouldn't be smooth, as would be required in braking situations.\n\nThe way around this is to make the states \"fuzzy\". That is, allow them to change gradually from one state to the next. In order to do this there must be a dynamic relationship established between different factors.\n\nWe start by defining the input temperature states using \"membership functions\":\n\nWith this scheme, the input variable's state no longer jumps abruptly from one state to the next. Instead, as the temperature changes, it loses value in one membership function while gaining value in the next. In other words, its ranking in the category of cold decreases as it becomes more highly ranked in the warmer category.\n\nAt any sampled timeframe, the \"truth value\" of the brake temperature will almost always be in some degree part of two membership functions: i.e.: '0.6 nominal and 0.4 warm', or '0.7 nominal and 0.3 cool', and so on.\n\nThe above example demonstrates a simple application, using the abstraction of values from multiple values. This only represents one kind of data, however, in this case, temperature.\n\nAdding additional sophistication to this braking system, could be done by additional factors such as traction, speed, inertia, set up in dynamic functions, according to the designed fuzzy system.\n\nIn spite of the appearance there are several difficulties to give a rigorous logical interpretation of the \"IF-THEN\" rules. As an example, interpret a rule as \"IF (temperature is \"cold\") THEN (heater is \"high\")\" by the first order formula \"Cold(x)→High(y)\" and assume that r is an input such that \"Cold(r)\" is false. Then the formula \"Cold(r)→High(t)\" is true for any \"t\" and therefore any \"t\" gives a correct control given \"r\". A rigorous logical justification of fuzzy control is given in Hájek's book (see Chapter 7) where fuzzy control is represented as a theory of Hájek's basic logic. Also in Gerla 2005 another logical approach to fuzzy control is proposed based on fuzzy logic programming.Indeed, denote by \"f\" the fuzzy function arising of an IF-THEN systems of rules. Then we can translate this system into a fuzzy program P containing a series of rules whose head is \"Good(x,y)\". The interpretation of this predicate in the least fuzzy Herbrand model of P coincides with f. This gives further useful tools to fuzzy control.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8897883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8897883", "title": "GoTo (telescopes)", "text": "GoTo (telescopes)\n\nIn amateur astronomy, \"GoTo\" refers to a type of telescope mount and related software that can automatically point a telescope at astronomical objects that the user selects. Both axes of a GoTo mount are driven by a motor and controlled by a computer. It may be either a microprocessor-based integrated controller or an external personal computer. This differs from the single-axis semi-automated tracking of a traditional clock-drive equatorial mount. \n\nThe user can command the mount to point the telescope to the celestial coordinates that the user inputs, or to objects in a pre-programmed database including ones from the Messier catalogue, the New General Catalogue, and even major Solar System bodies (the Sun, Moon, and planets).\nLike a standard equatorial mount, equatorial GoTo mounts can track the night sky by driving the right ascension axis. Since both axes are computer controlled, GoTo technology also allows telescope manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler altazimuth mounts.\n\nGoTo mounts are \"pre-aligned\" before use. When it is powered on, it may ask for the user's latitude, longitude, time, and date. It can also get this data from a GPS receiver connected to the telescope or built into the telescope mount itself, and the mount controller can have its own real time clock.\n\nAlt-azimuth GoTo mounts need to be aligned on a known \"alignment star\", which the user will centre in the eyepiece. From the inputted time and location and the star's altitude and azimuth the telescope mount will know its orientation to the entire sky and can then find any object.\n\nFor accuracy purposes, a second alignment star, as far away as possible from the first and if possible close to the object to be observed, may be used. This is because the mount might not be level with the ground; this will cause the telescope to accurately point to objects close to the initial alignment star, but less accurately for an object on the other side of the sky.\n\nAn additional reason for using two alignment stars is that the time and location information entered by the user may not be accurate. For example, a one-degree inaccuracy in the latitude or a 4-minute inaccuracy in the time may result in the telescope pointing a degree away from the user's target.\n\nWhen the user selects an object from the mount's database, the object's altitude and azimuth will be computed from its right ascension and declination. Then, the mount will move the telescope to that altitude and azimuth and track the object so it remains in the field of view despite Earth's rotation. Moving to the location is called \"slewing\".\n\nWhen astrophotography is involved, a further motor has to be used to rotate the camera to match the field of view for long exposure photographs.\n\nFor an equatorial GoTo telescope mount, the user must align the mount by hand with either the north celestial pole or the south celestial pole. Assuming the user is accurate in the alignment, the mount points the telescope to a bright star, asking the user to center it in the eyepiece. Since the star's correct right ascension and declination is already known, the distance from what the user considered to be the celestial pole and the actual pole can be roughly deduced. Using another alignment star can further improve the accuracy of the alignment.\n\nAfter alignment the telescope mount will then know its orientation with respect to the night sky, and can point to any right-ascension and declination coordinates.\n\nWhen the user selects an object to view, the mount's software looks up the object's right ascension and declination and slews (moves) to those coordinates. To track the object so that it stays in the eyepiece despite Earth's rotation, only the right-ascension axis is moved.\n\n\n"}

He described this device in a book, \"The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman\". Newman alleged that he had a mechanical explanation for Albert Einstein's unified field theory of physics. After applying for patents on the perpetual motion motor, he battled for over seven years against what he claimed was a government conspiracy to suppress his supposed discoveries. As a result of this, he gained national attention.\n\nAfter Newman graduated from Baker High School in Mobile, Alabama, he joined the U.S. Air Force in 1955 to serve as an expediter, and was stationed at Ramey Air Force Base in Puerto Rico where he witnessed Hurricane Betsy devastate the island in 1956. The aftermath of the hurricane prompted Newman to make a pledge to God that he would devote the rest of his life to help humanity.\n\nAfter leaving the Air Force a year early on the G.I. Bill, Newman attended the University of Alabama, enrolling in economics and accounting courses. He left college after acquiring interest in inventing and not long after, was awarded patents for the first plastic barbells. After selling his barbell business, he had the capital \"to buy science books\" and began to study energy, electrical engineering, physics and electromagnetics.\n\nJoseph Newman applied for a patent on his \"energy machine\" in 1979, which was rejected by the US Patent and Trademark Office as a perpetual motion machine. From 1979 to 1986 he filed lawsuits against the patent office to force the award of his patent.\n\nThe Federal District Court ordered the machine turned over to the National Bureau of Standards for testing. The NBS also admitted the order to test was unusual saying: \"It's very unusual for us to be testing something for a patent.\" Matthew Heyman, a bureau spokesman, said, \"I'm not aware of us ever having been involved in a patent case before.\"\n\nNewman persuaded seven members of Congress to sponsor private bills on his behalf that would order the Patent Office to grant him a patent.\n\nThe NBS concluded that Newman's machine did not reach or exceed 100% efficiency as Newman claimed, and declared the patent as unrewardable.\n\nIn 1989 Newman claimed, while already married, to have married his secretary and her 8 year old daughter, acting on orders from God. The daughter was removed from his home by the authorities. In 1987 he announced a run for the American Presidency, claiming that God had instructed him to run in order that the extinction of humanity by 1999 might be averted, and that Nostradamus had predicted his existence.\n\nJon Fox directed a 2015 documentary film about Newman, entitled \"Newman\".

The key difference between Riemannian metrics and semi-Riemannian metrics is that the former arise from bundling positive-definite quadratic forms, whereas the latter arise from bundling indefinite quadratic forms.\n\nA four-dimensional semi-Riemannian manifold is often called a Lorentzian manifold, because these provide the mathematical setting for metric theories of gravitation such as general relativity.\n\nFor many topics in applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and engineering, it is important to be able to write the most important partial differential equations of mathematical physics\n(as well as variants of this basic triad) in various coordinate systems which are \"adapted\" to any symmetries which may be present. While this may be how many students first encounter a non-Cartesian coordinate chart, such as the cylindrical chart on E (three-dimensional Euclidean space), it turns out that these charts are useful for many other purposes, such as writing down interesting vector fields, congruences of curves, or frame fields in a convenient way.\n\nListing commonly encountered coordinate charts unavoidably involves some real and apparent overlap, for at least two reasons:\nTherefore, seemingly any attempt to organize them into a list involves multiple overlaps, which we have accepted in this list in order to be able to offer a convenient if messy reference.\n\nWe emphasize that \"this list is far from exhaustive\".\n\nHere are some charts which (with appropriate metric tensors) can be used in the stated classes of Riemannian and semi-Riemannian surfaces:\n\n\nHere are some charts on some of the most useful Riemannian surfaces (note that there is some overlap, since many charts of S have closely analogous charts on H; in such cases, both are discussed in the same article):\n\n\nFavorite semi-Riemannian surface:\n\n\"Note:\" the difference between these two surfaces is in a sense merely a matter of convention, according to whether we consider either the cyclic or the non-cyclic coordinate to be timelike; in higher dimensions the distinction is less trivial.\n\nHere are some charts which (with appropriate metric tensors) can be used in the stated classes of three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds:\n\n(\"Note:\" not every three manifold admits an isothermal chart.)\n\n\nHere are some charts which can be used on some of the most useful Riemannian three-manifolds:\n\n\n\nThere are of course many important and interesting examples of Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds which are not even mentioned here, including:\n\nIn addition, one can certainly consider coordinate charts on complex manifolds, perhaps with metrics which arise from bundling Hermitian forms.

{"id": "20256890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20256890", "title": "Metallurgy during the Copper Age in Europe", "text": "Metallurgy during the Copper Age in Europe\n\nThe Copper Age, also called the Eneolithic or the Chalcolithic Age, has been traditionally understood as a transitional period between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, in which a gradual introduction of the metal (native copper) took place, while stone was still the main resource utilized. Recent archaeology has found that the metal was not introduced so gradually and that this entailed significant social changes, such as developments in the type of habitation (larger villages, launching of fortifications), long-distance trade, and copper metallurgy.\n\nRoughly, the Copper Age could be situated chronologically between the 5th and 6th millennia BC in places like the archaeological sites of Majdanpek, Јarmovac and Pločnik (a copper axe from 5500 BC belonging to the Vinča culture). Somewhat later, in the 5th millennium BC, metalwork is attested at Rudna Glava mine in Serbia, and at Ai Bunar mine in Bulgaria.\n\n3rd millennium BC copper metalwork is attested in places like Palmela (Portugal), Cortes de Navarra (Spain), and Stonehenge (United Kingdom). However, as often happens with the prehistoric times, the limits of the age cannot be clearly defined and vary with different sources.\n\nThe theory that metallurgy was imported into Europe from the Near East has been practically ruled out. A second hypothesis, that there were two main points of origin of metallurgy in Europe, in southern Spain and in West Bulgaria, is also doubtful due to the existence of sites outside the centers of diffusion where metallurgy was known simultaneously with, or before, those in the ‘original’ nuclei, such as Brixlegg (Tyrol, Austria), while sites closer to the supposed origins of metallurgy, such as in the north of Spain, show fewer metal artifacts than sites in the south and practically no evidence of production (Perez Arrondo 1986).\n\nCurrently, the general opinion is that the development of metallurgy took place independently in different places, at different times, with various techniques. One fact that supports this interpretation is that, although the final products (beads, rings, sickles, swords, axes, etc.) are quite similar throughout Europe, the method of production is not. Thus the use of crucibles was the technique utilized in the south of Spain, whereas central Europe employed a slagging process, but Cabrierés (France) used a primitive oxidizing non-slagging process (Bourgarit, et al. 2003), while in the British Isles the absence of debris, slag or ceramic suggests another technique (Craddock 1995).\n\nConsequently, the way in which metallurgy was initiated differs considerably depending on the region. There are areas in which copper seems to play a crucial role (i.e., the Balkans), whereas other areas show no interest in it at all. Then there are societies that use copper artifacts but do not practice metallurgy (Mohen 1992; 71), and there are other ones that fully adopt some of the cultural innovations but ignore the rest. One example of the latter is Basque country in northern Spain, where splendid large dolmens are present along the Ebro river, but metal is rather infrequent, and when it does appear between the trapping, it is more often bronze or arsenical copper than copper (Cava 1984).\n\nCopper is the eighth most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, is available all over the world, and is one of the few that can appear in a pure state (Atkinson 1987). It is not complicated to work with, and a bare hammering can be enough to transform a nugget into a bead. The eye-catching look of native copper makes it easy to recognize, and even flashier if converted into jewelry, a possible motivation for humankind to start the metallurgy with it. An evolutive technological process (Coghlan 1975, Mohen 1992; 48) has been described, although there are authors like Javinovic (Mohen 1992; 52) who think that it is not necessary to pass through the first stages to reach the last one.\n\nTo start with, the raw material must be obtained. Copper can be found in over 160 different minerals (Atkinson 1987), but mining activities are entailed to obtain them in large quantities if a reasonable amount of copper is wanted. Some of the most commonly exploited minerals are cuprite, malachite, azurite, chalcopyrite, chrysocolla and tennantite; e.g. malachite was extracted in Rudna Glava (Serbia), Cabrierés (France) or Chinflón (Riotinto, Spain). In fact, one of the possible explanations about what \"Ötzi the Iceman\", the ancient mummy found in the Alps who lived around 3300 years BC, was doing at of altitude is that he could have been prospecting for new ores of minerals (Peroni 1996; 336).\n\nSecondly, the mineral is separated from the gangue. This is only possible by smelting or beneficiation. To do so, it is necessary to use a furnace that is able to reach at least .\n\nLastly, a wide range of specific tools and resources have to be available, such as furnaces, moulds, crucibles, mauls, etc.\n\n\nMinerals of copper were known from ancient times. In Crete, little fragments of malachite and azurite were powdered and used as make up or to decorate ceramic in an early date such as 6000 BC (Mohen 1992).\n\nTherefore, the minerals were not collected because people were looking for copper but for virtues like those mentioned or simply because of its brightness and colour, but this knowledge of the minerals is critical since they already knew how to recognize them and where to collect them when, later, they started the systematic search for ores.\n\nNumerous examples of mines are known all over Europe (Craddock 1980, Mohen 1992 and 1996, Shennan 1999, Bartelheim et al. 2003) from the east: Rudna Glava (Serbia), Ai Bunar (Bulgaria); to the west: Mount Gabriel (Ireland), Great Orme, Alderley Edge (United Kingdom); crossing Central Europe: Mitterberg (Salzach, Austria), Neuchâtel (Switzerland), Cabrierés (France); to the south: Riotinto, Mola Alta de Serelles (Spain); and the Mediterranean: Corsica, Cyprus, and the Cyclades islands. It is remarkable that, usually, it is not a single mine but a complex, with a variable, large number of mineshafts, as in Rudna Glava (30) or Mount Gabriel (31).\n\nThe techniques observed in all of them are quite similar. Basically they used the thermic alteration or firesetting (Mohen 1992, Craddock 1995, Eiroa et al. 1996, Timberlake 2003). This consists of applying fire to the rock and then pouring water over it: the rapid changes of temperature will cause cracks within the rocks that can be totally broken with the help of mauls and picks. Then the useful masses were selected, crushed and transported to the production centre that could be in the surrounding area (Mitterberg) or far away (Rudna Glava).\n\nThe mines were exploited in extremely efficient and clever ways, according to the technology available (Jovanovic 1980, Craddock 1995, Timberlake 2003). The entire convenient mineral was collected and the abandoned shafts carefully refilled with gangue and rocks (Mohen 1992; 85). For example, at Mount Gabriel, it was estimated that they extracted the astonishing number of of rock, gangue and ore. The usable amount of copper was 162.85 tonnes and the final smelting finished metal was 146.56 tonnes (Jackson 1980; 24). The entire process was thoroughly described in 1744 by Lewis Morris, Crown Mineral Agent for Cardiganshire, and, incidentally, antiquarian (Timberlake, 2003, 22):\n\nThe tools employed are mainly presented in Lewis' observations, but other ones have been recovered in archaeological context:\n\nThe information available about the people of the Copper Age has not substantially increased along with the number of archaeological sites. Several ideas have been proffered, one of the most followed is that the metal itself did not bring abrupt transformation into the people's life (Cunliffe 1998) or even more that \"‘early copper does not produce anything useful at all’\" (Renfrew 1986, 146), meaning with this that with the copper, they produced mainly jewellery and, overall, weapons that obviously were not within reach of the majority of the population but only to privileged individuals. In other words, the real importance of the metal is not utilitarian but social. This is a suitable explanation about the rising of Great Cultures of Metal such as Vinča culture (Ex-Yugoslavia) Tiszapolgar and Unetice culture (Central Europe), Remedello and Rinaldone (Italy), Montagne Noire (France), El Argar and Targas (Spain), etc.\nAs the period moved forward, especially around the 3rd millennium, new and complex realities would appear strongly linked to the metal, like the impressive fortified villages of Los Millares (Spain), Vila Nova de Sao Pedro (Portugal) or the more modest cairn next to Copa Hill (United Kingdom) apparently destinated to control the centres of extraction, or the equally stunning and generalized cultural phenomenons of Megalithism, Rock Art, Bell Beakers Vessels… that are known from Scandinavia to the South of Spain and from Scotland to Turkey.\n\n\n"}

Unlike Calnic C, NICMOSlook requires the user to determine the best way to find an object and provides a number of different ways to accomplish this. Similarly, the user decides whether to use a weighting appropriate for point sources or weighting by the size of the object for the extraction of the spectra.\n\n\"Calnic C\" is a non-interactive counterpart, a program that performs a subset of NICMOSlook's functions with a \"pipelined\" approach.

After the encounter with the Jovian system in 1979 and the Saturnian system in 1980, the primary mission was declared complete in November of the same year. \"Voyager 1\" was the first space probe to provide detailed images of the two largest planets and their major moons.\nThe spacecraft, still travelling at , is the most distant man-made object from Earth and the first one to leave the Solar System. Its mission has been extended and continues to this day, with the aim of investigating the boundaries of the Solar system, including the Kuiper belt, the heliosphere and interstellar space. Operating for as of today (), it receives routine commands and transmits data back to the Deep Space Network.\n\n\"Voyager 1\" was expected to work only through the Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed the idea of the space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He acknowledged that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for \"Voyager\"s cameras to make out any detail, but it would be meaningful as a perspective on our place in the universe.\n\nAlthough many in NASA's Voyager program were supportive of the idea, there were concerns that taking a picture of Earth so close to the Sun risked damaging the spacecraft's imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan's idea was put into practice, but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to \"Voyager 1\" were also being laid off or transferred to other projects. Finally, NASA Administrator Richard Truly interceded to ensure that the photograph was taken.\n\n\"Voyager 1\"s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) consisted of two cameras: a 200 mm focal length, low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500 mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took \"Pale Blue Dot\" – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras were of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel placed in front of the tube.\n\nThe challenge was that, as the mission progressed, the objects to be photographed would increasingly be farther away and would appear fainter, requiring longer exposures and slewing (panning) of the cameras to achieve acceptable quality. The telecommunication capability also diminished with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system. The series of commands were compiled and sent to Voyager, with the images executed on February 14, 1990.\n\nAfter taking the \"Family Portrait\" series of images, which included \"Pale Blue Dot\", NASA mission managers commanded \"Voyager 1\" to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft was not going to fly near anything else of significance for the rest of its mission, while other instruments that were still collecting data needed power for the long journey to interstellar space.\n\nThe design of the command sequence to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, the data from the camera were stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the \"Magellan\" and \"Galileo\" missions being given priority over the use of the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, \"Voyager 1\" returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling at the speed of light for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.\n\nThree of the frames received showed the Earth as a tiny point of light in empty space. Each frame had been taken using a different color filter: blue, green and violet, with exposure times of 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds respectively. The three frames were then recombined to produce the image that became \"Pale Blue Dot\".\nOf the 640,000 individual pixels that compose each frame, Earth takes up less than one (0.12 of a pixel, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight reflecting off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. \"Voyager's\" point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.\n\nThe pale blue color of the dot is the result of polarization and scattering of the light reflected from Earth. The polarization in turn depends on various factors such as cloud cover, exposed areas of oceans, forests, deserts, snow fields etc.\n\n\"Pale Blue Dot\", which was taken with the narrow-angle camera, was also published as part of a composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: \"Pale Blue Dot\" and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.\n\nAccording to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's HORIZONS tool, the distances between \"Voyager 1\" and the Earth on February 14 and May 15, 1990, were as follows:\n\nDuring a public lecture at Cornell University in 1994, Carl Sagan presented the image to the audience and shared his reflections on the deeper meaning behind the idea of the \"Pale Blue Dot\":\n\nSagan also titled his 1994 book \"\" after the photograph.\n\nIn 2015, NASA acknowledged the 25th anniversary of \"Pale Blue Dot\".\n\n\n\n"}

The magazine was launched in 2006.\n\nTFOT was founded by Iddo Genuth and co-founder Barak Raz in early 2006 and its beta version was first launched on the 27 of September 2006. During beta the site included two sections – Picture of the Day (PODs) and Articles. In mid-2007 TFOT launched its full version with several new sections and a new design. Its team has more than 20 writers, from various countries worldwide. As of 2013 TFOT has been running under a different management.\n\nAs of September 2008, TFOT had several sections including: headlines, news, PODs, personal columns, book reviews and forums. TFOT also includes full articles which typically contain a Q&A section which, according to TFOT, is a more accurate way of doing an interview. In January 2009 TFOT added a video section featuring science and technology related videos from the web as well as original video clips produced by the TFOT team. Another change in 2009 was the expansion of the daily RSS service, providing headlines from similar websites among the original research published in the website. Until then, a smaller number of headlines were uploaded each day.\n\nOn August 22, 2007 TFOT was the first to extensively cover the Israeli company Mempile TeraDisc 1TB optical storage technology. The article was later picked up by numerous websites including Engadget , tgdaily and arstechnica . On January 14, 2009 TFOT exclusively reported on advancements in laser hard drive development . This news was quickly picked up by several publications including Engadget and electronista .\n\nSince its launch in early 2008, TFOT's headlines section was criticized several times for being too short (approx 500 characters); this, however, is probably the result of copyright issues. A different criticism was raised regarding the relatively short term look at the future of science and technology on TFOT as the site typically deals with research and technology for the next 5–10 years or so.\n\n\n"}

S. Ramachandran that explores, from a neurological viewpoint, the uniqueness of human nature. Ramachandran explores various aspects of visual perception and cognition to argue that humans are unique among species. For example, he notes that although animals show cortical remapping after the loss of a limb, the plasticity seen in the human brain (after amputation) is much more dramatic.\n\nRamachandran discusses seven main concepts which define the human aspect of self and how each may be disrupted by a specific neurological disorder. The concepts are: unity, continuity, embodiment, privacy, social embedding, free-will, and self-awareness.\n\n\"Tell-Tale Brain\" was on the New York Times best-seller list (Number 32 on the Hardcover Nonfiction list) and received mostly highly positive with some exceptions. The book won the 2010 Vodafone Crossword Book Award (Non-Fiction).\n\nOliver Sacks writes “No one is better than V. S. Ramachandran at combining minute, careful observation with ingenious experiments and bold, adventurous theorizing. The Tell-Tale Brain is Ramachandran at his best, a profoundly intriguing and compelling guide to the intricacies of the human brain.”\n\nAllan Snyder, Director of the Center for the Mind, said that the books is: “A masterpiece. The best of its kind and beautifully crafted. Alluring story telling, building to a penetrating understanding of what it is to be uniquely human. Ramachandran is the foremost pioneer—the Galileo—of neurocognition.”\n\nNorman Doidge, M.D., author of The Brain That Changes Itself praised the book by saying:“Ramachandran is the modern wizard of neuroscience. In The Tell-Tale Brain, we see the genius at work, tackling extraordinary cases, many of which mark turning points in neuroscientific knowledge. We see him hypothesizing, experimenting, failing, having epiphanies, experimenting, succeeding. In this utterly entertaining account, we see how these fascinating cases fit together, and how he uses them to explain, from a Darwinian point of view, how our brains, though evolved from those of other animals, become neurologically distinct and fundamentally human.”\n\nIn the Sunday Times, James McConnachie writes: \"When VS Ramachandran, one of the world’s most influential neurologists, wants to get inside a human head, he doesn’t reach for his scalpel or MRI scanner. Instead, like Sherlock Holmes (to whom he is often compared), he seizes on an oddity in a case study, then begins a pleasing process of deduction interspersed with leaps of excitingly creative thought. This absorbing book charts the acclaimed experiments he has performed around the world and at the University of California’s cutting-edge Centre for the Brain, and explains how they have helped unravel the workings of the human mind.\"\n\nAllan Snyder, FRS, Director of the Centre for the Mind writes: “A masterpiece. The best of its kind and beautifully crafted. Alluring story telling, building to a penetrating understanding of what it is to be uniquely human. Ramachandran is the foremost pioneer—the Galileo—of neurocognition.\"\n\nIn his review for the American Scientist, Simon Baron-Cohen, Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at Cambridge University, said he found the book stimulating and enjoyable but questioned the validity of Ramachandran's views on the importance of mirror neurons. In particular, Baron-Cohen took issue with Ramachandran's well known prediction \"... that mirror neurons will do for psychology what DNA did for biology: they will provide a unifying framework and help explain a host of mental abilities that have hitherto remained mysterious and inaccessible to experiments.” Baron-Cohen stated \"Whether [Ramachandran] has overstated the importance of mirror neurons and will decide to retract this statement remains to be seen.\" Baron-Cohen, who is Director of the Autism Research Center at Cambridge University, pointed out that Ramachandran has failed to acknowledge the experimental evidence that contradicts his theory that dysfunctional mirror neurons play a significant role in autism. Baron-Cohen writes \"There are also clinical and experimental reasons for being skeptical of the broken-mirror theory of autism... As an explanation of autism, the [Broken Mirror] theory offers some tantalizing clues; however, some problematic counter-evidence challenges the theory and particularly its scope.\". Dr. Baron-Cohen, however, does not address numerous other chapters and ideas discussed in the book. Ramachandran himself, has noted (even in the Tell-Tale Brain) that the evidence for the Broken Mirror Theory of autism, is, at present, \"Compelling but not conclusive\".\n\nIn the New York Times, Anthony Gottlieb criticized Ramachandran for not mentioning that his ideas about the importance of mirror neurons are controversial:\n\n\"Although Ramachandran admits that his account of the significance of mirror neurons is speculative, he doesn’t let on just how controversial it is. In the past four years, a spate of studies has dented every part of the mirror-neuron story. Doubt has been cast on the idea that imitation and the understanding of actions depend on mirror neurons, and on the theory that autism involves a defect in these systems of cells. It has even been claimed that the techniques used to detect the activity of mirror neurons have been widely misinterpreted. Ramachandran may have good reason to discount these skeptical studies, but he surely should have mentioned them.\". However, in his footnotes, Ramachandran does in fact point out the controversy surrounding mirror neurons.\n\nNicholas Shakespeare, the well-known British writer, felt that Ramachandran did not fully engage the ideas presented in the book:\n\n\"Ramachandran wanders along intriguing neural pathways, pausing to investigate strange disorders, but he leaves the impression that he is an explorer who has yet to leave the coast. Further, he appears not fully to appreciate that the interior of this vast continent he is mapping may be at war. His book is intermittently fascinating, but is not important in the way of Iain McGilchrist The Master and His Emissary, last year’s magisterial study of the brain’s two opposed hemispheres, which it nicely (though unintentionally) complements – even to the extent of using some of the same illustrations.\"\n\nIn his review for the Wall Street Journal, Raymond Tallis, emeritus professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Manchester complained that Ramachandran has failed to provide the research needed to back up his theories:\n\n\"The trouble begins when the neurologist turns philosopher and tries to use these insights to get closer to \"what makes us human.\" He suggests that such cross-wiring underpins both humans' ability to enjoy metaphors and artists' capacity to create novel connections—an assertion that has scarcely any research to back it up. (What little has been done depends on laughably simplistic models of how metaphors and creativity really work.) Likewise, his explanation of how we became speaking animals has scarcely a toe-hold on empirical data.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "49289810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49289810", "title": "Timeline of pterosaur research", "text": "Timeline of pterosaur research\n\nThis timeline of pterosaur research is a chronologically ordered list of important fossil discoveries, controversies of interpretation, and taxonomic revisions of pterosaurs, the famed flying reptiles of the Mesozoic era. Although pterosaurs went extinct millions of years before humans evolved, humans have coexisted with pterosaur fossils for millennia. Before the development of paleontology as a formal science, these remains would have been interpreted through a mythological lens. Myths about thunderbirds told by the Native Americans of the modern western United States may have been influenced by observations of \"Pteranodon\" fossils. These thunderbirds were said to have warred with water monsters, which agrees well with the co-occurrence of \"Pteranodon\" and the ancient marine reptiles of the seaway over which it flew.\n\nThe formal study of pterosaurs began in the late 18th century when naturalist Cosimo Alessandro Collini of Mannheim, Germany published a description of an unusual animal with long arms, each bearing an elongated finger. He recognized that this long finger could support a membrane like that of a bat wing, but because the unnamed creature was found in deposits that preserve marine life he concluded that these strange arms were used as flippers. The creature was restudied again in the very early 19th century by French anatomist Georges Cuvier, who recognized both that the creature was a reptile and that its \"flippers\" were wings. He called the creature the \"Ptero-dactyle\", a name since revised to \"Pterodactylus\".\n\nAlthough Cuvier's interpretation later became the consensus, it was just one of many early interpretations of the creature and its relatives, including that they were bats, strange birds, or the primordial handiwork of Satan himself. Similar animals like the long-tailed \"Rhamphorhynchus\" and \"Gnathosaurus\" were soon discovered around Europe and it became obvious that earth was once home to a diverse group of flying reptiles. The British anatomist Sir Richard Owen dubbed this vanished order the Pterosauria. Soon after, he described Britain's own first pterosaur, \"Dimorphodon\". Later in the 19th century pterosaurs were discovered in North America as well, the first of which was a spectacular animal named \"Pteranodon\" by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh.\n\nVarious aspects of pterosaur biology invited controversy from the beginning. Samuel Thomas von Soemmering ignited a multi-century debate over how pterosaurs walked on the ground by suggesting they crawled on all fours like bats. August Quenstedt, by contrast, argued that they walked on their hind limbs. In the early 20th century, Hankin and Watson in the first major study of pterosaur flight biomechanics concluded that on the ground these reptiles were altogether helpless and could only scoot along on their stomachs like penguins. The debate gained steam in 1957 when William Stokes reported unusual tracks left by a four-footed animal he suspected was a pterosaur walking along the ground. In 1984, Kevin Padian, who had recently argued that pterosaurs walked on their hind legs, dismissed Stokes's tracks as those of a crocodilian. However, in the mid-1990s, Jean-Michel Mazin and others reported that fossil footprints in Crayssac, France were similar to those reported by Stokes from the US. Mazin's tracks were more obviously pterosaurian in origin and settled the debate in favor of pterosaurs walking on all fours.\n\nPterosaur paleontology continues to progress into the 21st century. In fact, according to David Hone the early 21st century has seen more progress in pterosaur paleontology than in \"the preceding two centuries\" combined. He compared this transformative period in pterosaur paleontology to the Dinosaur Renaissance of the 1970s. He also observed that roughly one-third of known pterosaurs were discovered during this brief interval. One of the most notable of these was \"Darwinopterus\", whose body resembled the more primitive long-tailed \"rhamphorynchoids\", while its skull resembled those of the more advanced short-tailed pterodactyloids. These traits establish the species as an important transitional form, documenting one of the most important phases of pterosaur evolution. Another important new species is \"Faxinalipterus minima\", which might well be the world's oldest pterosaur. The first confirmed pterosaur eggs were also reported from China during the early 21st century.\n\n\n\n1784\n\n1801\n\n1802\n\n\n1807\n\n\n1809\n\n1812\n\n\n1817\n\n1824\n\n\nc. 1825\n\n1827\n\n1829\n\n1830\n\n1831\n\n1832\n\n1833\n\n1834\n\n1836\n1839\n\n1840\n\n1842\n\n1843\n\n1847\n\n1851\n\n1855\n1855\n\n1856\n\n1859\n\n1859 – 1860\n\n1860\n\n1861\n\n1862\n\n1863\n\n1869\n\n1870\n\n\n\"November, late\"\n\n\"November – December 31st\"\n\n\n1871\n\n\n1872\n\n\"March 7th\"\n\n\"March 12th\"\n\n\"March 12th – December 31st\"\n\n1874\n\n1875\n\n1876\n\n\"May\"\n\n\n\"May – December 31st\"\n\n1877\n\n\n1881\n\n\n1882\n\n\n1884\n\n1886\n\n\n1887\n\n1888\n\n1891\n\n\n1892\n\nIn this paper Williston also described a new, relatively complete \"Nyctosaurus\" specimen.
