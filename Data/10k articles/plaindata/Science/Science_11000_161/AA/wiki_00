Teledyne Ryan (acquired by Northrop Grumman in 1999) was granted a development contract for the ADM-160A in 1996, and the first test flight took place in 1999. The evaluation program was finished by 2001.\n\nThe US Air Force planned to acquire several thousand of ADM-160A's, but in 2001 this was reduced to at most 150 for a System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program. In January 2002, the USAF cancelled the program because the drone didn't have enough range and endurance to meet the service's requirements or to perform other missions.\n\nThe ADM-160A carries a Signature Augmentation Subsystem (SAS) which is composed of various active radar enhancers which cover a range of frequencies. The SAS can therefore simulate any aircraft, from the B-52 Stratofortress to the F-117 Nighthawk.\n\nThe missile has folded wings to allow more compact carriage. On launch the wings unfold and a TJ-50 turbojet propels the missile on a pre-determined course which is composed of up to 100 different waypoints. An inertial navigation system with GPS support keeps the MALD on course. Although pre-programmed before the aircraft leaves the ground, the course can be modified by the pilot at any point up to launch.\n\nIn 2002, the USAF renewed its interest in an air-launched decoy and started a new industry-wide competition for a variant with greater endurance. The contract for a new MALD was awarded to Raytheon in Spring 2003.\n\nThe Raytheon ADM-160B is similar in configuration to the ADM-160A, but has a trapezoidal fuselage cross section and is larger and heavier. It is powered by a Hamilton Sundstrand TJ-150, a more powerful variant of the TJ-50.\n\nThe first ADM-160B was delivered in Spring 2009. In 2010 an \"operationally significant quantity\" of the drones were delivered to the Air Force. The USAF currently plans to procure about 1,500.\n\nIn 2008 a contract for a jamming variant MALD-J was awarded to Raytheon. It made its first freefall test in 2009 and passed its critical design review in early 2010. The first MALD-J was delivered to the Air Force on September 6, 2012. On September 24, Raytheon started operational testing, achieving four successful flights out of four launches. In April 2015, the MALD-J completed operational testing, satisfying all requirements in 42 flight tests over the last two years.\n\nIn November 2012, Raytheon completed ground verification tests for the MALD and MALD-J for integration onto the MQ-9 Reaper UAV. Integration onto the aircraft was expected sometime in 2013, with the goal for an unmanned suppression of enemy air defenses capability. The company has also explored integration onto the smaller MQ-1 Predator and U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle.\n\nIn June 2013, Raytheon completed a four-year development program of the MALD, under budget. The MALD and MALD-J successfully completed all 30 engineering and operational flight tests, with each version completing 15. The Air Force has cleared the B-model MALD for export.\n\nIn May 2014, Raytheon delivered the 1,000th MALD-J to the Air Force as part of the Lot 5 production contract. The MALD program has achieved a perfect 33-for-33 flight test success record over the past two years.\n\nIn December 2014, a MALD-J was test-flown with a radio data-link to expand situational awareness and allow for in-flight targeting adjustments. While carrying out a jamming mission, the MALD-J was able to send situation awareness data to the EW Battle Manager, which used the information to adjust its mission while in-flight.\n\nIn July 2015, Raytheon revealed it had developed a new composite missile body for the MALD-J in partnership with Fokker Aerostructures and Italian race car manufacturer Dallara that is 25 percent cheaper to produce; Fokker adapted robotics to wind the carbon fiber fuselage instead of the conventional manual process and Dallara applied its lightweight structural technologies to airframe accessories such as air inlets and covers. The new cheaper airframe design was first incorporated into Lot 7 production models in 2015, from the contract awarded in June 2014.\n\nThe Naval Surface Warfare Center will place an order for the MALD-J.\n\nSystems integration has been announced as of July 6, 2012, by the Raytheon Corp. for the U.S. Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The process included a series of risk reduction activities and technology demonstrations.\n\nOn 9 September 2015, Raytheon and the Naval Research Lab announced they had demonstrated a new rapid-replacement, modular architecture for the MALD-J for electronic warfare payloads. Four payloads, each customized for a specific mission and threat, were demonstrated in 12 captive carry flights; the payloads could be swapped out of a captive carry vehicle in less than one minute.\n\nIn July 2016, Raytheon received a contract to develop an evolution of the MALD-J called the MALD-X, incorporating an improved electronic warfare payload, the ability to fly at low-altitude, and an enhanced net-enabled data-link. The company hopes to transition the MALD-X into the MALD-N for the U.S. Navy.\n\nThe British Ministry of Defence expressed interest on the MALD-V platform at the Paris Airshow in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article contains material that originally came from the web article \"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\" by Greg Goebel, which exists in the Public Domain.\n\n"}

Unlike a current-measuring galvanometer, the moving part has a large moment of inertia, thus giving it a long oscillation period. It is really an integrator measuring the quantity of charge discharged through it. It can be either of the moving coil or moving magnet type.\n\nBefore first use the ballistic constant of the galvanometer must be determined. This is usually done by connecting to the galvanometer a known capacitor, charged to a known voltage, and recording the deflection. The constant K is calculated from the capacitance C, the voltage V and the deflection d:\nformula_1\n\nwhere K is expressed in coulombs per centimeter.\n\nIn operation the unknown quantity of charge Q (in coulombs) is simply: \nformula_2.\n\nAn interesting form of ballistic galvanometer is the Grassot fluxmeter. In order to operate correctly, the discharge time through the regular ballistic galvanometer must be shorter than the period of oscillation. For some applications, especially those involving inductors, this condition cannot be met. The Grassot fluxmeter solves this. Its construction is similar to that of a ballistic galvanometer, but its coil is suspended without any restoring forces in the suspension thread or in the current leads. The core (bobbin) of the coil is of a non-conductive material. When an electric charge is connected to the instrument, the coil starts moving in the magnetic field of the galvanometer's magnet, generating an opposing electromotive force and coming to a stop regardless of the time of the current flow. The change in the coil position is proportional only to the quantity of charge. The coil is returned to the zero position manually or by reversing the direction of the current.\n\n"}

{"id": "313565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313565", "title": "Cognitivism (psychology)", "text": "Cognitivism (psychology)\n\nIn psychology, cognitivism is a theoretical framework for understanding the mind that gained credence in the 1950s. The movement was a response to behaviorism, which cognitivists said neglected to explain cognition. Cognitive psychology derived its name from the Latin \"cognoscere\", referring to knowing and information, thus cognitive psychology is an information-processing psychology derived in part from earlier traditions of the investigation of thought and problem solving.\n\nBehaviorists acknowledged the existence of thinking, but identified it as a behavior. Cognitivists argued that the way people think impacts their behavior and therefore cannot be a behavior in and of itself. Cognitivists later argued that thinking is so essential to psychology that the study of thinking should become its own field. However, cognitivists typically presuppose a specific form of mental activity, of the kind advanced by computationalism.\n\nThe process of assimilating and expanding our intellectual horizon is termed as cognitive development. We have a complex physiological structure that absorbs a variety of stimuli from the environment, stimuli being the interactions which are able to produce knowledge and skills. Parents process knowledge informally in the home while teachers process knowledge formally in school. Knowledge should be pursued with zest and zeal; if not, then learning becomes a burden.\n\nAttention is the first part of cognitive development. Learning takes place when the student gives attention towards the teacher. Interest and effort closely relate to attention. Attention is an active process which involves numerous outside stimuli. The attention of an organism at any point in time involves three concentric circles; beyond awareness, margin, and focus.\n\nCognitive theory mainly stresses the acquisition of knowledge and growth of the mental structure. Cognitive theory tends to focus on conceptualizing the student's learning process: how information is received; how information is processed and organized into existing schema; how information is retrieved upon recall. In other words, cognitive theory seeks to explain the process of knowledge acquisition and the subsequent effects on the mental structures within the mind. Learning is not about the mechanics of what a learner does, but rather a process depending on what the learner already knows (existing information) and their method of acquiring new knowledge (how they integrate new information into their existing schemas). Knowledge acquisition is an activity consisting of internal codification of mental structures within the student's mind. Inherent to the theory, the student must be an active participant in their own learning process. Cognitive approaches mainly focus on the mental activities of the learner like mental planning, goal setting, and organizational strategies (Shell, 1980).\nIn cognitive theories not only the environmental factors and instructional components play an important role in learning. There are additional key elements like learning to code, transform, rehearse, and store and retrieve the information. Learning process includes learner’s thoughts, beliefs, and attitude values(Winna, 1988).\n\nMemory plays a vital role in the learning process. Information is stored within memory in an organised, meaningful manner. Here, teacher and designers play different roles in the learning process. Teachers supposedly facilitate learning and the organization of information in an optimal way. Whereas designers supposedly use advanced techniques (such as analogies and hierarchical relationships) to help learners acquire new information to add to their prior knowledge. Forgetting is described as an inability to retrieve information from memory. Memory loss may be a mechanism used to discard situationally irrelevant information by assessing the relevance of newly acquired information.\n\nAccording to cognitive theory, if a learner knows how to implement knowledge in different contexts and conditions then we can say that transfer has occurred. (Schunk, 1991) Understanding is composed of knowledge - in the form of rules, concepts and discrimination (Duffy and Jonassen, 1991). Knowledge stored in memory is important, but the use of such knowledge is also important. Prior knowledge will be used for identifying similarities and differences between itself and novel information.\n\nCognitive theory mostly explains complex forms of learning in terms of reasoning, problem solving and information processing (Schunk, 1991). Emphasis must be placed on the fact that the goal of all aforementioned viewpoints is considered to be the same - the transfer of knowledge to the student in the most efficient and effective manner possible (Bednar et al., 1991). Simplification and standardization are two techniques used to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer. Knowledge can be analysed, decomposed and simplified into basic building blocks. There is a correlation with the behaviorist model of the knowledge transfer environment. Cognitivists stress the importance of efficient processing strategies.\n\nA behaviorist uses feedback (reinforcement) to change the behavior in the desired direction, while the cognitivist uses the feedback for guiding and supporting the accurate mental connections (Thomson, Simon son. & Hargrave, 1992).\nFor different reasons learners' task analyzers are critical to both cognitivists and behaviorists. Cognitivists look at the learner's predisposition to learning (How does the learner activate, maintain and direct his/her learning?) (Thompson et . al., 1992). Additionally, cognitivists examine the learner's 'how to design' instruction that it can be assimilated. (i. e ., what about the learners existing mental structures?) In contrast, the behaviorists look at learners how to determine where the lesson should begin (i. e., At what level the learners are performing successfully?) and what are the most effective reinforcements (i.e., What are the consequences that are most desired by the learner?).\n\nThere are some specific assumptions or principles that direct the instructional design: active involvement of the learner in the learning process, learner control, meta cognitive training (e.g., self-planning, monitoring and revising techniques), the use of hierarchical analyses to identify and illustrate prerequisite relationships (cognitive task analysis procedure), facilitating optimal processing of structuring, organizing and sequencing information (use of cognitive strategies such as outlining, summaries, synthesizers, advance organizers etc.), encouraging the students to make connections with previously learned material, and creating learning environments (recall of prerequisite skills; use of relevant examples, analogies).\n\nCognitive theories emphasize mainly on making knowledge meaningful and helping learners to organizing relate new information to existing knowledge in memory . Instruction should be based on students existing schema or mental structures, to be effective. The organisation of information is connected in such a manner that it should relate to the existing knowledge in some meaningful way. The examples of cognitive strategy are Analogies metaphors. The other cognitive strategies includes the use of framing, outlining the mnemonics, concept mapping, advance organizers and so forth ( West, Farmer, and Wolff,1991). The cognitive theory mainly emphasizes the major tasks of the teacher / designer and includes analyzing that various learning experiences to the learning situation which can impact learning outcomes of different individuals.\nOrganizing and structuring the new information to connect the learners previously acquired knowledge abilities and experiences.\nThe new information is effectively and efficiently assimilated/accommodated within the learners cognitive structure (Stepich and Newby, 1988 ).\n\nCognitivism has two major components, one methodological, the other theoretical. Methodologically, cognitivism adopts a positivist approach and the belief that psychology can be (in principle) fully explained by the use of the scientific method. This is also largely a reductionist goal, with the belief that individual components of mental function (the 'cognitive architecture') can be identified and meaningfully understood. The second is the belief that cognition consists of discrete, internal mental states (representations or symbols) whose manipulation can be described in terms of rules or algorithms..\n\nCognitivism became the dominant force in psychology in the late-20th century, replacing behaviorism as the most popular paradigm for understanding mental function. Cognitive psychology is not a wholesale refutation of behaviorism, but rather an expansion that accepts that mental states exist. This was due to the increasing criticism towards the end of the 1950s of simplistic learning models. One of the most notable criticisms was Chomsky's argument that language could not be acquired purely through conditioning, and must be at least partly explained by the existence of internal mental states.\n\nThe main issues that interest cognitive psychologists are the inner mechanisms of human thought and the processes of knowing. Cognitive psychologists have attempted to shed some light on the alleged mental structures that stand in a causal relationship to our physical actions.\n\nIn the 1990s, various new theories emerged and challenged cognitivism and the idea that thought was best described as computation. Some of these new approaches, often influenced by phenomenological and postmodern philosophy, include situated cognition, distributed cognition, dynamicism, embodied cognition. Some thinkers working in the field of artificial life (for example Rodney Brooks) have also produced non-cognitivist models of cognition. On the other hand, much of early cognitive psychology, and the work of many currently active cognitive psychologists does not treat cognitive processes as computational.\nThe idea that mental functions can be described as information processing models has been criticised by philosopher John Searle and mathematician Roger Penrose who both argue that computation has some inherent shortcomings which cannot capture the fundamentals of mental processes. \n\nAnother argument against cognitivism is the problems of Ryle's Regress or the homunculus fallacy. Cognitivists have offered a number of arguments attempting to refute these attacks.\n\n"}

The value of the electron magnetic moment is approximately .\nThe electron magnetic moment has been measured to an accuracy of 7.6 parts in 10.\n\nThe electron is a charged particle of charge −1\"e\", where \"e\" is the unit of elementary charge. Its angular momentum comes from two types of rotation: spin and orbital motion. From classical electrodynamics, a rotating electrically charged body creates a magnetic dipole with magnetic poles of equal magnitude but opposite polarity. This analogy holds as an electron indeed behaves like a tiny bar magnet. One consequence is that an external magnetic field exerts a torque on the electron magnetic moment depending on its orientation with respect to the field.\n\nIf the electron is visualized as a classical charged particle literally rotating about an axis with angular momentum L, its magnetic dipole moment μ is given by\n\nwhere \"m\" is the electron rest mass. Note that the angular momentum L in this equation may be the spin angular momentum, the orbital angular momentum, or the total angular momentum. It turns out that the classical result is off by a proportional factor for the spin magnetic moment. As a result, the classical result is corrected by multiplying it with a dimensionless correction factor \"g\", known as the g-factor:\n\nIt is usual to express the magnetic moment in terms of the reduced Planck constant \"ħ\" and the Bohr magneton \"μ\":\n\nSince the magnetic moment is quantized in units of \"μ\", correspondingly the angular momentum is quantized in units of \"ħ\".\n\nClassical notions such as the center of charge and mass are, however, hard to make precise for a quantum elementary particle. In practice the definition used by experimentalists comes from the form factors formula_4 \nappearing in the matrix element \n\nof the electromagnetic current operator between two on-shell states. Here formula_6 and formula_7 are 4-spinor solution of the Dirac equation normalized so that formula_8, and formula_9 is the momentum transfer from the current to the electron. The formula_10 form factor formula_11 is the electron's charge, formula_12 is its static magnetic dipole moment, and formula_13 provides the formal definion of the electron's electric dipole moment. The remaining form factor formula_14 would, if non zero, be the anapole moment.\n\nThe spin magnetic moment is intrinsic for an electron. It is\n\nHere S is the electron spin angular momentum. The spin g-factor is approximately two: \"g\" ≈ 2. The magnetic moment of an electron is approximately twice what it should be in classical mechanics. The factor of two implies that the electron appears to be twice as effective in producing a magnetic moment as the corresponding classical charged body.\n\nThe spin magnetic dipole moment is approximately one \"μ\" because and the electron is a spin-1/2 particle ():\n\nThe \"z\" component of the electron magnetic moment is\n\nwhere \"m\" is the spin quantum number. Note that μ is a \"negative\" constant multiplied by the spin, so the magnetic moment is \"antiparallel\" to the spin angular momentum.\n\nThe spin g-factor comes from the Dirac equation, a fundamental equation connecting the electron's spin with its electromagnetic properties. Reduction of the Dirac equation for an electron in a magnetic field to its non-relativistic limit yields the Schrödinger equation with a correction term, which takes account of the interaction of the electron's intrinsic magnetic moment with the magnetic field giving the correct energy.\n\nFor the electron spin, the most accurate value for the spin g-factor has been experimentally determined to have the value\n\nNote that it is only two thousandths larger than the value from the Dirac equation. The small correction is known as the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron; it arises from the electron's interaction with virtual photons in quantum electrodynamics. In fact, one famous triumph of the quantum electrodynamics theory is the accurate prediction of the electron g-factor. The most accurate value for the electron magnetic moment is\n\nThe revolution of an electron around an axis through another object, such as the nucleus, gives rise to the orbital magnetic dipole moment. Suppose that the angular momentum for the orbital motion is L. Then the orbital magnetic dipole moment is\n\nHere \"g\" is the electron orbital g-factor and \"μ\" is the Bohr magneton. The value of \"g\" is exactly equal to one, by a quantum-mechanical argument analogous to the derivation of the classical gyromagnetic ratio\n\nThe total magnetic dipole moment resulting from both spin and orbital angular momenta of an electron is related to the total angular momentum J by a similar equation:\n\nThe g-factor \"g\" is known as the Landé g-factor, which can be related to \"g\" and \"g\" by quantum mechanics. See Landé g-factor for details.\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, an electron occupying the atomic orbital Ψ, the magnetic dipole moment is given by\n\nHere L is the orbital angular momentum, \"n\", \"ℓ\" and \"m\" are the principal, azimuthal and magnetic quantum numbers respectively.\nThe \"z\" component of the orbital magnetic dipole moment for an electron with a magnetic quantum number \"m\" is given by\n\nThe necessity of introducing half-integral spin goes back experimentally to the results of the Stern–Gerlach experiment. A beam of atoms is run through a strong non-uniform magnetic field, which then splits into \"N\" parts depending on the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms. It was found that for silver atoms, the beam was split in two—the ground state therefore could not be integral, because even if the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms were as small as possible, 1, the beam would be split into 3 parts, corresponding to atoms with \"L\" = −1, 0, and +1. The conclusion is that silver atoms have net intrinsic angular momentum of . Pauli set up a theory which explained this splitting by introducing a two-component wave function and a corresponding correction term in the Hamiltonian, representing a semi-classical coupling of this wave function to an applied magnetic field, as so:\n\nHere A is the magnetic potential and \"ϕ\" the electric potential, both representing the electromagnetic field, and σ = (\"σ\", \"σ\", \"σ\") are the Pauli matrices. On squaring out the first term, a residual interaction with the magnetic field is found, along with the usual classical Hamiltonian of a charged particle interacting with an applied field:\n\nThis Hamiltonian is now a 2 × 2 matrix, so the Schrödinger equation based on it must use a two-component wave function. Pauli had introduced the 2 × 2 sigma matrices as pure \"phenomenology\"— Dirac now had a \"theoretical argument\" that implied that spin was somehow the consequence of incorporating relativity into quantum mechanics. On introducing the external electromagnetic 4-potential into the Dirac equation in a similar way, known as minimal coupling, it takes the form (in natural units \"ħ\" = \"c\" = 1)\n\nwhere formula_25 are the gamma matrices (known as Dirac matrices) and \"i\" is the imaginary unit. A second application of the Dirac operator will now reproduce the Pauli term exactly as before, because the spatial Dirac matrices multiplied by \"i\", have the same squaring and commutation properties as the Pauli matrices. What is more, the value of the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron, standing in front of Pauli's new term, is explained from first principles. This was a major achievement of the Dirac equation and gave physicists great faith in its overall correctness. The Pauli theory may be seen as the low energy limit of the Dirac theory in the following manner. First the equation is written in the form of coupled equations for 2-spinors with the units restored:\n\nso\n\nAssuming the field is weak and the motion of the electron non-relativistic, we have the total energy of the electron approximately equal to its rest energy, and the momentum reducing to the classical value,\n\nand so the second equation may be written\n\nwhich is of order \"v/c\" - thus at typical energies and velocities, the bottom components of the Dirac spinor in the standard representation are much suppressed in comparison to the top components. Substituting this expression into the first equation gives after some rearrangement\n\nThe operator on the left represents the particle energy reduced by its rest energy, which is just the classical energy, so we recover Pauli's theory if we identify his 2-spinor with the top components of the Dirac spinor in the non-relativistic approximation. A further approximation gives the Schrödinger equation as the limit of the Pauli theory. Thus the Schrödinger equation may be seen as the far non-relativistic approximation of the Dirac equation when one may neglect spin and work only at low energies and velocities. This also was a great triumph for the new equation, as it traced the mysterious \"i\" that appears in it, and the necessity of a complex wave function, back to the geometry of space-time through the Dirac algebra. It also highlights why the Schrödinger equation, although superficially in the form of a diffusion equation, actually represents the propagation of waves.\n\nIt should be strongly emphasized that this separation of the Dirac spinor into large and small components depends explicitly on a low-energy approximation. The entire Dirac spinor represents an \"irreducible\" whole, and the components we have just neglected to arrive at the Pauli theory will bring in new phenomena in the relativistic regime - antimatter and the idea of creation and annihilation of particles.\n\nIn a general case (if a certain linear function of electromagnetic field does not vanish identically), three out of four components of the spinor function in the Dirac equation can be algebraically eliminated, yielding an equivalent fourth-order partial differential equation for just one component. Furthermore, this remaining component can be made real by a gauge transform.\n\nThe existence of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron has been detected experimentally by magnetic resonance method. This allows the determination of hyperfine splitting of electron shell energy levels in atoms of protium and deuterium using the measured resonance frequency for several transitions.\n\nThe magnetic moment of the electron has been measured using a one-electron quantum cyclotron and quantum nondemolition spectroscopy. The spin frequency of the electron is determined by the g-factor.\n\nformula_31\n\nformula_32\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48103", "title": "Gödel, Escher, Bach", "text": "Gödel, Escher, Bach\n\nGödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, also known as GEB, is a 1979 book by Douglas Hofstadter. \nBy exploring common themes in the lives and works of logician Kurt Gödel, artist M. C. Escher, and composer Johann Sebastian Bach, the book expounds concepts fundamental to mathematics, symmetry, and intelligence. Through illustration and analysis, the book discusses how, through self-reference and formal rules, systems can acquire meaning despite being made of \"meaningless\" elements. It also discusses what it means to communicate, how knowledge can be represented and stored, the methods and limitations of symbolic representation, and even the fundamental notion of \"meaning\" itself.\n\nIn response to confusion over the book's theme, Hofstadter emphasized that \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" is not about the relationships of mathematics, art, and music—but rather about how cognition emerges from hidden neurological mechanisms. One point in the book presents an analogy about how individual neurons in the brain coordinate to create a unified sense of a coherent mind by comparing it to the social organization displayed in a colony of ants.\n\nThe tagline \"a metaphorical fugue on minds and machines in the spirit of Lewis Carroll\" was used by the publisher to describe the book.\n\n\"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" takes the form of interweaving narratives. The main chapters alternate with dialogues between imaginary characters, usually Achilles and the tortoise, first used by Zeno of Elea and later by Lewis Carroll in \"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\". These origins are related in the first two dialogues, and later ones introduce new characters such as the Crab. These narratives frequently dip into self-reference and metafiction.\n\nWord play also features prominently in the work. Puns are occasionally used to connect ideas, such as \"the Magnificrab, Indeed\" with Bach's \"Magnificat in D\"; \"SHRDLU, Toy of Man's Designing\" with Bach's \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\"; and \"Typographical Number Theory\", or \"TNT\", which inevitably reacts explosively when it attempts to make statements about itself. One dialogue contains a story about a genie (from the Arabic \"Djinn\") and various \"tonics\" (of both the liquid and musical varieties), which is titled \"Djinn and Tonic\".\n\nOne dialogue in the book is written in the form of a crab canon, in which every line before the midpoint corresponds to an identical line past the midpoint. The conversation still makes sense due to uses of common phrases that can be used as either greetings or farewells (\"Good day\") and the positioning of lines that double as an answer to a question in the next line. Another is a sloth canon, where one character repeats the lines of another, but slower and negated.\n\nThe book contains many instances of recursion and self-reference, where objects and ideas speak about or refer back to themselves. One is Quining, a term Hofstadter invented in homage to Willard Van Orman Quine, referring to programs that only produce their own source code. Another is the presence of a fictional author in the index, Egbert B. Gebstadter, a man with initials E, G, and B and a surname that partially matches Hofstadter. A phonograph dubbed \"Record Player X\" destroys itself by playing a record titled \"I Cannot Be Played on Record Player X\" (an analogy to Gödel's incompleteness theorems), an examination of canon form in music, and a discussion of Escher's lithograph of two hands drawing each other. To describe such self-referencing objects, Hofstadter coins the term \"strange loop\"—a concept he examines in more depth in his follow-up book \"I Am a Strange Loop\". To escape many of the logical contradictions brought about by these self-referencing objects, Hofstadter discusses Zen koans. He attempts to show readers how to perceive reality outside their own experience and embrace such paradoxical questions by rejecting the premise—a strategy also called \"unasking\".\n\nElements of computer science such as call stacks are also discussed in \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\", as one dialogue describes the adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise as they make use of \"pushing potion\" and \"popping tonic\" involving entering and leaving different layers of reality. Subsequent sections discuss the basic tenets of logic, self-referring statements, (\"typeless\") systems, and even programming. Hofstadter further creates BlooP and FlooP, two simple programming languages, to illustrate his point.\n\nThe book is filled with puzzles, such as Hofstadter's MU puzzle. For example, the chapter titled \"Contracrostipunctus\" combines the words \"acrostic\" and \"contrapunctus\" (counterpoint). In a dialogue between Achilles and the Tortoise, the author hints that there is a contrapunctal acrostic in the chapter that refers both to the author (Hofstadter) and Bach. This can be found by taking the first word of each paragraph, to reveal: Hofstadter's Contracrostipunctus Acrostically Backwards Spells 'J. S. Bach'. The second acrostic is found by taking the first letters of the first (in bold) and reading them backwards to get \"J. S. Bach\" (just as the first acrostic claims).\n\n\"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" won the Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction and the National Book Award for Science. Martin Gardner's July 1979 column in Scientific American stated, \"Every few decades, an unknown author brings out a book of such depth, clarity, range, wit, beauty and originality that it is recognized at once as a major literary event.\"\n\nFor Summer 2007, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created an online course for high school students built around the book.\n\nIn its February 19, 2010 investigative summary on the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation suggested that Bruce Edwards Ivins was inspired by the book to hide secret codes based upon nucleotide sequences in the anthrax-laced letters he allegedly sent in September and October 2001, using bold letters, as suggested on page 404 of the book. It was also suggested that he attempted to hide the book from investigators by throwing it in the trash.\n\nHofstadter claims the idea of translating his book \"never crossed [his] mind\" when he was writing it—but when his publisher brought it up, he was \"very excited about seeing [the] book in other languages, especially… French.\" He knew, however, that \"there were a million issues to consider\" when translating, since the book relies not only on word-play, but on \"structural puns\" as well—writing where the form and content of the work mirror each other (such as the \"Crab canon\" dialogue, which reads almost exactly the same forwards as backwards).\n\nHofstadter gives an example of translation trouble in the paragraph \"Mr. Tortoise, Meet Madame Tortue\", saying translators \"instantly ran headlong into the conflict between the feminine gender of the French noun \"tortue\" and the masculinity of my character, the Tortoise.\" Hofstadter agreed to the translators' suggestions of naming the French character \"Madame Tortue\", and the Italian version \"Signorina Tartaruga\". Because of other troubles translators might have retaining meaning, Hofstadter \"painstakingly went through every sentence of \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\", annotating a copy for translators into any language that might be targeted.\"\n\nTranslation also gave Hofstadter a way to add new meaning and puns. For instance, in Chinese, the subtitle is not a translation of \"an Eternal Golden Braid\", but a seemingly unrelated phrase \"Jí Yì Bì\" (集异璧, literally \"collection of exotic jades\"), which is homophonic to \"GEB\" in Chinese. Some material regarding this interplay is in Hofstadter's later book, \"Le Ton beau de Marot\", which is mainly about translation.\n\n"}

Methods of calculation and presentation of unemployment rate vary from country to country.\nSome countries count insured unemployed only, some count those in receipt of welfare benefit only, some count the disabled and other permanently unemployable people, some countries count those who choose (and are financially able) not to work, supported by their spouses and caring for a family, some count students at college and so on. There may also be differences in the minimum requirements and some consider people employed even if only marginally associated with employment market (for example, working only one hour per week). There can be differences in the age limit. For example, Eurostat uses 15 to 74 years old when calculating unemployment rate, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses anyone 16 years of age or older (in both cases, people who are under education, retired, on maternity/paternity leave, prevented from working due to health, or do not work but have been inactive in seeking employment in the last four weeks are excluded from the workforce, and therefore not counted as unemployed). Unemployment rates are often seasonally adjusted to avoid variations that depend on time of year. Employment rate as a percentage of total population in working age is sometimes used instead of unemployment rate.\n\nFor purposes of comparison, harmonized values are published by International Labour Organization (ILO) and by OECD.\nThe ILO harmonized unemployment rate refers to those who are currently not working but are willing and able to work for pay, currently available to work, and have actively searched for work. The OECD harmonized unemployment rate gives the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labour force.\n"}

To keep the lists manageable, only the largest craters within a time period are included. The complete list is divided into separate articles by geographical region.\n\nThese features were caused by the collision of meteors (consisting of large fragments of asteroids) or comets (consisting of ice, dust particles and rocky fragments) with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to the best available estimate of the original rim diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features. Time units are either in thousands (ka) or millions (Ma) of years.\n\nLess than ten thousand years old, and with a diameter of 0.1 km (100 meters) or more. The EID lists only 7 or 8 such craters, and the largest in the last 100,000 years (100 ka) is the 4.5 km Rio Cuarto crater in Argentina. However, there is some uncertainty regarding its origins and age, with some sources giving it as < 10 ka while the EID gives a broader < 100 ka.\n\nThe Kaali impacts (c. 2000 BC) during the Iron Age may have influenced Estonian and Finnish mythology, the Campo del Cielo (c. 2000 BC) could be in the legends of some Native American tribes, while Henbury (c. 2200 BC) has figured in Australian Aboriginal oral traditions.\n\nFor the Rio Cuarto craters, 2002 research suggests they may actually be aeolian structures. The EID gives a size of about 50 meters for Campo del Cielo, but other sources quote 100 meters.\n\nFrom between 10 thousand years to 1 million years ago, and with a diameter of 1 km or more. The largest in the last one million years is the 14-km Zhamanshin crater in Kazakhstan and has been described as being capable of producing a nuclear-like winter.\n\nHowever, the currently unknown source of the enormous Australasian strewnfield (c. 780 ka) could be a crater about 100 km across.\n\nFrom between 1 and 10 million years ago, and with a diameter of 5 km or more. If uncertainties regarding its age are resolved, then the largest in the last 10 million years would be the 52-km Karakul crater which is listed in EID with an age of less than 5 Ma, or the Pliocene. The large but apparently craterless Eltanin impact (2.5 Ma) into the Pacific Ocean has been suggested as contributing to the glaciations and cooling during the Pliocene.\n\nCraters with a diameter of 20 km or more are all older than 10 Ma, with the exception of Karakul (52 km) and the newly-discovered Hiawatha crater (31 km, but not yet in the EID) whose ages are uncertain. \n\nThere are more than forty craters of such size. The largest two within the last hundred million years have been linked to two extinction events: Chicxulub for the Cretaceous–Paleogene and the Popigai impact for the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event.\n\nThe largest unconfirmed craters 200 km or more are significant not only for their size, but also for the possible coeval events associated with them. For example, the Wilkes Land crater has been connected to the massive Permian–Triassic extinction event. The sortable table has been arranged by diameter.\n\nNote: A special case, the recently discovered Hiawatha crater (31 km) in North-Eastern Greenland, is not yet officially in the Earth Impact Database and is not large enough for this table. But if its age is indeed within the recent Pleistocene, then it will be notable for its possible coeval and environmental effects.\n\n, the Earth Impact Database (EID) contains 190 confirmed craters. The table below is arranged by the continent's percentage of the Earth's land area, and where Asian and Russian craters are grouped together per EID convention. The global distribution of known impact structures apparently shows a surprising asymmetry, with the small but well-funded European continent having a large percentage of confirmed craters. It is suggested this situation is an artifact, highlighting the importance of intensifying research in less studied areas like Antarctica, South America and elsewhere.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1405912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1405912", "title": "Ota Benga", "text": "Ota Benga\n\nOta Benga ( – March 20, 1916) was an Mbuti (Congo pygmy) man, known for being featured in an anthropology exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904, and in a human zoo exhibit in 1906 at the Bronx Zoo. Benga had been purchased from African slave traders by the missionary and anthropologist Samuel Phillips Verner, a businessman searching for African people for the exhibition. \nHe traveled with Verner to the United States. At the Bronx Zoo, Benga had free run of the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo's Monkey House. \nExcept for a brief visit with Verner to Africa after the close of the St. Louis Fair, Benga lived in the United States, mostly in Virginia, for the rest of his life.\n\nAfrican-American newspapers around the nation published editorials strongly opposing Benga's treatment. \nRobert Stuart MacArthur, spokesman for a delegation of black churches, petitioned New York City Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. for his release from the Bronx Zoo. \n\nIn late 1906, the mayor released Benga to the custody of James M. Gordon, who supervised the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. In 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga to be cared for in Virginia, where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth capped, so the young man could be more readily accepted in local society. \nBenga was tutored in English and began to work at a Lynchburg tobacco factory. He proved a valuable employee because he could climb up the poles to get the tobacco leaves without having to use a ladder.\nHe began to plan a return to Africa, but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 stopped ship passenger travel. \nBenga fell into a depression, and he committed suicide in 1916.\n\nAs a member of the Mbuti people, Ota Benga lived in equatorial forests near the Kasai River in what was then the Congo Free State. \nHis people were attacked by the \"Force Publique,\" established by King Leopold II of Belgium as a militia to control the natives for labor in order to exploit the large supply of rubber in the Congo. \nBenga's wife and two children were murdered; he survived only because he was on a hunting expedition when the Force Publique attacked his village. He was later captured by \"Baschelel\" (Bashilele) slave traders.\n\nAmerican businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner travelled to Africa in 1904 under contract from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (St. Louis World Fair) to bring back an assortment of pygmies to be part of an exhibition. To demonstrate the fledgling discipline of anthropology, the noted scientist W. J. McGee intended to display \"representatives of all the world's peoples, ranging from smallest pygmies to the most gigantic peoples, from the darkest blacks to the dominant whites\" to show what was commonly thought then to be a sort of cultural evolution. Verner discovered Ota Benga while 'en route' to a Batwa village visited previously; he negotiated Benga's release from the slave traders for a pound of salt and a bolt of cloth. Verner later claimed Benga was rescued from the cannibals by him. The two spent several weeks together before reaching the village. There the villagers had developed distrust for the \"muzungu\" (white man) due to the abuses of King Leopold's forces. Verner was unable to recruit any villagers to join him until Benga spoke of the \"muzungu\" saving his life, the bond that had grown between them, and his own curiosity about the world Verner came from. Four Batwa, all male, ultimately accompanied them. Verner recruited other Africans who were not pygmies: five men from the Bakuba, including the son of King Ndombe, ruler of the Bakuba, and other related peoples – \"Red Africans\" as they were collectively labeled by contemporary anthropologists.\n\nThe group was brought to St. Louis, Missouri, in late June 1904 without Verner, who had been taken ill with malaria. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition had already begun, and the Africans immediately became the center of attention. Ota Benga was particularly popular, and his name was reported variously by the press as \"Artiba\", \"Autobank\", \"Ota Bang\", and \"Otabenga\". He had an amiable personality, and visitors were eager to see his teeth, which had been filed to sharp points in his early youth as ritual decoration. The Africans learned to charge for photographs and performances. One newspaper account, promoting Ota Benga as \"the only genuine African cannibal in America\", claimed \"[his teeth were] worth the five cents he charges for showing them to visitors\".\n\nWhen Verner arrived a month later, he realized the pygmies were more prisoners than performers. Their attempts to congregate peacefully in the forest on Sundays were thwarted by the crowds' fascination with them. McGee's attempts to present a \"serious\" scientific exhibit were also overturned. On July 28, the Africans' performing to the crowd's preconceived notion that they were \"savages\" resulted in the First Illinois Regiment being called in to control the mob. Benga and the other Africans eventually performed in a warlike fashion, imitating American Indians they saw at the Exhibition. The Apache chief Geronimo (featured as \"The Human Tyger\" – with special dispensation from the Department of War) grew to admire Benga, and gave him one of his arrowheads. For his efforts, Verner was awarded the gold medal in anthropology at the close of the Exposition.\n\nBenga accompanied Verner when he returned the other Africans to the Congo. He briefly lived amongst the Batwa while continuing to accompany Verner on his African adventures. He married a Batwa woman who later died of snakebite, and little is known of this second marriage. Not feeling that he belonged with the Batwa, Benga chose to return with Verner to the United States.\n\nVerner eventually arranged for Benga to stay in a spare room at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City while he was tending to other business. Verner negotiated with the curator Henry Bumpus over the presentation of his acquisitions from Africa and potential employment. While Bumpus was put off by Verner's request of the prohibitively high salary of $175 a month and was not impressed with the man's credentials, he was interested in Benga. Wearing a Southern-style linen suit to entertain visitors, Benga initially enjoyed his time at the museum. He became homesick, however.\n\nThe writers Bradford and Blume imagined his feelings:\n\nWhat at first held his attention now made him want to flee. It was maddening to be inside – to be swallowed whole – so long. He had an image of himself, stuffed, behind glass, but somehow still alive, crouching over a fake campfire, feeding meat to a lifeless child. Museum silence became a source of torment, a kind of noise; he needed birdsong, breezes, trees.\n\nThe disaffected Benga attempted to find relief by exploiting his employers' presentation of him as a 'savage'. He tried to slip past the guards as a large crowd was leaving the premises; when asked on one occasion to seat a wealthy donor's wife, he pretended to misunderstand, instead hurling the chair across the room, just missing the woman's head. Meanwhile, Verner was struggling financially and had made little progress in his negotiations with the museum. He soon found another home for Benga.\n\nAt the suggestion of Bumpus, Verner took Benga to the Bronx Zoo in 1906. William Hornaday, director of the zoo, initially hired Benga to use as help in maintaining the animal habitats. However, Hornaday saw that people took more notice of Benga than the animals at the zoo, eventually making Hornaday create an exhibition to feature Benga. There, the Mbuti man was allowed to roam the grounds freely. He became fond of an orangutan named Dohong, \"the presiding genius of the Monkey House\", who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior. The events leading to his \"exhibition\" alongside Dohong were gradual: Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit, and the zoo encouraged him to hang his hammock there, and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target. On the first day of the exhibit, September 8, 1906, visitors found Benga in the Monkey House. Soon, a sign on the exhibit read:\n\nThe African Pygmy, \"Ota Benga.\"\nAge, 23 years. Height, 4 feet 11 inches.\nWeight, 103 pounds. Brought from the\nKasai River, Congo Free State, South Cen-\ntral Africa, by Dr. Samuel P. Verner. Ex-\nhibited each afternoon during September.\nHornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors; he was supported by Madison Grant, Secretary of the New York Zoological Society, who lobbied to put Ota Benga on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo. A decade later, Grant became prominent nationally as a racial anthropologist and eugenicist.\n\nAfrican-American clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit. Said James H. Gordon,\n\nOur race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes ... We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.\" Gordon thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and a promotion of Darwinism: \"The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity, and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted.\n\nA number of clergymen backed Gordon.\n\nIn defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human, an editorial in \"The New York Times\" suggested:\n\nWe do not quite understand all the emotion which others are expressing in the matter ... It is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation Benga is suffering. The pygmies ... are very low in the human scale, and the suggestion that Benga should be in a school instead of a cage ignores the high probability that school would be a place ... from which he could draw no advantage whatever. The idea that men are all much alike except as they have had or lacked opportunities for getting an education out of books is now far out of date.\n\nAfter the controversy, Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo. In response to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent. \nAround this time, an article in \"The New York Times\" stated, \"It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people, and then we bring one here to brutalize him.\"\n\nThe zoo finally removed Benga from the grounds. Verner was unsuccessful in his continued search for employment, but he occasionally spoke to Benga. The two had agreed that it was in Benga's best interests to remain in the United States despite the unwelcome spotlight at the zoo. \nToward the end of 1906, Benga was released into Reverend Gordon's custody.\n\nGordon placed Benga in the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum, a church-sponsored orphanage which he supervised. \nAs the unwelcome press attention continued, in January 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga's relocation to Lynchburg, Virginia, where he lived with the McCray family. So that Benga could more easily be part of local society, Gordon arranged for the African's teeth to be capped and bought him American-style clothes. Tutored by Lynchburg poet Anne Spencer, Benga could improve his English, and he began to attend elementary school at the Baptist Seminary in Lynchburg.\n\nOnce he felt his English had improved sufficiently, Benga discontinued his formal education. He began working at a Lynchburg tobacco factory. He proved a valuable employee because he could climb up the poles to get the tobacco leaves without having to use a ladder. His fellow workers called him \"Bingo\". He often told his life story in exchange for sandwiches and root beer. He began to plan a return to Africa.\n\nIn 1914 when World War I broke out, a return to the Congo became impossible as passenger ship traffic ended. Benga became depressed as his hopes for a return to his homeland faded. On March 20, 1916, at the age of 32, he built a ceremonial fire, chipped off the caps on his teeth, and shot himself in the heart with a stolen pistol.\n\nHe was buried in an unmarked grave in the black section of the Old City Cemetery, near his benefactor, Gregory Hayes. At some point, the remains of both men went missing. Local oral history indicates that Hayes and Ota Benga were eventually moved from the Old Cemetery to White Rock Cemetery, a burial ground that later fell into disrepair.\n\nPhillips Verner Bradford, the grandson of Samuel Phillips Verner, wrote a book on the Mbuti man, entitled \"Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo\" (1992). During his research for the book, Bradford visited the American Museum of Natural History, which holds a life mask and body cast of Ota Benga. The display is still labeled \"Pygmy\", rather than indicating Benga's name, despite objections beginning a century ago from Verner and repeated by others. Publication of Bradford's book in 1992 inspired widespread interest in Ota Benga's story and stimulated creation of many other works, both fictional and non-fiction, such as:\n\n\nSimilarities have been observed between the treatment of Ota Benga and Ishi. The latter was the sole remaining member of the Yahi Native American tribe, and he was displayed in California around the same period. Ishi died on March 25, 1916, five days after Ota.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30389297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30389297", "title": "Phylo (video game)", "text": "Phylo (video game)\n\nPhylo is an experimental video game about multiple sequence alignment optimisation. Developed by the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics, it was originally released as a free Flash game in November 2010. Designed as a game with a purpose, players solve pattern-matching puzzles that represent nucleotide sequences of different phylogenetic taxa to optimize alignments over a computer algorithm. By aligning together each nucleotide sequence, represented as differently coloured blocks, players attempt to create the highest point value score for each set of sequences by matching as many colours as possible and minimizing gaps.\n\nThe nucleotide sequences generated by \"Phylo\" are obtained from actual sequence data from the UCSC Genome Browser. High-scoring player alignments are collected as data and sent back to the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics to be further evaluated with a stronger scoring algorithm. Those player alignments that score higher than the current computer-generated score will be re-introduced into the global alignment as an optimization.\n\nThe goal of multiple sequence alignments in phylogenetics is to determine the most likely nucleotide sequence of each species by comparing the sequences of children species with those of a most recent common ancestor. Producing such an optimal multiple sequence alignment is usually determined with a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the most probable evolutionary outcome by minimizing the number of mutations required. These algorithms generate phylogenetic trees for each nucleotide in a sequence for each species, and determine the genetic sequence for a common ancestor by comparing the trees of the child species. The algorithms then score and sort the completed phylogenetic tree, and the alignment with the maximum parsimony score is determined to be the optimal, and thus most evolutionarily likely, multiple sequence alignment. However, finding such an optimal alignment for a large number of sequences has been determined to be an NP-complete problem.\n\n\"Phylo\" uses human-based computation to create an interactive genetic algorithm to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem instead. Generation of the ancestral sequences and parsimony scoring is still computed using a variation of the Fitch algorithm, but \"Phylo\" abstracts the genetic sequences obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser into a pattern-matching game, allowing human players to suggest the most likely alignment rather than algorithmically considering all possible trees.\n\nEach puzzle in \"Phylo\" is categorized based on the number of total sequence fragments to be aligned and a disease that is associated with that fragment in humans. Once a puzzle is chosen, a few of the genetic sequence fragments for each species to be aligned, represented as coloured blocks, are each placed on a single row of a grid. Each nucleotide of a genetic sequence fragment is free to move along the grid. Players can then adjust the sequences as necessary in order to create the largest number of colour matches in each column between them, while minimizing the number of the gaps that appear.\n\nScoring of the sequence alignment is done by comparing each of the player-aligned sequences with an algorithm-determined ancestral sequence generated at each node. A colour match yields +1 to the score, a mismatch yields -1, an opening of a gap yields -5, and an extension of any existing gap yields -1. The sum of all comparisons is then determined every several seconds, which provides the final score for that player's alignment. For each puzzle, only a few sequences are initially available at the beginning of the game. A computer-determined par score must be beaten by the player before moving on to the next round and unlocking more sequences to match. A player wins and is allowed to submit their sequence alignment to the database by matching or surpassing the final par score generated by the computer for each puzzle.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31822065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31822065", "title": "Program on Information Resources Policy", "text": "Program on Information Resources Policy\n\nThe Program on Information Resources Policy (PIRP) was a research program at Harvard University, sometimes referred to informally as \"Harvard’s think tank on the information age.\" See for a complete explanation.\nIt was established on February 1, 1973 by Anthony Oettinger and John LeGates and closed on June 30, 2011 by the same principals. It worked in the realm of communications and information resources. At most points in its history it employed as many as 15 full time staffers, mostly professionals, as well as hosting scores of visiting scholars and sponsored researchers over the years. At any given time it was supported by about 100 different public and private organizations.\n\nDuring the 1980s the principals of PIRP, in addition to Oettinger and LeGates, included John F. McLaughin, who headed areas of postal policy as well as national security issues; Benjamin Compaine, who directed areas of the media and literacy; and Oswald H. Ganley, who focused on international issues such as transborder data flows.\n\nAs is typical for an academic program, it offered courses and seminars, but it also produced more than 500 book-length reports, most after reviews from industry, government and academia. However, its principal goal was to aid industry, government and public decision makers with sound reasoning and with information that was both impartial and competent. For that mission it developed research and dissemination methods that were innovative and unique.\n\nIn the words of the Program:\n\nThe Program held itself as being both impartial and competent.\n\nBecause it worked in areas of contentious policy debates, from its founding the Principals were concerned about the perception that, for many researchers, accepting funding from a particular interest could taint the findings of the research, no matter how impartial the authors claimed to be. To address this concern, Oettinger and LeGates devised a funding plan that sought small sums from many competing stakeholders in the information industries. \"Being bought by everybody, we are bought by nobody,\" is how they explained this model. All operations were funded by \"Affiliates\" that provided contributions, usually on an annual basis, that went into a blended \"pot.\" The Principals made the determination what research to undertake, aiming to build knowledge for use when and where it’s needed. It never accepted funds from any source that would be designated for a specific research project. Whether a contributing affiliate or not, \"We do not take sides—in any form. We are in the business of description, not prescription. We map the territory—you position your forces.\" \n\nTo address the goal of competence, PIRP established process of continuous fact-finding and written analysis. It created a \"vetting\" procedure for all its published research. A first draft would be circulated among Affiliates as well as outsiders who might have relevant expertise. Among the questions they were typically asked might be: Do we have the facts straight? Have we presented the position of your industry or your agency accurately? Have we unearthed the critical controversies?\n\nThe Program's primary avenue for disseminating its research was through its approximately 500 publications. Most were extensively reviewed by both disciplinary experts and by stakeholders in the topics under discussion. Full texts of almost all are available on the Program website.\n\nHowever, PIRP's objective was to make the information it developed available to decision makers in real time. This was most often accomplished by face–to-face meetings, usually with senior people in the affiliates. One customary format would be for the affiliate to describe its major uncertainties. The Program's Principal's would respond with whatever they knew that might be relevant. The hoped-for result, if any, would be better information and thinking for the affiliate. Although Program Principals did not sign nondisclosure agreements, it assured those with whom they met confidentiality. Program Principals also disseminated its findings and analysis through testimony and presentations, when requested, to Federal and state policymakers as well as in other public forums.\n\nOver its career, the Program was supported at one time or another by about 400 organizations, called \"Affiliates\". They included industry players, government agencies, non-profit organizations, trade associations and advocacy groups in the U.S., Canada and globally. It worked closely with those and many others. Here is the complete list over the 38 years of its operations:\n\nThe impact of the Program is hard to measure directly: How can it be determined that organizations made better decisions? One metric would the breadth and continuity of the financial support (see list of affiliates). Another would be quotable feedback and praise from the people with whom the program worked. Here are some samples.

You are the only one I have met in the last fourteen years…who understands the situation, articulates it, and does so without prejudice. Edward P. Larkin, Chairman, New York Public Service Commission, 1984\n\nIn the course of its work on developing the JCS bill, the Investigations Subcommittee, which I chair, has benefited significantly from the studies authored by retired General J. H. Cushman. I understand that the Program on Information Resources Policy has sponsored General Cushman’s work, and commend you for supporting a project that is having an immediate, constructive impact as the Congress frames the future structure of the defense establishment. Congressman Bill Nichols, 1985\n\nThe Program on Information Resources Policy, through its independent and incisive analyses, free from special interest and partisan considerations, has helped me and my predecessors cut through the noise and get to the bottom of important public policy issues in the communications and information field. Over the years, the Harvard Program has become an indispensable institution on which policymakers in both the public and private sector have come to depend for truthful and fearless advice, even if its views have run sometimes counter to popular or conventional wisdom. For a Congressman to deal with people who are in fact impartial and competent is a rare experience. I recognize this program and your work as being critical to the development of sound telecommunications policy, and I support your continued efforts to examine these important issues. Congressman Edward J. Markey, Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, 1991\nThis chapter is the most succinct and analytical source yet available for elucidating local distribution policy, planning, and marketing. Journal of Communication 1985\n(Longstaff’s draft is) the best thing I ever read in the field. I need another copy. Senator McCain is reading it and won’t let it go. John McCain/Mark Buse, Senator John McCain’s office, 1995\nYour work is a distinguished contribution not only to the world of research and to your university, but to all of us whose life is caught up in the business of communication. Robert D. Lilley, President, American Telephone and Telegraph Company, 1974\nLast week’s conference was the finest I have ever attended. John R. Bennett, President, Transamerica Information Services, 1977\nWe are appreciative of the constructive work that you have been doing, particularly in the postal arena, and we certainly hope that you will continue to contribute to clearer thinking about the Postal Service here in this country. Kent Rhodes, Chairman, Reader's Digest, 1978\nYour center is a gold mine of information—and I very much appreciate your thoughtfulness in filling up my reading file with such helpful and insightful materials. \"You could have used my name if you hadn’t asked\", Executive Office of the President, 1990\nYour chart of information industries revenues will save us and our consultants many hundreds of hours of labor. I am especially grateful for your willingness to send a handwritten table prior to publication—we will guard it with our lives. Charles M. Oliver, Director, Legislative and Regulatory Policy, CBS, Inc., 1981\nI want both of you to know that our luncheon session last month and your follow-on work paid big dividends for us. George H. Bolling, Vice President, Advanced Programs, COMSAT, 1990\nThere is no trace of the mindless pap which passes as \"debate on regulation.\" Media Information Australia, 1985\nHave now read the C3I paper. Absolutely fascinating, and very useful to me in preparing a speech I hope to make on the SDI program later this week. The quality of the discussion was quite exceptional, and kept me reading all weekend! Sir Ian Lloyd, M.P., House of Commons, U.K., Chairman: All parties Committee on Communications Technology, 1986\nThe Program is in our view the pre-eminent honest broker in the massive job of keeping track of what is happening to, and within, the industry that comprises the means of moving information from place to place. John Morgan, Assistant to Executive Vice President, Communications Workers of America, 1981\nThere is no question at all that Washington looks at your work as an outside expert of very high credibility. I see your testimony reflected in their decisions as well as hearing about you in their discussions. Your work and your role are excellent. William Ditch, American District Telegraph Corporation, 1981\nDavid Charlton was very high in praise for you as the highest quality effort he has ever come in contact with. Frank Kapper, Corning, Inc., 1989\nI am amazed at the religious fervor with which Apple is using your map. I was handed it as background reading for my meeting with Sculley, Chairman and Nagle, Chief Scientist. They said “this may take you a while”. John Schwartz, Newsweek (reporter), 1993\n"}

Although there is no present activity on setiQuest per-se, much of the code and raw data products are still available on its successor site.\n\nThe setiQuest project started with Jill Tarter's \"TED wish\".

Tarter's wish was:\n\nAfter the award, the project materialized through a website, that later garnered grass-roots public involvement on its discussion forum, and also in IRC meetings, various social networks, and a wiki. Some of these channels were set up by the community itself, and others were facilitated through the support of several institutions, in cooperation with the SETI Institute.\n\nThe software aspect of the project initially entailed opening the source code of SonATA, the software used on the Allen Telescope Array (ATA), into Open SonATA, to allow improvement by hobbyist programmers who are passionate about the subject or enjoy contributing to open source code development projects.

The algorithms used on the ATA currently only search for continuous wave signals (that is, signals that appear at one frequency as a single tone) or pulsed signals. The goal of this participation mode was to allow signal processing enthusiasts to expand the search to other waveforms, perform improvements in the current algorithms or propose innovative new ones.\n\nsetiQuest also targets those who are less technically inclined, through the development of game-like apps to engage participants as Citizen Scientists, examining real data from SETI observations with the Allen Telescope Array. These apps were meant to harness the ability of the human brain to instinctively detect patterns, even in non-trivial cases where automated tools currently fail. The first of such apps, setiQuest Explorer was released in March 2011.\n\nTo encourage developers to create new apps, the SETI Institute has made a large amount of its data available to the public, under a Creative Commons 3.0 license.

The only assumption that the theory makes is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. It is a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor and the Principle of Multiple Explanations.\n\nPrediction is done using a completely Bayesian framework. The universal prior is calculated for all computable sequences—this is the universal a priori probability distribution;\nno computable hypothesis will have a zero probability. This means that Bayes rule of causation can be used in predicting the continuation of any particular computable sequence.\n\nThe theory is based in philosophical foundations, and was founded by Ray Solomonoff around 1960. It is a mathematically formalized combination of Occam's razor and the Principle of Multiple Explanations.\nAll computable theories which perfectly describe previous observations are used to calculate the probability of the next observation, with more weight put on the shorter computable theories. Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon this to calculate the expected value of an action.\n\nThe proof of the \"razor\" is based on the known mathematical properties of a probability distribution over a countable set. These properties are relevant because the infinite set of all programs is a denumerable set. The sum S of the probabilities of all programs must be exactly equal to one (as per the definition of probability) thus the probabilities must roughly decrease as we enumerate the infinite set of all programs, otherwise S will be strictly greater than one. To be more precise, for every formula_1 > 0, there is some length \"l\" such that the probability of all programs longer than \"l\" is at most formula_1. This does not, however, preclude very long programs from having very high probability.\n\nFundamental ingredients of the theory are the concepts of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity. The universal prior probability of any prefix \"p\" of a computable sequence \"x\" is the sum of the probabilities of all programs (for a universal computer) that compute something starting with \"p\". Given some \"p\" and any computable but unknown probability distribution from which \"x\" is sampled, the universal prior and Bayes' theorem can be used to predict the yet unseen parts of \"x\" in optimal fashion.\n\nThough Solomonoff's inductive inference is not computable, several AIXI-derived algorithms approximate it in order to make it run on a modern computer. The more computing power they are given, the closer their predictions are to the predictions of inductive inference (their mathematical limit is Solomonoff's inductive inference).\n\nAnother direction of inductive inference is based on E. Mark Gold's model of learning in the limit from 1967 and has developed since then more and more models of learning. The general scenario is the following: Given a class \"S\" of computable functions, is there a learner (that is, recursive functional) which for any input of the form (\"f\"(0),\"f\"(1)...,\"f\"(\"n\")) outputs a hypothesis (an index \"e\" with respect to a previously agreed on acceptable numbering of all computable functions; the indexed function may be required consistent with the given values of \"f\"). A learner \"M\" learns a function \"f\" if almost all its hypotheses are the same index \"e\", which generates the function \"f\"; \"M\" learns \"S\" if \"M\" learns every \"f\" in \"S\". Basic results are that all recursively enumerable classes of functions are learnable while the class REC of all computable functions is not learnable. \n\nMany related models have been considered and also the learning of classes of recursively enumerable sets from positive data is a topic studied from Gold's pioneering paper in 1967 onwards. A far reaching extension of the Gold’s approach is developed by Schmidhuber's theory of generalized Kolmogorov complexities, which are kinds of super-recursive algorithms.\n\nThe third mathematically based direction of inductive inference makes use of the theory of automata and computation. In this context, the process of inductive inference is performed by an abstract automaton called an inductive Turing machine (Burgin, 2005).\n\"Inductive Turing machines\" represent the next step in the development of computer science providing better models for contemporary computers and computer networks (Burgin, 2001) and forming an important class of super-recursive algorithms as they satisfy all conditions in the definition of algorithm. Namely, each inductive Turing machines is a type of effective method in which a definite list of well-defined instructions for completing a task, when given an initial state, will proceed through a well-defined series of successive states, eventually terminating in an end-state. The difference between an inductive Turing machine and a Turing machine is that to produce the result a Turing machine has to stop, while in some cases an inductive Turing machine can do this without stopping. Stephen Kleene called procedures that could run forever without stopping by the name \"calculation procedure or algorithm\" (Kleene 1952:137). Kleene also demanded that such an algorithm must eventually exhibit \"some object\" (Kleene 1952:137). This condition is satisfied by inductive Turing machines, as their results are exhibited after a finite number of steps, but inductive Turing machines do not always tell at which step the result has been obtained.\n\nSimple inductive Turing machines are equivalent to other models of computation. More advanced inductive Turing machines are much more powerful. It is proved (Burgin, 2005) that limiting partial recursive functions, trial and error predicates, general Turing machines, and simple inductive Turing machines are equivalent models of computation. However, simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines give direct constructions of computing automata, which are thoroughly grounded in physical machines. In contrast, trial and error predicates, limiting recursive functions and limiting partial recursive functions present syntactic systems of symbols with formal rules for their manipulation. Simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines are related to limiting partial recursive functions and trial and error predicates as Turing machines are related to partial recursive functions and lambda-calculus.\n\nNote that only simple inductive Turing machines have the same structure (but different functioning semantics of the output mode) as Turing machines. Other types of inductive Turing machines have an essentially more advanced structure due to the structured memory and more powerful instructions. Their utilization for inference and learning allows achieving higher efficiency and better reflects learning of people (Burgin and Klinger, 2004).\n\nSome researchers confuse computations of inductive Turing machines with non-stopping computations or with infinite time computations. First, some of computations of inductive Turing machines halt. As in the case of conventional Turing machines, some halting computations give the result, while others do not give. Second, some non-stopping computations of inductive Turing machines give results, while others do not give. Rules of inductive Turing machines determine when a computation (stopping or non-stopping) gives a result. Namely, an inductive Turing machine produces output from time to time and once this output stops changing, it is considered the result of the computation. It is necessary to know that descriptions of this rule in some papers are incorrect. For instance, Davis (2006: 128) formulates the rule when result is obtained without stopping as \"… once the correct output has been produced any subsequent output will simply repeat this correct result.\" Third, in contrast to the widespread misconception, inductive Turing machines give results (when it happens) always after a finite number of steps (in finite time) in contrast to infinite and infinite-time computations.\nThere are two main distinctions between conventional Turing machines and simple inductive Turing machines. The first distinction is that even simple inductive Turing machines can do much more than conventional Turing machines. The second distinction is that a conventional Turing machine always informs (by halting or by coming to a final state) when the result is obtained, while a simple inductive Turing machine in some cases does inform about reaching the result, while in other cases (where the conventional Turing machine is helpless), it does not inform. People have an illusion that a computer always itself informs (by halting or by other means) when the result is obtained. In contrast to this, users themselves have to decide in many cases whether the computed result is what they need or it is necessary to continue computations. Indeed, everyday desktop computer applications like word processors and spreadsheets spend most of their time waiting in event loops, and do not terminate until directed to do so by users.\n\nEvolutionary approach to inductive inference is accomplished by another class of automata called evolutionary inductive Turing machines (Burgin and Eberbach, 2009; 2012). An ‘’’evolutionary inductive Turing machine’’’ is a (possibly infinite) sequence \"E\" = {\"A\"[\"t\"]; \"t\" = 1, 2, 3, ... } of inductive Turing machines \"A\"[\"t\"] each working on generations X[t] which are coded as words in the alphabet of the machines \"A\"[\"t\"]. The goal is to build a “population” \"Z\" satisfying the inference condition. The automaton \"A\"[\"t\"] called a component, or a level automaton, of E represents (encodes) a one-level evolutionary algorithm that works with input generations \"X\"[\"i\"] of the population by applying the variation operators v and selection operator s. The first generation \"X\"[0] is given as input to \"E\" and is processed by the automaton \"A\"[1], which generates/produces the first generation \"X\"[1] as its transfer output, which goes to the automaton \"A\"[2]. For all \"t\" = 1, 2, 3, ..., the automaton \"A\"[\"t\"] receives the generation \"X\"[\"t\" − 1] as its input from \"A\"[\"t\" − 1] and then applies the variation operator v and selection operator \"s\", producing the generation \"X\"[\"i\" + 1] and sending it to \"A\"[\"t\" + 1] to continue evolution.\n\n\n\n"}

Children with disabilities are 3.7 times more likely to be affected by any sort of violence, 3.6 times more likely to be victims of physical violence, 2.9 times more likely to be victims of sexual violence, and children with intellectual impairment are among the most vulnerable being 4.6 times more likely to experience sexual violence than their non-disabled peers.\n\nAn article published by the World Health Organization titled \"Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies\" revealed that adults with any form of disability are 1.5 times more likely to experience some form of violence while adults with some form of mental impairment are 4 times more likely to experience violence than those without disabilities. \n\nAs mentioned by Powers and Oschwald, there are seven categories of abusive behavior defined by both male and female individuals who have some form of disability: physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal or emotional abuse, neglect or withholding support, financial abuse, manipulation of medications, and destroying or disabling equipment. With the scope of abuse being clearly defined, we can begin building evidence and empirical data from the individual experiences to find and implement solutions where they are most effective.\n\nWhen comparing and contrasting Institutional and Non-Institutional cases of violence against people with disabilities, we find that 82% of violence against people who are disabled happens when they are Institutionalized. Common thought is that Institutions \"inherently promote abuse and dehumanization.\" Although, Institutionalized cases are far more present than Non-Institutionalized cases, statistics show that sexual assault based violence is 7 times more probable among intellectually disabled people and that number jumps to 12 times more probable if that person is a woman compared to a non-disabled peer.\n\nAge plays a major factor when looking into non-institutionalized violence. Those who have some form of disability ranging from the ages of 12 to 15 experience violence at a rate of 144.1 out of 1000 persons compared to their non-disabled peers at a rate of 38.8 out of a thousand with a rate difference being 105.3. Disabled teens ranging from the ages of 16 to 19 experience violence at a rate of 86.6 out of 1000 persons compared to their non-disabled peers at the rate of 31.4 out of 1000 persons. Examining the age ranges of 20 to 24, and 25 to 34 collectively to represent a persons twenties to mid thirties, the data shows that people with a some form of disability in that age range goes at a rate of 147.9 out of 1000 persons compared to 55.9 to their non-disabled peers with a rate difference of 92 out of 1000.\n\nExamining statistics from \"Crime Against Persons with Disabilities\" table 5, results highlight that females between the ages of 12 and higher experience slightly higher percentages of violence among the disabled community compared to males of the same age group except for ambulatory disabilities. The rate of violence committed against men with a cognitive disability is 55.4 while females are at 60.3 out of 1000. Ambulatory disability being the only category where men have a higher rate comes to 29.6 while females are at 29.3 with a difference of 0.3. Visual impairment has a significant affect on the outcome of violence between the sexes as men are at a rate of 24.6 while females are 32.3 out of 1000 concluding a difference of 7.7. Lastly, table 8 displays a slight difference of 1.8 between the sexes with males at 15 while females are at 16.8.\n\nReferencing \"Crime Against Persons with Disabilities\" table 8, it is evident that persons with disabilities are at risk of a higher rate of violence committed against them than their non-disabled peers. Additionally, according to the data, individuals who have some form of disability are at a higher risk of being victimized by a well-known or casual acquaintance over a complete stranger unlike their non-disabled peers; people whom have experienced an act of violence by a stranger with a disability being at 30.3% while non-disabled people are at 39.4% by a complete stranger.\n\n• Mental disorder#Violence\n\n• Sexual abuse and intellectual disability\n\n• Ableism\n"}
