The painting preceded his similar \"An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump\" (National Gallery, London).\n\nThe first of Wright's candlelit masterpieces, \"Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight\", was painted in 1765, and showed three men studying a small copy of the \"Borghese Gladiator\". The \"Gladiator\" was greatly admired; but his next painting, \"The Orrery\", caused a greater stir, as it replaced the Classical subject at the centre of the scene with one of a scientific nature. Wright's depiction of the awe produced by scientific \"miracles\" marked a break with previous traditions in which the artistic depiction of such wonder was reserved for religious events, since to Wright the marvels of the technological age were as awe-inspiring as the subjects of the great religious paintings. In both of these works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well, and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were an essential part of the display. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.\n\nThe painting was one of a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French-dictated, hierarchy of genres in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated as seriously as the costumed history painting of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the \"Orrery\" and \"Air Pump\" subjects resembled conversation pieces, then largely a form of middle-class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when Johann Zoffany began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces. The 20th-century art historian Ellis Waterhouse compares these two works to the \"genre serieux\" of contemporary French drama, as defined by Denis Diderot and Pierre Beaumarchais, a view endorsed by Egerton.\n\nAn anonymous review from the time called Wright \"a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way\". \"The Orrery\" was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers, an amateur astronomer who had an orrery of his own, and with whom Wright's friend Peter Perez Burdett was staying while in Derbyshire. Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with a youth next to the orrery.\nFerrers purchased the painting for £210, but the 6th Earl auctioned it off, and it is now held by Derby Museum and Art Gallery, where it is on permanent display, and close to a working replica of a full-sized mechanical Grand Orrery.\n\nA biographer of Wright, Benedict Nicolson, argued in 1968 that John Whitehurst was the model for the lecturer, while another commentator points out the figure's resemblance to \"a painting of Isaac Newton by Godfrey Kneller\". Close observation of the adult faces in the picture reveals that each one demonstrates one or other of the main phases of the moon – new moon, half moon, gibbous moon and full moon.\n\n"}

It holds thousands of galaxies together. It is located at a distance of 2.4 billion light-years from Earth.\n\nAstronomers noticed an invisible string of matter was warping spacetime between Abell 222 and Abell 223. Upon further examination by using images from the Japanese Subaru telescope, astronomers discovered that this \"invisible matter\" is in fact dark matter. The astronomers used gravitational lensing to detect the dark matter filaments. The cluster is connected by a filament of dark matter to Abell 223 that is permeated by hot X-ray emitting gas. Further research shows that this filament only contains about 20 percent of normal matter, the rest is assumed to be dark matter. This is seen to be in good agreement with the cosmological standard model.\n\n5% of the universe is made up of baryonic or ordinary matter which contains protons and neutrons, also known as baryons, and electrons. Baryons and electrons are the foundation for atoms. Astronomers have not been able to locate the full 5% of baryonic matter within other galaxies, stars or gases. After observing gas that connects Abell 222 and Abell 223, scientists believe that the missing baryonic matter is within the gas that bridges the two galaxy clusters. This was difficult to locate due to the fact that the gas had a very low density, which made it hard to detect. This discovery was made possible because of Abell 222’s location. It is within Earth’s line of sight, so scientists were able to see a strong concentration of this gas within a section of the sky.\n\n"}

It lies at the eastern end of the large canyon Valles Marineris and close to Ares Vallis. Various geological processes have reduced it to a circular area of chaotic terrain. Aram Chaos takes its name from Aram, one of the classical albedo features observed by Giovanni Schiaparelli, who named it after the Biblical land of Aram. Spectroscopic observation from orbit indicates the presence of the mineral hematite, likely a signature of a once aqueous environment.\n\nAram Chaos measures about across, and lies in a region called Margaritifer Terra, where many water-carved channels show that floods poured out of the highlands onto the northern lowlands ages ago. It is in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on the orbiter \"Mars Odyssey\" found gray crystalline hematite on the floor of Aram. CRISM, the spectroscope on the MRO, found hydrated sulfates, jarosite, and hematite. Hematite is an iron-oxide mineral that can precipitate when ground water circulates through iron-rich rocks, whether at normal temperatures or in hot springs. The floor of Aram contains huge blocks of collapsed, or chaotic, terrain that formed when water or ice was catastrophically removed. Elsewhere on Mars, the release of groundwater produced massive floods that eroded the large channels seen in Ares Vallis and similar outflow valleys. In Aram Chaos, however, the released water stayed mostly within the crater's ramparts, eroding only a small, shallow outlet channel in the eastern wall. Several minerals including hematite sulfate minerals, and water-altered silicates in Aram suggests that a lake probably once existed within the crater. Because forming hematite requires liquid water, which could not long exist without a thick atmosphere, Mars must have had a much thicker atmosphere at some time in the past.\n\n\n"}

It provides an independent research institute for the mathematical sciences in North America, a counterpart to the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach in Europe. The research station, commonly known by its acronym, \"BIRS\", hosts over 2000 international scientists each year to undertake research collaboration in the mathematical sciences.\n\nThe research that takes place at the Banff International Research Station is either in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, or in other areas of science where they intersect with mathematics.\n\"BIRS embraces all aspects of the mathematical, computational and statistical sciences from the most fundamental challenges of pure and applied mathematics, theoretical and applied computer science, statistics, and mathematical physics, to financial and industrial mathematics, as well as the mathematics of information technology, and the life sciences.\" \nThere are a wide range of research publications citing lectures, meetings and reports from BIRS.\n\nThe Banff International Research Station hosts five types of meetings:\n\n\nThe core program of 5-day workshops is created two years in advance. Every summer, BIRS issues a Call for Proposals, soliciting applications for workshops from the global scientific community. Each year, it gets more competitive to get a space in the 48 available weeks at BIRS: 79 proposals were received for the 2003 program, and 168 were received for the 2014 program. An extensive peer-review process by international experts culminates in the selection of the scientific program for a given year.\n\nSummer schools and training camps must apply through the same process as 5-day workshops. An example of a summer school is the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) training camp, to prepare high school students for competing at the IMO. The other types of meetings are far less competitive, and may be applied for at any time, through the BIRS website.\n\nThe Banff International Research Station occupies two buildings on the campus of the Banff Centre, in Banff National Park. One of the buildings, Corbett Hall, is a residence building that provides bedrooms, a common lounge area, a small library, and space for small teams of people to work. The other building, TransCanada PipeLines Pavilion, hosts administrative offices, two lecture rooms, and a series of smaller rooms for break-out sessions and research teams. As part of the Banff Centre campus, BIRS researchers have full access to all of its amenities and services.\n\nThe idea behind this choice of location for a research facility is to create an atmosphere where scientists can remove themselves from day-to-day life, and immerse themselves in their research.\n\nIn 2012, the Banff International Research Station installed a fully automated lecture capture system. It provides live video streaming and video recording of the lectures that take place in its main lecture room. Video recordings are automatically posted on the BIRS website within a few minutes after a lecture ends. Use of the system is opt-in, decided by the individual lecturers at the time of their lecture, via a touchscreen panel in the lecture room. The automated system at BIRS employs high quality cameras to ensure that mathematics written on chalkboards can be seen clearly. Embedded microphones and audio processing systems capture both the lecturer and questions from the audience.\n\nRecent research videos recorded at BIRS are also available in the iTunes podcast directory.\n\nThe Banff International Research Station is funded by four governments:\n\n\n"}

Nowadays the term bunker is generally applied to the storage of petroleum products in tanks, and the practice and business of refueling ships. Bunkering operations are located at seaports, and they include the storage of \"bunker\" (ship) fuels and the provision of the fuel to vessels.\n\nIn many maritime contracts, such as charterparties, contracts for carriage of goods by sea, and marine insurance policies, the shipowner or ship operator is required to ensure that the ship is \"seaworthy\". Seaworthiness requires not only that the ship is sound and properly crewed, but also that it is fully fuelled (or \"bunkered\") at the start of the voyage. If the ship operator wishes to bunker \"en route\", this must be provided for in a written agreement, or the interruption of the voyage may be deemed to be deviation (a serious breach of contract). If the vessel runs out of fuel in mid-ocean, this is also serious breach, allowing the insurer to cancel a policy, and allowing a consignee to make a cargo claim. It may also give rise to a salvage situation.\n\nParticularly in Nigeria, \"bunkering\" also means the clandestine siphoning off or diverting of oil from pipelines and storage facilities. Such bunkering is often performed crudely, causing both accidents and pollution.\n"}

{"id": "39260190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39260190", "title": "Feminist technoscience", "text": "Feminist technoscience\n\nFeminist technoscience is a transdisciplinary branch of science studies which emerged from decades of feminist critique on the way gender and other identity markers are entangled in the combined fields of science and technology. The term technoscience, especially in regard to the field of feminist technoscience studies seeks to remove the distinction between scientific research and development with applied applications of technology while assuming science is entwined with the common interests of society. As a result, science is suggested to be held to the same level of political and ethical accountability as the technologies which develop from it. Feminist technoscience studies continue to develop new theories on how politics of gender and other identity markers are interconnected to resulting processes of technical change, and power relations of the globalized, material world.\n\nFeminist technoscience focuses less on intrapersonal relationships between men and women, and more on broader issues concerning knowledge production and how bodies manifest and are acknowledged in societies.\n\nFeminist technoscience studies are inspired by social constructionist approaches to gender, sex, intersectionalities, and science, technology and society (STS). It can also be referred to as feminist science studies, feminist STS, feminist cultural studies of science, feminist studies of science and technology, and gender and science.\n\nAccording to Judy Wajcman, the concept of technology has historically been bound to indigenous women. The roles of harvesters, or caretakers of the domestic economy taken up by these women lead Wajcman to conclude they would have created tools such as the sickle and the pestle, making them the first technologists. During the Eighteenth century, industrial engineering began to constitute the modern definition of technology. This transformed the meaning from including useful arts technology – such as needlework, metalwork, weaving, and mining – to strictly applied science. As a result, \"male machines\" replaced the \"female fabrics\" as identifiers of modern technology when engineering was considered as masculine profession. Due to political movements of the 1960s and early 70s, science and technology were considered for a profit industrial, governmental, or militaristic based practice, and associated with masculinity resulting in a lack of feminist discourse. Feminist scholarship identified the absence of women's presence in technological and scientific spheres, due the use of sex stereotyping in education and sexual discrimination in the workforce, as well as the development of technology as a masculine construct. Examples of masculine-coded technologies under these categories included ARPANET, a precursor to the internet developed by the United States Department of Defence, and the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe women's health movements of the 1970s US and UK provided momentum to the emergence of feminist politics around scientific knowledge. During the early states of second-wave feminism, campaigns for improved birth control and abortion rights were at the forefront in challenging the consolidation of male dominated sciences and technologies at the expense of women's health. The act of regaining knowledge and control over women's bodies was seen as a crucial component to women's liberation.\n\nScience was originally seen as an alien entity opposed to women's interests. Sciences and technologies developed under the misconception that women's needs were universal and inferior to the needs of men, forcing women into rigid, determined sex roles. A shift happened in the 1980s – Sandra Harding proposed \"the female question in science\" to raise \"the question of the science in feminism\", claiming that science is involved in projects that are not only neutral and objective, but that are strongly linked to male interests. The conceptualization of science and technology was expanded to reflect the all-pervasive ways in which technology is encountered in daily life, gaining attention of feminists out of concern for female positions in science and technological professions. Rather than asking how women can be better treated within and by science, feminist critics instead chose to focus on how a science deeply involved in masculinity and masculine projects could be used for the emancipation of women.\n\nToday's feminist critique often uses the former demonology of technology as a point of departure to tell a story of progress from liberal to postmodern feminism. According to Judy Wajcman, both liberal and Marxist feminists failed in the analysis of science and technology, because they considered the technology as neutral and did not pay attention to the symbolic dimension of technoscience.\n\nFeminist technoscience studies have become intrinsically linked with practices of Technofeminism and the development of feminist technologies in cultural and critical vernacular. Feminist technoscience studies explore the coded social and historical implications of science and technology on the development of society, including how identity constructs and is constructed by these technologies. Technofeminism emerged in the early 1980s, leaning on the different feminist movements. Feminist scholars reanalyzed the Scientific Revolution, and stated that the resulting science was based on the masculine ideology of exploiting the Earth and control. During this time, nature and scientific inquiry were modelled after misogynous relationships to women. Femininity was associated with nature and considered as something passive to be objectified. This was in contrast to culture, which was represented by objectifying masculinity. This analysis depended on the use of gender imagery to conceptualize the nature of technoscientific masculine ideology.\n\nJudy Wajcman draws parallels between Judith Butler's theory of gender performativity and the construction of technology. Butler conceives gender as a performative act as opposed to a naturalized condition one is born into. Through a fluctuating process achieved in daily social interaction, gender identity is acted and constructed through relational behaviours – it is a fluid concept. Drawing from the work of Butler and Donna Haraway, Amade M'charek analyzes how objects, when linked to another object or signifier, construct identity through the use of human imagination:\n\nDifferences and similarities may be stable or not, depending on the maintenance work that goes into the relations that help to produce them. They are neither fundaments nor qualities that are always embodied… Differences are relational. They do not always materialize in bodies (in the flesh, genes, hormones, brains, or the skin). Rather they materialize in the very relations that help to enact them. \n\nIn this theory, identity is not the byproduct of genes, but the constant upholding of hierarchical difference relations. Differences in identity are the effect of interferences, performing and enacting and being enacted upon. Technology too, as proposed by Wajcman, is a product of mutual alliances, not objectively given but collectively created in a process of reiteration. To this end, technology exists as both a source and a concurrence of identity relations.\n\nWestern technology and science is deeply implicated in the masculine projection and patriarchal domination of women and nature. After the shift of feminist theory to focus more on technoscience, there was a call for new technology to be based on the needs and values of women, rather than masculine dominated technological development. The differences between female and male needs were asserted by feminist movements, drawing attention to the exclusion of women being served by current technologies. Reproductive technologies in particular were influenced by this movement. During this time, household technologies, new media, and new technosciences were, for the most part, disregarded.\n\nFeminist technologies are ones that are formed from feminist social relations, but varied definitions and layers of feminism complicate the definition. Deborah Johnson proposes four candidates for feminist technologies: \n\nThe successes of certain technologies, such as the pap smear for cervical cancer testing, relied on the feminization of technician jobs. The intervention of women outside the technological sphere, like from members of the women's health movement, and public health activists also aided in the tool's development. However, other feminist technologies, such as birth control serve as an example of a feminist technology also shaped in part by dominant masculinity.\n\nCombined oral contraceptive pills were first approved for use in the United States in 1960, during the time of the women's liberation movement. The birth control pill helped make it possible for more women to enter the workforce by giving them the ability to control her own fertility. Decades prior to this, activists such as Margaret Sanger and Katharine McCormick fought for female contraceptives, seeing it as a necessity for the emancipation of women. However, in the 1970s feminists raised critique on male control of the medical and pharmaceutical industry. The male domination of these fields led technologies such as oral contraceptives to be developed around what men considered to be universal, defining characteristics of women (these being their sex and reproductive capabilities). Birth control pills themselves also succeeded in perpetrating and creating this universality – shaped by moral considerations of the natural body, the length of the menstrual cycle was able to be engineered.\n\nThe development of reproductive technologies blur the lines between nature and technology, allowing for the reconfiguration of life itself. Through the advances of genetic technologies, the controlling of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood has become increasingly possible through intrusive means. These advances in biotechnology are serving to develop life as a commodity and deepen monetary inequality - a link made by feminist theorists such as Donna Haraway. Genetic engineering also brings about questions in eugenics, leading to early radical feminist analysis to declare and attempt to reclaim motherhood as a foundation of female identity. The idea of a green, natural motherhood was popularized by eco feminists who celebrated the identification of women with nature, and natural life.\n\nHaraway instead chooses to embrace technology as feminist instead of reverting to this idea of naturalized femininity. By embracing the image of the cyborg, an amalgamation that is neither human/animal nor machine, Haraway explores the ideas of technoscience and gender, conceptualizing a space where gender is an arbitrary, unnecessary construct.\n\nThe corporatization of biology through the alteration of nature through technology is also a theme explored by Haraway. The OncoMouse is a laboratory mouse genetically modified to carry a specific gene which increases the creature's chance of developing cancer. Until 2005, American conglomerate DuPoint owned the patent to the OncoMouse, reconfiguring and relegating life to a commodity. This development in genetic engineering brings up questions about lab animal treatment, as well as ethical questions around class and race. Increasing breast cancer rates in Black women are discussed in eco-feminist analysis of the modification of lab animals from breast cancer research to being the discussion into an ethically ambiguous space. Haraway in particular raises the question of whether modifying and expending a live commodity like OncoMouse is ethical if it leads to the development of a cure for breast cancer.\n\nThe reconfiguring of life in biotechnologies and genetic engineering allow for a precedence to be set, leading to capitalist cultural consequences. Through these technologies technoscience becomes naturalized, and also becomes increasingly subject to the process of commodification and capital accumulation in transnational capitalist corporations. Like presented in Marxist and Neo-Marxist analysis of sciences, biotechnologies allow for the concept of commodity to become fetishized as genes are reified to have a monetary value outside nature. This also develops life and nature as a thing to be exploited by capitalism.\n\n\n\n"}

His father, a merchant, was United States consul at Alexandria where Gliddon was taken at an early age. \n\nGliddon became United States vice-consul and took a great interest in Egyptian antiquities. Subsequently, he lectured in the United States and succeeded in attracting attention to the subject of Egyptology. His chief work was \"Ancient Egypt\" (1850, ed. 1853). He wrote also \"Memoir on the Cotton of Egypt\" (1841); \"Appeal to the Antiquaries of Europe on the Destruction of the Monuments of Egypt\" (1841); \"Discourses on Egyptian Archaeology\" (1849); \"Types of Mankind\" (1854), in conjunction with J. C. Nott; and \"Indigenous Races of the Earth\" (1857), also in conjunction with Nott and others.\n\nGliddon was influenced by Samuel George Morton's craniometry and polygenist theory of human origins. Morton collected hundreds of human skulls from around the world and tried to classify them. Morton claimed that he could judge the intellectual capacity of a race by the cranial capacity (the measure of the volume of the interior of the skull). In Morton's theory, a large skull meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. By studying these skulls he claimed that the evidence supported polygenism, that each race had a separate origin. Morton had many skulls from Ancient Egypt, and concluded that the ancient Egyptians were not African, but were instead Caucasians.\n\nMorton's followers, particularly Gliddon and Josiah Nott in their monumental tribute to Morton's work, \"Types of Mankind\" (1854), carried Morton's ideas further and backed up Morton's findings which supported the notion of polygenism, which contends that humanity originates from different lineages and is the ancestor of the multiregional hypothesis.\n\nGliddon collaborated with Morton on several published works; they shared many views on human races. Morton had sent Gliddon over 100 Egyptian crania specimens. Gliddon was a popular lecturer and researcher on Egyptology and from his studies of ancient Egyptian monuments and hieroglyphics, he concluded that the Egyptians had been white, and that even in the ancient world there had been distinctly different races. He posited that Whites and Negroes had never changed their racial appearance and features. He believed that neither environment or climate could change a race into another. He rejected Monogenesis, and claimed that the Bible supported Polygenisis. Gliddon believed the differences of the races had been impressed upon them by the Creator himself since the beginning.\n\nGeorge Robbins Gliddon died of Yellow Fever on November 16, 1857 in Panama. He was buried in Panama but later re-interred in Philadelphia at the instigation of his friend, archaeologist E. G. Squier.\n\n\n"}

IAEA was founded at the first international congress in Paris in 1965 by Daniel Berlyne, Robert Francés, Carmelo Genovese, and Albert Wellek. \n\nAlthough IAEA has been active for half a century, the domain of experimental aesthetics is much older. It is the second-oldest branch of scientific psychology, traditionally dating from 1876, the year Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887) published his \"Vorschule der Aesthetik\" (Preschool of Aesthetics). Fechner, who also is credited with founding psychophysics, established methods for examining aesthetic response to a variety of visual forms, including an exploration of the venerable Golden Section hypothesis. Since the inception of IAEA in 1965, research on empirical aesthetics has continued to progress, with many pioneers prominent in its membership: witness, for instance, such classic books such as Daniel Berlyne’s (1971) \"Aesthetics and Psychobiology\", Colin Martindale’s (1990) \"The Clockwork Muse: The Predictability of Artistic Change\", or a variety of more recent contributions from IAEA’s current members.\n\nThe International Association of Empirical Aesthetics (IAEA) is an organization of researchers who use scientific methods to investigate aesthetic experience and aesthetic behavior in a wide variety of domains, including encounters with beauty, visual art, music, literature, film, theater, philosophy, and museum behavior.

An object in this state is said to be \"invisible\" (literally, \"not visible\"). The term is often used in fantasy/science fiction, where objects cannot be seen by magical or technological means; however, its effects can also be demonstrated in the real world, particularly in physics and perceptual psychology classes.\n\nSince objects can be seen by light in the visible spectrum from a source reflecting off their surfaces and hitting the viewer's eye, the most natural form of invisibility (whether real or fictional) is an object that neither reflects nor absorbs light (that is, it allows light to pass through it). This is known as \ntransparency, and is seen in many naturally occurring materials (although no naturally occurring material is 100% transparent).\n\nInvisibility perception depends on several optical and visual factors. For example, invisibility depends on the eyes of the observer and/or the instruments used. Thus an object can be classified as \"invisible to\" a person, animal, instrument, etc. In research on sensorial perception it has been shown that invisibility is perceived in cycles.\n\nInvisibility is often considered to be the supreme form of camouflage, as it does not reveal to the viewer any kind of vital signs, visual effects, or any frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum detectable to the human eye, instead making use of radio, infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.\n\nIn illusion optics, invisibility is a special case of illusion effects: the illusion of free space.\n\nTechnology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible:\n\nEngineers and scientists have performed various kinds of research to investigate the possibility of finding ways to create real optical invisibility (cloaks) for objects. Methods are typically based on implementing the theoretical techniques of transformation optics, which have given rise to several theories of cloaking.\n\nA person can be described as invisible if others refuse to see him or routinely overlook him. The term was used in this manner in the title of the book \"Invisible Man\", by Ralph Ellison, in reference to the protagonist, likely modeled after the author, being overlooked on account of his status as an African American. This is supported by the quote taken from the Prologue, \"I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.\" (Prologue.1)\n\nIn fiction, people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means:\n\n\nIn some works, the power of magic creates an effective means of invisibility by distracting anyone who might notice the character. But since the character is not truly invisible, the effect could be betrayed by mirrors or other reflective surfaces.\n\nWhere magical invisibility is concerned, the issue may arise of whether the clothing worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible. In general they are also regarded as being invisible, but in some instances clothing remains visible and must be removed for the full invisibility effect.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4522976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4522976", "title": "LGBT symbols", "text": "LGBT symbols\n\nThe LGBT community has adopted certain symbols for self-identification to demonstrate unity, pride, shared values, and allegiance to one another. LGBT symbols communicate ideas, concepts, and identity both within their communities and to mainstream culture. The two most-recognized international LGBT symbols are the pink triangle and the rainbow flag. The pink triangle, employed by the Nazis in World War II as a badge of shame, was re-appropriated but retained negative connotations. The rainbow flag, previously used as a symbol of unity among all people, was adopted to be a more organic and natural replacement without any negativity attached to it.\n\nGilbert Baker designed the rainbow Pride flag for the 1978 San Francisco Gay Freedom Celebration. The flag does not depict an actual rainbow. Rather, the colors of the rainbow are displayed as horizontal stripes, with red at the top and violet at the bottom. It represents the diversity of gays and lesbians around the world. In the original eight-color version, pink stood for sexuality, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for the sun, green for nature, turquoise for art, indigo for harmony, and violet for spirit. A copy of the original 20-by-30 foot, eight-color flag was remade by Baker in 2000, and was installed in the Castro district in San Francisco. Another similar flag flies at The Center in New York City.\n\nThe asexual pride flag consists of four horizontal stripes: black, grey, white, and purple from top to bottom. The black stripe represents asexuality, the grey stripe for the \"grey area\" between sexual and asexual, the white stripe for sexuality, and the purple stripe for community.\n\nIn August 2010, after a process of getting the word out beyond the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) and to non-English speaking areas, a flag was chosen following a vote on a non-AVEN site. It had been seen alongside other sexual orientation flags previous to formal election and has since been seen used in various LGBT publications and causes.\n\nThe AVEN logo is a triangle fading from white to black to symbolise the gradient between sexuals, gray-asexuals, demisexuals, and asexuals.\n\nThe ace of spades and ace of hearts are also used as asexual symbols as \"ace\" is a phonetic shortening of asexual. Similarly, \"aro\" is commonly used as an abbreviation for aromantic. Generally, romantic asexuals use the ace of hearts as their symbol, and aromantic asexuals use the ace of spades.\n\nAnother common symbol for the asexual community is a black ring worn on the middle finger of their right hand. The material and exact design of the ring are not important as long as it is primarily black. This symbol also found its start on AVEN in 2005.\n\n\"Bear\" is an affectionate gay slang term for those in the bear communities, a subculture in the gay community and an emerging subset of the LGBT community with its own events, codes, and culture-specific identity. Bears tend to have hairy bodies and facial hair; some are heavy-set; some project an image of working-class masculinity in their grooming and appearance, though none of these are requirements or unique indicators. The bear concept can function as an identity, an affiliation, and an ideal to live up to. There is ongoing debate in bear communities about what constitutes a bear. Some state that self-identifying as a bear is the only requirement, while others argue that bears must have certain physical characteristics, such as a hairy chest and face, a large body, or a certain mode of dress and behavior.\n\nBears are almost always gay or bisexual men; transgender men (regardless of their sexuality) and those who shun labels for gender and sexuality are increasingly included within bear communities. The bear community has spread all over the world, with bear clubs in many countries. Bear clubs often serve as social and sexual networks for older, hairier, sometimes heavier gay and bisexual men, and members often contribute to their local gay communities through fundraising and other functions. Bear events are common in heavily gay communities.\n\nThe International Bear Brotherhood Flag was designed in 1995 by Craig Byrnes.\n\nFirst unveiled on 5 December 1998, the bisexual pride flag was designed by Michael Page to represent and increase visibility of bisexuals in the LGBT community and society as a whole. This rectangular flag consists of a broad magenta stripe at the top, a broad stripe in blue at the bottom, and a narrower deep lavender band occupying the central fifth.\n\nPage describes the meaning of the pink, lavender, and blue (ratio 2:1:2) flag as this: \"The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only (gay and lesbian). The blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only (straight) and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi).\"\nHe also describes the flag's meaning in deeper terms, stating \"The key to understanding the symbolism of the Bisexual pride flag is to know that the purple pixels of color blend unnoticeably into both the pink and blue, just as in the 'real world,' where bi people blend unnoticeably into both the gay/lesbian and straight communities.\n\nThe blue and pink overlapping triangle symbol represents bisexuality and bi pride. The origin of the symbol, sometimes facetiously referred to as the \"biangles\", is largely unknown, however the colours of bisexuality originate from this symbol: pink for attraction to women, blue for attraction to men, and lavender for attraction to both, as well as a reference to queerness.\n\nIntersex people are those who do not exhibit all the biological characteristics of male or female, or exhibit a combination of characteristics, at birth. Between 0.05% and 1.7% of the population is estimated to have intersex traits.\n\nThe intersex pride flag was created by Intersex Human Rights Australia in July 2013 to create a flag \"that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning\". The organisation describes yellow and purple as \"hermaphrodite\" colors. The organisation describes the circle as \"unbroken and unornamented, symbolising wholeness and completeness, and our potentialities. We are still fighting for bodily autonomy and genital integrity, and this symbolises the right to be who and how we want to be\".\n\nThe labrys lesbian pride flag, created in 1999, involves a labrys superimposed on an inverted black triangle, set against a violet hue background. The labrys was used as an ancient religious symbol and for other various purposes. It was adopted as a symbol of empowerment by the lesbian feminist community in the 1970s.\n\nWomen considered asocial by the Third Reich because they did not conform to the Nazi ideal of a woman, which included homosexual females, were condemned to concentration camps and wore the black badge to identify them. Some lesbians reclaimed this symbol as gay men reclaimed the pink triangle, and many lesbians also reclaimed the pink triangle although lesbians were not included in Paragraph 175 of the German criminal code.\n\nThe pansexual pride flag has been found on various Internet sites since mid-2010. It has three horizontal bars that are pink, yellow and blue. The pink band symbolizes women; the blue, men; and the yellow, those of a non-binary gender, such as agender, bigender or genderfluid.\n\nA \"P\" with the tail converted to an arrow with a cross is also sometimes used. It predates the flag and is still in use today. The cross on the \"P\"'s tail refers to the cross on the Venus or female symbol (♀), and the arrow refers to the arrow on the Mars or male symbol (♂). While it does not technically have a name, it is sometimes colloquially referred to as \"the pansexual symbol\".\nIn the United Kingdom, since 2006 the \"Pink Jack\" has been widely used to represent a uniquely British LGBT identity.\nA transgender symbol is the Transgender Pride Flag designed by transgender woman Monica Helms in 1999, which was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona, USA in 2000. It was flown from a large public flagpole in San Francisco's Castro District beginning November 19, 2012 in commemoration of the Transgender Day of Remembrance. The flag represents the transgender community and consists of five horizontal stripes: two light blue, two pink, with a white stripe in the center. Helms described the meaning of the flag as follows:\n\nPhiladelphia became the first county government in the U.S. to raise the transgender pride flag in 2015. It was raised at City Hall in honor of Philadelphia's 14th Annual Trans Health Conference, and remained next to the US and City of Philadelphia flags for the entirety of the conference. Then-Mayor Michael Nutter gave a speech in honor of the trans community's acceptance in Philadelphia.\n\nA symbol of the female (♀), male (♂) and Genderqueer (⚨) symbols combined around a circle is sometimes used to represent transgender people.\n\nAlso under the trans or transgender umbrella are all those who identify off the gender binary. There are many different identities within this category including genderqueer, two-spirit, gender fluid, third gender, and androgyny.\n\nIn addition to major symbols of the LGBT community, less-popular symbols have been used to represent members' unity, pride, shared values, and allegiance to one another.\n\nIn the Society for Creative Anachronism, LGBT members often wear a blue feather to indicate an affiliation with Clan Blue Feather, a group of SCA members promoting the study of LGBT culture and people in the Middle Ages. Because of this affiliation, blue feathers have also been used at some Renaissance Faires and Pagan events.\n\nAccording to some interpretations, American poet Walt Whitman used the calamus plant to represent homoerotic love.\n\nInterlocked gender symbols. Each gender symbol derives from the astronomical symbol for the planet Venus and Mars. In modern science, the singular symbol for Venus is used to represent the female sex, and singular symbol for Mars is used to represent the male sex. Two interlocking female symbols (⚢) represent a lesbian or the lesbian community, and two interlocking male symbols (⚣) a gay male or the gay male community.\n\nThe symbols first appeared in the 1970s.\nFreedom rings, designed by David Spada, are six aluminum rings, each in one of the colors of the rainbow flag. They were released in 1991.\nSymbolizing happiness and diversity, these rings are worn by themselves or as part of necklaces, bracelets, and key chains.\n\nThey are sometimes referred to as \"Fruit Loops\".\n\nIn , green indicated homosexual affiliations. Victorian gay men would often pin a green carnation on their lapel as popularized by openly gay author Oscar Wilde, who often wore one on his lapel.\n\nIn the early 20th century gay men in New York City's Caucasian professional world would often wear red neckties to signal their identity. This practice was later expanded into a system called flagging, or the hanky code.\n\nIn 1970, graphic designer Tom Doerr selected the lower-case Greek letter lambda to be the symbol of the New York chapter of the Gay Activists Alliance. The alliance's literature states that Doerr chose the symbol specifically for its denotative meaning in the context of chemistry and physics: \"a complete exchange of energy–that moment or span of time witness to absolute activity\". Within the STEM field, the lambda symbol is associated with the half-life parameter of exponential random variables, which describes the time it takes for a state to change.\n\nThe lambda became associated with Gay Liberation, and in December 1974, it was officially declared the international symbol for gay and lesbian rights by the International Gay Rights Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland. The gay rights organization Lambda Legal and the American Lambda Literary Foundation derive their names from this symbol.\n\nOn October 31, 1969, sixty members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) staged a protest outside the offices of the \"San Francisco Examiner\" in response to a series of news articles disparaging LGBT people in San Francisco's gay bars and clubs. The peaceful protest against the \"homophobic editorial policies\" of the \"Examiner\" turned tumultuous and were later called \"Friday of the Purple Hand\" and \"Bloody Friday of the Purple Hand\". Examiner employees \"dumped a bag of printers' ink from the third story window of the newspaper building onto the crowd\". Some reports state that it was a barrel of ink poured from the roof of the building. The protesters \"used the ink to scrawl 'Gay Power' and other slogans on the building walls\" and stamp purple hand prints \"throughout downtown San Francisco\" resulting in \"one of the most visible demonstrations of gay power\". According to Larry LittleJohn, then president of SIR, \"At that point, the tactical squad arrived – not to get the employees who dumped the ink, but to arrest the demonstrators. Somebody could have been hurt if that ink had gotten into their eyes, but the police were knocking people to the ground.\" The accounts of police brutality include women being thrown to the ground and protesters' teeth being knocked out.\n\nInspired by Black Hand extortion methods of Camorra gangsters and the Mafia, some gay and lesbian activists attempted to institute \"purple hand\" as a warning to stop anti-gay attacks, but with little success. In Turkey, the LGBT rights organization MorEl Eskişehir LGBTT Oluşumu (Purple Hand Eskişehir LGBT Formation), also bears the name of this symbol.\n\nUnicorns have been part of pride flags and symbols of LGBT culture in the last century and It became prominent during the gay rights protests of the 1970s and 1980s.\nViolets and their color became a special code used by lesbians and bisexual women. The symbolism of the flower derives from several fragments of poems by Sappho in which she describes a lover wearing garlands or a crown with violets. In 1926, the play \"La Prisonnière\" by Édouard Bourdet used a bouquet of violets to signify lesbian love. When the play became subject to censorship, many Parisian lesbians wore violets to demonstrate solidarity with its lesbian subject matter.\n\nOne of the oldest of these symbols is the inverted pink triangle that male homosexuals in Nazi concentration camps were required to wear on their clothing. The badge is one of several badges that internees wore to identify what kind of prisoners they were. Many of the estimated 5–15,000 gay men and lesbians imprisoned in concentration camps died during the Holocaust. The pink triangle was later reclaimed by gay men, as well as some lesbians, in various political movements as a symbol of personal pride and remembrance. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP) adopted the inverted pink triangle to symbolize the \"active fight back\" against HIV/AIDS \"rather than a passive resignation to fate.\"\n\nThe pink triangle was used exclusively with male prisoners, as lesbians were not included under Paragraph 175, a statute which made homosexual acts between males a crime. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) stipulates that this was because women were seen as subordinate to men, and the Nazi state did not feel that homosexual women presented the same threat to masculinity as homosexual men. According to USHMM, many women were arrested and imprisoned for \"asocial\" behaviour, a classification applied to those who did not conform to the Nazi ideal of a woman's role: cooking, cleaning, kitchen work, child raising, and passivity. Asocial women were tagged with an inverted black triangle. Many lesbians reclaimed this symbol for themselves as gay men reclaimed the pink triangle.\n\n\n"}

By their nature, very distant objects tend to be very faint, and these distance determinations are difficult and subject to errors. An important distinction is whether the distance is determined via spectroscopy or using a photometric redshift technique. The former is generally both more precise and also more reliable, in the sense that photometric redshifts are more prone to being wrong due to confusion with lower redshift sources that have unusual spectra. For that reason, a spectroscopic redshift is conventionally regarded as being necessary for an object's distance to be considered definitely known, whereas photometrically determined redshifts identify \"candidate\" very distant sources. Here, this distinction is indicated by a \"p\" subscript for photometric redshifts.\n\n1 Gly = 1 billion light-years.\n\n, there were about 50 possible objects z = 8 or farther, and another 100 z = 7 candidates, based on photometric redshift estimates released by the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) project from observations made between mid-2002 and December 2012.

MM is most commonly applied to digital images, but it can be employed as well on graphs, surface meshes, solids, and many other spatial structures.\n\nTopological and geometrical continuous-space concepts such as size, shape, convexity, connectivity, and geodesic distance, were introduced by MM on both continuous and discrete spaces. MM is also the foundation of morphological image processing, which consists of a set of operators that transform images according to the above characterizations.\n\nThe basic morphological operators are erosion, dilation, opening and closing.\n\nMM was originally developed for binary images, and was later extended to grayscale functions and images. The subsequent generalization to complete lattices is widely accepted today as MM's theoretical foundation.\n\nEver since the 1960s, all sorts of schemes for nonlinear processing of images have been discussed and used in particular communities. An example originally popular in the earth and environmental sciences is mathematical morphology, based on \"dilation\" of data consisting of 0's and 1's with a \"structuring element\" σ according to Sign[ListConvolve[σ, data, 1, 0]] (as well as the dual operation of \"erosion\"). Mathematical Morphology was developed 1964 by the collaborative work of Georges Matheron and Jean Serra, at the \"École des Mines de Paris\", France. Matheron supervised the PhD thesis of Serra, devoted to the quantification of mineral characteristics from thin cross sections, and this work resulted in a novel practical approach, as well as theoretical advancements in integral geometry and topology.\n\nIn 1968, the \"Centre de Morphologie Mathématique\" was founded by the École des Mines de Paris in Fontainebleau, France, led by Matheron and Serra.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1960s and most of the 1970s, MM dealt essentially with binary images, treated as sets, and generated a large number of binary operators and techniques: Hit-or-miss transform, dilation, erosion, opening, closing, granulometry, thinning, skeletonization, ultimate erosion, conditional bisector, and others. A random approach was also developed, based on novel image models. Most of the work in that period was developed in Fontainebleau.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, MM was generalized to grayscale functions and images as well. Besides extending the main concepts (such as dilation, erosion, etc.) to functions, this generalization yielded new operators, such as morphological gradients, top-hat transform and the Watershed (MM's main segmentation approach).\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, MM gained a wider recognition, as research centers in several countries began to adopt and investigate the method. MM started to be applied to a large number of imaging problems and applications.\n\nIn 1986, Serra further generalized MM, this time to a theoretical framework based on complete lattices. This generalization brought flexibility to the theory, enabling its application to a much larger number of structures, including color images, video, graphs, meshes, etc. At the same time, Matheron and Serra also formulated a theory for morphological filtering, based on the new lattice framework.\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s also saw further theoretical advancements, including the concepts of \"connections\" and \"levelings\".\n\nIn 1993, the first International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology (ISMM) took place in Barcelona, Spain. Since then, ISMMs are organized every 2–3 years: Fontainebleau, France (1994); Atlanta, USA (1996); Amsterdam, Netherlands (1998); Palo Alto, CA, USA (2000); Sydney, Australia (2002); Paris, France (2005); Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2007); Groningen, Netherlands (2009); Intra (Verbania), Italy (2011); Uppsala, Sweden (2013); Reykjavik, Iceland (2015); and Fontainebleau, France (2017).\n\n\nIn binary morphology, an image is viewed as a subset of a Euclidean space formula_1 or the integer grid formula_2, for some dimension \"d\".\n\nThe basic idea in binary morphology is to probe an image with a simple, pre-defined shape, drawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the image. This simple \"probe\" is called the structuring element, and is itself a binary image (i.e., a subset of the space or grid).\n\nHere are some examples of widely used structuring elements (denoted by \"B\"):\n\n\nThe basic operations are shift-invariant (translation invariant) operators strongly related to Minkowski addition.\n\nLet \"E\" be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, and \"A\" a binary image in \"E\".\n\nThe erosion of the binary image \"A\" by the structuring element \"B\" is defined by:\n\nwhere \"B\" is the translation of \"B\" by the vector \"z\", i.e., formula_7, formula_8.\n\nWhen the structuring element \"B\" has a center (e.g., \"B\" is a disk or a square), and this center is located on the origin of \"E\", then the erosion of \"A\" by \"B\" can be understood as the locus of points reached by the center of \"B\" when \"B\" moves inside \"A\". For example, the erosion of a square of side 10, centered at the origin, by a disc of radius 2, also centered at the origin, is a square of side 6 centered at the origin.\n\nThe erosion of \"A\" by \"B\" is also given by the expression: formula_9.\n\nExample application: Assume we have received a fax of a dark photocopy. Everything looks like it was written with a pen that is bleeding. Erosion process will allow thicker lines to get skinny and detect the hole inside the letter \"o\".\n\nThe dilation of \"A\" by the structuring element \"B\" is defined by:\n\nThe dilation is commutative, also given by: formula_11.\n\nIf \"B\" has a center on the origin, as before, then the dilation of \"A\" by \"B\" can be understood as the locus of the points covered by \"B\" when the center of \"B\" moves inside \"A\". In the above example, the dilation of the square of side 10 by the disk of radius 2 is a square of side 14, with rounded corners, centered at the origin. The radius of the rounded corners is 2.\n\nThe dilation can also be obtained by: formula_12, where \"B\" denotes the symmetric of \"B\", that is, formula_13.\n\nExample application: Dilation is the dual operation of the erosion. Figures that are very lightly drawn get thick when \"dilated\". Easiest way to describe it is to imagine the same fax/text is written with a thicker pen.\n\nThe opening of \"A\" by \"B\" is obtained by the erosion of \"A\" by \"B\", followed by dilation of the resulting image by \"B\":\n\nThe opening is also given by formula_15, which means that it is the locus of translations of the structuring element \"B\" inside the image \"A\". In the case of the square of side 10, and a disc of radius 2 as the structuring element, the opening is a square of side 10 with rounded corners, where the corner radius is 2.\n\nExample application: Let's assume someone has written a note on a non-soaking paper and that the writing looks as if it is growing tiny hairy roots all over. Opening essentially removes the outer tiny \"hairline\" leaks and restores the text. The side effect is that it rounds off things. The sharp edges start to disappear.\n\nThe closing of \"A\" by \"B\" is obtained by the dilation of \"A\" by \"B\", followed by erosion of the resulting structure by \"B\":\n\nThe closing can also be obtained by formula_17, where \"X\" denotes the complement of \"X\" relative to \"E\" (that is, formula_18). The above means that the closing is the complement of the locus of translations of the symmetric of the structuring element outside the image \"A\".\n\nHere are some properties of the basic binary morphological operators (dilation, erosion, opening and closing):\n\n\n\nIn grayscale morphology, images are functions mapping a Euclidean space or grid \"E\" into formula_32, where formula_33 is the set of reals, formula_34 is an element larger than any real number, and formula_35 is an element smaller than any real number.\n\nGrayscale structuring elements are also functions of the same format, called \"structuring functions\".\n\nDenoting an image by \"f(x)\" and the structuring function by \"b(x)\", the grayscale dilation of \"f\" by \"b\" is given by\n\nwhere \"sup\" denotes the supremum.\n\nSimilarly, the erosion of \"f\" by \"b\" is given by\n\nwhere \"inf\" denotes the infimum.\n\nJust like in binary morphology, the opening and closing are given respectively by\n\nIt is common to use flat structuring elements in morphological applications. Flat structuring functions are functions \"b(x)\" in the form\n\nwhere formula_41.\n\nIn this case, the dilation and erosion are greatly simplified, and given respectively by\n\nIn the bounded, discrete case (\"E\" is a grid and \"B\" is bounded), the supremum and infimum operators can be replaced by the maximum and minimum. Thus, dilation and erosion are particular cases of order statistics filters, with dilation returning the maximum value within a moving window (the symmetric of the structuring function support \"B\"), and the erosion returning the minimum value within the moving window \"B\".\n\nIn the case of flat structuring element, the morphological operators depend only on the relative ordering of pixel values, regardless their numerical values, and therefore are especially suited to the processing of binary images and grayscale images whose light transfer function is not known.\n\n\nBy combining these operators one can obtain algorithms for many image processing tasks, such as feature detection, image segmentation, image sharpening, image filtering, and classification.\nAlong this line one should also look into Continuous Morphology \n\nComplete lattices are partially ordered sets, where every subset has an infimum and a supremum. In particular, it contains a least element and a greatest element (also denoted \"universe\").\n\nLet formula_44 be a complete lattice, with infimum and supremum symbolized by formula_45 and formula_46, respectively. Its universe and least element are symbolized by \"U\" and formula_47, respectively. Moreover, let formula_48 be a collection of elements from \"L\".\n\nA dilation is any operator formula_49 that distributes over the supremum, and preserves the least element. I.e.:\n\nAn erosion is any operator formula_52 that distributes over the infimum, and preserves the universe. I.e.:\n\nDilations and erosions form Galois connections. That is, for every dilation formula_55 there is one and only one erosion formula_56 that satisfies\n\nfor all formula_58.\n\nSimilarly, for every erosion there is one and only one dilation satisfying the above connection.\n\nFurthermore, if two operators satisfy the connection, then formula_55 must be a dilation, and formula_56 an erosion.\n\nPairs of erosions and dilations satisfying the above connection are called \"adjunctions\", and the erosion is said to be the adjoint erosion of the dilation, and vice versa.\n\nFor every adjunction formula_61, the morphological opening formula_62 and morphological closing formula_63 are defined as follows:\n\nThe morphological opening and closing are particular cases of algebraic opening (or simply opening) and algebraic closing (or simply closing). Algebraic openings are operators in \"L\" that are idempotent, increasing, and anti-extensive. Algebraic closings are operators in \"L\" that are idempotent, increasing, and extensive.\n\nBinary morphology is a particular case of lattice morphology, where \"L\" is the power set of \"E\" (Euclidean space or grid), that is, \"L\" is the set of all subsets of \"E\", and formula_66 is the set inclusion. In this case, the infimum is set intersection, and the supremum is set union.\n\nSimilarly, grayscale morphology is another particular case, where \"L\" is the set of functions mapping \"E\" into formula_32, and formula_66, formula_46, and formula_45, are the point-wise order, supremum, and infimum, respectively. That is, is \"f\" and \"g\" are functions in \"L\", then formula_71 if and only if formula_72; the infimum formula_73 is given by formula_74; and the supremum formula_75 is given by formula_76.\n\n\n\n"}

Similar to standard photolithography techniques, structuring is accomplished by illuminating negative-tone or positive-tone photoresists via light of a well-defined wavelength. The fundamental difference is, however, the avoidance of reticles. Instead, two-photon absorption is utilized to induce a dramatic change in the solubility of the resist for appropriate developers.\n\nHence, multiphoton lithography is a technique for creating small features in a photosensitive material, without the use of complex optical systems or photomasks. This method relies on a multi-photon absorption process in a material that is transparent at the wavelength of the laser used for creating the pattern. By scanning and properly modulating the laser, a chemical change (usually polymerization) occurs at the focal spot of the laser and can be controlled to create an arbitrary three-dimensional periodic or non-periodic pattern. This method has been used for rapid prototyping of structures with fine features.\n\nTwo-photon absorption is a third-order with respect to the third-order optical susceptibility formula_1 and a second-order process with respect to light intensity. For this reason it is a non-linear process several orders of magnitude weaker than linear absorption, thus very high light intensities are required to increase the number of such rare events. For example, tightly-focused laser beams provide the needed intensities. Here, pulsed laser sources are preferred as they deliver high-intensity pulses while depositing a relatively low average energy. To enable 3D structuring, the light source must be adequately adapted to the photoresist in that single-photon absorption is highly suppressed while two-photon absorption is favoured. This condition is met if and only if the resist is highly transparent for the laser light's output wavelength λ and, simultaneously, absorbing at λ/2. As a result, a given sample relative to the focused laser beam can be scanned while changing the resist's solubility only in a confined volume. The geometry of the latter mainly depends on the iso-intensity surfaces of the focus. Concretely, those regions of the laser beam which exceed a given exposure threshold of the photosensitive medium define the basic building block, the so-called \"voxel\". Other parameters which influence the actual shape of the voxel are the laser mode and the refractive-index mismatch between the resist and the immersion system leading to spherical aberration.\n\nIt was found that polarization effects in laser 3D nanolithography can be employed to fine-tune the feature sizes (and corresponding aspect ratio) in the structuring of photoresists. This proves polarization to be a variable parameter next to laser power (intensity), scanning speed (exposure duration), accumulated dose, etc.\n\n\n"}

This summary might include sums, averages, or other statistics, which the pivot table groups together in a meaningful way.\n\nPivot tables are a technique in data processing. They enable a person to arrange and rearrange (or \"pivot\") statistics in order to draw attention to useful information.\n\nAlthough \"pivot table\" is a generic term, Microsoft Corporation trademarked \"PivotTable\" in the United States in 1994.\n\nIn their book \"Pivot Table Data Crunching\", Bill Jelen and Mike Alexander refer to Pito Salas as the \"father of pivot tables\". While working on a concept for a new program that would eventually become Lotus Improv, Salas noted that spreadsheets have patterns of data. A tool that could help the user recognize these patterns would help to build advanced data models quickly. With Improv, users could define and store sets of categories, then change views by dragging category names with the mouse. This core functionality would provide the model for pivot tables.\n\nLotus Development released Improv in 1991 on the NeXT platform. A few months after the release of Improv, Brio Technology published a standalone Macintosh implementation, called DataPivot (with technology eventually patented in 1999). Borland purchased the DataPivot technology in 1992 and implemented it in their own spreadsheet application, Quattro Pro.\n\nIn 1993 the Microsoft Windows version of Improv appeared. Early in 1994 Microsoft Excel 5 brought a new functionality called a \"PivotTable\" to market. Microsoft further improved this feature in later versions of Excel:\n\n\nIn 2007 Oracle Corporation made codice_1 and codice_2 operators available in Oracle Database 11g.\n\nFor typical data entry and storage, data usually appear in \"flat\" tables, meaning that they consist of only columns and rows, as in the following portion of a sample spreadsheet showing data on shirt types:\n\nWhile tables such as these can contain many data items, it can be difficult to get summarized information from them. A pivot table can help quickly summarize the data and highlight the desired information. The usage of a pivot table is extremely broad and depends on the situation. The first question to ask is, \"What am I seeking?\" In the example here, let us ask, \"How many \"Units\" did we sell in each \"Region\" for every \"Ship Date?\"\":\n\nA pivot table usually consists of \"row\", \"column\" and \"data\" (or \"fact\") fields. In this case, the column is \"Ship Date\", the row is \"Region\" and the data we would like to see is (sum of) \"Units\". These fields allow several kinds of aggregations, including: sum, average, standard deviation, count, etc. In this case, the total number of units shipped is displayed here using a \"sum\" aggregation.\n\nUsing the example above, software will find all distinct values for \"Region\". In this case, they are: \"North\", \"South\", \"East\", \"West\". Furthermore, it will find all distinct values for \"Ship Date\". Based on the aggregation type, \"sum\", it will summarize the fact, the quantities of \"Unit\", and display them in a multidimensional chart. In the example above, the first datum is 66. This number was obtained by finding all records where both \"Region\" was \"East\" and \"Ship Date\" was \"1/31/2005\", and adding the \"Units\" of that collection of records (\"i.e.\", cells E2 to E7) together to get a final result.\n\nPivot tables are not created automatically. For example, in Microsoft Excel one must first select the entire data in the original table and then go to the Insert tab and select \"Pivot Table\" (or \"Pivot Chart\"). The user then has the option of either inserting the pivot table into an existing sheet or creating a new sheet to house the pivot table. A pivot table field list is provided to the user which lists all the column headers present in the data. For instance, if a table represents sales data of a company, it might include Date of sale, Sales person, Item sold, Color of item, Units sold, Per unit price, and Total price. This makes the data more readily accessible.\n\nThe fields that would be created will be visible on the right hand side of the worksheet. By default, the pivot table layout design will appear below this list.\n\nEach of the fields from the list can be dragged on to this layout, which has four options :\n\nReport filter is used to apply a filter to an entire table. For example, if the \"Color of Item\" field is dragged to this area, then the table constructed will have a report filter inserted above the table. This report filter will have drop-down options (Black, Red, and White in the example above). When an option is chosen from this drop-down list (\"Black\" in this example), then the table that would be visible will contain only the data from those rows that have the \"Color of Item = Black\".\n\nColumn labels are used to apply a filter to one or more columns that have to be shown in the pivot table. For instance if the \"Sales person\" field is dragged to this area, then the table constructed will have values from the column \"Sales Person\", \"i.e.\", one will have number of columns equal to the number of \"Sales person\". There will also be one added column of Total. In the example above, this instruction will create five columns in the table — one for each sales person, and Grand Total. There will be a filter above the data — column labels — from which one can select or deselect a particular sales person for the pivot table.\n\nThis table will not have any numerical values as no numerical field is selected but when it is selected, the values will automatically get updated in the column of \"Grand total\".\n\nRow labels are used to apply a filter to one or more rows that have to be shown in the pivot table. For instance if the \"Sales person\" field is dragged on this area then the other output table constructed will have values from the column \"Sales person\", \"i.e.\", one will have number of rows equal to the number of \"Sales Person\". There will also be one added row of \"Grand Total\". In the example above, this instruction will create five rows in the table — one for each sales person, and Grand Total. There will be a filter above the data — row labels — from which one can select or deselect a particular sales person for the Pivot table.\n\nThis table will not have any numerical values, as no numerical field is selected, but when it is selected, the values will automatically get updated in the Row of \"Grand Total\".\n\nThis usually takes a field that has numerical values that can be used for different types of calculations. However, using text values would also not be wrong; instead of Sum it will give a count. So, in the example above, if the \"Units sold\" field is dragged to this area along with row label of \"Sales person\", then the instruction will add a new column, \"Sum of units sold\", which will have values against each sales person.\n\nPivot tables or pivot functionality are an integral part of many spreadsheet applications and some database software, as well as being found in other data visualization tools and business intelligence packages.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcel pivot tables include the feature to directly query an online analytical processing (OLAP) server for retrieving data instead of getting the data from an Excel spreadsheet. On this configuration a pivot table is a simple client of an OLAP server. Excel's PivotTable not only allows for connecting to Microsoft's Analysis Service, but to any XML for Analysis (XMLA) OLAP standard-compliant server.\n\n"}

Ron Hubbard and his better-known conception of Scientology, though this interpretation is disputed.\n\nNordenholz highlights the problem of isolating knowledge as \"a particular appearance of the world.\" He asks:\n\nAfter establishing a number of definitions, he concludes that\n\nHe goes on to assert that human consciousness can be raised to a position of independence, or isolation, but notes that \"The consciousness, which always remains a part and particular creation of the world, is incompetent to create from a nothingness because of this very worldliness. In order for the consciousness to be able to create, it has to first find a fountainhead source out of which it can create, and this Something is a Beingness.\"\n\nNordenholz next introduces the concept of a number of axioms and systems which \"stand of their\nown power and dignity, \"as if\" they were capable of, but do not need, a verification or confirmation from another source.\" He defines the structure of Scientologie:\n\nNordenholz held that the most important axiom was the Axiom of Mediation:\n\nGeorge Malko claims that Nordenholz's concept of Scientologie has no proven connection to Scientology, which was created later by L. Ron Hubbard, although he notes some possible similarities between the ideas expounded by Nordenholz and Hubbard. Roy Wallis casts doubt on the perceived similarities, noting that Malko had used an English translation produced in 1968 by a former Scientologist, Woodward R. McPheeters. Wallis comments: \n\nHe also notes that there is no evidence that Hubbard could read German.\n\nFurthermore, the Free Zone association of independent scientologists (Freie Zone e.V.) considers the parallels in content sufficiently valid to republish it \"in its original context\".\n\nThe term \"Scientologie\" is a registered trademark of the Religious Technology Center, which controls the Church of Scientology's trademarks. It is used in French-speaking countries as a localized version of the word \"Scientology\", though in Germany the church uses \"Scientology\" instead.\n\nThe Church is currently in dispute with Free Zone Scientologists who have schismed off into their own offshoot of Scientology. They use the domain name \"scientologie.de\" for their website; the Church has attempted to force the Free Zoners to relinquish this domain name, claiming trademark infringement. But the German courts have rejected this in the light of Nordenholz having coined the term long before the church registered it as a trademark; also refusing the argument of \"possible confusion\" because Free Zone \"per se\" does not sell courses nor indeed anything else; and that the use of a similar name in these circumstances was covered by the \"fair use\" policy.\n\nThe English-language term \"Scientology\" originated neither with Hubbard nor Nordenholz, but with philologist Allen Upward, who coined the term in 1907 in his book \"The New Word\". \nThis reference is cited to be a use of the word to ridicule pseudoscientific theories in the book \"A Piece of Blue Sky\" by Jon Atack.\n\n\"...unhappily scientology is as often mistaken for science as theology is for worship.\" \n\n"}

{"id": "2663709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2663709", "title": "Third-person effect", "text": "Third-person effect\n\nThe Third-person effect hypothesis predicts that people tend to perceive that mass media messages have a greater effect on others than on themselves, based on personal biases. The Third-person effect manifests itself through an individual’s overestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on the generalized other, or an underestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on themselves.\n\nThese types of perceptions stem from a self-motivated social desirability (not feeling influenced by mass messages promotes self-esteem), a social-distance corollary (choosing to dissociate oneself from the others who may be influenced) and a perceived exposure to a message (others choose to be influenced by persuasive communication). Other names for the effect are \"Third-person perception\" and \"Web Third-person effect\". From 2015 the effect named \"Web Third-person effect\" when it is verified in social media, media websites, blogs and in websites in general.\n\nSociologist W. Phillips Davison, who first articulated the third-person effect hypothesis in 1983, explains that the phenomenon first piqued his interest in 1949 or 1950 upon learning of a Japanese attempt during World War II to dissuade black U.S. soldiers from fighting at Iwo Jima using propaganda. As Davison recounts, the leaflets stressed that the Japanese did not have a quarrel with the black soldiers and that they should give up or desert. Although there was no indication that the leaflets had any effect on the soldiers, the incident preceded a substantial reshuffle among the officers and the unit was withdrawn the next day.\n\nSeveral years later while interviewing West German journalists to determine the influence of the press on foreign policy, Davison asked the journalists to estimate the influence their editorials had on readers. Although no evidence could be found to support their claims, Davison writes that a common response was, “The editorials have little effect on people like you and me, but the ordinary reader is likely to be influenced quite a lot.”\n\nIn both anecdotes, the parties that evaluated the impact of the communication estimated a larger media effect for others than on self. These and other experiences led Davison to articulate what he called the third-person effect hypothesis, which predicts:\n\nIn a case study conducted by Douglas McLeod et al. (1997), the third-person effect was analyzed via participants’ perceptions of being influenced by violent or misogynistic lyrics from rap music. The sample participants were divided up into three groups: one listened to violent rap music, another heard misogynistic rap music and the third group was the control. All lyrics heard were from actual, recorded songs. The study asked subjects to estimate the effects of listening to these types of lyrics on someone’s behaviors, knowledge and attitudes. They were also asked how these lyrics would affect themselves, students at their university, youth in New York or Los Angeles, and the average person. The study found that students found the rap lyrics to be least influential on themselves and more influential on youths in New York or Los Angeles. Simply put, people are more likely to assume everyone else is more easily influenced by messages than themselves. Furthermore, a recent study conducted by Nikos Antonopoulos et al. (2015), found characteristics of what users observe when visiting a media website as well as a prediction model. The influence that this information has over their opinion verifies the existence of Web Third-person effect (WTPE). With the use of an online survey (N = 9150) in all media websites (radio station, television station, portal, newspaper and email-social media) it was proved that the variables that have a greater impact either on others or our friends than ourselves are: The number of users being concurrently online on the same media website, the exact number of users having read each article on a media website as well as the number of users having shared a news article on Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks. Moreover, age is a significant factor that explains the findings and is important to the effect. Additionally, factors that affect the influence of the user generated messages on others than on oneself were found. Furthermore, the more credible the news is perceived to be and when there is not a particular mediated message the WTPE is absent confirming the existing theory.\n\nTo support the third-person effect hypothesis, Davison (1983) conducted four minor and informal surveys. Each survey asked between 25 and 35 participants to estimate the influence of persuasive communication on themselves and others. Participants estimated self-other effects for (1) a campaign theme on gubernatorial vote choice, (2) television advertising on children, (3) the results of early presidential primaries on vote choice, and (4) campaign messages on presidential vote choice. On average they estimated (1) other New York voters were more influenced by campaign themes than they were personally, (2) other children were more influenced by television advertising than they had been personally, (3) others were more influenced by the results of early presidential primaries than they were personally, and (4) others were more influenced by campaign advertisements than they were personally. Although the surveys were informal, they support the hypothesis.\n\nPrice and Tewksbury tested whether the third-person effect was a methodological artifact as a result of asking participants self-other questions in close proximity. Using a three-condition experiment in which they asked participants in the first condition self-only questions, participants in the second condition other-only questions, and participants in the third condition self and other questions, Price and Tewksbury’s results indicate consistent estimates of self and other estimates across conditions. These results, then, indicate the effect is not the result of a methodological artifact.\n\nAccording to Perloff (1999, 2009), two major factors facilitate the third-person effect: judgments of message desirability and perceived social distance (social distance corollary). In their meta-analysis of studies of third-person perception Sun, Pan, and Shen (2008) found that message desirability is the most important moderator of third-person perception. Third-person effects are particularly pronounced when the message is perceived as undesirable—that is, when people infer that “this message may not be so good for me” or “it’s not cool to admit you’re influenced by this media program.” In line with these predictions, people have been found to perceive content that is typically thought to be antisocial to have a larger impact on others than on themselves (e.g., television violence, pornography, antisocial rap music). Indeed, many researchers have found evidence that undesirable messages, such as violent and hateful messages, yield a greater third-person effect.\n\nOn the other hand, when messages are perceived as desirable, people are not so likely to exhibit a third-person effect. According to Perloff (2009), the first-person effect, or reversed third-person effect, is more common for desirable messages and seems to emerge when agreement with the message reflects positively on the self and to some degree when the message touches on topics that are congruent with the orientation of groups with which individuals identify. According to the self-enhancement view, if the third-person effect is driven by a desire to preserve self-esteem, people should be willing to acknowledge effects for communications that are regarded as socially desirable, healthy, or otherwise good for the self. Undergraduates perceived that others will be more influenced than themselves by cigarette ads but they will be more affected by anti-tobacco and drunk-driving PSAs. \nAnother factor that influences the magnitude of the third-person effect is perceived social distance between self and comparison others. In the “social distance corollary,” the disparity of self and other is increased as perceived distance between self and comparison others is increased. Although social distance is not a necessary condition for the third-person effect to occur, increasing the social distance makes the third-person effect larger. In their meta-analysis, Andsager and White (2007) concluded that “Research consistently finds that others who are anchored to self as a point of reference are perceived to be less influenced by persuasive messages than are others who are not defined and, therefore, not anchored to any point of reference at all” (p. 92).\n\nPerloff notes that the majority of third-person effect studies attribute the psychological underpinnings of the effect to either attribution theory or biased optimism.\n\nAttribution theory predicts that actors tend to attribute their actions to situational factors while observers tend to attribute the same actions to dispositional factors. For example, attribution theory predicts that a student who turns in a late assignment may explain to the professor that the tardiness is uncharacteristic and due to a situational factor like an unusual computer problem while the professor might believe the tardiness was due instead to a dispositional factor like the student’s laziness. In the context of the third-person effect hypothesis, then, attribution theory explains why a person may think that he or she understands the underlying persuasive aspects of the message while others’ dispositional flaws prevent them from perceiving those same aspects.\n\nBiased optimism predicts that people tend to judge themselves as less likely than others to experience negative consequences and, conversely, that people tend to judge themselves as more likely than others to experience positive events. In the context of the third-person effect hypothesis, biased optimism explains why people judge themselves as being less likely than others to be affected by persuasion.\n\nIn a critical review and synthesis of the third-person effect hypothesis, Perloff (1999) noted that of the 45 published articles that had tested the phenomenon by 1999, all had found support for the perceptual component of the hypothesis.\n\nOne year later, Paul, Salwen, and Dupagne conducted a meta-analysis of 32 empirical analyses that tested the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis. Their results indicate the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis received robust support (\"r\" = .50), especially compared to meta-analyses of other media effects theories.\n\nPaul, Salwen, and Dupagne (2000) also found three significant moderators of the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis: (1) sampling – samples obtained from nonrandom samples yielded greater third-person effect differences than samples obtained from random samples; (2) respondent – samples obtained from student samples yielded greater third-person effect differences than samples obtained from non-student samples; and (3) message – different types of content (e.g., general media messages, pornography, television violence, commercial advertisements, political content, nonpolitical news, etc.) have differing effects on the size of the obtained third-person perceptions.\n\nMultiple studies have found support for the behavioral component of the third-person effect hypothesis. Possibly because Davison noted that censors seldom admit to have been adversely affected by the information they proscribe, scholars who have found support for the behavioral component have generally operationalized behavior as a willingness to censor content to stop the content from having the perceived negative persuasive impact on others.\n\nSpecifically, scholars have demonstrated that third-person perception predicts willingness to censor pornography, television violence, sexual and violent television in Singapore, cigarette, beer, liquor, and gambling advertising, rap music and the number of users being concurrently online on the same media website, the exact number of users having read each article on a media website as well as the number of users having shared a news article on Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks.\n\nScholars, however, have not found that third-person perception predicts willingness to censor news or political media content including censorship of press coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial, support for an independent commission to regulate political communication, or censorship or a Holocaust-denial advertisement.\n\nScholars have noted that in some situations, people don’t always estimate greater media effects for others than for themselves. Indeed, in certain situations people tend to estimate greater media effects on themselves than on others, and in other situations people tend to estimate similar media effects on self and others. These two phenomena are commonly known as first person and second person effects respectively.\n\nFirst person effects – the estimation of greater media effects on self than others – tends to happen in situations in which people judge it desirable to be influenced by the media message. Innes and Zeitz first documented this phenomenon in 1988 when they noticed that participants exposed to content with a violent message exhibited traditional third-person effects while those exposed to a public service announcement exhibited the reverse. They described this reverse effect, however, only as “something akin to a third person effect” (p. 461).\n\nSeveral years later, Cohen and Davis, who found that people tended to overestimate the effect of attack advertisements for disliked candidates on themselves than on others, coined the term “reverse third-person effect” (p. 687). The same year, Tiedge, Silverblatt, Havice, and Rosenfeld coined the term “first-person effect” to refer to the perceived effects of media on self as being more than on others.\n\nFinally, Gunther & Thorson, in a study that paved the way for extension of the third-person effect hypothesis, demonstrated empirically that the social desirability of the message tended to affect whether participants were likely to exhibit third- or first- person effects. Socially desirable messages, Gunther and Thorson argue, tend to produce first-person effects while messages that are not perceived as desirable to be influenced by tend to produce traditional third-person effects.\n\nOnly a handful of studies have, intentionally or unintentionally, examined the behavioral component of the first-person effect. Of these, only one has specifically examined a relationship between first-person perceptions and behavioral consequences. Day examined the relationship between first-person effects from socially desirable issue advertisements and the likelihood of voting for legislation supporting the issue. Day found a significant relationship between first-person perceptions of the advertisement and the reported likelihood of voting for the legislation.\n"}

This was the peak of the movement but it did bring necessary change as law enforcement in Ciudad Juarez did step up to the concerns of the community and the activists of human rights groups.\n\nChapter Five is where Staudt looks at the changes and provides an analysis if it is just weak attempts to try and calm activists and community members of their concerns. There has been better enforcement than before but the situation is still very much a depressing one for the safety of women in Ciudad Juarez.\n\nOne conclusion that Staudt makes in her book is how neoliberal economic policy has created an environment beside the United States where there are large maquiladoras that provide massive employment but with only 25-50 dollars a week being paid to these workers, putting many in the city into poverty. Violence is more likely in poverty since there is lack of control and added stress of being in poverty. This is why there’s greater numbers of violence below the poverty line. Add that with the law enforcement in Ciudad Juarez not being concerned about the well being of women in the city, having a culture of violence to women being the norm.\n\nWith activism having put more pressure towards the government, Staudt shows the changes the government has made could be much better but many Mexican politicians and bureaucrats have been timid in making too much changes in fear of angering the male population in, making the changes for women’s safety in Mexico to be slow but steady.\n"}
{"id": "42180168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42180168", "title": "Visual research", "text": "Visual research\n\nVisual research is a qualitative research methodology that relies on the use of artistic mediums to \"produce and represent knowledge.\" These artistic mediums include, but are not limited to: film, photography, drawings, paintings, and sculptures. The artistic mediums provide a rich source of information that has the ability of capturing reality. They also reveal information about what the medium captures, but the artist or the creator behind the medium. Using photography as an example, the photographs taken illustrate reality and give information about the photographer through the angle, focus of the image, and the moment in which the photograph was taken.\n\nImages are an essential component for different sorts on inquires in a wide range of topics and research questions may call for a visual component in a variety of ways. One way could be to the research questions or the phenomena being examined, or the researcher could be the one making new images. After the visual material is created the resulting collection may be the base of further discussion, interviews, and or analysis, although the process of creating images is often a large part of the research process itself.\n\nThis method of data collection is often used to elicit data or opinion, here the participant is the one who would be generating the visual data. If it is a photograph she or he has taken it, or for a video, she or he has shot the visual data that will be further analysed. This is important as it allows the researcher to understand participants' views and perceptions.\n\nCaroline C. Wang and Mary Anne Burris conceptualized the visual methodology called photovoice. Participants are provided with a camera and asked to produce an image-based account of their experiences and/or those things that are important to them in a particular context. These projects share the assumption that increased participant control of data generation through production of visual images will help to highlight important aspects of lived experience that might otherwise have been overlooked or ignored by researchers. This method is often used in social science and health research.\n\nRicardo Gomez and Sara Vannini () introduced a variation of photovoice called Fotohistorias, that combines participant-generated photos and semistructured interviews to elicit lived experiences of immigrants and other marginalized communities. Fotohistorias combines the power of images and the richness of stories. Together, they yield more depth and sensitivity than either photos or interviews alone. Fotohistorias helps to quickly get to deep conversation about profound and meaningful topics, by focusing on the photos as a pretext for conversation. Fotohistorias helps elicit multiple perspectives and symbols from the same image or place, emphasizing how people’s perceptions and feelings shape meaning and experience. Fotohistorias participants frequently feel empowered, heard and valued, and gain a new perspective and agency over their current situation and context. \n\nThe photo-elicitation approach can include researcher or participant generated photographs. Photographs are introduced to the context of research interview based off the \"assumption about the role and utility of photographs in promoting reflections that words alone cannot.\" Participant generated photo elicitation puts significance to the participants role in shaping the creation of visual images. It is important to note the value of the technique for \"bridging culturally distinct worlds of the researcher and the researched.\" The term photo-elicitation originated from a paper published by Collier (1957), when it was initiated as a solution to the practical difficulties that research teams were having in relation to agreeing on categories for quality housing. Collier extended the method to examine how families adapted to residence among ethnically different people, and to new forms of work in urban factories, interviewing families and communities with photographs created by researchers. Reflecting on the use of photo-elicitation, Collier (1957, p. 858), argued that ‘pictures elicited longer and more comprehensive interviews but at the same time helped subjects overcome the fatigue and repetition of conventional interviews’ and noted the technique’s ‘compelling effect upon the informant, its ability to prod latent memory, to stimulate and release emotional statements about the informant’s life’. Photo-elicitation with researcher-initiated productions has been taken up by a range of researchers across the social sciences and related disciplines (Mannay 2016)\n\nThis technique of data collection is mostly used by researchers who believe in Positivist or realist view of the world.\nMaking a film as opposed to simply shooting footages, involves editing and other post production tasks, such as adding subtitles, but it also rests upon a series of ideas concerning the place of visual representation within social science itself. \nThis technique of data collection or data analysis is not widely used because of its multiple requirements. \nMaking films – to elicit data or opinion, can be of 3 basic types:\n1.Documenting or filming the subjects\n2.Showing a film to the subjects and asking about their opinion \n3.Asking the subjects to make a film\n\nThere are 3 basic concerns when it comes to analysis of a film or a video: \n1. the analytical approach taken towards film or video.\n2. method employed to derive data.\n3. the kind of issue being analysed.\n\nThis methodology is beneficial in its applicability to participants who may be illiterate or have difficulty communicating because of language barriers, lack of education, or a disability. This characteristic of Photovoice allows researchers who choose to use this methodology to choose participants from a large sample pool because there are no language or literacy requirements. Photovoice may be a powerful research tool because it allows the researcher to see the topic being studied from the participant's perspective. It also encourages the participants and the researcher to reflect on the images and meaning behind them as they highlight an aspect or perspective of the research topic perhaps not previously considered. In this way visual methods of data production can act as tools of defamilairisation, fighting familiarity for both researchers and participants and allowing space for a more nuanced understanding of the topics studies (Mannay 2010)\nThe use of Photovoice also has its limits. It requires the researcher to budget for the equipment used to carry it out, such as cameras, ink and printing costs. This may be problematic for the researcher if the research has been given limited or insufficient funds.\nAnother problem that may arise in the use of Photovoice is the question of photograph ownership. The researcher may be providing the equipment, but it is the participants who are taking the pictures. To avoid any potential issues regarding photograph ownership, it is advised that researchers obtain from their participants permission to use the photographs they take. It is particularly important to think carefully about informed consent in an era of digital dissemination and open access publication where images can be reworked, redistributed and recirculated in the digital economy, in ways that may not have been envisaged at the time of the research study (Mannay, 2014).\n\nThese are activities where the experimenters are either not disclosing their real identity, or their true purpose for the activity. This includes assuming a false identity such as creating an avatar in an online game, or pretending to be a tourist while looking at statutes. This could also includes manipulating settings in order to observe reactions.\n\nThese activities concern individuals who feel that a particular population is being treated in a dispassionate manner or similar to scientists observing natural phenomena in a clinical way. Examples of this would be the exercises which you ask to observe the waiting behaviors of people in public places (either in person from a distance or via webcam).\n\nThis category refers to a in-depth analysis of intimate, meaningful or personal places activities or spaces, and may include making judgments which could sadden or offend people. An example of this could be coding or commenting on gravestone trends or personal graffiti.\n\nThis is a category, in which the exercise or project may upset some people, or create anxiety or fear (including and potentially, in the researcher). This may happen due to situations which could include wasting people's time or not conforming to societal norms, such as in 'breaching' experiments. The visual offers a range of exciting possibilities for social research but it also brings an array of challenges and ethical difficulties. Visual Ethics can now be regarded as a specialist area within visual methodologies. Much mainstream engagement with the ethics of visual ethnography focuses on issues of anonymity of place and participants so that the focus is on who is taking the picture, who is in the picture; and what else can be known from the geography or materiality of the image. Thus, the moral maze of image ethics has been centrally concerned with the creator of images in relation to informed consent and the tension between revealing and concealing the contents of visual images; and who has ‘the right’ to claim ownership of images to in turn edit their content and show them to others (Mannay 2016).Once a visual image is created it becomes very difficult to control its use or remove it from the public arena if participants decide that they no longer want to be represented in a fixed visual trope for time immemorial. Even if images are successfully anodised, acts to disguise images can be seen as tantamount to silencing the voice of research participants. This is particularly problematic where researchers invest in the epistemological aims of participatory approaches predicated on giving ‘voice’.\n\n"}

Following on from her 1992 novel \"Possessing the Secret of Joy\", Walker undertakes a journey to parts of Africa where clitoridectomy is still practised. \"Warrior Marks\" is a harrowing work as Walker interviews women who have had the operation done and finally interviews a woman—circumcised herself—who performs the operation.\n"}

It was the first of two X-15 missions that reached space, along with Flight 91 the next month. The X-15 was flown by Joseph A. Walker, who flew both X-15 spaceflights.\n\n\nMaximum Speed - 5,971 km/h. Maximum Altitude - 106,010 m. 80 cm diameter balloon towed on 30 m line to measure air density. First X-15 flight over 100 km (a height known as the Kármán line). This made Walker the first US civilian in space. This was also the first spaceflight of a spaceplane in aviation history. First flight launched over Smith Dry Lake, NV. Experiments: Towed balloon, horizon scanner, photometer, infrared and ultraviolet. Balloon instrumentation failed.\n\nThe mission was flown by X-15 #3, serial 56-6672 on its 21st flight.\n\nLaunched by: NB-52B #008, Pilots Fulton & Bement. Takeoff: 17:19. UTC Landing: 19:04 UTC.\n\nChase pilots: Crews, Dana, Rogers, Daniel and Wood.\n\nThe X-15 engine burned about 85 seconds. Near the end of the burn, acceleration built up to about 4\"g\" (39 m/s²). Weightlessness lasted for 3 to 5 minutes. Re-entry heating warmed the exterior of the X-15 to 650 °C in places. During pull up after re-entry, the acceleration built up to 5\"g\" (49 m/s²) for 20 seconds. The entire flight lasted about 12 minutes from launch to landing.\n\n"}
