It forms a near complete circuit except for a gap of around in the east of the city. An indirect route linking the gap involves the (A47) A6030, and A6. The A563 was formerly referred to as the Outer Ring.\n\nIf the outstanding section were completed, the road would have a circumference of about and an average distance from Town Hall Square of around .\n\nStarting in the SE at the A6 in Oadby the road goes west, between Knighton and Wigston (crossing the A5199 Welford Road), then to the south of Aylestone (crossing the A426), passing Fosse Shopping Park that lies to the north it crosses the B4114 (Fosse Way) then in close proximity it passes over and intersects with the A5460 giving access to the M1 and M69 motorways. It then turns north, parallel to the M1 and crosses the A47 and then the A50. As the road bears eastwards at Beaumont Leys there is the A5630 junction providing a link to the A46 Leicester Western Bypass.\n\nDirectly north of the city the A563 arrives at Red Hill Circle, near to the River Soar, and crosses the A6 again. It then passes east. After crossing the A607 it transects with the northern terminus of the A6030 (which serves as a \"bis\" alternate route for traffic progressing directly towards Oadby/Stoneygate). Continuing, the A563 turns south and finishes at the A47 , towards the city's eastern boundary at Goodwood/Rowlatts Hill north of Evington Village.\n\nHere the A563 Ring Road ends given that the section directly linking the A47 at Goodwood to the A6 in Oadby was not constructed. Traffic can continue straight on at the A47 junction down the Goodwood Road (or go via the A47 and Spencefield Lane) and then continue by a variety of routes to the A6 (by Evington to Stoughton Drive and then Stoughton Road, meeting the A6 considerably further in than Oadby), or can turn at Evington village onto the back road Shady Lane, and then proceed by Stoughton Road into Oadby, meeting the A6 further out.\n\nRecently a short section of road linking the A563 in Hamilton and the A6030 in Northfields was completed between the junction with Victoria Road East and Gipsy Lane to the south, and Thurmaston Lane to the north, to assist traffic to the A6 and Oadby. Building this section meant having to cut through part of the Humberstone Heights Golf Course.\n\nAlthough the ring road has been planned for decades, there are currently no firm plans to complete the eastern part, known as the Eastern District Distributor Road. The original designated route included Goodwood Road, but Leicester City Council allowed housing to be built on land earmarked for an expansion to a dual carriageway. Tentative plans to route traffic along Spencefield Lane were strongly opposed by residents, leaving it unclear where exactly the Distributor Road would be built. The A47 is not dual carriageway and is already congested at peak hours, so extending the A563 eastwards as far as open countryside seems problematic.\n\nA594 road (Leicester)\n"}

{"id": "13646426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13646426", "title": "Aseptic processing", "text": "Aseptic processing\n\nAseptic processing is a processing technique wherein commercially thermally sterilized liquid products (typically food or pharmaceutical) are packaged into previously sterilized containers under sterile conditions to produce shelf-stable products that do not need refrigeration. Aseptic processing has almost completely replaced in-container sterilization of liquid foods, including milk, fruit juices and concentrates, cream, yogurt, salad dressing, liquid egg, and ice cream mix. There has been an increasing popularity for foods that contain small discrete particles, such as cottage cheese, baby foods, tomato products, fruit and vegetables, soups, and rice desserts.\n\nAseptic processing involves three primary steps: thermal sterilization of the product, sterilization of the packaging material, and conservation of sterility during packaging. To ensure commercial sterility, aseptic processing facilities are required to maintain proper documentation of production operations, showing that commercially sterile conditions were achieved and maintained in all areas of the facility. Any breach of a scheduled process for the processing or packaging system means that the affected product must be destroyed, reprocessed or segregated and held for further evaluation. In addition, the processing and packaging system must be cleaned and re-sterilized before processing and/or packaging operations can resume. Packaging equipment and packaging materials are sterilized with various medium or combination of mediums (i.e., saturated steam, superheated steam, hydrogen peroxide and heat and other treatments).\n\nAseptic processing was derived from Olin Ball's heat-cool-fill (HCF) machine that was developed in 1927. While HCF was successful in improving the sensory quality of the processed chocolate milk as compared to canned product, the use of the equipment was hindered by its cost, maintenance, and inflexibility to process various container sizes, rendering the machine a failure.\n\nIn the 1940s, the Avoset process was developed by George Grindrod. Food products processed using the Avoset process were packaged under ultraviolet lamps and sterilized air inside a positive-pressurized room to keep the contaminants out of the processing room. sterilization was achieved through the use of direct steam injection of and then cooled. The food treated using this technique was described as an \"excellent cream product\" and 75-100 containers were produced each minute.\n\nLater in the 1940s, the Dole Aseptic Process was developed by McKinley Martin. The foods processed ranged from soups to specialty sauces, fruits, and dairy products. This process involved four steps:\n\n\nThe Dole aseptic machine overcame the hindrances that caused HCF's failure, since it was able to process various container sizes, needed less maintenance time, and cost less. The quality of products processed was consistent regardless of its container size, an important characteristic for heat sensitive foods, due to its short processing time. Split pea soup was treated using the Dole aseptic machine at the following dosage: heat time of for 3.53 seconds, hold time of 8.8 seconds, and cooling to in 14.0 - 17.0 seconds, compared to the normal processing time of 40-70 minutes at . The lack of consumer interest drove foods that were processed in the Dole aseptic machine to be discontinued.Roy Graves began sterilizing milk in the 1940s. The milk that was drawn from the cow went through a pipeline, into a vacuum tank, which was then heated to 285°F, then cooled to room temperature. The product, packaged in metal cans, was widely accepted by consumers without access to fresh milk, including the U.S. military.\n\nIn 1959, the food industry saw the advent of the use of paper-foil-plastic laminated containers called tetrahedron. In 1962, a Swedish company, Tetra Pak, introduced this container to the United States market. They sold pasteurized milk and beverages in the containers. Roy Graves' company started sterilizing this container with chlorine and were able to aseptically fill and hermetically seal the container. The use of these containers was not accepted by the American consumers due to their difficulty in opening however, it was widely used by the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn 1981, hydrogen peroxide was approved by the FDA to be used to sterilize containers.\n\nToday, ships used for continental food transport are equipped with aseptic tanks to transport fruit juices. Another means of transporting aseptically processed food is the use of aseptic bags.\n\nAseptic processing allows for the food to be properly sterilized outside the container and then placed into a previously sterilized container, which is then sealed in a sterile environment. Most systems use ultra-high temperature (UHT) sterilization to sterilize the food product before it is packaged. UHT sterilizes food at high temperatures usually above 135 C for 1-2 seconds. This is advantageous because it allows for faster processing, usually a few seconds at high temperatures (130-150ºC) and better retention of sensory and nutritional characteristics. Aseptic products have a non-refrigerated shelf-life of a few months to several years.\n\nSterilization of aseptic packaging material is a crucial step in aseptic food processing. These containers are sterilized to kill microorganisms present on the container during forming and transport and prior to filling. There are numerous methods used to sterile the containers, the most commonly used methods include: heat, hot water, chemical sterilants (hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid), and radiation or a combination of methods.\n\nAseptically processed food products can be sterilized using either direct or indirect methods of heat transfer. Direct heat transfer can be achieved through steam injection and steam infusion. Food products processed with a steam injector go through an injection chamber, where steam (150ºC) is injected into the product, then the product is flash cooled to 70°C. Direct heat transfer is suitable for heat-sensitive foods such as milk. However, only low viscosity liquids can be processed using steam injection, and high-quality steam is required to ensure sterilization. Steam infused food products involves food free-falling into highly pressurized steam which heats the food to approximately 145ºC and then its flash cooled to 65-70ºC. Steam infusion provides processors with great control compared to steam injection and reduction of burn-on and overheating risks are reduced. It can process higher viscosity foods compared to steam injection, but risks the blockage of nozzles in machinery. Indirect forms of heat transfer include: plate heat exchangers, tubular heat exchangers, or scraped-surface heat exchangers. Plate heat exchangers are mostly used because they are inexpensive and allow for easy changes during production.Tubular and scraped-surface can heat viscous food with particulates or high pulp content with minimal damage.\nEquipment used in aseptic processing of food and beverages must be sterilized before processing and remain sterile during processing. When designing aseptic processing equipment there are six basic requirements to consider: the equipment must have the capability of being cleaned thoroughly, it must be able to be sterilized with steam, chemicals, or high-temperature water, sterilization media should be able to contact all surfaces of the equipment, meaning the equipment does not contain any cracks, crevices or dead spots, the equipment must be able to be kept in a sterile state, it must have the ability to be used continuously, and lastly, the equipment must comply with regulations.\n\nAseptic packaging are generally placed in the following categories: fill, erect, form, thermoform, blow mold, and bulk packaging and storage systems.\n\n\nAseptic packaging consists of filling and sealing a sterilized packaging material with a sterilized product. Aseptic packaging material not only has to assure sterile conditions within the package and protect the product from physical damage, but also maintain the quality of the product inside the packaging. To achieve this, a laminate material is formed from the following components: semi-rigid paper, aluminum, and plastic. Paper (70%) provides the stiffness, strength, and the efficient brick shape to the package. Low-density polyethylene (24%), the most common plastic used for aseptic packaging, located on the innermost layer forms the seals that make the package liquid-tight. Aluminum (6%) is located on the inside of the aseptic package, forming a barrier against light and oxygen, thereby eliminating the need for refrigeration and preventing spoilage without using preservatives. Most packaging material used in aseptic packaging is made from plastics instead of metal or glass containers due to the relatively low cost of producing plastic material when compared to metal and glass. Plastics are lighter than metal or glass making them cheaper and easier to transport. Plastics also required much less energy to produce than metal and glass. These factors have made plastic the packaging material of choice for use in aseptic processing.\nThere are a lot of factors that can influence the type of aseptic container chosen for a product. The following factors may influence the choice of packaging material for aseptically processed products: functional properties of the plastic polymer (gas and water vapor barrier properties, chemical inertness, and flavor and odor absorption or scalping), potential interactions between plastic polymer and food product, desired shelf life, economical costs, mechanical characteristics of the packaging material (molding properties, material handling characteristics, and compatibility with packaging and sterilization methods), shipping and handling conditions (toughness, compression), compliance with regulation, and targeted consumer group.\n\nThere are a range of different types of containers to choose from depending on the product. The table below offers a few container types and examples.\n\nAseptic processing preserves food quality through fast heat treatment followed by a short holding time and rapid cooling. Compared to canning where food products are subjected to high temperature processing, the fast heat treatment provided by aseptic processing enables heat-sensitive characteristics of the food to be better retained.\nThe flavor of aseptically processed food products is minimally changed. Dairy products could have a cooked flavor because of exposure to sulfhydryl groups. The flavor is reduced during storage as the sulfhydryl groups oxidize. Severely treated milk could have a bitter flavor because of proteolysis.\nDairy products could have changes in color, an effect caused by Maillard browning. This depends on the amount of reducing sugar, the formation of pyralysins and melanoidins, the severity of the treatment, and the storage temperature.\n\nPlant pigments, carotene and betanin, are not affected, while chlorophyll and anthocyanins are minimally reduced.\nMeat is less likely to toughen when aseptically processed, compared to canned products.\n\nFruit juice viscosity is unaffected. Processed sliced fruit and vegetable pieces are softer compared to unprocessed pieces as a result of the solubilization of pectic materials and loss of cell turgor.\nAseptic Processing achieves sterility through a flash-heating process with temperatures ranging from 91°C to 146°C and is minimally processed. Due to the significantly lower processing time and temperature range used in aseptic processing compared to conventional sterilization, such as canning, products that are aseptically processed are able to retain more nutrients. Riboflavin, pantothenic acid, biotin, niacin, and vitamin B6 are unaffected. Approximately 10% of thiamine and vitamin B12, approximately 15% of folic acid and pyridoxine, and approximately 25% of vitamin C are lost during aseptic processing.\n\nFoods that are processed aseptically have better nutritional, vitamin, and natural pigment retention (chlorophyll, anthocyanins, betalins, carotenoids) compared to canned food products because of the lower temperature the foods are subjected to upon processing. Aseptic processing provides flexibility in using various container sizes as well as possibility of addition of bioactive and heat-sensitive components after processing (probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acids).\nAseptic processing costs more than canning because sterilization of the packaging materials requires different machinery and can get complex. In addition, maintaining air sterility in the processing room is difficult.\n\nInspections of aseptic processing is one of the most complex inspection of food manufacturing operations. Process authorities are required to establish a process that ensures commercial sterility for the following:\n\n\nDocumentation of production operations must be maintained by the facility, showing an achievement of commercial sterile conditions in all areas of the facility.The general regulatory requirements for all U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated foods are found in section 21 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 110. Section 113.40 lists specific requirements for aseptic processing and packaging systems, including specifications for equipment and instrumentation. One requirement of the FDA regulations is that all thermal processing operations must be conducted under the operating supervision of an individual who has completed an FDA-approved course of instruction on control of thermal processing systems, container closures, and acidification procedures. The Better Process Control School provides a section on aseptic processing and packaging systems, and will meet the FDA requirement for supervisors of aseptic operations.Processing authorities are responsible for aseptic systems must be aware of certain factors unique to aseptic processing and packaging operations, therefore specific knowledge in this area is essential. Neither the FDA nor other regulatory agency maintains a list of recognized processing authorities, however, certain organizations are widely recognized within government agencies and the industry as having the experience and expertise. The FDA regulations rely upon aseptic processing and packaging authorities to establish parameters for sterilization of product, packages, and equipment so that commercial sterility of the end product is assured.\n\nThe forms presently used to file aseptic processes for low-acid foods with the FDA is Form 2541c. Processes for acidified foods that are aseptically processes and packaged are filed under 2541a. Additionally, processing plants must be registered with the FDA using Form 2541. The FDA has also developed a Low-acid Canned Food (LACF) Electronic Process Filling System that facilitates the completion and submission of the forms.The FDA does exert authority over the types of aseptic processing and packaging systems that can be utilized to produce foods for distribution in U.S. commerce by reviewing and either accepting or rejecting process filing forms from individual processing firms. The FDA may request sufficient technical information from the processor to evaluate adequacy of the equipment and the procedures used to produce a commercially sterile product. Until the FDA finds no further objections to a process filing, the company is prevented from distributing product produced on that system in interstate commerce.Final aseptic products must undergo an incubation test before the product is released into distribution. The firm must determine the time and temperature of incubation as well as how many containers are incubated. It is generally accepted to incubate at 20-25°C for a minimum of 7 days followed immediately, or after a first reading, by incubation at 30-35°C for a total minimum incubation time of 14 days. Other incubation schedules should be based on supporting validation data. It is important to note that prior to incubation, the containers with the microbial growth medium must be inverted to ensure all surfaces are throughly wetted by the medium.The FDA relies on periodic inspections of processing plants to monitor compliance with its regulatory requirements. Inspection frequency for an individual plant may vary significantly depending upon products packed, occurrence of potential hazardous processing problems at the plant, and availability of FDA inspection personnel.\n"}

Formal sets of constants, along with recommended values, have been defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) several times: in 1964 and in 1976 (with an update in 1994). In 2009 the IAU adopted a new current set, and recognizing that new observations and techniques continuously provide better values for these constants, they decided to not fix these values, but have the Working Group on Numerical Standards continuously maintain a set of Current Best Estimates. The set of constants is widely reproduced in publications such as the \"Astronomical Almanac\" of the United States Naval Observatory and HM Nautical Almanac Office.\n\nBesides the IAU list of units and constants, also the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service defines constants relevant to the orientation and rotation of the Earth, in its technical notes.\n\nThe IAU system of constants defines a system of astronomical units for length, mass and time (in fact, several such systems), and also includes constants such as the speed of light and the constant of gravitation which allow transformations between astronomical units and SI units. Slightly different values for the constants are obtained depending on the frame of reference used. Values quoted in barycentric dynamical time (TDB) or equivalent time scales such as the \"T\" of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ephemerides represent the mean values that would be measured by an observer on the Earth's surface (strictly, on the surface of the geoid) over a long period of time.

The astronomical unit of mass is the mass of the Sun (\"S\"). The astronomical unit of length is that length (\"A\") for which the Gaussian gravitational constant (\"k\") takes the value when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time.\n\n\n† The definitions of these derived constants have been taken from the references cited, but the values have been recalculated to take account of the more precise values of the primary constants cited in the table.\n\n\n\n"}

Contact forces are ubiquitous and are responsible for most visible interactions between macroscopic collections of matter. Pushing a car up a hill or kicking a ball or pushing a desk across a room are some of the everyday examples where contact forces are at work. In the first case the force is continuously applied by the person on the car, while in the second case the force is delivered in a short impulse. Contact forces are often decomposed into orthogonal components, one perpendicular to the surface(s) in contact called the normal force, and one parallel to the surface(s) in contact, called the friction force.\n\nIn the Standard Model of modern physics, the four fundamental forces of nature are known to be non-contact forces. The strong and weak interaction primarily deal with forces within atoms, while gravitational effects are only obvious on an ultra-macroscopic scale. Molecular and quantum physics show that the electromagnetic force is the fundamental interaction responsible for contact forces. The interaction between macroscopic objects can be roughly described as resulting from the electromagnetic interactions between protons and electrons of the atomic constituents of these objects. Everyday objects do not \"actually\" touch; rather, contact forces are the result of the interactions of the electrons at or near the surfaces of the objects.\n\n"}

The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.\n\nThe debate was carried out from 2001 to 2003 through a series of published articles and open letters. It began with a 2001 article by Smalley in \"Scientific American\", which was followed by a rebuttal published by Drexler and coworkers later that year, and two open letters by Drexler in early 2003. The debate was concluded in late 2003 in a \"Point–Counterpoint\" feature in \"Chemical & Engineering News\" in which both parties participated.\n\nThe debate has been often cited in the history of nanotechnology due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of nanotechnology. It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone, with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work, and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science, causing commentators to go so far as to characterize the tone of the debate as similar to \"a pissing match\" and \"reminiscent of [a] \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch\".\n\nK. Eric Drexler is generally considered to have written the first scholarly paper on the topic of nanotechnology, and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work. Trained as an engineer, Drexler was inspired by a then-obscure 1959 talk by physicist Richard Feynman called \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\", which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using top-down engineering methodologies. Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in molecular biology such as recombinant DNA technology. In a 1981 publication in \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\", considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology, he argued that biological systems such as the ribosome were already capable of building molecules atom-by-atom, and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed. Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology: \"Engines of Creation\" in 1986, which was intended for the public, and the technical work \"Nanosystems\" in 1992. He also co-founded the Foresight Institute, a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology.\n\nDrexler's vision of nanotechnology, now called molecular nanotechnology, is based on the concept of the molecular assembler, a molecular machine which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom-by-atom. Drexler drew a distinction between wet nanotechnology based on biological systems, and \"second-generation\" dry nanotechnology which would be based on mechanosynthesis, positional control of molecules through principles more related to mechanical engineering. Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology, but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.\n\nRichard E. Smalley, a chemist at Rice University, was best known as a co-discoverer of the C form of carbon known as buckminsterfullerene in 1985, along with Harry Kroto, Robert Curl, James Heath, and Sean O'Brien. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be discovered of the class of molecules known as fullerenes, which also includes carbon nanotubes. The study and application of fullerenes forms a significant part of the fields of nanomaterials and nanoelectronics, and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery.\n\nSmalley had also taken a prominent public policy role in relation to nanotechnology, and was an outspoken advocate for using nanotechnology to develop solutions to the world's energy and health problems, for example raising the possibility of using nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission, and of developing nanomaterial-based drugs for targeted drug delivery. Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes, having founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology startups. Smalley died of leukemia in October 2005, after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler.\n\nSmalley wrote an article, \"Of Chemistry, Love, and Nanobots\", for the September 2001 issue of the popular science magazine \"Scientific American\", which was a special issue on the topic of nanotechnology. Smalley opened by comparing a chemical reaction to an intricate dance of atoms:\n\nHe referenced the idea of a molecular assembler, a nanorobot capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of how long it would take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one mole of material, but self-replicating assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a grey goo scenario, or, referring to Bill Joy's previous article \"Why the future doesn't need us\", that the nanorobots could develop swarm intelligence and become alive in some sense.\n\nSmalley then considered how realistic the concept of a self-replicating nanorobot was. He noted that in a chemical reaction, the chemical bonds are all interconnected and that the placement of each atom is sensitive to the position of all the other atoms in the vicinity. He then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work, and would thus have to have many manipulator arms. This led him to raise two objections to the concept of molecular assembler, which he called the \"fat fingers problem\" and the \"sticky fingers problem\":\n\nSmalley closed the article by returning to the analogy of chemistry as a dance of love, remarking that \"you don't make a girl and a boy fall in love by pushing them together.\"\n\nDrexler responded by publishing a rebuttal later in 2001 through the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, which was co-authored with others including Robert Freitas, J. Storrs Hall, and Ralph Merkle. The authors first discussed the \"fat fingers\" argument by attacking Smalley's notion that a chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms, stating that many reactions involve only two reactants, one of which can be immobilized and the other attached to a single \"finger\". They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tips and related technologies could be used as a reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface-bound molecules. They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction. The authors noted that the \"sticky fingers\" problem is valid in some reactions, but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem.\n\nThe authors put forth the ribosome as an example of a natural molecular machine; because the ribosome suffers from neither problem, they must not be fundamental, saying:\n\nThe authors also questioned Smalley's figures for the replication time of nanomachines. Instead of Smalley's figure of 1 GHz for the atomic placement frequency, they point out that \"Nanosystems\" suggested a frequency of 1 MHz, a thousand times slower, and that at Smalley's higher frequency diamondoid nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds. The authors called this a straw man argument, writing that \"in a serious scientific discussion, a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in the literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of the proposal.\" The authors closed by stating that the best way to find out whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work, and that \"there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome, but thus far, there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible.\"\n\nDrexler followed up with two open letters to Smalley in April and July 2003. The April letter began, \"I have written this open letter to correct your public misrepresentation of my work.\" Drexler accused Smalley of continuing to dismiss his work by publicly describing molecular assemblers as requiring what Drexler now calls \"Smalley fingers\", which he stated to be unlike the enzyme-like systems he had actually proposed. He asserted:\n\nDrexler compared the nanotechnology debate's importance to that of discussions of spaceflight before Sputnik or to theoretical work on nuclear chemistry before the Manhattan Project. He disputed Smalley's arguments that the fear of a grey goo scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research, arguing that the potential for long-term risks made research even more important. His conclusion stated, \"your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long-term security concerns.\"\n\nThe July 2003 letter referenced a note from Smalley promising to respond, which had yet gone unfulfilled. Drexler mentions inconsistencies in Smalley's previous public statements on atom-by-atom construction, and ended by stating \"I would not ordinarily raise an issue so persistently, but the question of what nanotechnology can ultimately achieve is perhaps the most fundamental issue in the field today—it shapes basic objectives and expectations—and your words have been remarkably effective in changing how this issue is perceived.\"\n\nThe debate was concluded in a \"Point–Counterpoint\" feature that was the 1 December 2003 cover story of \"Chemical & Engineering News\", the newsmagazine of the American Chemical Society. The feature first reproduced Drexler's April 2003 open letter to Smalley. Smalley's response began by apologizing for any offense his September 2001 article had caused, and stating that Drexler's book \"Engines of Creation\" had triggered Smalley's own interest in nanotechnology. He agreed that \"Smalley fingers\" could not work, and then asserted that the same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude the manipulation of larger building blocks, since each molecule would have multiple atoms which would need to be controlled\n\nHe then agreed that something like an enzyme or ribosome would be capable of precise chemistry, but asked how the nanorobot would be able to obtain, control, and repair such an enzyme, and noted the incompatibility of many reactions with water-based biological systems, stating that \"biology is wonderous in the vast diversity of what it can build, but it can't make a crystal of silicon, or steel, or copper, or aluminum, or titanium, or virtually any of the key materials on which modern technology is built.\" Smalley asked what kind of \"nonaqueous enzymelike chemistry\" Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon, calling this \"a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries.\"\n\nDrexler's counterresponse began by returning to Feynman's 1959 talk, stating that \"although inspired by biology... Feynman's vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical, not biological.\" He characterized the challenges as being that of systems engineering rather than solely chemistry, and referred Smalley to \"Nanosystems\", with its vision of mechanical control of chemical reactions with no enzymes and no reliance on solvents or thermal motion. He stated:\n\nDrexler reiterated that these molecular assemblers would require no impossible fingers, and would augment solution-phase chemistry to produce macroscopic products with precise arrangements of chemical building blocks, using solution-phase molecular assemblers to bootstrap the construction of more sophisticated assemblers. He concluded by writing:\n\nSmalley began his concluding letter:\n\nSmalley stated his belief that most reactions using mechanosynthesis would simply give the wrong product, and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach. He asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme-like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium, and as all known enzymes use water as that medium, the range of products must be limited to the \"meat and bone of biology.\" He accused Drexler of creating \"a pretend world where atoms go where you want because your computer program directs them to go there.\"\n\nLastly, Smalley recounted his recent experience reading essays written by middle and high school students after an outreach visit, saying that nearly half of them thought that self-replicating nanorobots were possible and that most were worried about the results of them spreading across the world. Smalley called this a deeply troubling bedside story that he did his best to allay. Smalley concluded his letter:\n\nThe debate has been widely criticized for its adversarial tone. David Berube in \"Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz\" characterized it as \"two people talking over each other... not conducive to reasonable rebuttal,\" and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard Lovy as saying \"the tenor of the debate is about personal pride, reputation, and a place in the pantheon.\" Zyvex founder James von Ehr remarked that \"Eric [Drexler] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a pissing match with a Nobel-prize winner.\" An article in \"The New York Times\" called the debate \"reminiscent of that old \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch... [with] Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue,\" referring to a version of the long-running Weekend Update segment.\n\nThe debate has received technical criticism as well. Steven A. Edwards in \"The Nanotech Pioneers\" noted that the ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes an evaluation of the argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that \"nowhere in it does \"Nanosystems\" contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler... We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together.\" He concludes that \"the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists.\"\n\nOn the other hand, futurist Ray Kurzweil in his book \"The Singularity Is Near\" declared Drexler as the winner of the debate, reiterating the view that Smalley distorted Drexler's ideas and calling Smalley's responses \"short on specific citations and current research and long on imprecise metaphors\" and asserting that \"Smalley is ignoring the past decade of research on alternative means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided molecular reactions... [which have] been extensively studied.\" He quoted experimental results on enzyme function in nonaqueous solutions, and pointed out that modern non-biological technology such as airplanes and computers have exceeded the capabilities of natural biological systems. He also noted that \"earlier critics also expressed skepticism that either worldwide communication networks or software viruses that would spread across them were feasible... [but today] we are obtaining far more gain than harm from this latest example of intertwined promise and peril.\"\n\nThe debate's focus on the public perception of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger Glenn Reynolds stated that \"the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market.\" Lawrence Lessig criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that \"if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research.\" Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.\n"}

{"id": "457921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457921", "title": "Fringe science", "text": "Fringe science\n\nFringe science is an inquiry in an established field of study which departs significantly from mainstream theories in that field and is considered to be questionable by the mainstream.\n\nFringe science may be either a questionable application of a scientific approach to a field of study or an approach whose status as scientific is widely questioned.\n\nFor mainstream scientists, attributes of fringe science include being highly speculative or relying on premises already refuted. Fringe science theories are often advanced by persons who have no traditional academic science background, or by researchers outside the mainstream discipline. The general public has difficulty distinguishing between science and its imitators, and in some cases a \"yearning to believe or a generalized suspicion of experts is a very potent incentive to accepting pseudoscientific claims\".\n\nThe term \"fringe science\" covers everything from novel hypotheses which can be tested by means of the scientific method to wild ad hoc hypotheses and mumbo jumbo. This has resulted in a tendency to dismiss all fringe science as the domain of pseudoscientists, hobbyists, and cranks.\n\nOther terms for questionable types of science are \"pathological science\", \"voodoo science\", and \"cargo cult science\". The term \"junk science\" is used to criticize research seen as dubious or fraudulent, as opposed to \"solid science\".\n\nA concept that was once accepted by the mainstream scientific community may become fringe science because of a later evaluation of previous research. For example, focal infection theory, which held that focal infections of the tonsils or teeth are a primary cause of systemic disease, was once considered to be medical fact. It has since been dismissed because of lack of evidence.\n\nThe term \"fringe science\" denotes unorthodox scientific theories and models. Persons who create fringe science may have employed the scientific method in their work, but their results are not accepted by the mainstream scientific community. Fringe science may be advocated by a scientist who has some recognition within the larger scientific community, but this is not always the case. Usually the evidence provided by fringe science is accepted only by a minority and is rejected by most experts.\n\nThe boundary between fringe science and pseudoscience is disputed. The connotation of \"fringe science\" is that the enterprise is rational but is unlikely to produce good results for a variety of reasons, including incomplete or contradictory evidence.\n\nThe term may be considered pejorative. For example, Lyell D. Henry Jr. wrote that, \"fringe science [is] a term also suggesting kookiness.\" This characterization is perhaps inspired by the eccentric behavior of many researchers of the kind known colloquially (and with considerable historical precedent) as mad scientists.\n\nAlthough most fringe science is rejected, the scientific community has come to accept some portions of it. One example of such is plate tectonics, an idea which had its origin in the fringe science of continental drift and was rejected for decades.\n\nSome historical ideas that are considered to have been refuted by mainstream science are:\n\n\nRelatively recent fringe sciences include:\n\n\n\nSome theories that were once rejected as fringe science, but were eventually accepted as mainstream science, are:\n\n\nMichael W. Friedlander has suggested some guidelines for responding to fringe science, which, he argues, is a more difficult problem than scientific misconduct. His suggested methods include impeccable accuracy, checking cited sources, not overstating orthodox science, thorough understanding of the Wegener continental drift example, examples of orthodox science investigating radical proposals, and prepared examples of errors from fringe scientists.\n\nFriedlander suggests that fringe science is necessary so that mainstream science will not atrophy. Scientists must evaluate the plausibility of each new fringe claim, and certain fringe discoveries \"will later graduate into the ranks of accepted\" — while others \"will never receive confirmation\".\n\nMargaret Wertheim profiled many \"outsider scientists\" in her book \"Physics on the Fringe\", who receive little or no attention from professional scientists. She describes all of them as trying to make sense of the world using the scientific method, but in the face of not being able to understand the complex theories of modern science. She also finds it fair that credentialed scientists do not bother spending a lot of time learning about and explaining problems with the fringe theories of uncredentialed scientists, since the authors of those theories have not taken the time to understand the mainstream theories they aim to disprove.\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century, some critics (such as Answers in Genesis) began to cite fringe science theories with limited support. Often their goal was to classify as controversial entire fields of scientific inquiry (notably paleoanthropology, human sexuality, evolution, geology, and paleontology) that contradict literal or fundamentalist interpretation of various sacred texts.\n\nCritics argue that such controversies open a window of plausibility for divine intervention and intelligent design.\n\nAs Donald E. Simanek asserts, \"Too often speculative and tentative hypotheses of cutting edge science are treated as if they were scientific truths, and so accepted by a public eager for answers.\" But the public is ignorant of the fact that \"As science progresses from ignorance to understanding it must pass through a transitional phase of confusion and uncertainty.\"\n\nThe media also play a role in propagating the belief that certain fields of science are controversial. In their 2003 paper \"Optimising Public Understanding of Science and Technology in Europe: A Comparative Perspective\", Jan Nolin \"et al.\" write that \"From a media perspective it is evident that controversial science sells, not only because of its dramatic value, but also since it is often connected to high-stake societal issues.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Historians subdivide the history of human activity into intervals that are comparatively much shorter. In both geological and historical scales, the divisions of equal rank are characteristically of unequal duration, and the identification of a particular interval is primarily based on its fossil, artifact, or cultural content (e.g., Carboniferous, Neolithic, Dark Ages, Ming Dynasty). Both scales are calibrated against numerical ages obtained\nseparately.\n\nAn alternative way of referring to the past is to use a scale with intervals of equal duration. We speak of a given decade, century, or millennium. For the enormously long geologic time frame, it is advantageous to use corresponding large, equal time intervals encompassing the events and processes that have shaped our planet. The development of mountain ranges, ocean basins, and continents takes tens to hundreds of millions of years, and large time units thus are convenient for discussing long-term trends. Astronomers use light years and parsecs to deal with huge distances, rather than kilometres. Geologists have geons to refer to large specified time intervals of Earth history. The geon scale is also applicable to other planets with different histories, and to the universe itself.\n\nTwo usages of geon have been introduced in geology:\n\n\n\n"}

His case was described at the time as \"possibly the biggest medical research scandal since Andrew Wakefield was struck off in 2010 for falsely claiming to have proved a link between the MMR vaccine and autism\".\n\nIn August 2012, the hospital released the results of its investigation: while no patients were harmed, \"in a large number of the studies investigated, the conduct of research failed to meet required standards. False data were published in at least 10 of the 91 articles examined, including, for instance, data on patient numbers/ study groups as well as data on the timing of measurements\".\n\nOn February 20, 2013, JAMA published a metaanalysis on HES in critically ill patients (Zachyranski R et al.) Boldt had 7 studies from the 1990s that had not yet been retracted. Including them, there was no increase in mortality, but excluding them, there was a significant increase in mortality. Only the Boldt studies showed an improvement with HES; all other studies showed the opposite. It is believed that his fraudulent studies put critically ill patients at risk and caused harm.\n\nAn overview of the challenges for meta-analysts presented by the fraud has recently been published. It includes double publication of studies, manipulating demographic and outcome data to conceal double publication and getting better results for a drug being tested.\n\nAs of 2017, 96 of his papers have been retracted.\nIn October 2018 a review highlighted additional retractions, the first fraudulent one retracted was from 1986 demonstrating persistent fraud for the entire career of Boldt ,Statistical analyses demonstrate,that still many most likely fraudulent papers from Boldt are out there and editors should take action.\n\n"}

A signal was sent to the explosive bolts to separate the spacecraft from the launch vehicle. Up to this point, everything was going as planned.

The name \"Lower Aragon\" refers to the areas of the lowest altitude within the Ebro river basin, but the historical region encompasses only the river basins of several right tributaries of the Ebro River, namely the Matarranya, Guadalope, Regallo, Martín and Aguas, located between the Ebro and the Iberian mountain range.\n\nThe demonym for Lower Aragonese people is \"bajoaragonés\" or \"tierrabajino\". The eastern fringes of the Lower Aragon natural region include some areas belonging as well to the Catalan-speaking strip in eastern Aragon known as La Franja and overlapping the historical Ilercavonia comarca.\n\nAll the villages traditionally taking part in the characteristic and loud Drum and Bass drum Route during Holy Week processions are included in Lower Aragon historical region.\n\nIn 1707, following King Philip's Nueva Planta decrees a large part of Lower Aragon became the \"Corregimiento de Alcañiz\", a kind of large district. In 1812, as a result of Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet's territorial division, the Province of Alcañiz \"(Provincia de Alcañiz)\" briefly unified the Lower Aragon region during French occupation. Since then, and despite of the strong identity of its inhabitants, this historical region has not been able to achieve the necessary legal recognition for its administrative development. \n\nAfter the territorial division of Spain in 1833 there have been attempts to create again a fourth province of Aragon with its capital in Alcañiz. These proposals were based on the limited relationship that the municipal areas of Lower Aragon have had with Teruel, the capital of the province in which most of the historical region of Lower Aragon is presently included. \n\nIn 1935, at the time of the Second Spanish Republic there was a feeble attempt to segregate the municipalities surrounding Alcañiz and Híjar from the Province of Teruel and merge them with Zaragoza Province. But so far the proposals to make a province out of the Lower Aragon region have not found much echo and the area finds itself in a state of administrative and economical neglect reflected in the A-68 highway issue.\n\nLower Aragon was divided into the smaller administrative comarcas after the official delimitation of the Comarcas of Aragon in 1999. Its historical limits fall now within the Bajo Aragón, Bajo Aragón-Caspe, Bajo Martín, Andorra-Sierra de Arcos, Matarranya and Ribera Baja del Ebro comarcas, as well as some municipal terms of the Maestrazgo, Campo de Belchite, Bajo Cinca and Cuencas Mineras comarcas.\n\nSince the current \"Bajo Aragón\" administrative division is only a small fraction of the historical territory, the name \"Bajo Aragón histórico\" is now commonly used in order to distinguish it from the homonymous small comarca.\n\n\n"}

In March 2013 a book \"Information Development Using MIKE2.0\" was published promoting it. \n\nThe methodology provides a framework for information management.\nIt covers how information is created, accessed, presented and used in decision-making to how it is kept secure, stored and destroyed.\n\nWhile initially focused around structured data, the it coined the term \"information development\". \nThe MIKE2.0 approach is based on the premise that traditional software delivery has under-focused on the information management. The goal of MIKE2.0 is to create a new competency, specifically for managing information\n\nMIKE2.0 introduces the concept of an integrated content repository.\n\nThis repository is a federated hub of shared assets from the Internet and content held internally within an organization. Using this concept, organizations can create mashups to the MIKE2.0 standard and information management assets on the World Wide Web.

It proposes to be an approach which sits between a completely open Wikipedia-style model and a more rigorous development approach seen with software development.

The methodology states that this model is likely to evolve over time\n\nMIKE2.0 is made up of building blocks, given in a block diagram.\n\nProducts tend to focus on a certain type of problem as opposed to being generalized for information management like the overall implementation guide.\n\nThe approach of the MIKE2 Methodology is to drive implementation of information management projects through a conceptual architecture framework known as strategic architecture for the federated enterprise (SAFE). SAFE goes across applications, data, and infrastructure and is designed to accommodate the inherent complexities of a highly federated organisation. Using a Conceptual Architecture helps align projects to a target vision for the future and to take the complexity out of the myriad of vendor choices around integration and information management.\n\nInformation governance is a term used in MIKE2.0. The governance model provides assessment tools, information standards, organizational structures and roles and responsibilities in relation to managing information assets.

The crater was discovered by NASA's \"New Horizons\" space probe on its flyby of Pluto. The name was chosen as a reference to Leia Organa from the \"Star Wars\" media franchise in the theme of naming Charon's craters after science fiction characters. Organa crater is rich in frozen ammonia, which suggests it was created very recently. The location of Organa crater is in the northern Pluto-facing hemisphere of Charon.\n\nOrgana crater is the only known crater on Charon that contains abundant ammonia. The ammonia was detected using the \"New Horizons\" LEISA instrument, by observing an absorption of infrared light in the band, which is associated with ammonia.\n\nThe source of the ammonia has not been confirmed, but it is associated with the impact process that created Organa crater, perhaps by removing the overlaying layer of water of ice and regolith. If this is confirmed, the detection could indicate that Charon has experienced cyrovolcanic activity, with ammonia as magma. This interpretation is puzzling, since cryovolcanism isn't known to occur on such small bodies. In this scenario, the ammonia may have precipitated from an atmosphere, or soaked the ground from a subsurface source, or diffused out of the existing tholin.\n\nAn alternate explanation suggests the deposit of ammonia was delivered by the impactor that created Organa crater. In either case, it is believed that Organa crater is the result of a recent impact, less than 10 million years ago. The impact that created Organa crater may have been so recent that the ammonia hasn't yet been destroyed by radiation from space.\n\n"}

{"id": "8392357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8392357", "title": "Shovel-shaped incisors", "text": "Shovel-shaped incisors\n\nShovel-shaped incisors (or, more simply, shovel incisors) are incisors whose lingual surfaces are scooped as a consequence of lingual marginal ridges, crown curvature or basal tubercles, either alone or in combination.\n\nShovel-shaped incisors are relatively common in Central, East and Southeast Asians; the Eskimo and Aleut peoples of Northeast Asian and North America (including but not limited to the Inuit peoples of eastern Alaska, arctic Canada and Greenland); and Aboriginal North and South Americans. In Europeans and Africans, shovel-shaped upper incisors are uncommon or not present. There is a spectrum of the degree of shoveled-ness, ranging on a scale from 0 to 7 of spatulate incisors to shoveled incisors. It was theorized that positive selection for shovel shaped incisors over the spatulate incisors are more commonly found in anthropoids within cultures that used their teeth as tools due to a greater structural strength in increased shovel shaped incisors. However, more modern research suggests that instead genetics plays a role in the degree of shoveled-ness. \n\nIn some instances, incisors can present a more pronounced version of this called double shovel-shaped. When present, shovel-shaped incisors can indicate correlation among populations and are considered to be one of the non-metrical traits in osteology. Structurally resembling the shovel-shaped incisors, double-shovel-shaped incisors are distinguished by a more pronounced mesial ridge comparing to the distal ridge. Similarly, the grades for both shovel-shaped incisors and the double shovel-shaped incisors in females are significantly greater than that in males. \n\nShovel-shaped dental characteristic are also observed in \"Homo erectus\" and in Neanderthals, although the morphology of these shoveled incisors is distinct from the modern human form of shoveling. The morphology of Neanderthal's anterior teeth has been seen as an adaptation to the heavy use of their canines and incisors in processing and chewing food, and the use of their teeth for activities other than feeding.\n\nVariation in modern human incisor shoveling has been associated with the presence/absence of the V370A allele of the \"Ectodysplasin A Receptor\" (\"EDAR\") gene. The EDAR V370A isoform arises from a single nucleotide polymorphism/missense mutation which changes the 370 Valine residue to an Alanine on the EDAR gene. The effect is approximately additive, where individuals with one copy of the allele have intermediate expression of shovel-shaped incisors and homozygotes have more strongly shoveled incisors. The trait is pleiotropically related to thicker and straighter hair shafts, other dental traits, sweat glands, and mammary gland ductal branching. An earlier quantitative genetic analysis of a Finnish population also revealed that inheritance of incisor shoveling is monogenic. The 1540C allele of EDAR is also strongly correlated with the presence of shovel-shaped incisors and Asian specific hair thickness, as found in a study conducted on the DNA from Japanese populations.\n\nIt is hypothesized that other pleiotropic effects associated with the V370A allele were favored by natural selection to help promote the presence of the allele and thus the emergence of shovel-shaped incisors. One of these associated traits is increased ductal branching in the mammary gland, which improves nutrient transport in breastmilk. This may likely have conferred a survival advantage to those with the allele during the Last Glacial Maximum in certain environments with high altitudes and low Vitamin D.\n\nThe first description of shovel-shaped incisors was in 1870. During the 20th century, it was accepted that incisor shoveling yielded a direct advantage to the possessor. The proposed explanation for this at the time was that shovel-shaped incisors were stronger than non-shovel shaped incisors, resulting in the evolution of shovel-shaped incisors in regions where having stronger teeth would provide an evolutionary advantage. The greater size and mass of shoveled incisors was said to have provided increased strength and durability as a means to prevent breakage. However, current research shows that part of the genotype, the EDAR gene, which was selected for because of its role in nutrient transfer in breast milk during the era of the Beringian refugium, also determines the degree to which teeth shovel. In an interview, Dr. Hlusko suggests that human populations who had the trait migrated from Asia to the Americas, thus leaving their genetic trace around the world. With greater implications outside shoveling itself, the human variation in shoveling also supports the idea that populations are dynamic, rather than the theory of static populations evolving separately and distinctly.\n\nIn the mid 20th century, shovel-shaped incisors were considered to be a trait useful for racial categorization, since the occurrence of shovel-shape incisors varies between many populations. A 1964 text said that many anthropologists at the time used the trait of shovel-shaped incisors as a diagnostic for race.\n\nThe presence of shovel-shaped incisors, among many dental characteristics, is utilized in forensic dentistry to identify an individual’s ancestry. In particular, this trait occurs predominantly in Asian and Native American populations.\n\n"}
