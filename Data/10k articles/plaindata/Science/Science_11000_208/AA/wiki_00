Thus, analytic frames are used to elaborate on starting ideas and usually consist of a list of some key elements found in most of the analysed phenomena (for example, social movements).\n\nTwo specific types of analytic frames are case and aspect based frames. Framing by case refers to researchers using concepts to classify the phenomena they study, while framing by aspect refers to using concepts to characterize the phenomena. For example, a scientists describing a restaurant, a bus, a coffeehouse and a waiting room as a noninteraction places is assigning them into the same category, thus framing them by case. Framing by aspect is going further and differentiating between cases in a given category (how exactly is noninteraction achieved in those places, what forms of social interaction are permitted in those places, etc.).\n\nFrames can be also divided into fixed, fluid, or flexible. Fixed frames don't change in later research states. They are common in quantitative research, and are used to test and prove or falsify a hypothesis. Flexible frames are common in comparative research, where they show which factors may be more relevant in specific research context, helping to explore the problem without making specific hypothesis. Fluid frames are used when researcher wants to limit the influence of the existing, more established theories; they are thus subject to much change and the researcher can use several frames switching between them depending on the gathered data. Fluid frames are most common in the qualitative research.\n\n"}
{"id": "23945936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23945936", "title": "Ancient Chinese urban planning", "text": "Ancient Chinese urban planning\n\nAncient Chinese encompasses the diverse set of cultural beliefs, social and economic structures, and technological capacities that historically influenced urban design in the early period of Chinese civilization. Factors that have shaped the development of Chinese urbanism include: \"fengshui\" geomancy and astronomy; the well-field system; the cosmological belief that Heaven is round and the Earth is square, the concept of \"qi\"; political power shared between a ruling house and educated advisers; the holy place \"bo\"; a three-tiered economic system under state control; early writing; and the walled capital city as a diagram of political power.\n\nUrban planning originated during the urbanization of the Yellow River valley in the Neolithic Age, which began in China around 10,000 B.C. and concluded with the introduction of metallurgy about 8,000 years later, was characterized by the development of settled communities that relied primarily on farming and domesticated animals rather than hunting and gathering. The process in China, as elsewhere in the world, is related to the process of centralizing power in a political state. Although several cultures formed competing states, the direct ancestor of the Chinese state was Longshan culture. Therefore, the earliest Chinese urban planning was a synthesis of Longshan traditional cosmology, geomancy, astrology, and numerology. This synthesis generated a diagram of the cosmos, which placed man, state, nature, and heaven in harmony. The city was planned in the context of this cosmic diagram to maintain harmony and balance.\n\nUrbanization begins at Banpo (4,800-3,750 BC) on the Zhongyuan plain of the Yellow River. Banpo grew from a typical Yangshao village in both size and organization until the construction of the Great Hall ca. 4000 BC. Like Eridu in Mesopotamia, Banpo in East Asia was the first instance of specialized architecture, something other than a house. Physically, Banpo was composed of 200 round pit houses and the Great Hall across 5 hectares and surrounded by a ditch. These pit houses were sited for solar gain by aligning the door to the \"Yingshi\" asterism just after the winter solstice. Already, at this early stage the principle of south-facing entry was firmly established.\n\nAs in other Neolithic communities, life at Banpo was synchronized to the agricultural year, which was timed by the movement of the Big Dipper, which functioned as a celestial clock. The \"Classic of Poetry\" describes this annual cycle. Beginning in spring, adolescents swam through the flood waters at the triangular confluence of two rivers. They emerged shivering, and in this state they were infused with the souls of ancestors buried in the earth who had reemerged at the springs of the Yellow River. In this energized state they procreated in a location deemed to possess magical earth energy. These locations were unsuitable for agriculture, usually a hill, and therefore were uncleared primeval forests. Consecrated procreation was essential to maintaining the cycle of life. When the flood waters receded, the triangle was divided into fields between the families. In autumn there was a large festival at the completion of the harvest. In winter, the men left their homes and retired to the Great Hall, where they were led by the village elders in drinking and singing to repel the cold.\n\nThe needs and beliefs of Banpo society created the prototype Chinese urban form. The springtime sacred procreation sites became, in time, the Holy Place called \"bo\" . Moreover, the connection between ancestors, earth, and fertility developed into a theory of \"qi\" energy and \"fengshui\" geomancy. The \"Book of Burial\" elaborates this theory. Man is considered concentrated \"qi\", when his bones are returned to the earth they become re-energized by \"qi\". The living descendants are affected by the \"qi\" generated from the bones of their ancestors, \"as a lute string will pick of the vibration of another lute string near it.\" In this theory, the world was an active matrix of \"qi\" into which graves, houses, and cities must be carefully inserted by fengshui principals to maintain harmony. The shape of this world was described by a parallel cosmology of a round heaven revolving around a square earth. This \"gaitian\" cosmology originated from neolithic astronomy. This cosmic diagram is depicted on jade \"bi\" and \"cong\" used to talk to sky and earth spirits, respectively. In particular, Yangshao pottery decorated with Big Dipper inscribed on a nine-in-one square (earth) surrounded by a circle (heaven) already depicts a cosmic diagram of earth divided into nine parts. This nine-in-square, in time, became basis of the well-field system, which was the basic geometric and legal module of urban-regional planning. Likewise, the Great Hall became the prototype of later palaces and imperial cities.\n\nLongshan Culture (3000-2000 BC) arrived from the east one thousand years after Banpo in the same area. This arrival is mythologized by the story of the Yellow Emperor, a man of vigorous energy who dispensed law, standardized measures, invented writing, and conquered. The Longshan tribes formed a superstratum over Yangshao culture. As they fused ideologically and socially, all the elements of a new state and civilization appeared. Culturally, protowriting in the form of the Longshan Script was used on oracle bones. Politically, a Longshan warlord ruled with the help of a Yangshao adviser. Both the use of oracle bones, and the rule of a king with adviser had continuity into the Shang Dynasty. The first capital was Chengziya in 2500 BC followed by Taosi in 2300 BC and finally by Erlitou in 2000 BC. Longshan Culture developed directly into the Xia and Shang Dynasties.\n\nThe hierarchical and militaristic aspects of Longshan culture are evident in their cities. Their shape is a walled square filled with square houses. The transition from round to square homes is always accompanied by centralizing power in history. The square shaped city, itself a product of centralized power, historically arises a from a military encampment. It is the city as a diagram of political power. The new order made its mark on the Urban-Regional context. Three levels of settlement emerged in the early Longshan state, village called Jū (0-1 ha), city Yi (1-5 ha), and capital called Dū (<5 ha). These three tiers of settlements are the physical realization of central place theory. The original Yangshao Jū villages formed a matrix of production that channeled goods upward to larger Longshan Yi and ultimately to the Dū. Political power was therefore defined as the amount of the highly productive matrix of agriculture and villages under control. The greater the area, the more wealth passed upwards to the capital. Other cities were economically unnecessary as there were neither long distance trade nor markets.\n\nThe final Longshan capital, Erlitou is the physical manifestation of massive social change in China c 2000 BC. Erlitou began in the Neolithic as a Yangshao bo, with later additions of altars and temples. It was a sacred city, even when absorbed by the Longshan tribes, and thus was never walled. Erlitou was the site of transition into the Bronze Age. The legendary Xia Dynasty may have been the ruling class of Erlitou.\n\nErlitou is sited at the confluence of the Luo and Yi rivers, a sacred place known as the Waste of Xia. Geographically, the Waste of Xia marked the center of the nine-in-one square earth. During the transitional Erlitou Culture, diverse Neolithic traditions were woven into one coherent harmonious philosophical and political system. In this system earth was the mirror of heaven ruled by the Jade Emperor. Residing in Polaris, he sent the heavenly breath of \"qi\" down to earth through meridians. The \"qi\" concentrated in mountains and rivers, and by informed site planning a building and even a city could fit into this energized matrix. Politically, \"qi\" flowed from heaven through earth into and the through the divine emperor, through his city, and out of the gates into his realm. The emperor kept heaven and earth in harmonious balance through his absolute power. An adviser class interpreted the omens of heaven to inform his actions. \nGeographically, the state was believed to be square shaped and centered on the ruler. As described in the \"Book of Documents\", China is a square of 45,000 \"li\" with five nested squares spaced at 500 \"li\" to create five zones. Beginning at the center, Royal Domain (500 x 500 \"li\"), Noble Domain, Domain of Peace-Securing, Domain of Restraint, and Wild Domain. Outside the fifth zone, the barbarian tribes lived. The Xia and early Shang palace was a miniature diagram of this cosmos. It had a traditional Longshan square shape oriented strictly north-south since \"qi\" flows that direction. This square was further subdivided into nine parts based on the now ancient nine-in-one square, which had become a prosperity symbol. A rectilinear walled settlement for servants and craftsmen formed around this palace.\n\nThe nine-in-one square was transformed into the Holy Field symbol, sometime during the Shang Dynasty. In a myth the founder of the Xia Dynasty, Yu the Great, received the Holy Field symbol from a magical turtle sent by heaven. Its importance cannot be underestimated as it is the geometric basis of ancient Chinese architecture, urban planning, and geography. By the time of the Xia Dynasty, the nine-in-one square territory of earth was divided into nine states (九州; Jiǔzhōu).\n\nAlthough an important stage in urbanization, Erlitou was not a true city. It was a palace complex surrounded by an oversized Neolithic village. During the Bronze Age, expensive bronze artifacts belonged exclusively to the aristocracy, and the peasants still lived at a neolithic level of development. There was a succession of these palatial \"du\" capitals during the Xia and into the Early Shang Dynasties. Each successive capital had a higher level of development until the Late Shang capital Yin. Yin was the first true city and represented the culmination of Longshan Culture. The design of the palace at Yin was copied by the Zhou Dynasty to create the palace at Zhouyuan, which consolidated all the addition and experimentation of Yin over centuries. Although a copy, Zhouyuan was innovative for its high level of planning. This feature of Zhou urbanism would later be implemented on a national scale. Politically, the Zhou tribe, a vassal of the Shang dynasty, moved through a series of three capitals, Fan, Bo, and Shen, before settling at their ancestral capital, Zhouyuan on the Weishui River.\n\nAs China moved into the Iron Age the control of the Zhou over their empire dissolved into multiple states. This period, called the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, was a time of great urbanization in China. Chengzhou became the political capital of the Eastern Zhou in 510 BC (its fortification tripled in width). The cities lost the rank to size hierarchy imposed by Zhou authority and grew according to their economic and military functions. This period, although politically chaotic, was a great period of urbanization and experimentation with architecture and urban planning.\n\nAlong with the growth of cities there was a parallel growth of urban society; independent merchants, artisans, scholars, and the like all emerged as a new social class at this time. In addition to the growth in the Yellow River Valley, the Yangtze River Valley began to urbanize under the cultural model of the Zhou Dynasty. The cities of states such as Wu, Yue, Chu, and Shu had regional variations. By the time of the Qin Dynasty conquest there was a great diversity of wealthy cities across China, excluding the Lingnan region.\n\nThe city marketplace with tower was a new feature of this era that marked the beginning of an integrated economic function of cities. The architecture of the warring states featured high walls, large gates, and towers. The development of the tower as a symbol of power and social order especially defined this era. The tower usually projected outward at the top to create an image of strength and intimidation. The new marketplace was always overlooked by a tower.\n\nDuring the Warring States and Han, the beginnings of a classical textual tradition of city planning developed. Although there is little direct evidence that any classical text exerted an important influence on urban design until the late imperial period, the texts themselves have a much longer history. While some important literary evidence concerning Zhou urban construction can be found in the \"Classic of Poetry\" and the \"Book of Documents\", during the Han dynasty a text emerged that would later become the \"locus classicus\" of the ideal imperial capital.\n\nThis text, \"The Artificer’s Record\", is a description of craftsmen’s techniques that includes two sections on city construction. It is a late addition to the \"Rites of Zhou\" (\"Zhouli\" 周禮) one of three ritual classics canonized during the Han. The \"Rites of Zhou\" is a blueprint for governmental administration divided into six offices representing Heaven, Earth, and each of the four seasons. The section for the \"Offices of Winter\", a bureau charged with the oversight of public works, was lost sometime before or during the Qin to Han transition. During the Western Han, \"The Artificer’s Record\" was added as a replacement.\n\nThe first section on urban construction in \"The Artificer’s Record\" describes ancient techniques for siting a city, including methods for precisely orienting the site to the cardinal directions and determining the levelness of the land. The second section describes the basic the features of the ideal capital city:\n\n“The carpenters construct the capital city, which is a square of nine \"li\" on each side. On each side there are three gates. Within the city there are nine north-south and nine east-west roads; the north-south roads are as wide as nine carriages side by side. The ancestral temple of the ruling house is to the left of the palace, the temple to god of the soil is to the right. The palace faces the court in front and the market is behind it. The court and the market are both one \"fu\" in area.”\n\nThis section goes on to describe the structure and dimensions of important buildings (as well as their historical precedents), and the heights of the towers surmounting the palace, inner city wall, and outer city wall.\n\nThere are several cosmologically significant features of this basic urban outline, including cardinal orientation, square shape, (implied) centrality of the ruler’s palace, grid structure, and the prominence of the number nine. The nine-by-nine grid has led some scholars to suggest that the plan is based on the cosmological belief that the Earth is a square divided into nine sections. This structure is reproduced by the magic square, a tool for divination.\n\nAlthough the “Kaogongji” does not explicitly identify this model with any historical city, it has been traditionally associated with Chengzhou, a city built by the Duke of Zhou soon after the Zhou conquest of the Shang. The “Proclamation at Luo,” a chapter of the \"Book of Documents\", describes how the Duke of Zhou traveled to Luo (near the site of present-day Luoyang) to establish a secondary capital for the new Zhou dynasty, further solidify the Zhou receipt of the Mandate of Heaven, and relocate the former subjects of the defeated Shang.\n\nThe imperial era of urban planning was marked by an attempt to extend imperial authority uniformly across China by creating an economic and political urban hierarchy. In the Han, this integration was imagined as the resurrection of an idealized memory of the golden age of the Zhou dynasty. Each province was divided into prefectures and each prefecture into counties. The network of imperial administrative cities was overlaid on an existing network of unwalled villages and townships. One county therefore ruled over several townships and many more villages. At the apex of this administrative hierarchy was a new creation, the imperial capital.\n\nHistorically, the cities of the Seven Warring States were combined into one unified regional system under the Qin Dynasty unification of China. Also under the Qin dynasty Chengzhou lost its status and was renamed Luoyang in 236 BC. The Qin dynasty destroyed most of the Eastern Zhou urbanization to concentrate its collected wealth at the capital Xianyang. Colonization of the Lingnan and Ordos regions began at this time, using a modified version of the Zhou classical standard of urban design. The Qin created a national system of military garrisons on a three-tier administrative hierarchy as a practical measure to control the population according to strict legalistic principles. The Qin soon lost power in a revolt and were replaced by the Han dynasty, who continued many aspects the Qin system of imperial administration, including its system of laws.\n\nAt its inception the Han dynasty was immediately faced with the task of rebuilding the urban infrastructure which had been destroyed by Qin dynasty purges and the war of succession after its downfall. According to the \"Records of the Grand Historian,\" Gaozu, the Han founder, initially desired to establish the new capital at Luoyang, the former site of Chengzhou, in order to associate the Han with the illustrious early Zhou. However, it was ultimately decided that the new capital, Chang'an, should be built near the old Qin capital at Xianyang.\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty official administration extended only to the county level. The county (县; xiàn) was the primary unit of government control which harnessed the productive power of the villages in its area of control to concentrate wealth. The county was thus a city-state in function with two parts; a walled settlement 1×1\"li\" at the geographical center of territory. The city had no name of its own, it was named by adding the suffix -\"cheng\" to the county's name. The territory of the county was divided into districts called townships (乡; xiāng) which were subdivided into villages (村; cūn). Villages generally had a population of 100. Currently the village level is the lowest level of administration in China. These local units, counties, were collected in groups of 8-10 called prefectures, and the prefectures were gathered in groups of 12-16 to form provinces. Economically, the county was a market for productive countryside, which consisted not only of agriculture, but also townships and villages of people to work the land and produce goods by cottage industry. The county extended military control over a segment of this productive matrix and was the entry point for goods to channel upward to the Imperial City. There were approximately 1500 counties in China proper. This economic structure was later modified by commercial towns in the Middle Ages.\n\nA county was controlled by a magistrate in a walled complex in the walled county center. He was responsible for tax collection, justice, postal service, police, granaries, salt stores, social welfare, education, and religious ceremony. The magistrate's complex (yamen) was sited at the center of this the city at the point where the main east-west street crossed the main north-south street. The main entrance was in the south and axially aligned along the main north south street connecting to the south gate of the walls. Two arches on the east west street marked the entry forming a small plaza. The south side of the plaza was a dragon wall and the north was the main gate of the compound. This gate lead to a courtyard passing through this courtyard to another gate, called the gate of righteousness, lead to the main courtyard of the complex. The north side of this courtyard was the central hall where the magistrate worked the two side halls contained the six offices. Behind the central hall was another courtyard and hall where the magistrate met with higher-ranking officials. The three courtyard compound formed the center of the complex to the east west of it were other halls, offices, granaries, stables, libraries, official residences, and prisons.\n\nThe imperial capital was meant to exist outside of any one region, even the one it was physically located in. To achieve this it used a text based plan, a cult of heaven, forced migration, and symbolization of the city as the Emperor. The evolution of the imperial capital occurred in three stages, first the super-regional capital on Xianyang, followed by the semi-regional and semi-textual capital of Chang'an, and finally fully realized in the fully textual capital of Luoyang. The capital city of the Western Han Dynasty, Chang'an, was built to exceed its predecessor, Xianyang. Luoyang, the capital of the Eastern Han Dynasty, would in turn become the model of all future imperial cities.\n\nAs the empire was divided into counties prefectures and provinces \n\nIt is uncertain to what extent the planners of early and medieval Chinese cities consciously took the \"Kaogongji\" as a model. Very little textual evidence preserves the motives and debates surrounding the construction of China's great pre-modern capitals. However, during the Ming (1346-1644) there was a close formal correspondence between the capital at Beijing and the \"Kaogongji\" model.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12203253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12203253", "title": "Bennett's fracture", "text": "Bennett's fracture\n\nBennett fracture is a fracture of the base of the first metacarpal bone which extends into the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. This intra-articular fracture is the most common type of fracture of the thumb, and is nearly always accompanied by some degree of subluxation or frank dislocation of the carpometacarpal joint.\n\nSymptoms of Bennett fracture are instability of the CMC joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and weakness of the pinch grasp. Characteristic signs include pain, swelling, and ecchymosis around the base of the thumb and thenar eminence, and especially over the CMC joint of the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the CMC joint of the thumb. The patient will often manifest a weakened ability to grasp objects or perform such tasks as tying shoes and tearing a piece of paper. Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the thumb on an object, such as when reaching into a pants pocket.\n\nMany important activities of daily life are dependent on the ability to grasp, pinch, and oppose the thumb. In fact, thumb function constitutes about 50% of overall hand function. These abilities are in turn dependent on an intact and functional thumb CMC joint. The CMC joint of the thumb allows a wide range of motion while maintaining stability for grasp and pinch.\n\nWith this in mind, failure to properly recognize and treat the Bennett fracture will not only result in an unstable, painful, arthritic CMC joint with diminished range of motion: it will also result in a hand with greatly diminished overall function.\n\nIn the case of the Bennett fracture, the proximal metacarpal fragment remains attached to the anterior oblique ligament, which in turn is attached to the tubercle of the trapezium bone of the CMC joint. This ligamentous attachment ensures that the proximal fragment remains in its correct anatomical position.\n\nThe distal fragment of the first metacarpal bone possesses the majority of the articular surface of the first CMC joint. Unlike the proximal fracture fragment, strong ligaments and muscle tendons of the hand tend to pull this fragment out of its correct anatomical position.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTension from the APL and ADP muscles frequently leads to displacement of the fracture fragments, even in cases where the fracture fragments are initially in their proper anatomic position. Because of the aforementioned biomechanical features, Bennett fractures nearly always require some form of intervention to ensure healing in the correct anatomical position and restoration of proper function of the thumb CMC joint.\n\nThe Bennett fracture is an oblique intraarticular metacarpal fracture dislocation, caused by an axial force directed against the partially flexed metacarpal. This type of compression along the metacarpal bone is often sustained when a person punches a hard object, such as the skull or tibia of an opponent, or a wall. It can also occur as a result of a fall onto the thumb. This is a common injury sustained from bike falls, as the thumb is generally extended while around the handle bars. It is also a common injury in car crashes, especially into fixed objects, from the driver holding the steering wheel during impact. The hand moves forward, while the steering wheel rim hyperextends the thumb.\n\nSome authors have recently made an assertion against popular belief that the APL tendon is not a deforming force on the Bennett fracture.\n\nThough these fractures commonly appear quite subtle or even inconsequential on radiographs, they can result in severe long-term dysfunction of the hand if left untreated. In his original description of this type of fracture in 1882, Bennett stressed the need for early diagnosis and treatment in order to prevent loss of function of the thumb CMC joint, which is critical to the overall function of the hand.\n\n\nRegardless of which approach is employed (nonsurgical, CRPP, or ORIF), immobilization in a cast or thumb spica splint is required for four to six weeks.\n\nIf intraarticular trapeziometacarpal fractures (such as the Bennett or Rolando fractures) are allowed to heal in a displaced position, significant post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the base of the thumb is virtually assured. Some form of surgical treatment (typically either a CRPP or an ORIF) is nearly always recommended to ensure a satisfactory outcome for these fractures, if there is significant displacement.\n\nThe long-term outcome after surgical treatment appears to be similar, whether the CRPP or the ORIF approach is used. Specifically, the overall strength of the affected hand is typically diminished, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis tends to develop in almost all cases. The degree of weakness and the severity of osteoarthritis does however appear to correlate with the quality of reduction of the fracture. Therefore, the goal of treatment of Bennett fracture should be to achieve the most precise reduction possible, whether by the CRPP or the ORIF approach.\n\nThe Bennett fracture is named after Edward Hallaran Bennett, Professor of Surgery (1837–1907) at Trinity College of the University of Dublin, who described it in 1882. Bennett said his fracture \"passed obliquely across the base of the bone, detaching the greater part of the articular surface, and the separated fragment was very large and the deformity that resulted there-from seemed more a dorsal subluxation of the first metacarpal\".\n\n\n"}

The batholith covers an approximate area of 440 km and lies about 50 km south of the larger Achala Batholith. The batholith contains various circular plutons emplaced by stoping at pressures of 2 kbar or less. Alpa Corral, El Talita and Los Cerros are the three largest individual plutons and together they make up the bulk of the batholith. The most common rock type is monzogranite with biotite and an igneous texture that is equigranular but varies from coarse grained to porphyritic. \n\nThe emplacement of plutons occurred in the Middle to Late Devonian period. Contact aureoles for the batholith are, contrary to other batholiths, largely undeformed. The relation of the magmatic episode represented by the Cerro Aspero Batholith to the Famatinian orogeny is not fully understood. Alternatively it is grouped as a \"Achaliano\" igneous cycle. \n\nVertical to near-vertical veins of fluorite formed in the Cretaceous occur in the batholith. At most veins reach 3 meters in thickness. Collectively these veins constitute the largest reserves of fluorite in the whole Sierras Pampeanas area.\n"}

{"id": "23731243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23731243", "title": "Differential susceptibility hypothesis", "text": "Differential susceptibility hypothesis\n\nThe differential susceptibility hypothesis proposed by Jay Belsky is another interpretation of psychological findings that are usually discussed according to the diathesis-stress model. Both models suggest that people's development and emotional affect are differentially susceptible to experiences or qualities of the environment. Where the Diathesis-stress model suggests a distinct and mostly negativity-sensitive group, Belsky describes a group that is sensitive to negative experiences but also to positive experiences. These models may be complementary, if some individuals are dually or uniquely positivity-sensitive, while other people are uniquely negativity-sensitive.\n\nThe idea that individuals vary in their responsivity to negative qualities of the environment is generally framed in diathesis-stress or dual-risk terms. That is, some individuals, due to their biological, temperamental and/or behavioral characteristics (i.e., \"diathesis\" or \"risk 1\"), are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of negative experiences (i.e., \"stress\" or \"risk 2\"), whereas others are relatively resilient with respect to them (see , an adaptation of Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn's (2007) Figure 1).\n\nA fundamentally different, even if not competing view, of the very same phenomenon is central to Belsky's \"differential susceptibility hypothesis\" and Boyce and Ellis' (2005) related notion of \"biological sensitivity to context\": Individuals do not simply vary in the degree to which they are vulnerable to the negative effects of adverse experience but, more generally, in their developmental plasticity.\n\nOn this hypothesis, more \"plastic\" or malleable individuals are more susceptible than others to environmental influences in a for-better-and-for-worse manner. That is, susceptible to both the adverse developmental sequelae associated with negative environments and the positive developmental consequences of supportive ones. Less susceptible individuals, in contrast, are less affected by rearing conditions, be they presumptively supportive or undermining of well being (see Figure 2, an adaptation of Bakermans-Kranenburg and Van IJzendoorn's (2007) Figure 1).\n\nBelsky suggests that evolution might select for some children who are more plastic, and others who are more fixed in the face of, for example, parenting styles.\n\nBelsky offers that ancestral parents, just like parents today, could not have known (consciously or unconsciously) which childrearing practices would prove most successful in promoting the reproductive fitness of offspring—and thus their own inclusive fitness. As a result, and as a fitness optimizing strategy involving bet hedging, natural selection might have shaped parents to bear children varying in plasticity. This way, if an effect of parenting had proven counterproductive in fitness terms, those children not affected by parenting would not have incurred the cost of developing in ways that ultimately proved \"misguided\".\n\nImportantly, natural selection might favour genetic lines with both plastic and fixed developmental and affective patterns. In other words, there is value to having both kinds at once. In light of inclusive-fitness considerations, children who were less malleable (and more fixed) would have \"resistance\" to parental influence. This could be adaptable some times, and maladaptive other times. Their fixedness would not only have benefited themselves directly, but even their more malleable siblings indirectly. This is because siblings, like parents and children, have 50% of their genes in common. By the same token, had parenting influenced children in ways that enhanced fitness, then not only would more plastic offspring have benefited directly by following parental leads, but so, too, would their parents and even their less malleable siblings who did not benefit from the parenting they received, again for inclusive-fitness reasons. The overall effect may be to temper some of the variability in parenting. That is, to make more conservative bets.\n\nThis line of evolutionary argument leads to the prediction that children should vary in their susceptibility to parental rearing and perhaps to environmental influences more generally. As it turns out, a long line of developmental inquiry, informed by a \"transactional\" perspective, has more or less been based on this unstated assumption.\n\nBelsky, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Van IJzendoorn, (2007) delineated a series of empirical requirements—or steps—for evidencing the differential susceptibility hypothesis. Particularly they identify tests that distinguish differential susceptibility from other interaction effects including diathesis-stress/dual-risk.\n\nWhile diathesis-stress/dual-risk arises when the most vulnerable are disproportionately affected in an adverse manner by a negative environment but do not also benefit disproportionately from positive environmental conditions, differential susceptibility is characterized by a cross-over interaction: the susceptible individuals are disproportionately affected by both negative and positive experiences. A further criterion that needs to be fulfilled to distinguish differential susceptibility from diathesis-stress/dual-risk is the independence of the outcome measure from the susceptibility factor: if the susceptibility factor and the outcome are related, diathesis-stress/dual-risk is suggested rather than differential susceptibility. Further, environment and susceptibility factor must also be unrelated to exclude the alternative explanation that susceptibility merely represents a function of the environment. The specificity of the differential-susceptibility effect is demonstrated if the model is not replicated when other susceptibility factors (i.e., moderators) and outcomes are used. Finally, the slope for the susceptible subgroup should be significantly different from zero and at the same time significantly steeper than the slope for the non- (or less-) susceptible subgroup.\n\nCharacteristics of individuals that have been shown to moderate environmental effects in a manner consistent with the differential susceptibility hypothesis can be subdivided into three categories: Genetic factors, endophenotypic factors, phenotypic factors.\n\nBakermans-Kranenburg and Van IJzendoorn (2006) were the first to test the differential susceptibility hypothesis as a function of Genetic Factors regarding the moderating effect of the dopamine receptor D4 7-repeat polymorphism (DRD4-7R) on the association between maternal sensitivity and externalizing behavior problems in 47 families. Children with the DRD4-7R allele and insensitive mothers displayed significantly more externalizing behaviors than children with the same allele but with sensitive mothers. Children with the DRD4-7R allele and sensitive mothers had the least externalizing behaviors of all whereas maternal sensitivity had no effect on children without the DRD4-7R allele.\n\nEndophenotypic Factors have been examined by Obradovic, Bush, Stamperdahl, Adler and Boyce's (2010). They investigated associations between childhood adversity and child adjustment in 338 5-year olds. Children with high cortisol reactivity were rated by teachers as least prosocial when living under adverse conditions, but most prosocial when living under more benign conditions (and in comparison to children scoring low on cortisol reactivity).\n\nRegarding characteristics of the category of Phenotypic Factors, Pluess and Belsky (2009) reported that the effect of child care quality on teacher-rated socioemotional adjustment varied as a function of infant temperament in the case of 761 4.5-year olds participating in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005). Children with difficult temperaments as infants manifest the most and least behavior problems depending on whether they experienced, respectively, poor or good quality care (and in comparison to children with easier temperaments).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "95646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95646", "title": "Dioptre", "text": "Dioptre\n\nA dioptre (British spelling) or diopter (American spelling) is a unit of measurement of the optical power of a lens or curved mirror, which is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres. (1 dioptre = 1 m.) It is thus a unit of reciprocal length. For example, a 3-dioptre lens brings parallel rays of light to focus at metre. A flat window has an optical power of zero dioptres, and does not cause light to converge or diverge.\n\nDioptres are also sometimes used for other reciprocals of distance, particularly radii of curvature and the vergence of optical beams. The usage was proposed by French ophthalmologist Ferdinand Monoyer in 1872, based on earlier use of the term \"dioptrice\" by Johannes Kepler.\n\nThe main benefit of using optical power rather than focal length is that the lensmaker's equation has the object distance, image distance, and focal length all as reciprocals. A further benefit is that when relatively thin lenses are placed close together their powers approximately add. Thus, a thin 2.0-dioptre lens placed close to a thin 0.5-dioptre lens yields almost the same focal length as a single 2.5-dioptre lens.\n\nThough the dioptre is based on the SI-metric system it has not been included in the standard so that there is no international name or symbol for this unit of measurement—within the international system of units, this unit for optical power would need to be specified explicitly as the inverse metre (m). However most languages have borrowed the original name and some national standardization bodies like DIN specify a unit name (dioptrie, dioptria, etc.) and derived unit symbol \"dpt\".\n\nThe fact that optical powers are approximately additive enables an eye care professional to prescribe corrective lenses as a simple correction to the eye's optical power, rather than doing a detailed analysis of the entire optical system (the eye and the lens). Optical power can also be used to adjust a basic prescription for reading. Thus an eye care professional, having determined that a myopic (nearsighted) person requires a basic correction of, say, −2 dioptres to restore normal distance vision, might then make a further prescription of 'add 1' for reading, to make up for lack of accommodation (ability to alter focus). This is the same as saying that −1 dioptre lenses are prescribed for reading.\n\nIn humans, the total optical power of the relaxed eye is approximately 60 dioptres. The cornea accounts for approximately two-thirds of this refractive power (about 40 dioptres) and the crystalline lens contributes the remaining one-third (about 20 dioptres). In focusing, the ciliary muscle contracts to reduce the tension or stress transferred to the lens by the suspensory ligaments. This results in increased convexity of the lens which in turn increases the optical power of the eye. The amplitude of accommodation is about 15 to 20 dioptres in the very young, decreasing to about 10 dioptres at age 25, and to around 1 dioptre above age 50.\n\nConvex lenses have positive dioptric value and are generally used to correct hyperopia (farsightedness) or to allow people with presbyopia (the limited accommodation of advancing age) to read at close range. Concave lenses have negative dioptric value and generally correct myopia (nearsightedness). Typical glasses for mild myopia will have a power of −1.00 to −3.00 dioptres, while over the counter reading glasses will be rated at +1.00 to +3.00 dioptres. Optometrists usually measure refractive error using lenses graded in steps of 0.25 dioptres.\n\nThe dioptre can also be used as a measurement of curvature equal to the reciprocal of the radius measured in metres. For example, a circle with a radius of 1/2 metre has a curvature of 2 dioptres. If the curvature of a surface of a lens is \"C\" and the index of refraction is \"n\", the optical power is φ = (\"n\" − 1)\"C\". If both surfaces of the lens are curved, consider their curvatures as positive toward the lens and add them. This will give approximately the right result, as long as the thickness of the lens is much less than the radius of curvature of one of the surfaces. For a mirror the optical power is φ = 2\"C\".\n\nThe \"magnifying power\" \"V\" of a simple magnifying glass is related to its optical power \"φ\" by\nThis is approximately the magnification observed when a person with normal vision holds the magnifying glass close to his or her eye.\n\n\n"}

During the Getting the Scoop panel, Adam Schefter managed to give a live demonstration, breaking some NFL news mid-panel.\n\nCompetitive Advantage talks by John D’Angelo, Larry Coon, Meeta Singh, and Eric Joyce and Cam Lawrence on, respectively, preventing Tommy John surgery, understanding the new NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement, the impact of sleep on sports performance, and analytics’ role in NHL draft strategy generated significant interest. Over two days leaders from across the sports landscape provided attendees insight on some of the most critical issues in the industry today. Attendees were also treated to 9 workshops on topics ranging from coding in SQL to data scraping and optimization.\n\nThe Research Papers Competition presented by Wasserman remains a key source of innovation where groundbreaking researchers from around the world redefine sports analytics. Top prize went to John Drazan, Amy Loya, Benjamin Horne, and Ron Eglash for their work on using sports analytics to stimulate youth interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit was alive and well at the Startup Competition & Trade Show, with 24 companies aiming to disrupt the sports industry. In addition, 2017 marked the introduction of the Accelerator Competition presented by Reebok. The judges were so impressed with the participants that both Nix Biotech and Open Gym walked away with the top prize and the opportunity to grow their businesses with Reebok’s support. Additional events—a dedicated esports room that hosted a ProAm tournament, drone racing, and a chess simulation with Polgar—helped make this the most interactive SSAC yet.\n\nFinally, it wouldn’t be SSAC without a nod to the individuals who have used analytics to transform the sports world. Oakland A’s Executive Vice President Billy Beane, whose Moneyball approach to baseball has made an impact far beyond the diamond, took home the Alpha Award for Lifetime Achievement. The 2016 World Champion Chicago Cubs were named Best Analytics Organization. Bob Myers and the Golden State Warriors took the Best Transaction prize for bringing Kevin Durant to the Bay Area just three months before Durant added an NBA Championship and Finals MVP to his resume. Finally, Q30 and its anti-concussion Q-Collar earned an Alpha Award for Best Innovation.\n\nThe excitement was hardly limited to the people in the Hynes Convention Center. SSAC’s social media footprint was massive throughout the two days. The conference’s live streams reached over 650K people. SSAC’s Snapchat filter was viewed by over 22.8K accounts. The conference made its mark on Twitter, with #SSAC17 trending No. 1 nationally.\n\nThe inaugural conference was held on February 10, 2007 at a variety of classrooms on the MIT campus and had 175 attendees. Nine different panel topics were showcased including baseball analytics featuring Bill James, basketball analytics, fan management, and sports technology. The conference was highlighted by keynote speakers J.P. Ricciardi, then-Senior Vice President of Baseball Operations and General Manager of the Toronto Blue Jays and Jamie McCourt, then-CEO of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe conference was held on February 9, 2008 at the Ray and Maria Stata Center. The 350 guests in attendance heard a keynote speech by Boston Celtics CEO and co-owner Wycliffe Grousbeck. Among the eleven panels offered during the day, the most popular was Defending the Title, which included decision-makers from the then reigning champions of the four major sports leagues; Bill Polian (Then President, Indianapolis Colts), RC Buford (General Manager, San Antonio Spurs), Brian Burke (Then General Manager, Anaheim Ducks), and Jed Hoyer (Then Assistant General Manager, Boston Red Sox).\n\nThe conference was held on March 7, 2009 at the Stata Center for the final time and was the first to use a featured panel format. Before an audience of 550 the panel, Value of Icon Players, highlighted by Boston Celtics all-star guard Ray Allen discussed how to quantify the contribution made by star players to a team or city. The other featured panel, Evolution of the Fan Experience, looked at how new technology, stadium design, game innovations, and customer initiatives impact fan experience. It was moderated by Bill Simmons and included ESPN commentator Jeff Van Gundy and Brian Burke.\n\nThe conference was held on March 6, 2010 and with over 1,000 attendees, it nearly doubled the gallery from the previous year. As a result, the conference was moved off-campus to the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center in South Boston to accommodate the growing interest. The conference was headlined by a panel that addressed the limits of statistical analysis entitled What Geeks Don't Get: The Limits of Moneyball and was moderated by author Michael Lewis and featured Bill Polian, Jonathan Kraft, Mark Cuban and Bill Simmons. One specific situation discussed was the November 15, 2009 game between the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts in which the Patriots, up 34-28 with the ball on their own 28 yard line, decided to go for it on 4th & 2 rather than punt. Among the other popular panels were Coaching Analytics with New Jersey Nets Head Coach Avery Johnson and Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter and Next Generation Sports Management and Ownership with Boston Celtics Owner Steve Pagliuca and Tampa Bay Rays President Matt Silverman.\n\nA research paper track was introduced in which individuals could submit original analysis that offers a new perspective on anything from evaluating players and game strategies, to examining the success factors for sports business. The research paper track has continued to be an integral part of future conferences. Submissions are evaluated by the organizing committee and, if selected, authors make a 45-minutue presentation to vie for a $7,500 prize. The 2010 winner, Joe Sill, presented \"Improved NBA Adjusted +/- Using Regularization and Out-of-Sample Testing \" which analyzed the traditional way adjusted plus/minus is evaluated and offered a technique to improve its accuracy.\n\nThe conference was held from March 4–5, 2011 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center once again. The conference expanded to a two-day format for the first time, running from early Friday morning until late Saturday afternoon. It was attended by over 1,500 guests and had a waitlist of 300. The first panel of the conference was headlined by Malcolm Gladwell and featured a dialog about whether modern athletes' skills are innate or developed through extensive training. For the remainder of the conference, each time-slot had 3 panels running simultaneously and covered the standard topics of Baseball, Basketball, and Football analytics along with a range of new content. Some of the more popular new panels included The Decision: How Players and Teams Will Choose in the Future with retired basketball player Donny Marshall, CEO and Founder of Priority Sports & Entertainment Mark Bartelsteain, R.C. Buford, Brian Burke, and Michael Wilbon, Referee Analytics with longtime NFL official Mike Carey, and The Future of the Game Day Experience: HDTV vs. Live Events anchored by Co-founder and Chairman of HDNet Mark Cuban. The research paper track was expanded and the 2011 conference added several new facets to the traditional panel discussions. These events include the Evolution of Sport (EOS) presentations, the First Pitch MBA Sports Business Case Competition, and a trade show that offers sports-industry startups the ability to demonstrate products or services and connect with potential customers or business partners.\n\nThe competition showcased the work of nineteen authors. The winner, Arup Sen, presented \"The Moral Hazard in Long‐Term Guaranteed Contracts: Theory and Evidence from the NBA\" which analyzed the effect the final year of a contract has on player performance. \n\nSimilar in scope to TED talks, these presentations offer individuals a chance to present a message, idea or thought that could someday change the face of sport. The 2011 conference featured 14 speakers who were each given roughly 20 minutes to address the audience. Two of the most popular presentations were by Mark Sweeney, founder of AimPoint Technologies, who presented Accelerated Skill Acquisition in Putting and by Henry Abbott, senior writer at ESPN, who presented Bad Decisions in Sports Skew Macho. Some of the others topics included; The Importance of Being Open: What Optical Tracking Data Can Say About NBA Field Goal Shooting, The Foundation of Elite Sports Analytics: Three Secrets You Must Know, and Better Off Guessing? Measuring the Quality of Draft Decisions. The talks have since become some of the most downloaded content on the conference website.\n\nThe case competition presents teams with a current sports business situation and asks students to analyze the situation and present a recommendation. The initial competition was sponsored by AECOM and featured 15 teams from top MBA programs including; MIT Sloan School of Management, Harvard Business School, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, University of Virginia Darden School of Business, Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, and Yale School of Management. The MIT Sloan School of Management team was the winner of the inaugural competition.\n\nThe 6th annual conference was held from March 2–3, 2012 at the Hynes Convention Center located in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. The attendance grew by over 50% from 2011 (13x increase since 2007) to over 2,200 guests with a waitlist of 250. There were 23 panels featuring over 100 panelists, and had representatives from 5 current championship teams, including: Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, Manchester United F.C. CEO David Gill, Boston Bruins GM Peter Chiarelli, New York Giants Chairman Steve Tisch, and current Houston Astros GM and former St. Louis Cardinals Vice President Jeff Luhnow.\n\nThe conference had multiple panels running simultaneously and covered the sports of baseball, basketball, football, hockey, soccer, tennis, motorsports. A groundbreaking eSports panel, highlighting the growth of competition in video games, panel was also featured. 11 first-time panels were introduced and addressed topics both on the business and operations of sports. The conference theme of celebrating analytics was exemplified through images of analytical decisions displayed throughout the venue. Among those included were Brain Westbrook taking a knee on the 1 yard-line with 2 minutes left to allow the Eagles to run out the clock, Greg Popovich employing Hack-a-Shaq in key moments, New Orleans Saints onside kick to start the 2nd half of the 2010 Super Bowl, and the Patriots allowing a touchdown while leading with 64 seconds to play in the 2012 Super Bowl. \nThe most popular panels were \"In the Best Interest of the Game: The Evolution of Sports Leagues\", which addressed how leagues have evolved and what the future holds regarding both on-field and off-field issues, \"Fanalytics\" which looked how to predict fan behavior and improve the fan experience drive revenues, and \"Franchises in Transition\" which highlighted the various strategies used by teams to achieve success.\n\n\nEach day of the conference ended with a live B.S. Report with Bill Simmons interviewing Bill James on Friday and Mark Cuban on Saturday. The ESPN show Numbers Never* Lie, hosted by Michael Smith and Charissa Thompson, was broadcast live from the conference on Friday afternoon and conversed with conference panelists Mark Shapiro, Paraag Marathe, and Bill James. The conference continued its success in attracting new, interesting and unique research papers and Evolution of Sports talks. Some new facets unveiled for this conference included the inaugural \"Alpha Awards\" for sports analytics achievement as well as the inaugural \"Trade Show Business Competition\". The conference website also added a sports analytics blog and job board.\n\nThe research paper track received over 100 submissions and 20 authors were selected to display their work at the conference, with 10 chosen to given 20 minute presentations. The presenters competed for the $7,500 Grand Prize. The paper \"Deconstructing the Rebound with Optical Tracking Data\" by Rajiv Maheswaran was awarded the Grand Prize. \"CourtVision: New Visual and Spatial Analytics for the NBA\" by Kirk Goldsberry received second place. Additionally, the inaugural ESPN \"Fan’s Choice\" award was initiated. The competition was featured in the March 5th issue of ESPN The Magazine and voting occurred online.

Specifically, students were asked to refine methods teams use to \"right size\" professional football stadiums. The University of Chicago Booth School of Business (Josh Yelsey, Moon Javaid, Shreena Amin) won the competition.\n\nThe competition gave 12 start-ups \"4 Good Minutes\" to explain their business and its role within the sport industry. StarStreet, a real money sports stock market, won the inaugural competition and the $3,500 cash prize. MC10, who develops next generation of electronic systems and SportBoard, who provides scouting and assessment software for all levels of sports were the other finalists.\n\nThe conference created the 1st Annual \"Alpha Awards\" to recognize people and organizations that have changed sports by defying conventional wisdom through sports analytics. The following were the inaugural winners:\n\nThe 7th annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference was held from March 1–2, 2013 at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center (BCEC). Attendance grew by over 25% from 2012 to more than 2,700 guests and featured 125 panelists across 30 panels. Featured panelists included: Michael Lewis, Mark Cuban, Nate Silver, R.C. Buford, Brian Burke, Jack Del Rio, Herman Edwards, Stan Kasten, Jonathan Kraft, Andrea Kremer, Jackie MacMullan, Steve Pagliuca, Bill Polian, Adam Silver, John Skipper, and Stan Van Gundy.\n\nThe conference featured multiple panels running simultaneously and covered a range of topics across sports and the business of sports.

The discussion examined the influence of big data, the rise of technology, and the evolving competitive advantage analytics provides.\n\nThe conference continued to emphasize and promote innovation in the sports industry through conference staples such as the research paper competition and Evolution of Sport (EoS) series. Each was again a featured part of the conference, drawing packed audiences across the two days. In the research paper category, \"The Value of Flexibility in Baseball Roster Construction\" by Timothy Chan and Douglas Fearing took home first prize, while \"The Automated Prospect Model\" by Adam Guttridge was selected as the best EoS presentation.\n\nOpportunities for students and start-ups to share their ideas remained a focus with the third annual \"First Pitch\" business case competition sponsored by Major League Baseball Advanced Media. In a similar forum, the second annual Trade Show Blitz Competition provided space for exploring new, unique ideas in sports analytics from start-up companies.\n\nFinally, our second Lifetime Achievement Alpha Award winner was Bill Belichick, Head Coach of the New England Patriots. He accepted the honor via video and the video promptly went viral.\n\nThe conference's impact on the sports industry continued to grow with over 100 media mentions over the two-day conference, including articles from Bloomberg, \"Forbes\", \"The New York Times\", and \"Sports Illustrated\". Additionally, the conference trended #3 nationally on Twitter and in the top 5 internationally, with 22,000 #ssac or #ssac13 tweets posted throughout the conference.\n\n\"From Ripple to Revolution,\" co-chair Daryl Morey began in echoing the theme of the 2014 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. \"Things start small, and using analytics, eventually become a necessary part of competing.\" Morey’s panel with some of the great innovators in sports – Bill James and Nate Silver – kicked off a conference which has become the fabric of the sports analytics revolution. In 2014, 2000+ attendees representing 300+ teams, leagues and sports-related organizations descended on Boston to hear the latest in the development and use of sports analytics. Expanding far beyond the attendees at the Hynes Convention Center, the conference trended on Twitter as high as third throughout the US, with conference attendees relaying quotes and insights to a broad online audience, while hundreds followed panel live-streams on YouTube. Eight years into the conference’s history, nearly every aspect of the sports industry has been impacted by the data revolution. Once again co-chaired by Jessica Gelman and Morey, the 2014 version featured 25 panels, 27 presentations, and 100+ speakers. Innovation in sports analytics remained a primary focus, with over 300 entries in the research paper competition and a series of Evolution of Sports talks by analytics thought-leaders. The role of analytics on the business side of the industry also increased in prominence, with an expanded Competitive Advantage series highlighting the growing role of data in managerial decision-making.\n\nThe heart of the conference remained the panels featuring pre-eminent analytic and industry leaders. The talk of the first day centered around its culmination, the \"Building a Dynasty\" panel in which Jonathan Kraft talked with Jackie MacMullan about the Patriots’ run in the 2000s and Phil Jackson discussed how he led the Bulls and Lakers to 11 NBA Championships. In other Day 1 highlights, panelists discussed the increasing use of analytics on the field, in the front office, and in the boardroom, including entrepreneurs sharing their stories in \"Starting a Sports Business,\" featuring founder-CEOs Kevin Plank of Under Armour, Michael Rubin of Fanatics and Casey Wasserman of his eponymous sports marketing and talent agency.\n\nThis set the stage for a fast-paced Day 2, when a massive crowd filled the main ballroom to watch Malcolm Gladwell engage new NBA commissioner Adam Silver in a heated one-on-one that had the basketball world talking. There was a major splash on the diamond as well with MLB Advanced Media using the SSAC stage to roll out its defensive tracking technology that will fundamentally change the way baseball players are evaluated.\n\nWhile league luminaries, front-office decision-makers and industry leaders spoke about how they are employing analytics in decision-making on the panel stage, the next major advances in sports analytics were shared through research papers, Competitive Advantage presentations, Evolution of Sport talks, Tradeshow competition and the First Pitch MBA case competition. Second Spectrum Inc. won best research paper for the second time in the conference's history based on defining basketball’s rebounding statistic into three separate quantifiable skills. Peter Carr won the EoS competition for his work on \"Broadcasting Live Sports Automatically Using Robotic Cameras.\" Swingbyte, Inc. was judged to be the top presenter at the startup trade show, marketing a product that gives golfers real-time swing analysis on their phones. The team from the University of Wisconsin School of Business captured Aramark’s First Pitch MBA case competition on the analytics of the fan experience, and best transaction was awarded to the three-team trade between the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Chicago White Sox. New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson was given the Lifetime Achievement Alpha Award for his career in baseball, including his role on the forefront of applying sabermetrics in the front office while GM of the Athletics and mentor to Billy Beane and his subsequent tenures as GM of the San Diego Padres and New York Mets. The conference continued to be a hotbed for recruiting and hiring within the industry. The introduction of a resume review session, \"Career Conversations\" between students and business leaders, and a panel on breaking into the sports world highlighted the opportunities and interest of the next generation of sports professionals who will carry forward the revolution.\n\n“This year it has been incredible to see the growth of sports analytics both in breadth and depth” conference chair Jessica Gelman exclaimed to kick off the 2015 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. Continuing as the preeminent sports industry conference, SSAC15 also grew in breadth and depth as it pushed out the limits of data analytics and sport, delivering two days of groundbreaking innovation and discussion. The conference welcomed three commissioners: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, and MLS Commissioner Don Garber, once again highlighting the growing acceptance of sports analytics.\n\nThe much anticipated 2015 conference brought together leading sports innovators, influencers and technologies at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center February 27–28. The ninth annual conference drew more than 3,200 attendees (a 50% growth from 2014), representing over 100 professional teams and 300 sports industry organizations. Featuring 29 panels and 15 Competitive Advantage presentations, the conference delved into themes for every fan and industry professional with topics ranging from early analytic adopters, player contract negotiations, entrepreneurship, sports betting, the future of sports media, the value of digital media for fan engagement, adapting and expanding the game for the modern fan and the future of sports analytics. Attendees enjoyed insights from Shane Battier and Sue Bird equating data analytics to another tool in their arsenal similar to a jump shot or strength training; Commissioner Silver, Jonathan Kraft and Marie Donoghue shared their unique vision on media rights and the ever-changing landscape of fan consumption; and SSAC veterans Brian Burke, Nate Silver, RC Buford and Scott Pioli got into heated discussions about how much to attribute the improvement of sports to analytics and how analytics will contribute to the future of sport over the next 5–10 years Other conference speakers included industry veterans such as Wyc Grousbeck, Sean Payton, Oliver Luck, Bob Myers, Jackie MacMullan and many more. \n\nThe SSAC research paper competition continued to remain at the forefront of sports analytics research and showcased some of the most exciting and cutting-edge developments in the theory and practice of sports analytics. Several teams of researchers and academics presented their findings to a panel of expert judges, who produced a split outcome, with two teams sharing the first-place prize. The first team, a group of statisticians at Harvard University, introduced “Counterpoints,” a framework for quantifying basketball players’ defensive contributions based on their ability to suppress and alter shots. The second team, a duo of analysts at Baseball Info Solutions, developed a method to quantify and more finely assign credit for pitch framing to catchers, batters, pitchers and umpires.\n\nThe conference featured two inaugural and fully interactive events: the Data Science and Visualization Zone presented by Booz Allen Hamilton and the SSAC Hackathon presented by ESPN’s Stats & Info Group. The Data Science and Visualization Zone included groundbreaking technological demos, conversation areas, and presentations. The SSAC Hackathon featured students from top universities competing for a coveted internship with ESPN as well as professionals from industry leading companies. Participants analyzed and presented innovative ways to visualize NFL data in order to improve the fan and media experience.\n\nThe conference continued to be a leading recruiting and hiring tool for the sports industry. Lines were out the door early Saturday morning for “Career Conversations” as students met 1-1 with sports business leaders to learn about roles in the sports industry, followed by a panel on breaking into the coveted industry.\n\nSSAC 2015 built on the successes of previous years’ conferences and continued to pioneer the field of sports analytics. With its original content, invited speakers and showcase of advanced technological innovations, SSAC 2015 once again set the industry conference standard in sports analytics.\n\n“We had 175 folks at that first conference…this year we have more speakers than we had attendees [at that first conference]” said conference chair Jessica Gelman in her opening remarks of the 2016 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. As the conference celebrated its 10th year—-its #DecadeOfData—-Gelman and fellow co-chair Daryl Morey reflected on the roots of the preeminent sports industry conference—fondly referred to as the “Super Bowl of Analytics” and “Dork-a-Palooza”—and the massive growth of both the conference and the sports analytics industry as a whole in those ten short years. \n\nThe much anticipated 10th anniversary conference brought together leaders from across the sports community—from teams to players, innovators and influencers—at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center on March 11-12. The 2016 conference, presented by ESPN, grew to new heights in both size and content with nearly 4,000 attendees (20% growth from 2015), over 1,500 students from over 320 academic institutions, 130 teams and leagues and 300 industries attending more content than ever before. The conference featured 6 more panels, double the number of Competitive Advantage talks, the introduction of workshops, and the first ever Facebook live stream of a panel, which reached over 312,000 viewers. Attendees contributed record-breaking conference interactions over the course of the weekend, with over 15,000 posts utilizing the hashtag #SSAC16, over 60 million impressions and over 13,000 accounts viewing the conference snapchat filter.\nThe conference opened with a reference to its earliest inspiration: a Moneyball reunion panel with Bill James, Michael Lewis and Paul DePodesta. Throughout the rest of the weekend, industry leaders covered topics ranging from new scientific developments in panels on sports science and wearable technology, to sports business panels on modern sports finance and the future of the front office, to one-on-ones with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Nate Silver. Attendees were treated to insights from Jonathan Kraft, Michael Rubin and Jared Smith on the ways sports organizations are connecting in a more personalized manner and generating targeted content faster to enhance the fan experience. Jackie MacMullan closed the conference by moderating a high-energy discussion on player retention, building a winner and the overall future of the front office between Nick Caserio, Jeff Luhnow, Bob Myers and Daryl Morey. Other conference speakers included Stan Kroenke, Sam Kennedy, Wyc Grousbeck, Shane Battier, Steve Pagliuca, Vivek Ranadive, Oliver Luck, Michelle McKenna-Doyle, Sue Bird and many more. \n\nWhile league and industry leaders spoke about the current applications of analytics in the panel rooms, the newest advances in sports analytics thinking and technology were showcased in the research papers competition, startup competition, the data visualization room and the Hack-a-thon. A team of Australian researchers won the prestigious Research Paper competition presented by Ticketmaster for their work using Hawkeye technology to discover player patterns in tennis, and, in turn, predict the probability of a given player winning a point. \n\nThe conference continued to be a leading resource for developing new talent in the world of sports with the Hackathon, presented by ESPN, the MBA case competition presented by Ticketmaster—which was won by a team from McGill University—and career conversations providing opportunities for the 1,000+ students in attendance to network and demonstrate their industry skills. \n\nThe weekend concluded with the presentation of the Alpha Awards, as the conference recognized achievement across the entire landscape of sports analytics, as well as special recognition to the ten devotees who been a part of every conference thus far. Through the increasing number of dedicated attendees and the growth and development of the sports analytics field, SSAC 2016 was able to build on the success of previous conferences and again set the industry conference standard in sports analytics.\n"}

Specimens in excess of 50 cm in carapace length have been recorded. Hatchlings have a straight carapace length of 2.0–3.5 cm. Adult Mary River turtles have an elongated, streamlined carapace that can be plain in colour or intricately patterned. Overall colour can vary from rusty red to brown and almost black. The plastron varies from cream to pale pink. The skin colouration is similar to that of the shell and often has salmon pink present on the tail and limbs. The iris can be pale blue. Mary River turtles use bimodal respiration, and so are capable of absorbing oxygen via the cloaca whilst underwater. However, they do regularly come to the surface to breathe air in the usual way.\n\nA unique feature of the male Mary River turtle is the tail, which can measure almost two-thirds of the carapace length. The tail has haemal arches, a feature lost in all other modern turtles. It is probably a derived feature, but its function is not understood. Another unique feature is the exceptionally long barbels under the mandible. Proportionately, the Mary River turtle has the smallest head and largest hind feet of all the species within the catchment, which contributes to its distinction of being the fastest swimmer.\n\nThe turtle is occasionally informally referred to as the green haired turtle due to the fact that many specimens are covered with growing strands of algae which resemble hair.\n\nLittle is known about the ecology and behaviour of the Mary River Turtle. It inhabits flowing and well-oxygenated sections of streams in the Mary River basin, using terrestrial nest sites. Turtles take an unusually long time to mature; it has been estimated that females take 25 years, and males, 30 years to become adults. Mature males may be aggressive towards other males, or turtles of other species. The species is apparently omnivorous, taking plant matter such as algae as well as bivalves and other small animal prey.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Mary River turtle was popular as a pet in Australia, with about 15,000 sent to shops every year during a 10-year period. They were originally known as the \"penny turtle\" or \"pet shop turtle\".\n\nThis species is currently listed as endangered under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992, and under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The international conservation body IUCN lists it as endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is also listed on the Zoological Society of London's Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered list, part of the EDGE of Existence programme. It is Australia's second-most endangered freshwater turtle species, after the western swamp turtle (\"Pseudemydura umbrina\") of Western Australia. Mary River turtles were listed amongst the world's top 25 most endangered turtle species by the Turtle Conservation Fund in 2003.\n\nAustralia's first reptile-focused, nonprofit conservation organisation, the Australian Freshwater Turtle Conservation and Research Association, were the first to breed this species in captivity for release into the wild in 2007.\n\n\n"}

NASSDOC can get documents on inter library loan through DELNET from the member libraries.\n\nPhotocopies are provided from the NASSDOC collection and also from its own network, if the document is not available within the premises.\n\nNASSDOC is involved in the creation of databases and information locating tools: \n\nNASSDOC provides a current awareness service by bringing out publications. Photocopies of references included in the CAS publications are provided. Following are the serial publications of NASSDOC available at the sales counter of the ICSSR :\n\nUnder this scheme, Ph.D. research scholars get financial assistance from ICSSR to consult libraries and archives that are located in other cities. Traveling allowances and a daily allowance are paid to the scholars for this purpose.\n\nUnder this scheme NASSDOC provides financial assistance to conduct research in the field of Library and Information Science and compilation of research/reference tools for social scientists. Project proposals fall under one of the following categories :\n\nIn order to familiarize librarians, information experts and social scientists, with the techniques of information technology, NASSDOC organizes training workshops, seminars and lectures under its Continuing Education Programme in different parts of the country.\n\nNASSDOC has started microfilming of its Ph.D. theses collection. 1500 theses have been microfilmed in three phases during the year 2003–2004, 2004–2005 and 2005–2006. \nNASSDOC has a collection of microfilms/microfiches of Ph.D. theses, some of the Indian and foreign journals, Economic Working Papers, Union Catalogues, Government Publications and rare publications are available for consultation in the Microfilm Section in the Reading Room at ground floor.\n\nThe catalogue database of the library has been converted into machine readable or electronic form with the help of an agency. In total 6000, catalogue records have converted using UNIMARC so that this data can be exchanged with other libraries.\nRFID Technology\n\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been introduced for inventory management of books and members. The technology obviates the need for human intervention in issuance of books/journals to the members in the library. The components used in RFID are electronic chips, which are pasted on books; membership cards (i.e. smart ID cards); two mid-range readers and pad antenna.\n\nLIBSYS software is being used for library automation. NASSDOC has upgraded its LIBSYS Software version 3 to LIBSYS version 4 release 5 under Windows 2000. It works now in LAN.\nModules used in the package are :\n\nFor making the software compatible for exchange of catalogue records UNIMARC utility was purchased. To make the catalogue available online on the web, purchase of the Webopac add-on facility is under process. This facility has been implemented within NASSDOC building but not on Internet scale, due to lack of infrastructure.\n\nInternet connectivity has been provided to officials and scholars in the library. Internet is used for electronic communication, accessing and retrieving information from the subscribed online databases and from other Internet resources.\n\nUnder the project, started in 2003 -2004, digitisation of Indian Social Science Periodical Literature was undertaken. The purpose was to digitise Indian Social Science Literature published in 119 periodicals since their inception to 1970. It has 97492 references. Two disciplines i.e. Economics and Political Science have been taken for this project. The product has been completed and the database has been released in CD-ROM (INSPEL).\n\nThe references in CD-ROM can be searched by name of the author, title of the article, subject of the article, name of the journal in which article has been published. Free search (i.e. the term may exist in any field) can also be conducted. The search results can be printed, saved, or exported to MS word. INSPEL has been developed in Visual Basic as front end for circulation on CDs. \n\nNASSDOC has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Vidyanidhi Digital Library Project of Mysore University to digitise the Ph.D. theses collection of NASSDOC. More than 2000 Ph.D. Theses have been digitised and put on CD–ROM format. The objective is to put them on the web, so that research scholars can view them on the website.\n\nTo promote sale of its publications, the council has a sales counter at NASSDOC. There has been participation of the Council in book fairs and exhibitions.\n"}

POGO's goal is to promote global operational oceanography, the implementation of a Global Ocean Observing System, and the importance of ocean observations for society. In 2011, POGO had 40 Members. The current Chairman (2011-2012) is Prof. Peter Herzig (GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany). The incoming Chairman is Prof. John Field (Marine Research Institute, University of Cape Town, South Africa).\n\nIt is supported from annual dues subscribed by the Members, as well as by grants from charitable foundations. The funds to explore the value of, and then establish, POGO were provided by the Alfred P. Sloan and Richard Lounsbery foundations.\n\nPOGO provides a forum (at the annual meetings and intersessionally) for Members to meet with their peers, and with senior officials of partner organisations, to discuss issues of mutual concern (it is a talking shop). It also serves as a credible voice for the marine science community, through its leadership role in the informal grouping Oceans United, and an advocating body for the establishment of an integrated, global ocean observing system. As a means to ease the shortage in trained observers of the ocean in developing countries, It has developed a suite of programmes in capacity building, and works with relevant partner organisations in the marine field SCOR, IOC, GOOS, GEO). It engages in outreach activities to the general public, a current example being its exhibit at the Ocean and Coasts Best Practices Area Pavilion at the Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea.\n\nIn March 1999, the Directors of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre in the UK, convened a planning meeting in the headquarters of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organisation (IOC-UNESCO) in Paris. This meeting confirmed the value of creating a new partnership and defined the initial mission statement and terms of reference.\n\nScripps Institution of Oceanography hosted the first formal meeting in early December 1999, with g included senior officials from 17 institutions in 12 countries (as well as representatives of the IOC, the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the International Council for Science (ICSU), the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and several international scientific programs. At this meeting, there was agreement on an initial work plan, including development of an advocacy plan for observing systems; participation in processes to secure governmental commitments to fund ocean observing systems; a data interchange demonstration pilot project; and establishment of a clearinghouse for information exchange among POGO members, as well as the broader community.\n\n\nAlthough not funded by POGO, the EAMNet Fellowship Programme, under which scientists from African countries can visit major oceanographic laboratories for training in use of remote sensing for ocean observations, is modelled on the POGO-SCOR Fellowship Programme. It is administered from Plymouth and is an example of the synergy resulting from the co-location of the POGO Secretariat in a member institution.\nUnder POGO capacity-building schemes, some 450 young scientists from 63 countries have received advanced training. Former scholars or alumni of NF-POGO training become members of the rapidly developing NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans (NANO), whose first newsletter appeared in September 2011.\n\nIn its São Paulo declaration of 2001, POGO drew attention to the world imbalance between Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the capacity to observe the oceans, resulting in its establishment of a capacity-building programme (above). It also underlined the relative paucity of ocean observations in the Southern Hemisphere compared with the Northern Hemisphere, and POGO member JAMSTEC, organised a circumnavigation of the Southern Hemisphere, the BEAGLE Expedition, using its ship \"RV Mirai\", at a cost estimated to be around $35M. More recently, selected Antarctic Expeditions of Alfred Wegener Institute have been labelled POGO Expeditions,n. POGO also supports the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS).\n\nAround the time POGO was being started, the Argo programme was also beginning.\n\nThe GEO Secretariat was established during the early years of POGO. Oceans did not appear among the nine societal-benefit areas around which GEO is structured. POGO has led the creation of a new Ocean Task (SB01, Oceans and Society: the Blue Planet) in the 2012-2015 GEO Work Plan. Trevor Platt, Executive Director of POGO, is the overall Coordinator for this Task.\n\nPOGO contributed to OceanObs'09 in Venice in 2009, which led to the opening up of sustained ocean observations to a broader community, including chemical, biological and biogeochemical observations. POGO also participated in the post-Venice Framework for Ocean Observing Committee.\n\nPOGO member institutions have been driving the establishment of OceanSites (coordinated, deep-ocean, multi-disciplinary time-series reference sites), which has made significant progress in recent years.\n\nThe idea for an \"International Quiet Ocean Experiment\" first came up during one of the POGO Annual Meetings. With seed funding from the Sloan Foundation, the idea was further developed in partnership with SCOR. An Open Science Meeting was convened under the auspices of SCOR and POGO at IOC-UNESCO, Paris, in August–September 2011, to develop a Science Plan for the project, which could last up to ten years.\n\n\nThe executive director is Dr. Trevor Platt.\n\n"}

Richards\n\nRichard Walter Richards, GC (14 November 1894 – 8 May 1986), often referred to as Dick Richards, was an Australian science teacher who joined Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition in December 1914 as a physicist with the Ross Sea Party under Captain Aeneas Mackintosh. Richards was barely 20 years old, and had just completed his studies at the University of Melbourne, when SY Aurora sailed. He was to outlive all other members of the expedition, and became the last survivor of the so-called \"Heroic Age\" of Antarctic exploration, dying at the age of 91 in 1985.\n\nRichards was born on 14 November 1894 in Bendigo, Victoria, to Richard Roberts Richards and Louise Alice Richards (nee Philpott.) He was schooled at Bendigo High School, before going on to study mathematics and science at the University of Melbourne.\n\nOn the ill-starred Ross Sea Party, Richards learned sledging and polar travel techniques from Ernest Joyce whom Richards admired. It was Richards who first noticed the disappearance of the Aurora during a gale on 6 May 1915, and coincidentally he was the first to sight her on her return, 20 months later. During the intervening period while the shore party was stranded, Richards participated in the harrowing march to the Beardmore Glacier, laying depots for Shackleton's expected transcontinental party, which of course never came. He observed the deaths of Arnold Spencer-Smith, Victor Hayward and Mackintosh during the journey back from the Beardmore, and was thereafter confined to his bunk for several weeks, suffering from exhaustion and depression.\n\nAfter rescue in January 1917, and his return to Australia, Richards taught at the School of Mines and Industry at Ballarat. After acting as a government adviser on optical apparatus during World War II he returned to Ballarat in 1948, as Principal of the College, retiring in 1958. During his later years he was frequently consulted by historians and chroniclers of polar exploration, often expressing his views in terms. He maintained the view that, though the depot-laying journey was ultimately unnecessary, it was not futile, but was a demonstration of what the human spirit could accomplish in adversity.\n\nRichard Richards was awarded the Albert Medal in 1923 for his efforts on the ice to save the lives of Spencer-Smith and Mackintosh, this award being converted in 1971 to the George Cross, an exchange offered to all Albert Medal holders then living. He is further commemorated by the Richards Inlet at , and also by the Richard W Richards Medal at the Ballarat College of Advanced Education.\n\nIt is reported that Richards signed up for the Trans-Antarctic Expedition without any discussion of payment, and that on his return he received the sum of £70.\n\n"}

{"id": "203452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203452", "title": "Sputnik crisis", "text": "Sputnik crisis\n\nThe Sputnik crisis was a period of public fear and anxiety in Western nations about the perceived technological gap between the United States and Soviet Union caused by the Soviets' launch of \"Sputnik 1\", the world's first artificial satellite. The crisis was a key event in the Cold War that triggered the creation of NASA and the Space Race between the two superpowers. The satellite was launched on October 4, 1957 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.\n\nThe United States was the dominant world power in the early 1950s. Lockheed U-2 spy plane flights over the Soviet Union provided intelligence that the U.S. held the advantage in nuclear capability. However, an education gap was identified when studies conducted between 1955 and 1961 reported that the Soviet Union was training two to three times as many scientists per year as the United States. The launch and orbit of \"Sputnik 1\" suggested that the USSR had made a substantial leap forward in technology, which was interpreted as a serious threat to U.S. national security. This spurred the United States to make substantial federal investments in research and development, education and national security. The Juno I rocket that carried the first U.S. satellite Explorer 1 had been ready to launch in 1956, but that fact was classified and unknown to the public. The Army's PGM-19 Jupiter from which Juno was derived had been mothballed on the orders of defense secretary Charles Erwin Wilson amid interservice rivalry with the U.S. Air Force's PGM-17 Thor.\n\nThe USSR used ICBM technology to launch Sputnik into space. This gave the Soviets two propaganda advantages over the U.S. at once: the capability to send the satellite into orbit, and proof of the distance capabilities of their missiles. This proved that the Soviets had rockets capable of sending nuclear weapons from Russia to Western Europe and even North America. This was the most immediate threat that the launch of \"Sputnik 1\" posed. The United States, a land with a history of geographical security from European wars, suddenly seemed vulnerable.\n\nA contributing factor to the Sputnik Crisis was that the Soviets had not released a photograph of the satellite for five days after the launch. Until this point, its appearance remained a mystery to Americans. Another factor was Sputnik's weight of , compared to United States' plans to launch a satellite of . The Soviet claim seemed outrageous to many American officials who doubted its accuracy. U.S. rockets at the time produced of thrust and U.S. officials presumed that the Soviet rocket that launched Sputnik into space had to have produced of thrust. In fact, the R-7 rocket that launched \"Sputnik 1\" into space produced almost of thrust. All these factors contributed to the American people's perception that they were greatly behind the Soviets in the development of space technologies.\nHours after the launch, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign Astronomy Department rigged an ad-hoc interferometer to measure signals from the satellite. Donald B. Gillies and Jim Snyder programmed the ILLIAC I computer to calculate the satellite orbit from this data. The programming and calculation was completed in less than two days. The rapid publication of the ephemeris (orbit) in the journal \"Nature \"within a month of the satellite launch helped to dispel some of the fear created by the Sputnik launch. It also lent credence to the spurious idea that the Sputnik launch was part of an organized effort to dominate space.\n\nThe successful launch of \"Sputnik 1\" and the subsequent failure of the first two Project Vanguard launch attempts, greatly accentuated the perception in the United States of a threat from the Soviet Union, a perception that had persisted since the Cold War began after World War II. The same rocket that launched Sputnik could send a nuclear warhead anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes, stripping the continental United States of its oceanic defenses. The Soviets had demonstrated this capability on 21 August with a test flight of the R-7 booster. The event was announced by TASS five days later and was widely reported in other media.\n\nFive days after the launch of \"Sputnik 1\", the world's first artificial satellite, Eisenhower addressed the people of the United States. After being asked by a reporter about security concerns regarding the Russian satellite, Eisenhower said \"Now, so far as the satellite itself is concerned, that does not raise my apprehensions, not one iota\".\n\nEisenhower made the argument that Sputnik was only a scientific achievement and not a military threat or change in world power. Eisenhower believed that Sputnik's weight \"was not commensurate with anything of great military significance, and that was also a factor in putting it in [proper] perspective\".\n\nIn 1958 Eisenhower declared three \"stark facts\" the United States needed to confront:\n\nHe followed this statement by saying that the United States needed to meet these challenges with \"resourcefulness and vigor\". Eisenhower's ability to project confidence about the situation was limited because his confidence was based on clandestine reconnaissance. As such, he failed to quell the fears that there was a shift in power between the Americans and Soviets. The perception of the Soviets as more modern than Americans was reinforced by Eisenhower's old-fashioned style. The launch of \"Sputnik 1\" also impacted Eisenhower's ratings in his polls, from which he eventually recovered.\n\nThe media stirred a moral panic by writing sensational pieces on the event. In the first and second days following the event, New York Times wrote that the launch of \"Sputnik 1\" was a major global propaganda and prestige triumph for Russian Communism. Not until after the people of the United States were exposed to a multitude of news reports did it become a \"nation in shock\". The media not only reported public concern, it also created the hysteria. Journalists greatly exaggerated the danger of the Soviet satellite for their own benefit. On October 9, 1957, notable science fiction writer and scientist Arthur C. Clarke said that the day Sputnik orbited around the Earth the United States became a second-rate power.\n\nPoliticians used the event to bolster their ratings in polls. Research and development was used as a propaganda tool and Congress spent large sums of money on the perceived problem of American technological deficiency. After the launch of \"Sputnik 1\" national security advisers overestimated the USSR's current and potential rocket strength which alarmed portions of Congress and the executive branch. When these estimations were released, Eisenhower was forced into an accelerated missile race to appease those concerned with America's safety. Sputnik provoked Congress into taking action on improving the United States' standing in the fields of science.\n\nThe Soviets also had a hand in the political exploitation of the event. Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the USSR, reflected on the event saying \"It always sounded good to say in public speeches that we could hit a fly at any distance with our missiles. Despite the wide radius of destruction caused by our nuclear warheads, pinpoint accuracy was still necessary - and it was difficult to achieve\". At the time, Khrushchev stated that \"our potential enemies cringe in fright\". Political analyst Samuel Lubell conducted research on public opinion about Sputnik and found \"no evidence at all of any panic or hysteria in the public's reaction\" confirming that it was an elite, not popular, panic.\n\nThe launch spurred a series of initiatives by the United States, ranging from defense to education. Increased emphasis was placed on the Navy's Project Vanguard to launch an American satellite into orbit. There was renewed interest in the preceding Explorer program that launched the first American satellite into orbit on January 31, 1958. In February 1958, Eisenhower authorized formation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, later renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), within the Department of Defense (DoD) to develop emerging technologies for the U.S. military. On July 29, 1958, he signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, the creation of NASA.\n\nLess than a year after the Sputnik launch, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act (NDEA). The act was a four-year program that poured billions of dollars into the U.S. education system. In 1953 the government spent $153 million, and colleges took $10 million of that funding; however, by 1960 the combined funding grew almost six-fold because of the NDEA. After the initial public shock, the Space Race began, leading to the first human launched into space, Project Apollo and the first humans to land on the Moon in 1969.\n\nCampaigning in 1960 on closing the \"missile gap\", Eisenhower's successor John F. Kennedy decided to deploy 1,000 Minuteman missiles. This was many more ICBMs than the Soviets had at the time. Though Kennedy did not favor a massive U.S. manned space program while in the U.S. Senate during Eisenhower's term, public reaction to the Soviet's launching the first human into orbit, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961 led Kennedy to raise the stakes of the Space Race by setting the goal of landing men on the Moon. Kennedy claimed that \"If the Soviets control space they can control the earth, as in past centuries the nation that controlled the seas dominated the continents\". Eisenhower disagreed with Kennedy's goal, referring to it as a \"stunt\". Kennedy had privately acknowledged that the space race was a waste of money, but he knew there were benefits from a frightened electorate. The space race was less about its intrinsic importance and more about prestige and calming the public.\n\nThe Sputnik Crisis sparked the U.S. drive to retake the lead in space exploration from the Soviets, and fueled its drive to land men on the Moon. American officials had a variety of opinions at the time, some registering alarm, others dismissing the satellite. Gerald Ford, a Republican congressman from Michigan, had stated that \"We Middle Westerners are sometimes called isolationists. I don't agree with the label; but there can be no isolationists anywhere when a thermonuclear warhead can flash down from space at hypersonic speed to reach any spot on Earth minutes after its launching\". Former United States Rear Admiral Rawson Bennett, chief of naval operations, stated that Sputnik was a \"hunk of iron almost anybody could launch\".\n\nThe Sputnik Crisis also spurred substantial transformation in the United States' science policy which provided much of the basis for modern academic scientific research. In the mid-1960s NASA went on to provide almost 10 percent of the federal funds for academic research.\n\nFurther expansion was made in the funding and research of space weapons and missile defense in the form of anti-ballistic missile proposals. Education programs were initiated to foster a new generation of engineers and support was dramatically increased for scientific research. Congress increased the National Science Foundation (NSF) appropriation for 1959 to $134 million, almost $100 million higher than the year before. By 1968, the NSF budget stood at nearly $500 million.\n\nAccording to Marie Thorsten, Americans experienced a \"techno-other void\" after the Sputnik crisis and continue to express longing for \"another Sputnik\" to boost education and innovation. During the 1980s, the rise of Japan filled that void temporarily. Following the Sputnik crisis, leaders exploited an \"awe doctrine\" to organize learning \"around a single model of educational national security: with math and science serving for supremacy in science and engineering, foreign languages and cultures for potential espionage, and history and humanities for national self-definition\". American leaders were not able to exploit the image of Japan as effectively, despite its representations of super-smart students and a strong economy.\n\nIn Britain the launch of the first Sputnik provoked surprise, combined with elation at experiencing the dawn of the Space Age. It also aroused feelings of sadness, for it reminded the public of their nation's loss of prestige and power on the world stage. The crisis soon became part of the broader Cold War narrative. Much of the public nervousness that did exist was dispelled when the Soviets launched Laika (one of several space dogs sent into space during the 1950s and 1960s) into space in November 1957 aboard \"Sputnik 2\", which was seen less as a threat and more so as a propaganda maneuver.\n\n\n\n"}

A large number of submarine volcanoes are located near areas of tectonic plate movement, known as mid-ocean ridges. The volcanoes at mid-ocean ridges alone are estimated to account for 75% of the magma output on Earth. Although most submarine volcanoes are located in the depths of seas and oceans, some also exist in shallow water, and these can discharge material into the atmosphere during an eruption. The total number of submarine volcanoes is estimated to be over 1 million, of which some 75,000 rise more than 1 km above the seabed.\n\nHydrothermal vents, sites of abundant biological activity, are commonly found near submarine volcanoes.\n\nThe presence of water can greatly alter the characteristics of a volcanic eruption and the explosions of underwater volcanoes in comparison to those on land.\n\nFor instance, water causes magma to cool and solidify much more quickly than in a terrestrial eruption, often turning it into volcanic glass. The shapes and textures of lava formed by submarine volcanoes are different from lava erupted on land. Upon contact with water, a solid crust forms around the lava. Advancing lava flows into this crust, forming what is known as pillow lava.\n\nBelow ocean depths of about 2200 m, where the pressure exceeds the critical pressure of water (22.06 MPa or about 218 atmospheres for pure water), it can no longer boil; it becomes a supercritical fluid. Without boiling sounds, deep-sea volcanoes can be difficult to detect at great distances using hydrophones.\n\nThe critical temperature and pressure increase in solutions of salts, which are normally present in the seawater. The composition of aqueous solution in the vicinity of hot basalt, and circulating within the conduits of hot rocks, is expected to differ from that of bulk water (i.e., of sea water away from the hot surfaces). One estimation is that the critical point is 407 °C and 29.9 MPa, while the solution composition corresponds to that of approximately 3.2% of NaCl.\n\nScientists still have much to learn about the location and activity of underwater volcanoes. The Kolumbo underwater volcano in the Aegean Sea was discovered in 1650 when it burst from the sea and erupted, killing 70 people on the nearby island of Santorini. More recently, NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration has funded exploration of submarine volcanoes, with the Ring of Fire missions to the Mariana Arc in the Pacific Ocean being particularly noteworthy. Using Remote Operated Vehicles (ROV), scientists studied underwater eruptions, ponds of molten sulfur, black smoker chimneys and even marine life adapted to this deep, hot environment. \n\nResearch from the ROV KAIKO off the coast of Hawaii has suggested that pahoehoe lava flows occur underwater, and the degree of the submarine terrain slope and rate of lava supply determine the shape of the resulting lobes.\n\nMany submarine volcanoes are seamounts, typically extinct volcanoes that rise abruptly from a seafloor of 1,000 - 4,000 meters depth. They are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise to at least 1,000 meters above the seafloor. The peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of meters below the surface, and are therefore considered to be within the deep sea. An estimated 30,000 seamounts occur across the globe, with only a few having been studied. However, some seamounts are also unusual. For example, while the summits of seamounts are normally hundreds of meters below sea level, the Bowie Seamount in Canada's Pacific waters rises from a depth of about 3,000 meters to within 24 meters of the sea surface.\n\nThere are two types of submarine eruptions: One is created by the slow release and bursting of large lava bubbles, and the other one is created by a quick explosion of gas bubbles. Lava can affect marine animals and ecosystems differently than gas can, so it is important to be able to distinguish the two.\n\nScientists have been able to connect sounds to sights in both types of eruptions. In 2009, a video camera and a hydrophone were floating 1,200 meters below sea level in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, watching and listening as the West Mata Volcano erupted in several ways. Putting video and audio together let researchers learn the sounds made by slow lava bursting and the different noises made by hundreds of gas bubbles.\n\n\n"}

Subtitled \"The Scientific Basis for a Rational World\", it is a whirlwind tour and explanation of theories, both physical and metaphysical, regarding ultimate causes. Its title comes from a quotation from Stephen Hawking: \"If we do discover a theory of everything...it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we would truly know the mind of God.\"\n\nIn the preface, Davies explains that he has been interested in ultimate causes since childhood, having annoyed his parents with unending \"why's\" about everything, with each answer demanding another \"why,\" and usually ending with the reply, \"Because God made it that way, and \"that's that!\"\" In the book proper, Davies briefly explores: the nature of reason, belief, and metaphysics; theories of the origin of the universe; the laws of nature; the relationship of mathematics to physics; a few arguments for the existence of God; the possibility that the universe shows evidence of a deity; and his opinion of the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem, that \"the search for a closed logical scheme that provides a complete and self-consistent explanation is doomed to failure.\"\n\nHe concludes with a statement of his belief that, even though we may never attain a theory of everything, \"the existence of mind in some organism on some planet in the universe is surely a fact of fundamental significance. Through conscious beings the universe has generated self-awareness. This can be no trivial detail, no minor byproduct of mindless, purposeless forces. We are truly meant to be here.\"\n\n\n"}

This opposes the view put by Edelman and others that consciousness emerged after the development of cognitive processes such as the ability to create a scene from diverse sensory inputs.\n\nDenton distinguishes between primordial emotions, \"imperious states of arousal and compelling intentions to act\" (p. 7) driven by activation of interoceptors and involving ancient, lower brain regions such as the medulla, midbrain and hypothalamus, and \"classic\" emotions, such as anger, fear and love, driven by distance receptors (vision, hearing, olfaction) and mediated by higher, more recently evolved brain regions.\n"}

Large metropolitan areas typically only do such surveys once every decade, though some cities are conducting panel surveys, which track the same people year after year.\n\nThat data is generally used to estimate transportation planning models, so that transport analysts can make predictions about people who haven't been surveyed. This is important in forecasting traffic, which depends on future changes to road networks, land use patterns, and policies.\n\nSome years ago it was recognized that behavioral research was limited by data, and a special data set was developed to aid research: The Baltimore Disaggregate Data Set which is the result an in depth survey, ca. 1977. Its title indicates today’s emphasis on disaggregated rather than aggregated data. This particular data set is believed lost. A small program to preserve and make available on the web these travel behavior surveys, the Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive, is now under way at the University of Minnesota. There is also the National Personal Transportation Survey (later National Household Travel Survey), conducted every five years or so, but with much less spatial detail.\n\nAnalysis of travel behavior from the home can answer the question: How does the family participate in modern society. Consider two non-observable extremes. At one extreme we have the non-specialized household. It does everything for itself, and no travel is required. Ultimate specialization is the other extreme; travel is required for all things. Observed households are somewhere in between. The “in between” position of households might be thought of as the consequence of two matters.\n\n\nMoore (1964) has observed that increasing specialization in all things is the chief feature of social change. Considering social changes, one might observe that 100 years ago things were less specialized compared to today. So we would expect lots of change in household travel over the time period. Data are not very good, but the travel time aspect of what’s available seems contrary to the expectation, travel hasn’t changed much. For instance, the time spent on the journey to work may have been stable for centuries (the travel budget hypothesis). Here are some travel time comparisons from John Robinson (1986).\n\nMost travel behavior analysis concerns demand issues and do not touch very much on supply issues. Yet when we observe travel from a home, we are certainly observing some sort of market clearing process – demand and supply are matched.\n\nAnalytic work on travel behavior can be dated from Liepmann (1945). Liepmann obtained and analyzed 1930s data on worker travel in England. Many of the insights current today were found by Liepmann: time spent, ride sharing, etc. Most academics date modern work from advances in mode choice analysis made in the 1970s. This created much excitement, and after some years an International Association for Travel Behaviour Research emerged. There are about 150 members of the Association; it holds a conference every three years. The proceedings of those conferences yield a nice record of advances in the field. The proceedings also provide a record of topics of lasting interest and of changing priorities. Mode choice received priority early on, but in the main today’s work is not so much on theory as it is on practice. Hagerstrand (1970) developed a time and space path analysis, often called the time-space prism.\n\nOn November 18–20, 2004, Transportation Research Board (TRB) held its third conference in Chicago, Illinois, with an interest in advancing the understanding of women’s issues in transportation. One of the presented studies, conducted by Nobis et al., revealed that the gender difference in travel patterns is linked to employment status, household structure, child care, and maintenance tasks. They found that travel patterns of men and women are much similar when considering single families; the differences are greater once males and females are compared in multi-person households without children; and are the highest once they live in households with children. Over the past two decades numerous studies have been conducted on travel behavior showing gender as an influential factor in travel decision making.\n\n\n"}
