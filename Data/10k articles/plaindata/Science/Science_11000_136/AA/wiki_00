Initially running east, as Pennyfoot Street, before a right turn sees it head southwards onto Manvers Street, a 4 lane single carriageway which was formerly a B road (B685). The road then crosses the main railway line out of Nottingham to the east over an early 1990s bridge (which again is 4 lane) before meeting Meadow Lane (here unclassified for approximately 100 metres, but further on the A6011) at a triangular roundabout.\n\nAfter leaving the roundabout the road is two-lane dual carriageway with a speed limit for approximately . A further roundabout with Trent Street by a call centre for Virgin Media sees a change to 2 lane single carriageway, as it is for the remainder of its length, retaining the limit. After a further roundabout at Nottingham Racecourse, the limit changes to the national speed limit of until Colwick is reached, when it changes to to pass through a built up stretch.\n\nLeaving Colwick the road becomes the Colwick Loop Road, which bypasses Netherfield, Carlton and Gedling. This section was also built national speed limit, but in May 2007 was reduced to concurrent with the opening of the Gedling bypass, or as it was described in the plans, \"Gedling Integrated Transport Scheme\". The former section of Colwick Loop Road bypassed by the scheme is now mapped as the A6211, but is unsigned at ground level. \n\nRejoining the former route at a signalled T-junction, we enter Burton Joyce. Initially a limit, approaching the village centre the limit is reduced to . Here, a 1930s bypass would previously have bypassed the bulk of the village but now almost bisects it, as development has spread across the road. Bypassing Bulcote, the road is then again as it opens out towards a roundabout junction with the A6097 at Lowdham.\n\nAfter leaving Lowdham the road is again open single carriageway with a limit. Gonalston is bypassed, and then we pass through Thurgarton, up a steep hill before the road becomes again. The road between Thurgarton and Southwell is relatively undulating and bendy.\n\nEntering Southwell from the south-west, passing the leisure centre, we then meet the B6386 at a T-junction where you need to turn off the A612 to stay on the numbered route. After passing the West gate to Southwell Minster, the road turns right at a mini roundabout by the Saracen's Head public house and passes the north side of the Minster. A further sharp bend to the left allows us to pass another racecourse, this time Southwell Racecourse, before exiting Southwell past the former workhouse which is now a museum.\n\nHeading east through Upton, past a property owned by the British Horological Society, we meet the A617 near Averham at a signalled T-junction, signalling the end of the route.\n\nPlans have been drawn up by Nottinghamshire County Council to bypass Southwell. The plans have existed since before 1990. The County Council has acquired a number of parcels of land in the line of the plan. However, considerable opposition is building up to the plan. Southwell residents are arguing that the 'line' of the bypass will become a new edge of town, and allow considerable expansion of the urban edge of the town, into the sensitive southern aspect. This is the view which includes the historic town centre and views of the Southwell Minster.\n\nNew traffic measures are suggested as an alternative to reduce through traffic, such as an HGV ban except for access, and downgrading this inappropriate route from Lowdham to Newark, to B road status. Through traffic should be directed at Lowdham and Newark to the newly dualled A46.\n\n\nThe reopening of the bus plug still causes controversy with many Councillors and locals questioning the validity\n\n\nReports of bus plug controversy:\n"}

{"id": "436251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436251", "title": "Bactrian camel", "text": "Bactrian camel\n\nThe Bactrian camel (\"Camelus bactrianus\") is a large, even-toed ungulate native to the steppes of Central Asia. The Bactrian camel has two humps on its back, in contrast to the single-humped dromedary camel. Its population of two million exists mainly in the domesticated form. Their name comes from the ancient historical region of Bactria.\n\nThe domesticated Bactrian camel has served as a pack animal in inner Asia since ancient times. With its tolerance for cold, drought, and high altitudes, it enabled the travel of caravans on the Silk Road. A small number of feral Bactrian camels still roam the Mangystau Province of southwest Kazakhstan and the Nubra Valley in India. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is the only truly wild (as opposed to feral) species of camel in the world.\n\nThe Bactrian camel shares the genus \"Camelus\" with the dromedary (\"C. dromedarius\") and the wild Bactrian camel (\"C. ferus\"). The Bactrian camel belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle was the first to describe the species of \"Camelus\": in his 4th century BC \"History of Animals\" he identified the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel. The Bactrian camel was given its current binomial name \"Camelus bactrianus\" by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication \"Systema Naturae\".\n\nIn 2007, Peng Cui (of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and colleagues carried out a phylogenetic study of the evolutionary relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae: Camelini — consisting of the three \"Camelus\" species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a subspecies of the Bactrian camel) — and Lamini — consisting of the alpaca (\"Vicugna pacos\"), the guanaco (\"Lama guanicoe\"), the llama (\"L. glama\") and the vicuña (\"V. vicugna\"). The study revealed that the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), notably earlier than what had been previously estimated from North American fossils. Speciation began first in Lamini as the alpaca came into existence 10 million years ago (late Pleistocene). Nearly two million years later, the Bactrian camel and the dromedary emerged as two independent species.\n\nThe Bactrian camel and the dromedary often interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Where the ranges of the two species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Iran and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease as a result of extensive crossbreeding between them. The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the Bactrian camel and the dromedary should be merged into a single species with two varieties. However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene revealed that the species display 10.3% divergence in their sequences.\n\nThe wild Bactrian camel (\"Camelus ferus\") was first described by Nikolay Przhevalsky in the late 19th century and has now been established as a distinct species from the Bactrian camel (\"Camelus bactrianus)\".\nZoological opinion nowadays tends to favour the idea that \"C. bactrianus\" and \"C. dromedarius\" are descendants of two different subspecies of \"C. ferus\" (Peters and von den Driesch 1997: 652) and there is no evidence to suggest that the original range of \"C. ferus\" included those parts of Central Asia and Iran where some of the earliest Bactrian remains have been found. In particular, a population of wild Bactrian camel has been discovered to live within a part of the Gashun Gobi region of the Gobi Desert. This population is distinct from domesticated herds both in genetic makeup and in behavior.\n\nAs many as three regions in the genetic makeup are distinctly different from Bactrian camels, with up to a 3% difference in the base genetic code. However, with so few wild camels, what the natural genetic diversity within a population would have been is not clear.\n\nAnother difference is the ability of these wild camels to drink saltwater slush, although whether the camel can extract useful water from it is not yet certain. Domesticated camels are unable to drink such salty water.\n\nThe Bactrian camel is the largest mammal in its native range and is the largest living camel. Shoulder height is from , head-and-body length is , and the tail length is . At the top of the humps, the average height is . Body mass can range from , with males often being much larger and heavier than females. Its long, wooly coat varies in colour from dark brown to sandy beige. A mane and beard of long hair occurs on the neck and throat, with hairs measuring up to long. The shaggy winter coat is shed extremely rapidly, with huge sections peeling off at once, appearing as if sloppily shorn. The two humps on the back are composed of fat (not water as is sometimes thought). The face is typical of a camelid, being long and somewhat triangular, with a split upper lip. The long eyelashes, along with the sealable nostrils, help to keep out dust in the frequent sandstorms which occur in their natural range. The two broad toes on each foot have undivided soles and are able to spread widely as an adaptation to walking on sand. The feet are very tough, as befits an animal of extreme environments.\n\nThese camels are migratory, and their habitat ranges from rocky mountain massifs to flat arid desert, stony plains, and sand dunes. Conditions are extremely harsh – vegetation is sparse, water sources are limited and temperatures are extreme, ranging from as low as −40 °C in winter to 40 °C in summer. The camels’ distribution is linked to the availability of water, with large groups congregating near rivers after rain or at the foot of the mountains, where water can be obtained from springs in the summer months, and in the form of snow during the winter.\n\nBactrian camels are exceptionally adept at withstanding wide variations in temperature, ranging from freezing cold to blistering heat. They have a remarkable ability to go without water for months at a time, but when water is available they may drink up to 57 liters at once. When well fed, the humps are plump and erect, but as resources decline, the humps shrink and lean to the side. When moving faster than a walking speed, they pace, by stepping forwards with both legs on the same side (as opposed to trotting, using alternate diagonals as done by most other quadrupeds). Speeds of up to have been recorded, but they rarely move this fast. Bactrian camels are also said to be good swimmers. The sense of sight is well developed and the sense of smell is extremely good. The lifespan of Bactrian camels is estimated at up to 50 years, often 20 to 40 in captivity.\n\nBactrian camels are diurnal, sleeping in the open at night and foraging for food during the day. They are primarily herbivorous. With tough mouths that can withstand sharp objects such as thorns, they are able to eat plants that are dry, prickly, salty or bitter, and can ingest virtually any kind of vegetation. When other nutrient sources are not available, these camels may feed on carcasses, gnawing on bones, skin, or various different kinds of flesh. In more extreme conditions, they may eat any material they find, which has included rope, sandals, and even tents. Their ability to feed on a wide range of foods allows them to live in areas with sparse vegetation. The first time food is swallowed, it is not fully chewed. The partly masticated food (called cud) goes into the stomach and later is brought back up for further chewing.\n\nBactrian camels belong to a fairly small group of animals that regularly eat snow to provide their water needs. Any animals living above the snowline are obliged to do this, as snow and ice are the only forms of water during winter, and by doing so, their range is greatly enlarged. The latent heat of snow and ice is enormous compared with the heat capacity of water, demanding a large sacrifice in heat energy and forcing animals to eat only small amounts at a time.\n\nBactrian camels are induced ovulators — they ovulate after insemination (insertion of semen into the vagina); the seminal plasma, not the spermatozoa, induces ovulation. Ovulation occurs in 87% of females after insemination: 66% ovulate within 36 h and the rest by 48 h (the same as natural mating). The least amount of semen required to elicit ovulation is about 1.0 ml.\n\nMales during mating time are often quite violent and may bite, spit, or attempt to sit on other male camels. The age of sexual maturity varies, but is usually reached at 3 to 5 years. Gestation lasts around 13 months. One or occasionally two calves are produced, and the female can give birth to a new calf every other year. Young Bactrian camels are precocial, being able to stand and run shortly after birth, and are fairly large at an average birth weight of . They are nursed for about 1.5 years. The young calf stays with its mother for three to five years, until it reaches sexual maturity, and often serves to help raise subsequent generations for those years. Wild camels sometimes breed with domesticated or feral camels.\n\nThe Bactrian camel is thought to have been domesticated (independent of the dromedary) sometime before 2500 BC in Northeast Afghanistan or southwestern Turkestan. The dromedary camel is believed to have been domesticated between 4000 BC and 2000 BC in Arabia. As pack animals, these ungulates are virtually unsurpassed, able to carry at a rate of 47 km (30 miles) per day, or 4 km/h (2 mph) over a period of four days. Furthermore, Bactrian camels are frequently ridden, especially in desertified areas. In ancient Sindh, for example, Bactrian camels of two humps were initially used by the rich for riding. The camel was later brought to other areas such as Balochistan and Iran for the same purpose.\n\nBactrian camels have been the focus of artwork throughout history. For example, western foreigners from the Tarim Basin and elsewhere were depicted in of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907).\n\nBactrian camels were imported to the US several times in the mid- to late 1800s, both by the US military and by merchants and miners, looking for pack animals sturdier and hardier than horses and mules. Although the camels met these needs, the United States Camel Corps was never considered much of a success. Having brought two shipments of fewer than 100 camels to the US, plans were made to import another 1,000, but the US Civil War interrupted this. Most surviving camels of these endeavors, both military and private, were merely turned loose to survive in the wild. As a result, small feral herds of Bactrian camels existed during the late 19th century in the southwest deserts of the United States.\n\n\n\n"}

Disillusioned by the lack of progress in safeguarding the environment in the United States, particularly after a wilderness inventory by the United States Forest Service known as RARE II (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation), he was a co-founder of the environmental organization known as Earth First! (EF) in the 1980s. EF originally mixed innovative publicity, such as rolling a plastic \"crack\" down Glen Canyon Dam, with far-reaching wilderness proposals that went far beyond what the mainstream environmental groups were willing to advocate, and with conservation biology research from a biocentric perspective. Later however, after about 1987, EF became primarily associated with non-violent direct action activities.\n\nForeman took his inspiration for Earth First! from Edward Abbey's book \"The Monkey Wrench Gang\" which is a fictional account of a gang of four individuals who take on a pointless yet deeply symbolic effort to destroy and thus halt the machines of human expansion and putative \"progress\" in the American Southwest.\n\nIn 1989 Foreman was implicated in the FBI conspiracy known as THERMCON wherein four activists in Prescott, Arizona, who were only peripherally connected with EF, were enticed by undercover FBI agent Michael Fain (alias Mike Tait) who talked them into the destruction of a power line in the State of Arizona. Foreman himself wasn't involved. However he was arrested and indicted along with the four.\n\nHis book \"Confessions of an Eco-Warrior\" is partly an autobiographical account of RARE II and his disillusionment with the mainstream environmental movement, the early years of Earth First!, the FBI entrapment, and his ultimate disillusionment with what Earth First! became. It is also partly a statement of his views on wilderness and the state of the environmental movement.\n\nIn the book he expressed his view that Earth First!, by 1990, had largely run its course, and was starting to attract new members who took the group in a more countercultural and left-wing direction than he was comfortable associating with. The defining moments for Foreman, according to the book, were when some activists under the Earth First! banner held a \"puke-in\" at a shopping mall, when Edward Abbey was subjected to harsh criticism and heckling by some younger newcomers to EF when he attended the 1987 EF rendezvous (Foreman and the other old guard of EF, who revered Abbey, were horrified that he would receive that sort of treatment at an EF gathering), and when some Earth First! funds were diverted to launch a punk-style zine called \"Live Wild or Die\", which among other things espoused anarchism and attacked Foreman's and Abbey's views on some controversial issues then being debated within EF.\n\nWhile Foreman and most of the rest of the old guard of EF severed their ties to the group in 1990, he remains an environmental activist. At the time \"Confessions\" was published, he had just launched a new magazine, \"Wild Earth\" (intended as a replacement for the 1980s-era \"Earth First! Journal\"), and was soon to launch a new environmental group, The Wildlands Project.\n\n"}

In physics and chemistry, this constant represents the magnitude of electric charge per mole of electrons. It has the currently accepted value \n\nThis constant has a simple relation to two other physical constants:\nwhere\n\"N\" is the Avogadro constant (the ratio of the number of particles, \"N\", which is unitless, to the amount of substance, \"n\", in units of moles), and \"e\" is the elementary charge or the magnitude of the charge of an electron. This relation holds because the amount of charge of a mole of electrons is equal to the amount of charge in \"one\" electron multiplied by the number of electrons in a mole.\n\nOne common use of the Faraday constant is electrolysis. One can divide the amount of charge in coulombs by the Faraday constant in order to find the amount (in moles) of the element that has been oxidized.\n\nThe value of \"F\" was first determined by weighing the amount of silver deposited in an electrochemical reaction in which a measured current was passed for a measured time, and using Faraday's law of electrolysis. Research is continuing into more accurate ways of determining the interrelated constants \"F\", \"N\", and \"e\".\n\n\nRelated to Faraday's constant is the \"faraday\", a unit of electrical charge. It is much less common than the coulomb, but sometimes used in electrochemistry. One faraday of charge is the magnitude of the charge of one mole of electrons, i.e. \n\nExpressed in faradays, the Faraday constant \"F\" equals \"1 faraday of charge per mole\".\n\nThis faraday unit is not to be confused with the farad, an unrelated unit of capacitance ().\n\n\"The Simpsons\" episode \"Dark Knight Court\" (RABF10) has Mr. Burns asking Comic Book Guy how much he wants for his entire comic book inventory.

Half of the Lunar Crater is on top of the large walled plain Fabry. This is on the north-northeast side of Fabry. On the other half, the northwest half, Vashakidze, a smaller crater than Fabry, lies. And on the Southwest is Vestine, and Richardson on the south.\n\nHarkhebi predicted the weather patterns of the heliacal risings of the fixed stars. He refers the winds and the omens' to is prediction of meteorology. While Harkhebi was observing the north and south motions of the sun and Venus, he concluded that the Babylonians has some affiliation with the weather phenomena in \"Enuma Anu Enil.\" \n\n"}

The Ritchey-Chrétien reflecting telescope is notable for the design of telescope mount. Instead of the typical mounting where the telescope moves on two rotating axes, the mirror end of the telescope is supported by six extensible struts, an arrangement known as a Stewart platform. This configuration allows the telescope to move in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides strong structural integrity. As a result, the ratio of bearing pressure and its own weight is very high. Furthermore, the six-leg structure allows for a very precise positioning and repeatability. The disadvantage of the system is that controlling and aiming a hexapod-mounted telescope is much more complex than with conventional telescope mounts.\n\nThe mounting was designed by engineers of the company Vertex, in collaboration with astronomers of the Astronomy Institute of the Ruhr University Bochum (AIRUB) in Germany. Led by Prof. Rolf Chini, the HPT was thoroughly tested at AIRUB. In 2006, it was moved to its new location on Cerro Armazones Observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile. AIRUB, in collaboration with the Astronomy Department of the Catholic University of the North (UCN), is developing an observatory there. A new control building was built next to the HPT on the summit of Cerro Murphy, a subsidiary peak of Cerro Armazones.\n\nTogether with the Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl, AIRUB developed the Bochum Echelle Spectrograph for the Optical (BESO) for the HPT.

Its mission is to improve health outcomes by facilitating the unification of data on human genetic variation and its impact on human health.\n\nThe HVP concept was conceived by Richard Cotton, a leader in the field of human genetic variation. His group, the Genomic Disorders Research Centre, based at the University of Melbourne and St. Vincent's Hospital, has established a consortium that covers genomic variation and its health implications in a comprehensive form. This consortium has encouraged the creation and supported many of the 571 gene specific variation databases currently available on the internet. However, these databases are of varying completeness and individualistic, so the Human Variome Project was born to establish a central project to encourage the collection and sourcing of this data, verifying it and ultimately using it for improved health outcomes.\n\nGeneticists, Diagnosticians, Researchers and Bio-informatics scientists came together in June 2006 at the Human Variome Project Meeting, organized by Professor Cotton’s team, and agreed take on the task of organising data collection and unifying the systems of data access and storage. This initiative builds on substantial pilot work and achievements of the Human Genome Variation Society. The authority of those initiating this project is evidenced by the fact that major international bodies were present. These included WHO, OECD, European Commission, UNESCO, March of Dimes (US), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US), Google, representatives of two dozen international genetics bodies, numerous genetics journals, 20 countries and Australian State and Federal Governments.\n\nThis major international project, a natural partner to the Human Genome Project, will require substantial funding to get it to a sustainable position. A five-year secure budget period of approximately US$12m per year has been proposed to initiate the project. This will enable the project to be organized and find operational funds for the tasks of system development, informatics, database curation and clinical access as well as collection systems that are open and accessible to all.\n\nThe Human Variome Project seeks to provide open access to the full realm of genetic variation for the benefit of everyone.\n\nThe Centre for Arab Genomic Studies (CAGS) has initiated efforts to proceed with the Arab Human Variome Project under the Human Variome Project. CAGS was one of the participants of the HVP meeting in Melbourne. Since then, several meetings have been held between officials of HVP and CAGS members to discuss the nature of work involved.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17272221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17272221", "title": "Laboratory quality control", "text": "Laboratory quality control\n\nLaboratory quality control is designed to detect, reduce, and correct deficiencies in a laboratory's internal analytical process prior to the release of patient results, in order to improve the quality of the results reported by the laboratory. Quality control is a measure of precision, or how well the measurement system reproduces the same result over time and under varying operating conditions. Laboratory quality control material is usually run at the beginning of each shift, after an instrument is serviced, when reagent lots are changed, after calibration, and whenever patient results seem inappropriate. Quality control material should approximate the same matrix as patient specimens, taking into account properties such as viscosity, turbidity, composition, and color. It should be simple to use, with minimal vial to vial variability, because variability could be misinterpreted as systematic error in the method or instrument. It should be stable for long periods of time, and available in large enough quantities for a single batch to last at least one year. Liquid controls are more convenient than lyophilized controls because they do not have to be reconstituted minimizing pipetting error.\n\nInterpretation of quality control data involves both graphical and statistical methods. Quality control data is most easily visualized using a Levey-Jennings chart. The dates of analyses are plotted along the X-axis and control values are plotted on the Y-axis. The mean and one, two, and three standard deviation limits are also marked on the Y-axis. Inspecting the pattern of plotted points provides a simple way to detect increased random error and shifts or trends in calibration.\n\nThe control charts: a statistical approach to the study of manufacturing process variation for the purpose of improving the economic effectiveness of the process. These methods are based on continuous monitoring of process variation. The control chart, also known as the 'Shewhart chart' or 'process-behavior chart' is a statistical tool intended to assess the nature of variation in a process and to facilitate forecasting and management. A control chart is a more specific kind of a run chart. The control chart is one of the seven basic tools of quality control which include the histogram, pareto chart, check sheet, control chart, cause and effect diagram, flowchart and scatter diagram. Control charts prevents unnecessary process adjustments; provides information about process capability; provides diagnostic information and it is a proven technique for improving productivity.\n\nLevey-Jennings chart is a graph that quality control data is plotted on to give a visual indication whether a laboratory test is working well.The distance from the mean is measured in standard deviations (SD). It is named after S. Levey and E. R. Jennings who in 1950 suggested the use of Shewhart's individuals control chart in the clinical laboratory. On the x-axis the date and time, or more usually the number of the control run, are plotted. A mark is made indicating how far away the actual result was from the mean (which is the expected value for the control). Lines run across the graph at the mean, as well as one, two and three standard deviations to either side of the mean. This makes it easy to see how far off the result was.\n\nRules, such as the Westgard rules can be applied to see whether the results from the samples when the control was done can be released, or if they need to be rerun. The formulation of Westgard rules were based on statistical methods. Westgard rules are commonly used to analyse data in Shewhart control charts. Westgard rules are used to define specific performance limits for a particular assay and can be used to detect both random and systematic errors. Westgard rules are programmed in to automated analyzers to determine when an analytical run should be rejected. These rules need to be applied carefully so that true errors are detected while false rejections are minimized. The rules applied to high volume chemistry and hematology instruments should produce low false rejection rates.\nThe Levey-Jennings chart differs from the Shewhart individuals control chart in the way that sigma, the standard deviation, is estimated. The Levey-Jennings chart uses the long-term (i.e., population) estimate of sigma whereas the Shewhart chart uses the short-term (i.e., within the rational subgroup) estimate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1045127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1045127", "title": "Landrace", "text": "Landrace\n\nA landrace is a domesticated, locally adapted, traditional variety of a species of animal or plant that has developed over time, through adaptation to its natural and cultural environment of agriculture and pastoralism, and due to isolation from other populations of the species. Landraces are generally distinguished from cultivars, and from breeds in the standardized sense, although the term landrace breed is sometimes used as distinguished from the term \"standardized breed\" when referring to cattle.\n\nSpecimens of a landrace tend to be relatively genetically uniform, but are more diverse than members of a standardized or formal breed. Some standardized animal breeds originate from attempts to make landraces more consistent through selective breeding and a landrace may become a more formal breed with the creation of a breed registry and/or publication of a breed standard. In such a case, the landrace may be thought of as a \"stage\" in breed development. However, in other cases, formalizing a landrace may result in the genetic resource of a landrace being lost through crossbreeding. Landraces are distinct from ancestral wild species of modern stock, and from separate species or subspecies derived from the same ancestor as modern domestic stock. Landraces are not all derived from ancient stock largely unmodified by human breeding interests. In a number of cases, most commonly dogs and horses, domestic animals have escaped in sufficient numbers in an area to breed feral populations that, through evolutionary pressure, can form new landraces in only a few centuries. In other cases, simple failure to maintain breeding regimens can do the same. For example, selectively bred cultivars can become new landraces when loosely selective reproduction is applied.\n\nIncreasing adoption of and reliance upon modern, purposefully selected plant strains, considered \"improved\" – \"scientifically bred to be uniform and stable\" – has led to a reduction in biodiversity. The majority of the genetic diversity of domesticated species lies in landraces and other traditionally used varieties, a \"reservoir of genetic resources\".\n\nGeneral features that characterize a landrace may include:\n\n\nNot every source on the topic enumerates each of these criteria, and they may be weighted differently depending on a given source's focus (e.g., governmental regulation, biological sciences, agribusiness, anthropology and culture, environmental conservation, pet keeping and breeding, etc.). Additionally, not all cultivars agreed to be landraces exhibit all possible landrace characteristics. Plant landraces have been the subject of more intensive study, and the majority of the academic literature about landraces is focused on agricultural botany, not animal husbandry. Most plant landraces are associated with traditional agricultural systems.\n\nWhile many landrace animals are associated with farming, other domestic animals have been put to use as modes of transportation, as companion animals, for sporting purposes, and for other non-farming uses, so their geographic distribution may differ. For example, horse landraces are less common because human use of them for transport has meant that they have moved with people more commonly and constantly than most other domestic animals, reducing the incidence of populations locally genetically isolated for extensive periods of time.\n\nThe word \"landrace\" literally means 'country-breed' (German: \"Landrasse\") and close cognates of it are found in various Germanic languages. The term was first defined (in German) by Kurt von Rümker in 1908, and more clearly described (in Dutch) in 1909 by U. J. Mansholt, who wrote that landraces have better \"stability of their characteristics\" and \"resistance capacity to tolerate adverse influences\" but lower production capacity than cultivars, and are apt to change genetically when moved to another environment. H. Kiessling added in 1912 that a landrace is a mixture of phenotypic forms despite relative outward uniformity, and a great adaptability to its natural and human environment. The word entered non-academic English in the early 1930s, by way of the Danish Landrace pig, a particular breed of lop-eared swine.\n\nAside from some standardized breeds having \"Landrace\" in their names, actual landraces and standardized breeds are sometimes further confused when the word \"breed\" is used very broadly. As one example, a glossary in a Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) guideline defines \"landrace\" or \"landrace breed\" (treated synonymously) as \"a breed that has largely developed through adaptation to the natural environment and traditional production system in which it has been raised\". It also defines \"breed\" expansively and in multiple ways, with a focus on treating differing senses, landrace breed and standardized breed, as equivalent for \"genetic management\" purposes, the focus of the FAO guideline. It does clearly distinguish between the two concepts, however, both with a distinct definition of \"standardized breed\" and in the main body of the guideline, referring to the \"interaction between landraces and standardized breeds\"), and that FAO document uses \"breed\" to mean \"the unit of conservation, i.e. the specific population of animals that is to be conserved\". Similarly, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines \"landrace\" as a \"local cultivar or animal breed that has been improved by traditional agricultural methods\", without specifying which definition of \"breed\" is cross-referenced. (The definition is also at odds with some peer-reviewed material, in which lack of formal, scientific breeding for genetic improvement (e.g. uniformity and stability) is characteristic of landraces; such sources clearly distinguish landraces from cultivars.)\n\nA landrace native to, or produced for a long time (e.g. 100 years or longer) within the agricultural system in which it is found is referred to as an \"autochthonous landrace\", while an introduced one is termed an allochthonous landrace. \"Within academic agronomy, the term \"autochthonous landrace\" is sometimes used with a more specific, productivity-related definition, synthesized by A. C. Zeven from previous definitions beginning with Mansholt's; it is not often encountered outside that field. These terms are most often applied to plants, with animals more often being referred to as indigenous or native.\n\nMany languages do not use separate terms, like \"landrace\" and \"breed\" in English, but instead rely on extended description to convey such distinctions. The FAO notes: \"The distinction between breeds and ecotypes within breeds is not very objective, and generally involves cultural rather than genetic factors.\"\n\nThe term landrace breed is sometimes encountered. In various domestic species (including pigs, goats, sheep and geese) some standardized breeds include \"Landrace\" in their names, and \"Landrace breeds\" (with capital \"L\") is sometimes used to refer to them collectively. but may be used more ambiguously to include actual landraces.\n\nSimilar ambiguity may be encountered in the use of terms such as ancient breed, native breed (not to be confused with native species), old breed, and indigenous breed. Farmers' variety, usually applied to local cultivars, or seen as intermediate between a landrace and a cultivar, may also include landraces when referring to plant varieties not subjected to formal breeding programs.\n\nThe term \"breed\" itself has multiple definitions and uses, some of which may encompass the concept of landraces. For example, the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) guideline provides a definition of \"breed\", for \"genetic management\" purposes, that overlaps with many definitions of \"landrace\", and defines \"landrace (or landrace breed)\" as a type of \"breed\".\n\nDue to their adaptation to the local environment, some farmers using scientifically \"improved\" domesticates also continue to raise landraces, because the latter often exhibit benefits, ranging from lower cost, and cultural (e.g. culinary) preference, to superior hardiness in a less-than-ideal climate, and better disease resistance. There may be more variety-specific pluses; a plant landrace may have, e.g., lower fertilizer requirements, or something about a plant or animal product's texture, color or ease of use might be a major factor.\n\nLandraces are often free from many intellectual property and other regulatory encumbrances. However, in some jurisdictions, a focus on their production may result in missing out on some benefits afforded to producers of genetically selected and homogenous organisms, including breeders' rights legislation, easier availability of loans and other business services, even the right to share seed or stock with others, depending on how favorable the laws in the area are to high-yield agribusiness interests. As Regine Andersen of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute (Norway) and the Farmers' Rights Project puts it, \"Agricultural biodiversity is being eroded. This trend is putting at risk the ability of future generations to feed themselves. In order to reverse the trend, new policies must be implemented worldwide. The irony of the matter is that the poorest farmers are the stewards of genetic diversity.\" Protecting farmer interests and protecting biodiversity is at the heart of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (the \"Plant Treaty\" for short), under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), though its concerns are not exclusively limited to landraces.\n\nIn 2005, a \"working definition\" of plant landraces was proposed: \"a dynamic population(s) of a cultivated plant that has historical origin, distinct identity and lacks formal crop improvement, as well as often being genetically diverse, locally adapted and associated with traditional farming systems\". Another definition, dating to 1975, of the term \"landrace\" as used in botany (and by extension in agriculture, horticulture, anthropology, etc.) was provided by J. R. Harlan: \n\nLandrace plants are grown from seeds which have not been systematically selected and marketed by seed companies, nor developed by plant breeders. The label \"landraces\" includes all those regional cultigens that are highly heterogeneous, but with enough characteristics in common to permit their recognition as a group.\n\nThis includes all cultigens cultivated without any specific nomenclature and value. A landrace identified with a unique feature, and selected for uniformity over a period of time for maintenance of the characteristic features of the population, can evolve into a \"farmers' variety\", or even a modern cultivar as in many crops (for example, \"Cajanus cajan\" 'Maruti' in the case of pigeon peas).\n\nConversely, a modern cultivar grown over time can \"evolve\" into a landrace, especially when self-seeded and some human selection is applied.\n\nA \"significant proportion\" of farmers around the world continue to grow landrace crops. However, as industrialized agriculture spreads, cultivars, which are selectively bred for high yield, rapid growth, disease and drought resistance, and other commercial production values, are supplanting many landraces, putting more and more of them at risk of extinction.\n\nUsing Europe as an example, data collected for an agricultural study published in 2008, showed that landrace cereal crops began to decline in Europe in the 19th century with selective seed improvements, and continued with varietal improvement in the 20th century, such that cereal landraces \"have largely fallen out of use\" in Europe. Landrace cultivation in central and northwest Europe was almost eradicated by the early 20th century, due to economic pressure to grow improved, modern cultivars. While many in the region are already extinct, some have survived in commercial European farming by being passed from generation to generation of farmers, and have also been revived by enthusiasts outside Europe to preserve European \"agricultural and food heritage\" elsewhere. These survivals are usually for specific uses, such as thatch, and traditional European cuisine and craft beer brewing. Systematic preservation efforts for these cereal strains are ongoing, \"in situ\" and in online-searchable germplasm collections (seed banks), coordinated by Biodiversity International and the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (UK). However, more may need to be done, because plant genetic variety, the source of crop health and seed quality, depends on a diversity of landraces and other traditionally used varieties. Efforts () were mostly focused on Iberia, the Balkans, and European Russia, and dominated by species from mountainous areas. Despite their incompleteness, these efforts have been described as \"crucial in preventing the extinction of many of these local ecotypes\".\n\nOne definition of a landrace applied to both plants and animals is \"which has developed over a long period of time and as a result has adapted to the local natural environment in which it lives.\" Geneticist D. Phillip Sponenberg described animal breeds as \"consistent and predictable genetic entities\" falling into several \"classes\": the landrace, the standardized breed, modern \"type\" breeds, industrial strains and feral populations. He describes landraces as an early stage of breed development, created by a combination of founder effect, isolation and environmental pressures. Isolation prevents the further introduction of genetic material. Human selection for production goals is typical of most landraces.\n\nOne definition of a \"landrace\", as applied to animals, is a biological race of [domestic] animal adapted to thrive in a specific land or locality. Another, applied to both plants and animals, is a variety \"which has developed over a long period of time and as a result has adapted to the local natural environment in which it lives.\"\n\nThere are various distinctive landraces of domestic cat around the world, including the Aegean, Cyprus, domestic long-haired, domestic short-haired, Kellas and Sokoke, among others. The Van cat of modern-day Turkey is a landrace of symbolic and (disputed) cultural value to Turks, Armenians and Kurds.\n\nMany standardized breeds have rather recently (within a century or less) been derived from landraces. Examples, often called \"natural breeds\", include Arabian Mau, Egyptian Mau, Korat, Kurilian Bobtail, Maine Coon, Manx, Norwegian Forest Cat, Siberian, and Thai (which is the landrace ancestor of modern Siamese cats), among many others.\n\nIn some cases, such as the Turkish Angora and Turkish Van breeds and their possible derivation from the Van cat landrace, the relationships are not entirely clear.\n\nOther examples of landrace bovines include Pineywoods, Florida Cracker, Ankole-Watusi and Randall cattle.\n\nDog landraces and the selectively bred dog breeds that follow breed standards vary widely depending on their origins and purpose. Landraces in dogs are defined as \"dog or any livestock animal has been bred without a formal registry, although their breeders may have kept written or informal pedigrees of their animals.\" These are distinguished from dog breeds which have breed standards, breed clubs and registries.\n\nLandrace dogs have more variety in their appearance than do standardized dog breeds. An example of a dog landrace with a related standardized breed with a similar name is the collie. The Scotch Collie is a landrace, while the Rough Collie and the Border Collie are standardized breeds. They can be very different in appearance, though the Rough Collie in particular was developed from the Scotch Collie by inbreeding to fix certain highly desired traits. In contrast to the landrace, in the various standardized Collie breeds, purebred individuals closely match a breed-standard appearance but might have lost other useful characteristics and have developed undesirable traits linked to inbreeding. Similarly, the ancient landrace dogs of the Fertile Crescent that led to the Saluki breed excels in running down game across open tracts of hot desert, but conformation-bred individuals of the breed might not be able to chase and catch desert hares.\n\nThe now extinct St. John's water dog, a landrace native to the island of Newfoundland, Canada, was the foundational stock for a number of purpose-bred dogs, such as the Labrador Retriever, Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Cape Shore Water Dog, and Newfoundland. Another example of a North American landrace, the Carolina Dog or yellow dog, was developed from dogs originally from Asia; it has also been established now as a standardized breed.\n\nThe mountain dog is a group of breeds and landraces, and is the common working dog \"type\" of mountain environs of central Eurasia. One of these is the Armenian Gampr dog.\n\n\nSome standardized, selective breeds that are derived from landraces include the Dutch Landrace, Swedish Landrace and Finnish Landrace goats. The confusingly named Danish Landrace is a modern mix of three different breeds, one of which was a \"Landrace\"-named breed.\n\n\nIt is rare for landraces among domestic horses to remain isolated, due to human use of horses for transportation, thus causing horses to move from one local population to another. Examples of horse landraces include isolated island populations such as the Shetland pony and Icelandic horse, insular landraces in Greece and Indonesia, and, on a broader scale, New World populations derived from the founder stock of Colonial Spanish horse. The Yakutian and Mongolian Horses of Asia have \"unimproved\" characteristics. The heavy 'draft' type of domestic horse, developed in Europe, has itself differentiated into many separate landraces or breeds.\n\nThe wild progenitor of the domestic horse is now extinct. The Przewalski's horse, \"Equus ferus przewalskii\", is a wholly separate subspecies with a different number of chromosomes than domesticated horses (\"E. f. caballus\"), and has never been successfully domesticated.\n\nThe Mulefoot pig breed originated as a landrace, but has been a standardized breed since the early 1900s. The standardized swine breeds named \"Landrace\" are not actually landraces, and often not even derived from one, but from other breeds with \"Landrace\" in their names. The Danish Landrace pig breed, pedigreed in 1896 from the actual local landrace, is the principal ancestor of the American Landrace (1930s). The Swedish Landrace is derived from the Danish and from other Scandinavian breeds, as was the British Landrace breed, which was established as late as 1950. The Baudin pig was once a feral landrace on Kangaroo Island, South Australia.\n\nLandrace chicken varieties include:\n\n\nLandrace duck varieties include:\n\n\nLandrace goose varieties include:\n\n\nNote: Many standardized breeds named \"Landrace\", e.g. the Twente Landrace goose, are not actually true landrace breeds, but may be derived from them.\n\n\n"}

By contrast, the constitutive theory defines a state as a person of international law only if it is recognised as such by other states that are already a member of the international community.\n\nProto-states often reference either or both doctrines in order to legitimise their claims to statehood. There are, for example, entities which meet the declarative criteria (with \"de facto\" partial or complete control over their claimed territory, a government and a permanent population), but whose statehood is not recognised by any other states. Non-recognition is often a result of conflicts with other countries that claim those entities as integral parts of their territory. In other cases, two or more partially recognised states may claim the same territorial area, with each of them \"de facto\" in control of a portion of it (as have been the cases of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC), and North and South Korea). Entities that are recognised by only a minority of the world's states usually reference the declarative doctrine to legitimise their claims.\n\nIn many situations, international non-recognition is influenced by the presence of a foreign military force in the territory of the contested entity, making the description of the country's \"de facto\" status problematic. The international community can judge this military presence too intrusive, reducing the entity to a puppet state where effective sovereignty is retained by the foreign power. Historical cases in this sense can be seen in Japanese-led Manchukuo or the German-created Slovak Republic and Independent State of Croatia before and during World War II. In the 1996 case \"Loizidou v. Turkey\", the European Court of Human Rights judged Turkey for having exercised authority in the territory of Northern Cyprus.\n\nThere are also entities which do not have control over any territory or do not unequivocally meet the declarative criteria for statehood but have been recognised to exist \"de jure\" as sovereign entities by at least one other state. Historically this has happened in the case of the Holy See (1870–1929), Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (during Soviet annexation), and more recently the State of Palestine at the time of its declaration of independence in 1988. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta is currently in this position. See list of governments in exile for unrecognised governments without control over the territory claimed.\n\nThe criteria for inclusion means a polity must claim sovereignty, lack recognition from at least one UN member state, and either:\n\n\nThere are United Nations (UN) member states, while both the Holy See and the State of Palestine have observer state status in the United Nations. However, some countries fulfill the declarative criteria, are recognised by the large majority of other states and are members of the United Nations, but are still included in the list here because one or more other states do not recognise their statehood, due to territorial claims or other conflicts.\n\nSome states maintain informal (officially non-diplomatic) relations with states that do not officially recognise them. The Republic of China (Taiwan) is one such state, as it maintains unofficial relations with many other states through its Economic and Cultural Offices, which allow regular consular services. This allows the ROC to have economic relations even with states that do not formally recognise it. A total of 56 states, including Germany, Italy, the United States, and the United Kingdom, maintain some form of unofficial mission in the ROC. Kosovo, the Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Abkhazia, Transnistria, the Sahrawi Republic, Somaliland, and Palestine also host informal diplomatic missions, and/or maintain special delegations or other informal missions abroad.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "283810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=283810", "title": "Mass spectrometry", "text": "Mass spectrometry\n\nMass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. In simpler terms, a mass spectrum measures the masses within a sample. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.\n\nA mass spectrum is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical structures of molecules and other chemical compounds.\n\nIn a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gas, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break into charged fragments. These ions are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, typically by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses (e.g. an entire molecule) to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern.\n\nIn 1886, Eugen Goldstein observed rays in gas discharges under low pressure that traveled away from the anode and through channels in a perforated cathode, opposite to the direction of negatively charged cathode rays (which travel from cathode to anode). Goldstein called these positively charged anode rays \"Kanalstrahlen\"; the standard translation of this term into English is \"canal rays\". Wilhelm Wien found that strong electric or magnetic fields deflected the canal rays and, in 1899, constructed a device with perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that separated the positive rays according to their charge-to-mass ratio (\"Q/m\"). Wien found that the charge-to-mass ratio depended on the nature of the gas in the discharge tube. English scientist J.J. Thomson later improved on the work of Wien by reducing the pressure to create the mass spectrograph.\nThe word \"spectrograph\" had become part of the international scientific vocabulary by 1884. Early \"spectrometry\" devices that measured the mass-to-charge ratio of ions were called \"mass spectrographs\" which consisted of instruments that recorded a spectrum of mass values on a photographic plate. A \"mass spectroscope\" is similar to a \"mass spectrograph\" except that the beam of ions is directed onto a phosphor screen. A mass spectroscope configuration was used in early instruments when it was desired that the effects of adjustments be quickly observed. Once the instrument was properly adjusted, a photographic plate was inserted and exposed. The term mass spectroscope continued to be used even though the direct illumination of a phosphor screen was replaced by indirect measurements with an oscilloscope. The use of the term \"mass spectroscopy\" is now discouraged due to the possibility of confusion with light spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry is often abbreviated as \"mass-spec\" or simply as \"MS\".\n\nModern techniques of mass spectrometry were devised by Arthur Jeffrey Dempster and F.W. Aston in 1918 and 1919 respectively.\n\nSector mass spectrometers known as calutrons were developed by Ernest O. Lawrence and used for separating the isotopes of uranium during the Manhattan Project. Calutron mass spectrometers were used for uranium enrichment at the Oak Ridge, Tennessee Y-12 plant established during World War II.\n\nIn 1989, half of the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Hans Dehmelt and Wolfgang Paul for the development of the ion trap technique in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 2002, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to John Bennett Fenn for the development of electrospray ionization (ESI) and Koichi Tanaka for the development of soft laser desorption (SLD) and their application to the ionization of biological macromolecules, especially proteins.\n\nA mass spectrometer consists of three components: an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector. The \"ionizer\" converts a portion of the sample into ions. There is a wide variety of ionization techniques, depending on the phase (solid, liquid, gas) of the sample and the efficiency of various ionization mechanisms for the unknown species. An extraction system removes ions from the sample, which are then targeted through the mass analyzer and into the \"detector\". The differences in masses of the fragments allows the mass analyzer to sort the ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. The detector measures the value of an indicator quantity and thus provides data for calculating the abundances of each ion present. Some detectors also give spatial information, e.g., a multichannel plate.\n\nThe following example describes the operation of a spectrometer mass analyzer, which is of the sector type. (Other analyzer types are treated below.) Consider a sample of sodium chloride (table salt). In the ion source, the sample is vaporized (turned into gas) and ionized (transformed into electrically charged particles) into sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) ions. Sodium atoms and ions are monoisotopic, with a mass of about 23 u. Chloride atoms and ions come in two isotopes with masses of approximately 35 u (at a natural abundance of about 75 percent) and approximately 37 u (at a natural abundance of about 25 percent). The analyzer part of the spectrometer contains electric and magnetic fields, which exert forces on ions traveling through these fields. The speed of a charged particle may be increased or decreased while passing through the electric field, and its direction may be altered by the magnetic field. The magnitude of the deflection of the moving ion's trajectory depends on its mass-to-charge ratio. Lighter ions get deflected by the magnetic force more than heavier ions (based on Newton's second law of motion, \"F\" = \"ma\"). The streams of sorted ions pass from the analyzer to the detector, which records the relative abundance of each ion type. This information is used to determine the chemical element composition of the original sample (i.e. that both sodium and chlorine are present in the sample) and the isotopic composition of its constituents (the ratio of Cl to Cl).\n\nThe ion source is the part of the mass spectrometer that ionizes the material under analysis (the analyte). The ions are then transported by magnetic or electric fields to the mass analyzer.\n\nTechniques for ionization have been key to determining what types of samples can be analyzed by mass spectrometry.\nElectron ionization and chemical ionization are used for gases and vapors. In chemical ionization sources, the analyte is ionized by chemical ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the source. Two techniques often used with liquid and solid biological samples include electrospray ionization (invented by John Fenn) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI, initially developed as a similar technique \"Soft Laser Desorption (SLD)\" by K. Tanaka for which a Nobel Prize was awarded and as MALDI by M. Karas and F. Hillenkamp).\n\nIn mass spectrometry, ionization refers to the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the ion source. There are several ion sources available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, electron ionization (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.\n\nHard ionization techniques are processes which impart high quantities of residual energy in the subject molecule invoking large degrees of fragmentation (i.e. the systematic rupturing of bonds acts to remove the excess energy, restoring stability to the resulting ion). Resultant ions tend to have \"m/z\" lower than the molecular mass (other than in the case of proton transfer and not including isotope peaks). The most common example of hard ionization is electron ionization (EI).\n\nSoft ionization refers to the processes which impart little residual energy onto the subject molecule and as such result in little fragmentation. Examples include fast atom bombardment (FAB), chemical ionization (CI), atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), electrospray ionization (ESI), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).\n\nInductively coupled plasma (ICP) sources are used primarily for cation analysis of a wide array of sample types. In this source, a plasma that is electrically neutral overall, but that has had a substantial fraction of its atoms ionized by high temperature, is used to atomize introduced sample molecules and to further strip the outer electrons from those atoms. The plasma is usually generated from argon gas, since the first ionization energy of argon atoms is higher than the first of any other elements except He, O, F and Ne, but lower than the second ionization energy of all except the most electropositive metals. The heating is achieved by a radio-frequency current passed through a coil surrounding the plasma.\n\nPhotoionization can be used in experiments which seek to use mass spectrometry as a means of resolving chemical kinetics mechanisms and isomeric product branching. In such instances a high energy photon, either X-ray or uv, is used to dissociate stable gaseous molecules in a carrier gas of He or Ar. In instances where a synchrotron light source is utilzed, a tuneable photon energy can be utilized to acquire a photoionization efficiency curve which can be used in conjunction with the charge ratio m/z to fingerprint molecular and ionic species.\n\nOthers include glow discharge, field desorption (FD), fast atom bombardment (FAB), thermospray, desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS), Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), spark ionization and thermal ionization (TIMS).\n\nMass analyzers separate the ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. The following two laws govern the dynamics of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields in vacuum:\n\nHere F is the force applied to the ion, \"m\" is the mass of the ion, a is the acceleration, \"Q\" is the ion charge, E is the electric field, and v × B is the vector cross product of the ion velocity and the magnetic field\n\nEquating the above expressions for the force applied to the ion yields:\n\nThis differential equation is the classic equation of motion for charged particles. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it completely determines the particle's motion in space and time in terms of \"m/Q\". Thus mass spectrometers could be thought of as \"mass-to-charge spectrometers\". When presenting data, it is common to use the (officially) dimensionless \"m/z\", where z is the number of elementary charges (\"e\") on the ion (z=Q/e). This quantity, although it is informally called the mass-to-charge ratio, more accurately speaking represents the ratio of the mass number and the charge number, \"z\".\n\nThere are many types of mass analyzers, using either static or dynamic fields, and magnetic or electric fields, but all operate according to the above differential equation. Each analyzer type has its strengths and weaknesses. Many mass spectrometers use two or more mass analyzers for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). In addition to the more common mass analyzers listed below, there are others designed for special situations.\n\nThere are several important analyser characteristics. The mass resolving power is the measure of the ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different \"m/z\". The mass accuracy is the ratio of the \"m/z\" measurement error to the true m/z. Mass accuracy is usually measured in ppm or milli mass units. The mass range is the range of \"m/z\" amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.\n\nA sector field mass analyzer uses a static electric and/or magnetic field to affect the path and/or velocity of the charged particles in some way.\nAs shown above, sector instruments bend the trajectories of the ions as they pass through the mass analyzer, according to their mass-to-charge ratios, deflecting the more charged and faster-moving, lighter ions more. The analyzer can be used to select a narrow range of \"m/z\" or to scan through a range of \"m/z\" to catalog the ions present.\n\nThe time-of-flight (TOF) analyzer uses an electric field to accelerate the ions through the same potential, and then measures the time they take to reach the detector. If the particles all have the same charge, the kinetic energies tends to be identical, and their velocities, in this case, will depend only on their masses. Ions with a lower mass will reach the detector first. However, in reality, even particles with the same m/z can arrive at different times at the detector, because they have different initial velocities. The initial velocity is not dependent on the mass of the ion what becomes a problem for the TOF-MS. The difference in initial velocity turns into difference in the final velocity. In this way, ions with the same m/z are going to arrive at different times in the detector. For fixing this problem, time-lag focusing/delayed extraction has been coupled with TOF-MS.\n\nQuadrupole mass analyzers use oscillating electrical fields to selectively stabilize or destabilize the paths of ions passing through a radio frequency (RF) quadrupole field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow a wide range of m/z values to be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the quadrupole ion trap, particularly the linear quadrupole ion trap except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole.\nA magnetically enhanced quadrupole mass analyzer includes the addition of a magnetic field, either applied axially or transversely. This novel type of instrument leads to an additional performance enhancement in terms of resolution and/or sensitivity depending upon the magnitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field. \nA common variation of the transmission quadrupole is the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The “triple quad” has three consecutive quadrupole stages, the first acting as a mass filter to transmit a particular incoming ion to the second quadrupole, a collision chamber, wherein that ion can be broken into fragments. The third quadrupole also acts as a mass filter, to transmit a particular fragment ion to the detector. If a quadrupole is made to rapidly and repetitively cycle through a range of mass filter settings, full spectra can be reported. Likewise, a triple quad can be made to perform various scan types characteristic of tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nThe quadrupole ion trap works on the same physical principles as the quadrupole mass analyzer, but the ions are trapped and sequentially ejected. Ions are trapped in a mainly quadrupole RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode (usually connected to the main RF potential) between two endcap electrodes (typically connected to DC or auxiliary AC potentials). The sample is ionized either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, in which case the ions are often introduced through an aperture in an endcap electrode.\n\nThere are many mass/charge separation and isolation methods but the most commonly used is the mass instability mode in which the RF potential is ramped so that the orbit of ions with a mass are stable while ions with mass \"b\" become unstable and are ejected on the \"z\"-axis onto a detector. There are also non-destructive analysis methods.\n\nIons may also be ejected by the resonance excitation method, whereby a supplemental oscillatory excitation voltage is applied to the endcap electrodes, and the trapping voltage amplitude and/or excitation voltage frequency is varied to bring ions into a resonance condition in order of their mass/charge ratio.\n\nThe cylindrical ion trap mass spectrometer (CIT) is a derivative of the quadrupole ion trap where the electrodes are formed from flat rings rather than hyperbolic shaped electrodes. The architecture lends itself well to miniaturization because as the size of a trap is reduced, the shape of the electric field near the center of the trap, the region where the ions are trapped, forms a shape similar to that of a hyperbolic trap.\n\nA linear quadrupole ion trap is similar to a quadrupole ion trap, but it traps ions in a two dimensional quadrupole field, instead of a three-dimensional quadrupole field as in a 3D quadrupole ion trap. Thermo Fisher's LTQ (\"linear trap quadrupole\") is an example of the linear ion trap.\n\nA toroidal ion trap can be visualized as a linear quadrupole curved around and connected at the ends or as a cross section of a 3D ion trap rotated on edge to form the toroid, donut shaped trap. The trap can store large volumes of ions by distributing them throughout the ring-like trap structure. This toroidal shaped trap is a configuration that allows the increased miniaturization of an ion trap mass analyzer. Additionally all ions are stored in the same trapping field and ejected together simplifying detection that can be complicated with array configurations due to variations in detector alignment and machining of the arrays.\n\nAs with the toroidal trap, linear traps and 3D quadrupole ion traps are the most commonly miniaturized mass analyzers due to their high sensitivity, tolerance for mTorr pressure, and capabilities for single analyzer tandem mass spectrometry (e.g. product ion scans).\n\nOrbitrap instruments are similar to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers (see text below). Ions are electrostatically trapped in an orbit around a central, spindle shaped electrode. The electrode confines the ions so that they both orbit around the central electrode and oscillate back and forth along the central electrode's long axis. This oscillation generates an image current in the detector plates which is recorded by the instrument. The frequencies of these image currents depend on the mass-to-charge ratios of the ions. Mass spectra are obtained by Fourier transformation of the recorded image currents.\n\nOrbitraps have a high mass accuracy, high sensitivity and a good dynamic range.\n\nFourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS), or more precisely Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS, measures mass by detecting the image current produced by ions cyclotroning in the presence of a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an electron multiplier, the ions are injected into a Penning trap (a static electric/magnetic ion trap) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion's cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be deconvoluted by performing a Fourier transform on the signal. FTMS has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is \"counted\" more than once) and much higher resolution and thus precision.\n\nIon cyclotron resonance (ICR) is an older mass analysis technique similar to FTMS except that ions are detected with a traditional detector. Ions trapped in a Penning trap are excited by an RF electric field until they impact the wall of the trap, where the detector is located. Ions of different mass are resolved according to impact time.\n\nThe final element of the mass spectrometer is the detector. The detector records either the charge induced or the current produced when an ion passes by or hits a surface. In a scanning instrument, the signal produced in the detector during the course of the scan versus where the instrument is in the scan (at what \"m/Q\") will produce a mass spectrum, a record of ions as a function of \"m/Q\".\n\nTypically, some type of electron multiplier is used, though other detectors including Faraday cups and ion-to-photon detectors are also used. Because the number of ions leaving the mass analyzer at a particular instant is typically quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal. Microchannel plate detectors are commonly used in modern commercial instruments. In FTMS and Orbitraps, the detector consists of a pair of metal surfaces within the mass analyzer/ion trap region which the ions only pass near as they oscillate. No direct current is produced, only a weak AC image current is produced in a circuit between the electrodes. Other inductive detectors have also been used.\n\nA tandem mass spectrometer is one capable of multiple rounds of mass spectrometry, usually separated by some form of molecule fragmentation. For example, one mass analyzer can isolate one peptide from many entering a mass spectrometer. A second mass analyzer then stabilizes the peptide ions while they collide with a gas, causing them to fragment by collision-induced dissociation (CID). A third mass analyzer then sorts the fragments produced from the peptides. Tandem MS can also be done in a single mass analyzer over time, as in a quadrupole ion trap. There are various methods for fragmenting molecules for tandem MS, including collision-induced dissociation (CID), electron capture dissociation (ECD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD), electron-detachment dissociation (EDD) and surface-induced dissociation (SID). An important application using tandem mass spectrometry is in protein identification.\n\nTandem mass spectrometry enables a variety of experimental sequences. Many commercial mass spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such routine sequences as selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and precursor ion scanning. In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions. SRM is most often used with scanning instruments where the second mass analysis event is duty cycle limited. These experiments are used to increase specificity of detection of known molecules, notably in pharmacokinetic studies. Precursor ion scanning refers to monitoring for a specific loss from the precursor ion. The first and second mass analyzers scan across the spectrum as partitioned by a user-defined \"m/z\" value. This experiment is used to detect specific motifs within unknown molecules.\n\nAnother type of tandem mass spectrometry used for radiocarbon dating is accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), which uses very high voltages, usually in the mega-volt range, to accelerate negative ions into a type of tandem mass spectrometer.\n\nWhen a specific combination of source, analyzer, and detector becomes conventional in practice, a compound acronym may arise to designate it succinctly. One example is MALDI-TOF, which refers to a combination of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization source with a time-of-flight mass analyzer. Other examples include inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), thermal ionization-mass spectrometry (TIMS) and spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS).\n\nCertain applications of mass spectrometry have developed monikers that although strictly speaking would seem to refer to a broad application, in practice have come instead to connote a specific or a limited number of instrument configurations. An example of this is isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), which refers in practice to the use of a limited number of sector based mass analyzers; this name is used to refer to both the application and the instrument used for the application.\n\nAn important enhancement to the mass resolving and mass determining capabilities of mass spectrometry is using it in tandem with chromatographic and other separation techniques.\n\nA common combination is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS). In this technique, a gas chromatograph is used to separate different compounds. This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the ion source, a metallic filament to which voltage is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass spectrometer's analyzer and are eventually detected.\n\nSimilar to gas chromatography MS (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS or LC-MS) separates compounds chromatographically before they are introduced to the ion source and mass spectrometer. It differs from GC-MS in that the mobile phase is liquid, usually a mixture of water and organic solvents, instead of gas. Most commonly, an electrospray ionization source is used in LC-MS. Other popular and commercially available LC-MS ion sources are atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and atmospheric pressure photoionization. There are also some newly developed ionization techniques like laser spray.\n\nCapillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is a technique that combines the liquid separation process of capillary electrophoresis with mass spectrometry. CE-MS is typically coupled to electrospray ionization.\n\nIon mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS/MS or IMMS) is a technique where ions are first separated by drift time through some neutral gas under an applied electrical potential gradient before being introduced into a mass spectrometer. Drift time is a measure of the radius relative to the charge of the ion. The duty cycle of IMS (the time over which the experiment takes place) is longer than most mass spectrometric techniques, such that the mass spectrometer can sample along the course of the IMS separation. This produces data about the IMS separation and the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions in a manner similar to LC-MS.\n\nThe duty cycle of IMS is short relative to liquid chromatography or gas chromatography separations and can thus be coupled to such techniques, producing triple modalities such as LC/IMS/MS.\n\nMass spectrometry produces various types of data. The most common data representation is the mass spectrum.\n\nCertain types of mass spectrometry data are best represented as a mass chromatogram. Types of chromatograms include selected ion monitoring (SIM), total ion current (TIC), and selected reaction monitoring (SRM), among many others.\n\nOther types of mass spectrometry data are well represented as a three-dimensional contour map. In this form, the mass-to-charge, \"m/z\" is on the \"x\"-axis, intensity the \"y\"-axis, and an additional experimental parameter, such as time, is recorded on the \"z\"-axis.\n\nMass spectrometry data analysis is specific to the type of experiment producing the data. General subdivisions of data are fundamental to understanding any data.\n\nMany mass spectrometers work in either \"negative ion mode\" or \"positive ion mode\". It is very important to know whether the observed ions are negatively or positively charged. This is often important in determining the neutral mass but it also indicates something about the nature of the molecules.\n\nDifferent types of ion source result in different arrays of fragments produced from the original molecules. An electron ionization source produces many fragments and mostly single-charged (1-) radicals (odd number of electrons), whereas an electrospray source usually produces non-radical quasimolecular ions that are frequently multiply charged. Tandem mass spectrometry purposely produces fragment ions post-source and can drastically change the sort of data achieved by an experiment.\n\nKnowledge of the origin of a sample can provide insight into the component molecules of the sample and their fragmentations. A sample from a synthesis/manufacturing process will probably contain impurities chemically related to the target component. A crudely prepared biological sample will probably contain a certain amount of salt, which may form adducts with the analyte molecules in certain analyses.\n\nResults can also depend heavily on sample preparation and how it was run/introduced. An important example is the issue of which matrix is used for MALDI spotting, since much of the energetics of the desorption/ionization event is controlled by the matrix rather than the laser power. Sometimes samples are spiked with sodium or another ion-carrying species to produce adducts rather than a protonated species.\n\nMass spectrometry can measure molar mass, molecular structure, and sample purity. Each of these questions requires a different experimental procedure; therefore, adequate definition of the experimental goal is a prerequisite for collecting the proper data and successfully interpreting it.\n\nSince the precise structure or peptide sequence of a molecule is deciphered through the set of fragment masses, the interpretation of mass spectra requires combined use of various techniques. Usually the first strategy for identifying an unknown compound is to compare its experimental mass spectrum against a library of mass spectra. If no matches result from the search, then manual interpretation or software assisted interpretation of mass spectra must be performed. Computer simulation of ionization and fragmentation processes occurring in mass spectrometer is the primary tool for assigning structure or peptide sequence to a molecule. An \"a priori\" structural information is fragmented \"in silico\" and the resulting pattern is compared with observed spectrum. Such simulation is often supported by a fragmentation library that contains published patterns of known decomposition reactions. Software taking advantage of this idea has been developed for both small molecules and proteins.\n\nAnalysis of mass spectra can also be spectra with accurate mass. A mass-to-charge ratio value (\"m/z\") with only integer precision can represent an immense number of theoretically possible ion structures; however, more precise mass figures significantly reduce the number of candidate molecular formulas. A computer algorithm called formula generator calculates all molecular formulas that theoretically fit a given mass with specified tolerance.\n\nA recent technique for structure elucidation in mass spectrometry, called precursor ion fingerprinting, identifies individual pieces of structural information by conducting a search of the tandem spectra of the molecule under investigation against a library of the product-ion spectra of structurally characterized precursor ions.\n\nMass spectrometry has both qualitative and quantitative uses. These include identifying unknown compounds, determining the isotopic composition of elements in a molecule, and determining the structure of a compound by observing its fragmentation. Other uses include quantifying the amount of a compound in a sample or studying the fundamentals of gas phase ion chemistry (the chemistry of ions and neutrals in a vacuum). MS is now commonly used in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds.\n\nAs an analytical technique it possesses distinct advantages such as: Increased sensitivity over most other analytical techniques because the analyzer, as a mass-charge filter, reduces background interference, Excellent specificity from characteristic fragmentation patterns to identify unknowns or confirm the presence of suspected compounds, Information about molecular weight, Information about the isotopic abundance of elements, Temporally resolved chemical data.\n\nA few of the disadvantages of the method is that it often fails to distinguish between optical and geometrical isomers and the positions of substituent in o-, m- and p- positions in an aromatic ring. Also, its scope is limited in identifying hydrocarbons that produce similar fragmented ions.\n\nMass spectrometry is also used to determine the isotopic composition of elements within a sample. Differences in mass among isotopes of an element are very small, and the less abundant isotopes of an element are typically very rare, so a very sensitive instrument is required. These instruments, sometimes referred to as isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IR-MS), usually use a single magnet to bend a beam of ionized particles towards a series of Faraday cups which convert particle impacts to electric current. A fast on-line analysis of deuterium content of water can be done using flowing afterglow mass spectrometry, FA-MS. Probably the most sensitive and accurate mass spectrometer for this purpose is the accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS). This is because it provides ultimate sensitivity, capable of measuring individual atoms and measuring nuclides with a dynamic range of ~10 relative to the major stable isotope. Isotope ratios are important markers of a variety of processes. Some isotope ratios are used to determine the age of materials for example as in carbon dating. Labeling with stable isotopes is also used for protein quantification. (see protein characterization below)\n\nMembrane-inlet Mass Spectrometry, combines the Isotope ratio MS with a reaction chamber/cell separated by a gas-permeable membrane. This method allows the study of gasses as they evolve in solution. This method has been extensively used for the study of the production of oxygen by Photosystem II.\n\nSeveral techniques use ions created in a dedicated ion source injected into a flow tube or a drift tube: selected ion flow tube (SIFT-MS), and proton transfer reaction (PTR-MS), are variants of chemical ionization dedicated for trace gas analysis of air, breath or liquid headspace using well defined reaction time allowing calculations of analyte concentrations from the known reaction kinetics without the need for internal standard or calibration.\n\nAn atom probe is an instrument that combines time-of-flight mass spectrometry and field-evaporation microscopy to map the location of individual atoms.\n\nPharmacokinetics is often studied using mass spectrometry because of the complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) and the need for high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however it is not uncommon to use curve fitting with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.\n\nThere is currently considerable interest in the use of very high sensitivity mass spectrometry for microdosing studies, which are seen as a promising alternative to animal experimentation.\n\nMass spectrometry is an important method for the characterization and sequencing of proteins. The two primary methods for ionization of whole proteins are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). In keeping with the performance and mass range of available mass spectrometers, two approaches are used for characterizing proteins. In the first, intact proteins are ionized by either of the two techniques described above, and then introduced to a mass analyzer. This approach is referred to as \"top-down\" strategy of protein analysis. The top-down approach however is largely limited to low-throughput single-protein studies. In the second, proteins are enzymatically digested into smaller peptides using proteases such as trypsin or pepsin, either in solution or in gel after electrophoretic separation. Other proteolytic agents are also used. The collection of peptide products are then introduced to the mass analyzer. When the characteristic pattern of peptides is used for the identification of the protein the method is called peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF), if the identification is performed using the sequence data determined in tandem MS analysis it is called de novo peptide sequencing. These procedures of protein analysis are also referred to as the \"bottom-up\" approach. A third approach however is beginning to be used, this intermediate \"middle-down\" approach involves analyzing proteolytic peptide larger than the typical tryptic peptide.\n\nMass spectrometry (MS), with its low sample requirement and high sensitivity, has been predominantly used in glycobiology for characterization and elucidation of glycan structures. Mass spectrometry provides a complementary method to HPLC for the analysis of glycans. Intact glycans may be detected directly as singly charged ions by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) or, following permethylation or peracetylation, by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) also gives good signals for the smaller glycans. Various free and commercial software are now available which interpret MS data and aid in Glycan structure characterization.\n\nAs a standard method for analysis, mass spectrometers have reached other planets and moons. Two were taken to Mars by the Viking program. In early 2005 the Cassini–Huygens mission delivered a specialized GC-MS instrument aboard the Huygens probe through the atmosphere of Titan, the largest moon of the planet Saturn. This instrument analyzed atmospheric samples along its descent trajectory and was able to vaporize and analyze samples of Titan's frozen, hydrocarbon covered surface once the probe had landed. These measurements compare the abundance of isotope(s) of each particle comparatively to earth's natural abundance. Also on board the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft was an ion and neutral mass spectrometer which had been taking measurements of Titan's atmospheric composition as well as the composition of Enceladus' plumes. A Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer mass spectrometer was carried by the Mars Phoenix Lander launched in 2007.\n\nMass spectrometers are also widely used in space missions to measure the composition of plasmas. For example, the Cassini spacecraft carried the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS), which measured the mass of ions in Saturn's magnetosphere.\n\nMass spectrometers were used in hospitals for respiratory gas analysis beginning around 1975 through the end of the century. Some are probably still in use but none are currently being manufactured.\n\nFound mostly in the operating room, they were a part of a complex system, in which respired gas samples from patients undergoing anesthesia were drawn into the instrument through a valve mechanism designed to sequentially connect up to 32 rooms to the mass spectrometer. A computer directed all operations of the system. The data collected from the mass spectrometer was delivered to the individual rooms for the anesthesiologist to use.\n\nThe uniqueness of this magnetic sector mass spectrometer may have been the fact that a plane of detectors, each purposely positioned to collect all of the ion species expected to be in the samples, allowed the instrument to simultaneously report all of the gases respired by the patient. Although the mass range was limited to slightly over 120 u, fragmentation of some of the heavier molecules negated the need for a higher detection limit.\n\nThe primary function of mass spectrometry is as a tool for chemical analyses based on detection and quantification of ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. However, mass spectrometry also shows promise for material synthesis. Ion soft landing is characterized by deposition of intact species on surfaces at low kinetic energies which precludes the fragmentation of the incident species. The soft landing technique was first reported in 1977 for the reaction of low energy sulfur containing ions on a lead surface.\n\n"}

{"id": "21881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21881", "title": "Nuremberg Code", "text": "Nuremberg Code\n\nThe Nuremberg Code () is a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation created as a result of the Nuremberg trials at the end of the Second World War.\n\nThe origin of the Nuremberg Code began in pre–World War II German politics, particularly during the 1930s and 1940s. The pre-war German Medical Association was considered to be a progressive yet democratic association with great concerns for public health, one example being the legislation of compulsory health insurance for German workers. However, starting in the mid-1920s, German physicians, usually proponents of racial hygiene, were accused by the public and the medical society of unethical medical practices. The use of racial hygiene was supported by the German government in order to create an Aryan \"master race\", and to exterminate those who did not fit into their criteria. Racial hygiene extremists merged with National Socialism to promote the use of biology to accomplish their goals of racial purity, a core concept in the Nazi ideology. Physicians were attracted to the scientific ideology and aided in the establishment of National Socialist Physicians' League in 1929 to \"purify the German medical community of 'Jewish Bolshevism'.\" Criticism was becoming prevalent; Alfons Stauder, member of the Reich Health Office, claimed that the \"dubious experiments have no therapeutic purpose\", and Fredrich von Muller, physician and the president of the Deutsche Akademie, joined the criticism.\n\nIn response to the criticism of unethical human experimentation, the Reich government issued \"Guidelines for New Therapy and Human Experimentation\" in Weimar, Germany. The guidelines were based on beneficence and non-maleficence, but also stressed legal doctrine of informed consent. The guidelines clearly distinguished the difference between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research. For therapeutic purposes, the guidelines allowed administration without consent only in dire situations, but for non-therapeutic purposes any administration without consent was strictly forbidden. However, the guidelines from Weimar were negated by Adolf Hitler. By 1942, the Nazi party included more than 38,000 German physicians, who helped carry out medical programs such as the Sterilization Law.\n\nAfter World War II, a series of trials were held to hold members of the Nazi party responsible for a multitude of war crimes. The trials were approved by President Harry Truman in January 1946 and were led exclusively by the United States. They began on December 9, 1946 in Nuremberg, Germany, in what became known as the Nuremberg trials. In one of the trials, which became known as the \"Doctors' Trial\", German physicians responsible for conducting unethical medical procedures on humans during the war were tried. They focused on physicians who conducted inhumane and unethical human experiments in concentration camps, in addition to those who were involved in over 3,500,000 sterilizations of German citizens. Several of the accused argued that their experiments differed little from those used before the war, and that there was no law that differentiated between legal and illegal experiments. On August 20, 1947, the judges delivered their verdict against Karl Brandt and 22 others.\n\nIn May 1947, while the trials were being held, six points defining legitimate medical research were submitted to the Counsel for War Crimes. Three judges, in response to expert medical advisers for the prosecution, adopted these points and added four additional points. The 10 points constituted the \"Nuremberg Code\", which includes such principles as informed consent and absence of coercion; properly formulated scientific experimentation; and beneficence towards experiment participants. It is thought to have been mainly based on the Hippocratic Oath, which was interpreted as endorsing the experimental approach to medicine while protecting the patient.\n\n\nThe Nuremberg Code was initially ignored, but gained much greater significance about 20 years after it was written. As a result, there were substantial rival claims for the creation of the Code. Some claimed that Harold Sebring, one of the three U.S. judges who presided over the Doctors' Trial, was the author. Leo Alexander, MD and Andrew Ivy, MD, the prosecution's chief medical expert witnesses, were also each identified as authors. In his letter to Maurice H. Pappworth, an English physician and the author of the book \"Human Guinea Pigs\", Andrew Ivy claimed sole authorship of the Code. Leo Alexander, approximately 30 years after the trial, also claimed sole authorship. However, after careful reading of the transcript of the Doctors' Trial, background documents, and the final judgements, it is more accepted that the authorship was shared and the Code grew out of the trial itself.\n\nThe Nuremberg Code has not been officially accepted as law by any nation or as official ethics guidelines by any association. In fact, the Code's reference to Hippocratic duty to the individual patient and the need to provide information was not initially favored by the American Medical Association. The Western world initially dismissed the Nuremberg Code as a \"code for barbarians\" and not for civilized physicians and investigators. Additionally, the final judgement did not specify whether the Nuremberg Code should be applied to cases such as political prisoners, convicted felons, and healthy volunteers. The lack of clarity, the brutality of the unethical medical experiments, and the uncompromising language of the Nuremberg Code created an image that the Code was designed for singularly egregious transgressions.\n\nHowever, the Code is considered to be the most important document in the history of clinical research ethics, which had a massive influence on global human rights. The Nuremberg Code and the related Declaration of Helsinki are the basis for the Code of Federal Regulations Title 45 Part 46, which are the regulations issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services for the ethical treatment of human subjects, and are used in Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). In addition, the idea of informed consent has been universally accepted and now constitutes Article 7 of the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It also served as the basis for International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects proposed by the World Health Organization.\n\n"}

Russell (1974 and after) to describe and measure emotional states. PAD uses three numerical dimensions, Pleasure, Arousal and Dominance to represent all emotions. Its initial use was in a theory of environmental psychology, the core idea being that physical environments influence people through their emotional impact. It was subsequently used by Peter Lang and colleagues to propose a physiological theory of emotion. It was also used by James A. Russell to develop a theory of emotional episodes (relatively brief emotionally charged events). The PA part of PAD was developed into a circumplex model of emotion experience, and those two dimensions were termed \"core affect\". The D part of PAD was re-conceptualized as part of the appraisal process in an emotional episode (a cold cognitive assessment of the situation eliciting the emotion). A more fully developed version of this approach is termed the psychological construction theory of emotion.\n\nThe PAD (\"Pleasure\", \"Arousal\", \"Dominance\") model has been used to study nonverbal communication such as body language in psychology. It has also been applied to consumer marketing and the construction of animated characters that express emotions in virtual worlds.\n\nPAD uses three-dimensional scales which in theory could have any numerical values. The dimensional structure is reminiscent of the 19th century work of Wilhelm Wundt who also used a three-dimensional system and also the 20th century work of Charles E. Osgood.\n\nThe \"Pleasure-Displeasure Scale\" measures how pleasant or unpleasant one feels about something. For instance both anger and fear are unpleasant emotions, and both score on the displeasure side. However joy is a pleasant emotion.\n\nThe \"Arousal-Nonarousal Scale\" measures how energized or soporific one feels. It is not the intensity of the emotion -- for grief and depression can be low arousal intense feelings. While both anger and rage are unpleasant emotions, rage has a higher intensity or a higher arousal state. However boredom, which is also an unpleasant state, has a low arousal value.\n\nThe \"Dominance-Submissiveness Scale\" represents the controlling and dominant versus controlled or submissive one feels. For instance while both fear and anger are unpleasant emotions, anger is a dominant emotion, while fear is a submissive emotion.\n\nA more abbreviated version of the model uses just 4 values for each dimension, providing only 64 values for possible emotions. For instance, anger is a quite unpleasant, quite aroused, and moderately dominant emotion, while boredom is slightly unpleasant, quite unaroused, and mostly non-dominant.\n\nThe abbreviated model has also been used in organizational studies where the emotions towards specific entities or products marketed by them are measured.\n\nThe PAD model has been used in studying consumer behavior in stores, to determine the effects of pleasure and arousal on issues such as extra time spent in the store and unplanned spending.\n\nThe PAD model, and the corresponding \"PAD Space\" have been used in the construction of animated agents that exhibit emotions.For instance, Becker et al. describe how primary and secondary emotions can be mapped via the PAD space to features in the faces of animated characters to reflect happiness, boredom, frustration or annoyance. Lance et al. discuss how the PAD model can be used to study gaze behavior in animated agents.\n\nZhang et al. describe how the PAD model can be used to assign specific emotions to the faces of avatars. In this approach the PAD model is used as a high level emotional space, and the lower level space is the MPEG-4 Facial Animation Parameters (FAP). A mid-level Partial Expression Parameters (PEP) space is then used to in a two level structure: the PAD-PEP mapping and the PEP-FAP translation model.\n\n"}

In order to work with such data, there is a need to quantify the integrity of the data. This is achieved by using probabilistic databases.\n\nA probabilistic database is an uncertain database in which the possible worlds have associated probabilities. Probabilistic database management systems are currently an active area of research. \"While there are currently no commercial probabilistic database systems, several research prototypes exist...\"\n\nProbabilistic databases distinguish between the logical data model and the physical representation of the data much like relational databases do in the ANSI-SPARC Architecture.\nIn probabilistic databases this is even more crucial since such databases have to represent very large numbers of possible worlds, often exponential in the size of one world (a classical database), succinctly.\n\nIn a probabilistic database, each data item←relation, tuple and value that an attribute can take—is associated with a probability ∈ (0,1], with 0 representing that the data is certainly incorrect, and 1 representing that it is certainly correct.\n\nA probabilistic database could exist in multiple states. For example, if we are uncertain about the existence of a tuple in the database, then the database could be in two different states with respect to that tuple—the first state contains the tuple, while the second one does not.

{"id": "2860674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2860674", "title": "Q value (nuclear science)", "text": "Q value (nuclear science)\n\nIn nuclear physics and chemistry, the \"Q\" value for a reaction is the amount of energy absorbed or released during the nuclear reaction. The value relates to the enthalpy of a chemical reaction or the energy of radioactive decay products. It can be determined from the masses of reactants and products. Q values affect reaction rates. In general, the larger the positive Q value for the reaction, the faster the reaction proceeds, and the more likely the reaction is to \"favor\" the products.\nQ value=(mp-mr)931Mev\nwhere,mr=sum of the masses of reactants.\nmp=sum of the masses of products.\n\nThe conservation of energy, between the initial and final energy of a nuclear process (formula_1), enables the general definition of \"Q\" based on the mass-energy equivalence. For any radioactive particle decay, the kinetic energy difference will be given by:\nwhere \"K\" denotes the kinetic energy of the mass \"m\".\nA reaction with a positive \"Q\" value is exothermic, i.e. has a net release of energy, since the kinetic energy of the final state is greater than the kinetic energy of the initial state.\nA reaction with a negative \"Q\" value is endothermic, i.e. requires a net energy input, since the kinetic energy of the final state is less than the kinetic energy of the initial state. Observe that a chemical reaction is exothermic when it has a \"negative\" enthalpy of reaction, in contrast a positive Q value in a nuclear reaction.\n\nThe Q value can also be expressed in terms of the binding energies of the nuclear species as:\n\nformula_3\n\nProof: Note that the count of nucleons is conserved in a nuclear reaction. Hence, total reactant protons = total product protons and total reactant neutrons = total product neutrons. Hence, the sum of binding energy and rest mass energy of nuclei of both reactant and products are same. In other words, formula_4. Using the first relation (formula_5), this proof is complete.\n\nChemical \"Q\" values are measurement in calorimetry. Exothermic chemical reactions tend to be more spontaneous and can emit light or heat, resulting in runaway feedback(i.e. explosions).\n\n\"Q\" values are also featured in particle physics. For example, Sargent's rule states that weak reaction rates are proportional to \"Q\". The \"Q\" value is the kinetic energy released in the decay at rest. For neutron decay, some mass disappears as neutrons convert to a proton, electron and antineutrino:\n\nwhere \"m\" is the mass of the neutron, \"m\" is the mass of the proton, \"m\" is the mass of the electron antineutrino and \"m\" is the mass of the electron; and the \"K\" are the corresponding kinetic energies. The neutron has no initial kinetic energy since it is at rest. In beta decay, a typical \"Q\" is around 1 MeV.\n\nThe decay energy is divided among the products in a continuous distribution for more than 2 products. Measuring this spectrum allows one to find the mass of a product. Experiments are studying emission spectrums to search for neutrinoless decay and neutrino mass; this is the principle of the ongoing KATRIN experiment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17137358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17137358", "title": "Reactive centrifugal force", "text": "Reactive centrifugal force\n\nIn classical mechanics, a reactive centrifugal force forms part of an action–reaction pair with a centripetal force.\n\nIn accordance with Newton's first law of motion, an object moves in a straight line in the absence of any external forces acting on the object. A curved path may however ensue when a force acts on it; this force is often called a centripetal force, as it is directed toward the center of curvature of the path. Then in accordance with Newton's third law of motion, there will also be an equal and opposite force exerted by the object on some other object, such as a constraint that forces the path to be curved, and this reaction force, the subject of this article, is sometimes called a reactive centrifugal force, as it is directed in the opposite direction of the centripetal force.\n\nUnlike the inertial force or fictitious force known as centrifugal force, which always exists in addition to the reactive force in the rotating frame of reference, the reactive force is a real Newtonian force that is observed in any reference frame. The two forces will only have the same magnitude in the special cases where circular motion arises and where the axis of rotation is the origin of the rotating frame of reference. It is the reactive force that is the subject of this article.\n\nThe figure at right shows a ball in uniform circular motion held to its path by a massless string tied to an immovable post. The figure is an example of a centrifugally-directed real force. In this system a centripetal force upon the ball provided by the string maintains the circular motion, and the reaction to it, usually called the \"reactive centrifugal force\" acts upon the string. In this model, the string is assumed massless and the rotational motion frictionless, so no propelling force is needed to keep the ball in circular motion.\n\nNewton's first law requires that any body not moving in a straight line is subject to a force, and the free body diagram shows the force upon the ball (center panel) exerted by the string to maintain the ball in its circular motion.\n\nNewton's third law of action and reaction states that if the string exerts an inward centripetal force on the ball, the ball will exert an equal but outward reaction upon the string, shown in the free body diagram of the string (lower panel) as the \"reactive centrifugal force\".\n\nThe string transmits the reactive centrifugal force from the ball to the fixed post, pulling upon the post. Again according to Newton's third law, the post exerts a reaction upon the string, labeled the \"post reaction\", pulling upon the string. The two forces upon the string are equal and opposite, exerting no \"net\" force upon the string (assuming that the string is massless), but placing the string under tension.\n\nThe reason the post appears to be \"immovable\" is because it is fixed to the earth. If the rotating ball was tethered to the mast of a boat, for example, the boat mast and ball would both experience rotation about a central point.\n\nEven though the reactive centrifugal is rarely used in analyses in the physics literature, the concept is applied within some mechanical engineering concepts. An example of this kind of engineering concept is an analysis of the stresses within a rapidly rotating turbine blade. The blade can be treated as a stack of layers going from the axis out to the edge of the blade. Each layer exerts an outward (centrifugal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially inward layer and an inward (centripetal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially outward layer. At the same time the inner layer exerts an elastic centripetal force on the middle layer, while and the outer layer exerts an elastic centrifugal force, which results in an internal stress. It is the stresses in the blade and their causes that mainly interest mechanical engineers in this situation.\n\nAnother example of a rotating device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified used to describe the system behavior is the centrifugal clutch. A centrifugal clutch is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension. At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the spring tension, due to the outer drum, the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces. The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the output drive shaft that is connected to the drum. Thus the centrifugal clutch illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.\n\nAny force directed away from a center can be called \"centrifugal\". \"Centrifugal\" simply means \"directed outward from the center\". Similarly, \"centripetal\" means \"directed toward the center\". The \"reactive centrifugal force\" discussed in this article is not the same thing as the centrifugal pseudoforce, which is usually what's meant by the term \"centrifugal force\".\n\nReactive centrifugal force, being one-half of the reaction pair together with centripetal force, is a concept which applies in any reference frame. This distinguishes it from the inertial or fictitious centrifugal force, which appears only in rotating frames.\n\nIn a two-body rotation, such as a planet and moon rotating about their common center of mass or barycentre, the forces on both bodies are centripetal. In that case, the reaction to the centripetal force of the planet on the moon is the centripetal force of the moon on the planet.\n"}

Eagleman explores the wonders of the human brain with the goal of revealing why we feel and think the things we do. The series debuted on PBS in 2015, followed by airings on the BBC in the United Kingdom and the SBS in Australia. As of early 2016 it has been nominated for an Emmy Award.\n\nThe series consists of six 1-hour episodes:\n\nEagleman's book to accompany the series, \"The Brain: The Story of You\", was co-published by Pantheon Books (US) and Canongate Books (UK).\n\nThe series and accompanying book garnered wide critical acclaim. The \"New York Times\" listed it as one of the best television shows of 2015. Forbes magazine wrote that \"in the fine tradition of Carl Sagan, Eagleman shows that science is captivating without hyped embellishment, and, if you pay attention, you'll find yourself immersed in it\". The scientific journal \"Nature\" described the series as \"an ideal introduction to how biology generates the mind... structured around crucial and wide-ranging questions, saturated with personal and social relevance. And Eagleman's answers are consistently clear, engaging and thought-provoking.\" Actor Hugh Laurie described the series as one of the influences in his current television series, \"Chance\"; Laurie also tweeted his advice about the show: \"I recommend a facial truss, to prevent your chin hitting the floor hard and often.\" \"Texas Monthly\" Magazine suggested that Eagleman is \"the Carl Sagan of neuroscience\"\n\n\"The Brain with David Eagleman\" on the Internet Movie Database\n"}

The expedition met disastrous results when its ship became trapped and ultimately crushed in the ice pack. Shackleton and his 28-man crew endured the long polar winter before ultimately finding rescue following an 800-mile open boat voyage on the Weddell sea. Against all odds, the entire crew of \"The Endurance\" survived. Frank Hurley's original film footage was used by Butler along with interviews of surviving relatives to present the story of Shackleton's expedition.\n\nThe film was well received by critics, and was nominated for and won several awards. Butler followed it up the next year with another documentary about Shackleton's expedition entitled \"Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure\".\n"}

The list is divided into core items and complementary items. The core items are deemed to be the most cost effective options for key health problems and are usable with little additional health care resources. The complementary items frequently require additional infrastructure such as specially trained health care providers or diagnostic equipment. The first list for children was created in 2007, and the list is now in its 5th edition.\n\nNote: In the following article, an α indicates the medicine is a complementary item, for which specialised diagnostic or monitoring and/or specialist training are needed.

Callimahos as part of an advanced course, CA-400, that Callimahos taught to National Security Agency cryptanalysts starting in the 1950s.\n\nThe scenario involves 375 radio messages said to have been intercepted on December 23 by the US Army contingent of a United Nations force landed on the fictional island of Zendia in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nA typical intercept looks like this:\nFor each message, the first line is provided by the intercept operator, giving call signs, frequency, time, and reference number. The rest of the message is a transcript of the Morse code transmission.\n\nAt the beginning of the intercepted message there is a header which consists of 8 four-digit groups. Initially, the meaning of the numeric header is not known; the meanings of various components of this header (such as a serial number assigned by the transmitting organization's message center) can be worked out through traffic analysis.\n\nThe rest of the message consists of \"indicators\" and ciphertext; the first group is evidently a \"discriminant\" indicating the cryptosystem used, and (depending on the cryptosystem) some or all of the second group may contain a message-specific keying element such as initial rotor settings. The first two groups are repeated at the end of the message, which allows correction of garbled indicators. The remaining characters are encrypted text. Since the transmissions always use complete groups, \"nulls\" may have been used to pad out the text.\n\nCryptosystems employed include transposition, dinome, and rotor-based ciphers and a one-part code. While these can be successfully tackled without use of a computer, solution is not easy. The practical exercise reinforces many basic principles, including ways to exploit having a \"collection\" of message traffic.\n\nA certain amount of cleartext inter-operator \"chatter\" is also provided, and may help with the analysis.\n\nHeaders and discriminants are also given for intercepts from the next three days; these may be used for traffic analysis and in determining daily operating procedures.\n\nThe Zendian problem has been declassified and is available either as part of \"Military Cryptanalytics\" or as a book in itself. Both were published as reprints by Aegean Park Press, Walnut Creek, CA, USA. There are a few small differences in the ciphertext between these sources, with neither being entirely error-free; indeed, some errors were intentional, and dealing with them is part of the learning process.\n\nKarl Heinz-Everts' Web site provides a link to a downloadable archive of the \"intercepts.\" (The site also provides analysis and partial solutions, which should \"not\" be viewed by anyone wishing to learn from working on this exercise.)\n\nCryptanalists who successfully finished CA-400 became members of the Dundee Society. This society was founded by Lambros D. Callimahos and was so named after the empty Dundee marmalade jar on his desk, as he couldn't disclose the society's real purpose.\n\nA large print showing the fictional nation of Zendia hangs on the wall of the library at the National Cryptologic Museum, which is operated by the NSA. Copies of this map, shrunken to such a degree that most feature labels are illegible, appear in the previously cited books.\n\n\n"}
