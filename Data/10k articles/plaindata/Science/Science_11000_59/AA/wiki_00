{"id": "2873458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2873458", "title": "Civic Biology", "text": "Civic Biology\n\nA Civic Biology: Presented in Problems (usually referred to as just Civic Biology) was a biology textbook written by George William Hunter, published in 1914. It is the book which the state of Tennessee required high school teachers to use in 1925 and is best known for its section about evolution that was ruled by a local court to be in violation of the state Butler Act. It was for teaching from this textbook that John T. Scopes was brought to trial in Dayton, Tennessee in the Scopes \"Monkey\" Trial. The views espoused in the book about evolution, race, and eugenics were common to American Progressives (especially in the work of Charles Benedict Davenport, one of the most prominent American biologists of the early 20th century, whom Hunter cites in the book).\n\nExcerpts from the book give its general tone and approach to controversial topics regarding mankind:\n\nHunter was born in Mamaroneck New York, and was educated at Williams College, the University of Chicago, and New York University, where he obtained his doctorate. He later became chairman of the biology department at his alma mater, De Witt Clinton High School, a public secondary school for boys in Manhattan. During his time at Clinton, he wrote or co-authored 30 textbooks for college and high school biology courses, including \"Civic Biology\" in 1905. By working with educators at Columbia University's Teachers College and the geneticist, Thomas Hunt Morgan, Hunter developed \"Civic Biology\", a textbook that shaped the modern secondary-school biology curriculum.\n\n In the first edition of \"Civic Biology\", Hunter briefly discusses eugenics on one page of the 432 page textbook. Along with many other evolutionary biologists, Hunter embraced the idea of eugenics as a social doctrine. It was a popular idea in the early 20th century, and several states had enacted laws to compel the sexual segregation and sterilization of people deemed eugenically unfit. Hunter believed that society could perfect the human race by preventing intermarriage between people such as the mentally ill, criminals, and epileptics. Hunter also believed that the Caucasian race was the highest type of all the races.\n\n Darwin had published his evolutionary theories 60 years before the public controversy over \"Civic Biology\" with the Scopes Trial. Prior to the Scopes Trial and controversy over \"Civic Biology\", most science textbooks included Darwinian concepts in order to keep abreast with prevalent scientific ideas. In the early 20th century, there was a movement in the education sector to bring evolution into high school classrooms, in order to update and reshape how biology was taught. Once evolution began being taught in high schools, controversy over Darwin's theories developed. These efforts tried to incorporate progressive educational ideologies and apply the biological sciences to human society.\n\n\"Civic Biology\" was an example of the new approaches to scientific instruction emerging in the education sector. This modern education focused on applying scientific principles to human society by developing applicable and relevant content for students. This movement towards socially applicable biology was coupled with national efforts towards mandatory public education. Anti-evolution efforts and legislation were responding to the redesigned ideologies in the new biology curricula, and also to the centralized control and regulation of education. Concerns about public and standardized education were part of the public debate over \"Civic Biology.\"\n\n There were a variety of socio-cultural events that shaped the publication and reaction to \"Civic Biology.\" Following World War I, a cultural movement emerged that poised two ideological groups against each other: the traditionalists and the modernists. The modernists embraced intellectual experimentation by exploring new philosophies such as Freudian theories and advocated against alcohol prohibition in political spheres. In response to this modernist cultural movement, there was a religious revivalist movement to protest the emergence of these progressive ideologies. The traditionalists were distinguished by their religious zeal. This group favored alcohol prohibition laws and a literal interpretation of the Bible.\n\n The prosecution made arguments that fit the ideology of the traditionalists. The contents of \"Civic Biology\" were not specifically discussed in the trial, but rather the trial focused on the merits and problems with Darwin's theory of evolution. The Scopes Trial used \"Civic Biology\" as a tool to have a publicized and public debate on whether or not evolution should continue to be taught. \n\n The Scopes Trial and the controversy over \"Civic Biology\" was a major setback for anti-evolution groups because of the 15 states with anti-evolution legislation pending in 1925, only 2 enacted laws restricting the teaching of Darwin's evolutionary theories. While this public controversy had some political implications, it was not extensively influential in the education sector and the instruction of the biological sciences. During the 1970s, it was believed that pressure from Christian fundamentalists after the Scopes Trial forced textbook authors to limit the discussion of evolution. However, upon later examination of biology textbooks, scholars determined that textbook authors worked to develop biological curricula that differentiated and defended its content, in an attempt to reduce the influence of religious fundamentalism on the biological sciences. As a result, modern scholars now believe that overall, biology textbooks were not heavily influenced by anti-evolution rhetoric after the Scopes Trial.\n\nA revised edition of Hunter's book appeared the year after the Scopes Trial. This new edition no longer used the word \"evolution\", and removed most references to recognizably evolutionary concepts. A figure illustrating fossils of the precursors of horses in geological context and much of the associated text was eliminated. The section quoted above, \"Evolution of Man\", was renamed \"Development of Man\", and, rather than saying \"lower in mental organization\" said \"lower in civilization\" (page 250). The book did mention natural selection (page 383), homology (page 237), classification of plants and animals (Chapter XXI, pages 234â252) (including mention of \"man\" as a vertebrate, a mammal, and a primate, page 250), and had a short biography of Charles Darwin among the \"Great Names in Biology\" (pages 411â412).\n\nThis new edition contained an extended discussion of eugenics (Chapter XXXII \"The Improvement of the Human Race\", pages 394â404), but the section quoted above on \"The Remedy\" removed the words \"If such people were lower animals, we would probably kill them off to prevent them from spreading. Humanity will not allow this ...\". (page 400). The supposed history of the Jukes family and the Kallikak family was advanced (pages 398â399). The section \"Parasitism and its Cost to Society\" was unchanged but for the insertion of the sentence \"It is estimated that between 25% and 50% of all prisoners in penal institutions are feeble-minded.\"\n\nThis new edition retained the section \"The Races of Man\" as written, with two changes about \"caucasians\": They were no longer described as \"the highest type of all\", and \"the Hindus and Arabs of Asia\" were included among the enumerated caucasians (page 251).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37619021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37619021", "title": "Co-development", "text": "Co-development\n\nCodevelopment is a trend of thought and a development strategy in development studies\nwhich considers migrants to be a developing factor for their countries of origin.\n\nAlthough it is widely accepted that it was French scholar Sami NaÃ¯r who first coined the word codevelopment, it is believed this phenomenon has existed alongside migrations since they exist. Traditionally, immigrants (especially those who migrate for economic reasons) have, collectively or individually, supported their communities of origin.\n\nIn 1997 Sami NaÃ¯r, while directing the Interministerial Mission on Migration/Codevelopment, defined this last concept as \"a proposal for integrating immigration and development in a way that migration fluxes will benefit both the country of origin and the country of destination. This is, a consensual relationship between two countries that will allow migration to the country of destiny not to imply an equivalent loss in the country of origin\".\n\nAdherents to this model believe that it fosters mutual collaboration among countries in a way that traditional and hierarchical north-south development focus did not.\nIn this context, immigrant initiatives enrich the countries of origin both from a cultural and a human resources perspective. Their condition as transnational citizens would allow them a better understanding of the needs of both the communities of origin and destination.\nFor this reason, their participation in projects involving members of their communities, in both âtheirâ countries would be more effective, as priorities and needs would be correctly identified.\nOn the other hand, this participation would also work as an integrating force in the destination countries, as they would be perceived as an enriching factor by the public opinion and institutions.\n\nIn countries receiving immigration, codevelopment has been implemented by the institutions in a different way. Since they were first implemented in France, codevelopment initiatives in Europe have been frequently linked to control of the migration fluxes, often promoting the return of immigrants.\n\nAt a European level, codevelopment was first mentioned during the Tampere Summit held in October 1999, when the European Council defined 5 guidelines for the new European migration policy aimed at a common space of \"\"Liberty, Security and Justice\".\"\nAnyhow, critics consider that Tampere quickly shifted towards a Fortress Europe mentality, limiting development aid to those countries willing to implement migration control measures and accepting repatriations.\n\nAn example of this tendency may be found in the imbalance between de 23 million euro budget that the EU plans on investing in the Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System (aimed at a further immigrant identification and control) with the 3 million euro budget (4 million in its second year) granted to codevelopment projects.\n\nSince the late nineties, codevelopment has been the subject of postgraduate studies, specialist courses, discussions and forums among multiple stakeholders, as well as calls for project grants by some local and regional administrations, beginning with the Municipality of Madrid. These authorities quickly became aware of the local impact of the presence of new immigrant communities, the importance of the links that bind them with their communities of origin, and the desirability of relating them in any future action to support the policies of cooperation. Codevelopment policies had a much stronger presence and development in the regional and local levels.\n\nAt the state level, in accordance with Tampere Summit on Migration, the GRECO Plan on migration management (Programa Global de RegulaciÃ³n y CoordinaciÃ³n de la ExtranjerÃ­a y la InmigraciÃ³n 2000-2004), was launched by the Interior Ministry in 2001. This Plan devoted an important space for âjoint developmentâ, in line with the policies of Tampere and the French government. GRECO insisted on technical and educational cooperation, the voluntary return of migrants, the channelling of migrantsâ remittances to development projects, and finally, on the cooperation with those governments that were ready to accept the returned illegal migrants, as well as to control the exit of their citizens with destination Spain. However, codevelopment was not even mentioned as a policy line in the Immigration law passed in 2000, and did not receive proper funding within the GRECOâs framework.\n\nSince ending 2004, codevelopment policies have been open to discussion, including the contents, limits, and plans. Two state agencies claimed their space in codevelopment actions: the State Secretary for International Cooperation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the brand new General Directorate of Immigrantsâ Integration, at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.\n\nDuring 2005 there has been progress in the search for a consensus on competences and actors. A codevelopment line was mainstreamed in the Master Plans on Development Cooperation, and two years later, also in the new Integration Plan, called Strategic Plan on Citizenship and Integration 2007-2010, which was finally implemented in 2007, by the Ministry of Labour and Migration.\n\nRegional and local authorities soon adopted this win/win approach and consequently launched several codevelopment guidelines within their Integration Plans and Development Cooperation Strategies. Ending 2009, most of the Spanish Regions (Comunidades AutÃ³nomas) had considered codevelopment and had set up budget lines both for migrants' associations and Development NGOs. Graciela Malgesini argues that codevelopment and migrants' remittances partly redirect the decentralized cooperation funds to their countries of origin.\n\nIn the last ten years, academic research on codevelopment increased, as a result of the strong immigration process experienced by the Spanish society from 2000 onwards (which represented nearly 80% of Spainâs demographic growth). Many universities decided to open up new learning courses on the matter, following the steps of the Universidad AutÃ³noma de Madrid. Several doctoral thesis are currently being carried out, focusing diverse aspects of codevelopment, including the impact of migration and remittances in the sending countries, mainly Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco. Migrants living in Spain remitted nearly EURO 10 thousands millions, in 2007 (while the overall Spanish OAD summed only half of this amount).\n\nAccording to Graciela Malgesini, spontaneous codevelopment could be defined as the win/win effect, the linkage between migration and development, which generates mostly positive impacts on both the society of origin of immigrants, and the host society. This definition presumes the role of immigrants as actors and vectors of development, in \"both sides\", and the understanding of the relations between host countries (North) and sending countries (South) in a horizontal way. Codevelopment is directly related to Transnationalism.\n\nCarlos Gimenez pinpointed other two characteristics of codevelopment: (1) The multiplicity of stakeholders (a network of participants that surpasses both quantitatively and qualitatively the traditional agents in the traditional development cooperation projects, as it includes authorities, social organizations, trade unions, universities, training institutes, businesses and immigrant associations). (2) Transnational citizenship (immigrants acting in codevelopment activities, embedded in a transnational dynamic, are also transnational citizens, to the extent that they have a dual presence. This dual space of belonging, in turn, encourages decision making, influences on the economic, political and social development, and allows the formation of a separate identity, based on two geographical areas, the country of origin and the country of destination).\n\nTransnationalism and codevelopment are spreading.In Latin America, covedelopment is a relatively new idea, but it has been embraced by grassroots organizations. For example, on November 25, 2010, FAMIGRANTESâthe Federation of associations gathering migrants' family members in South Americaâgathered in their 4th Meeting on Migration and Codevelopment, in Rosario, Argentina. They stated that the codevelopment approach was the best way of understanding the contribution that their relatives were making both in the reception countries and in their homelands (www.famigrantes.org and www.famisur.org). At the same time, more than 100 migrants' associations launched FEDACOD (Federation of Associations for Codevelopment) in Valencia, Spain, on September 24, 2010 (www.fedacod.com).\n\n\n"}

An explicit specification of a conceptualization is an ontology, and it may occur that a conceptualization can be realized by several distinct ontologies. An \"ontological commitment\" in describing ontological comparisons is taken to refer to that subset of elements of an ontology shared with all the others. \"An ontology is \"language-dependent\"\", its objects and interrelations described within the language it uses, while a conceptualization is always the same, more general, its concepts existing \"independently of the language used to describe it\". The relation between these terms is shown in the figure to the right.\n\nNot all workers in knowledge engineering use the term âconceptualizationâ, but instead refer to the conceptualization itself, or to the ontological commitment of all its realizations, as an overarching ontology.\n\nAs a higher level abstraction, a conceptualization facilitates the discussion and comparison of its various ontologies, facilitating knowledge sharing and reuse. Each ontology based upon the same overarching conceptualization maps the conceptualization into specific elements and their relationships.\n\nThe question then arises as to how to describe the 'conceptualization' in terms that can encompass multiple ontologies. This issue has been called the 'Tower of Babel' problem, that is, how can persons used to one ontology talk with others using a different ontology? This problem is easily grasped, but a general resolution is not at hand. It can be a 'bottom-up' or a 'top-down' approach, or something in between.\n\nHowever, in more artificial situations, such as information systems, the idea of a 'conceptualization' and the 'ontological commitment' of various ontologies that realize the 'conceptualization' is possible. The formation of a conceptualization and its ontologies involves these steps:\n\nAn example of moving conception into a language leading to a variety of ontologies is the expression of a process in pseudocode (a strictly structured form of ordinary language) leading to implementation in several different formal computer languages like Lisp or Fortran. The pseudocode makes it easier to understand the instructions and compare implementations, but the formal languages make possible the compilation of the ideas as computer instructions. \n\nAnother example is mathematics, where a very general formulation (the analog of a conceptualization) is illustrated with 'applications' that are more specialized examples. For instance, aspects of a function space can be illustrated using a vector space or a topological space that introduce interpretations of the 'elements' of the conceptualization and additional relationships between them but preserve the connections required in the function space. \n\n\n"}

It is a manifesto detailing how to achieve their Cradle to Cradle Design model. It calls for a radical change in industry: a switch from a cradle-to-grave pattern to a cradle-to-cradle pattern. It suggests that the \"reduce reuse recycle\" methods perpetuate this cradle-to-grave strategy, and that more changes need to be made. The book discourages downcycling, but rather encourages the manufacture of products with the goal of upcycling in mind. This vision of upcycling is based on a system of \"lifecycle development\" initiated by Braungart and colleagues at the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency in the 1990s: after products have reached the end of their useful life, they become either \"biological nutrients\" or \"technical nutrients\". Biological nutrients are materials that can re-enter the environment. Technical nutrients are materials that remain within closed-loop industrial cycles.\n\nThe book uses historical examples such as the Industrial Revolution along with commentary on science, nature, and society.\n\nWilliam McDonough and Michael Braungart met at an Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency reception in New York City. They began discussing toxicity and design. They were immediately interested in working together to create a better world for each other, and in 1991 they coauthored \"The Hannover Principles\": a set of design guidelines for the 2000 World's Fair that were issued at the 1992 World Urban Forum and United Nations forum of the Earth Summit. In 1995 they founded McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry, a firm to assist companies in implementing sustainable design protocols.\n\nThe book was published in 2002 by North Point Press. The book itself is printed using DuraBook technology. The pages are not paper, but rather synthetics created from plastic resins and inorganic fillers. The books are more durable and strong than traditional paper books, waterproof, and upcyclable. It is considered a \"technical nutrient\" in the lifecycle development system.\n\nThe book has been translated into 12 languages.\n\n\n"}

Deformable mirrors are used in combination with wavefront sensors and real-time control systems in adaptive optics. In 2006 they found a new use in femtosecond pulse shaping.\n\nThe shape of a DM can be controlled with a speed that is appropriate for compensation of dynamic aberrations present in the optical system. In practice the DM shape should be changed much faster than the process to be corrected, as the correction process, even for a static aberration, may take several iterations.\n\nA DM usually has many degrees of freedom. Typically, these degrees of freedom are associated with the mechanical actuators and it can be roughly taken that one actuator corresponds to one degree of freedom.\n\nNumber of actuators determines the number of degrees of freedom (wavefront inflections) the mirror can correct. It is very common to compare an arbitrary DM to an ideal device that can perfectly reproduce wavefront modes in the form of Zernike polynomials. For predefined statistics of aberrations a deformable mirror with M actuators can be equivalent to an ideal Zernike corrector with N (usually N < M) degrees of freedom. For correction of the atmospheric turbulence, elimination of low-order Zernike terms usually results in significant improvement of the image quality, while further correction of the higher-order terms introduces less significant improvements. For strong and rapid wavefront error fluctuations such as shocks and wake turbulence typically encountered in high-speed aerodynamic flowfields, the number of actuators, actuator pitch and stroke determine the maximum wavefront gradients that can be compensated for.\n\nActuator pitch is the distance between actuator centers. Deformable mirrors with large actuator pitch and large number of actuators are bulky and expensive.\n\nActuator stroke is the maximum possible actuator displacement, typically in positive or negative excursions from some central null position. Stroke typically ranges from Â±1 to Â±30 micrometres. Free actuator stroke limits the maximum amplitude of the corrected wavefront, while the inter-actuator stroke limits the maximum amplitude and gradients of correctable higher-order aberrations.\n\nInfluence function is the characteristic shape corresponding to the mirror response to the action of a single actuator. Different types of deformable mirrors have different influence functions, moreover the influence functions can be different for different actuators of the same mirror. Influence function that covers the whole mirror surface is called a \"modal\" function, while localized response is called \"zonal\".\n\nActuator coupling shows how much the movement of one actuator will displace its neighbors. All \"modal\" mirrors have large cross-coupling, which in fact is good as it secures the high quality of correction of smooth low-order optical aberrations that usually have the highest statistical weight.\n\nResponse time shows how quickly the mirror will react to the control signal. Can vary from microseconds (MEMS and magnetics mirrors) to tens of seconds for thermally controlled DM's.\n\nHysteresis and creep are nonlinear actuation effects that decrease the precision of the response of the deformable mirror. For different concepts, the hysteresis can vary from zero (electrostatically-actuated mirrors) to tens of percent for mirrors with piezoelectric actuators. Hysteresis is a residual positional error from previous actuator position commands, and limits the mirror ability to work in a feedforward mode, outside of a feedback loop.\n\nSegmented concept mirrors are formed by independent flat mirror segments. Each segment can move a small distance back and forth to approximate the average value of the wavefront over the patch area. Advantageously, these mirrors have little or zero cross-talk between actuators. Stepwise approximation works poorly for smooth continuous wavefronts. Sharp edges of the segments and gaps between the segments contribute to light scattering, limiting the applications to those not sensitive to scattered light. Considerable improvement of the performance of the segmented mirror can be achieved by introduction of three degrees of freedom per segment: piston, tip and tilt. These mirrors require three times as many actuators compared to piston segmented mirrors. This concept was used for fabrication of large segmented primary mirrors for the Keck telescopes, JWST, and the future E-ELT. Numerous methods exist to accurately co-phase the segments and reduce the diffraction patterns introduced by the segment shapes and gaps. Future large space-based telescopes, such as the NASA ATLAST will also possess a segmented primary mirror. The development of robust methods to increase the contrast is key for the direct imaging and characterization of exoplanets.\n\nContinuous faceplate concept mirrors with discrete actuators are formed by the front surface of a thin deformable membrane. The shape of the plate is controlled by a number of discrete actuators that are fixed to its back side. The shape of the mirror depends on the combination of forces applied to the faceplate, boundary conditions (the way the plate is fixed to the mirror) and the geometry and the material of the plate. These mirrors allow smooth wavefront control with very large - up to several thousands - degrees of freedom.\n\nMagnetics concept mirrors are based on continuous reflective surface motioned by magnetics actuators. They feature large strokes, linearity and fast settling time.\n\nMEMS concept mirrors are fabricated using bulk and surface micromachining technologies. MEMS mirrors have a great potential to be cheap. They could break the high price threshold of conventional adaptive optics. MEMS mirrors typically have high response rates, limited hysteresis.\n\nMembrane concept mirrors are formed by a thin conductive and reflective membrane stretched over a solid flat frame. The membrane can be deformed electrostatically by applying control voltages to electrostatic electrode actuators that can be positioned under or over the membrane. If there are any electrodes positioned over the membrane, they are transparent. It is possible to operate the mirror with only one group of electrodes positioned under the mirror. In this case a bias voltage is applied to all electrodes, to make the membrane initially spherical. The membrane can move back and forth with respect to the reference sphere.\nBimorph concept mirrors are formed by two or more layers of different materials. One or more of (active) layers are fabricated from a piezoelectric or electrostrictive material. Electrode structure is patterned on the active layer to facilitate local response. The mirror is deformed when a voltage is applied to one or more of its electrodes, causing them to extend laterally, which results in local mirror curvature. Bimorph mirrors are rarely made with more than 100 electrodes.\n\nFerrofluid concept mirrors are liquid deformable mirrors made with a suspension of small (about 10Â nm in diameter) ferromagnetic nanoparticles dispersed in a liquid carrier. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the ferromagnetic particles align with the field, the liquid becomes magnetized and its surface acquires a shape governed by the equilibrium between the magnetic, gravitational and surface tension forces. Using proper magnetic field geometries, any desired shape can be produced at the surface of the ferrofluid. This new concept offers a potential alternative for low-cost, high stroke and large number of actuators deformable mirrors.\n\n"}

Queen Elizabeth II opened Glasgow Science Centre on 5 June 2001. It is one of Scotland's most popular paid-for visitor attractions. It is a purpose-built science centre composed of three principal buildings: Science Mall, Glasgow Tower and an IMAX cinema. The Scottish tourist board, VisitScotland, awarded Glasgow Science Centre a five star rating in the visitor attraction category. As well as its main location, Glasgow Science Centre also manages the visitor centre at Whitelee Wind Farm, which opened to the public in 2009.\n\nThe largest of the three main, titanium-clad buildings takes a crescent shape structure and houses a Science Mall. In architectural terms it represents the canted hull of a ship, a reference to the adjacent 'canting basin', where vessels were brought to have the marine growth removed from their hulls. Internally, there are three floors of over 250 science-learning exhibits. As is usual for science centres, the exhibits aim to encourage interaction, and can be used or played with as part of the informal learning experience the centre aims to deliver. The building was designed by BDP.\n\nOn Floor 1, amongst the many interactive exhibits that demonstrate scientific principles, visitors can access a Science Show Theatre and the Glasgow Science Centre Planetarium. The planetarium contains a Zeiss optical-mechanical projector that projects images of the night sky onto a 15m diameter dome. There is an area specifically aimed at young children, called The Big Explorer.\n\nOn Floor 2, visitors can explore opportunities in STEM careers in the My World of Work Live interactive exhibition space. There is also The Lab, primarily used as an educational workshop space.\n\nFloor 3 was refurbished in 2012 and reopened to the public on 28 March 2013. It now houses an interactive exhibition about human health and wellbeing in the 21st century, called BodyWorks. Visitors are invited to consider their bodies, health and lifestyle from a new perspective through 115 interactive exhibits, research capsules and live laboratory experiences.\n\nThe Ground Floor of the Science Mall contains the ticket desk, cafes, gift shop, and a cloakroom. There are a number of flexible room spaces on the Ground Floor that are used for a variety of educational and corporate purposes: an education space called The Egg; a lecture-theatre space called The Auditorium; and the Clyde Suite, a multi-purpose function space. Access to Glasgow Tower for the public is also via the Ground Floor.\n\nThe Glasgow Tower was designed to be the tallest freely-rotating tower in the world. It missed its opening date in 2001 and was plagued by problems since then. It has been closed for over 80% of its life, and was closed from August 2010 until July 2014.\n\nThe IMAX cinema was the first IMAX cinema to be built in Scotland. The single auditorium seats 370 in front of a rectangular screen measuring by and has the capability to show 3D films as well as standard 2D films in IMAX format. It opened to the public in October 2000, and premiered the first film, entitled \"Dolphins\", several months prior to the opening of the two other buildings. On 6 September 2013, Cineworld agreed a 10-year lease to operate the IMAX cinema and opened a Starbucks on site.\n\nOpened to the public in June 2001, Glasgow Science Centre is part of the ongoing redevelopment of Pacific Quay, an area which was once a cargo port known as Prince's Dock. The redevelopment started with the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988. As with the other National Garden Festivals, the Glasgow site was intended to be sold off for housing development, but due to a housing slump in 1987, the developers were unable to develop the land as they intended, and the majority of the site remained derelict for years. Parts were finally redeveloped for the Science Centre and also Pacific Quay, including new headquarters for BBC Scotland and Scottish Television, opened in 2007. The Clydesdale Bank Tower was dismantled and re-erected in Rhyl in North Wales, however its spiritual successor came in the form of the Glasgow Tower as part of Science Centre complex, which stands on approximately the same spot.\n\nThe architects of the Glasgow Science Centre were Building Design Partnership, however the Glasgow Tower was originally designed by the architect Richard Horden with engineering design by Buro Happold. It was built at a cost of around Â£75 million, including Â£10 million for the Glasgow Tower, with over Â£37 million coming from the Millennium Commission.\n\nIn June 2004, it was announced that about a fifth of the workforce were to be made redundant following the creation of a funding deal with the Scottish Executive. In June 2008, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Nicol Stephen, stated that Glasgow Science Centre was facing a 40% cut in government funding. Prime Minister Gordon Brown commented on this issue during Prime Minister's Questions saying, \"It's unfortunate in Glasgow that as a result of the SNP, funding has been cut, and they will live to regret that\". Although funding for the Scottish Science Centres as a whole has actually increased, it is now being split between four centres using a formula based on visitor numbers, and Glasgow is the only centre to face a reduction in budget. This led to the announcement in July 2008 that 28 full-time jobs were to be cut as a direct consequence of the cuts \"in order to secure Glasgow Science Centre's future\", according to the Chief Executive, Kirk Ramsay.\n\nGlasgow Science Centre is located in the Pacific Quay area, and as such, is surrounded by the media centres that form the Digital Media Quarter, a Scottish Enterprise development initiative, With the opening of the new STV headquarters in June 2006 and the beginning of broadcast programming from BBC Pacific Quay in the summer of 2004, it can be expected that more programming will be filmed in the area.\n\nIn the CBeebies television programme \"Nina and the Neurons\", the title character Nina is a neuroscientist who works at Glasgow Science Centre. In reality, Nina is played by the actress Katrina Bryan who is not a staff member at Glasgow Science Centre.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8554023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8554023", "title": "Horizontal correlation", "text": "Horizontal correlation\n\nHorizontal correlation is a methodology for gene sequence analysis. Rather than referring to one specific technique, \"horizontal correlation\" instead encompasses a variety of approaches to sequence analysis that are unified by two specific themes:\n\n\nThe core ideas of the horizontal correlation approach were first presented in a year 2000 paper by Grosse, Herzel, Buldyrev, and Stanley (Grosse, et al. 2000). In this first formulation, Grosse and colleagues sought to characterize a large genetic sequence by dividing the sequence into coding and non-coding regions. Whereas traditional approaches to the coding-vs.-non-coding problem generally relied on sophisticated pattern recognition systems that were first trained on small inputs and then run over the entire sequence (Ohler, et al. 1999), the horizontal correlation approach of Grosse and colleagues worked instead by breaking the sequence into many relatively short sequence fragments, each only 500 base pairs in length. They then sought to characterize each of these fragments as either coding or non-coding. This was accomplished by comparing each size 3 window along the length of a fragment with the first size 3 window in that fragment, then measuring the value of the mutual information function between the two windows. Coding sequences were found to display a stylized pattern of 3-periodicity that non-coding sequences did not. Such a pattern was easy to recognize, and enabled significantly more rapid, more species-independent identification of coding regions (Grosse, et al. 2000).\n\nSince 2000, horizontal correlation methodologies emphasizing the measurement of information theoretic quantities along the length of a gene sequence have been put to widespread use, and have even found application in shotgun sequencing fragment assembly (Otu & Sayood, 2004).\n\n"}

Observations recorded with iNaturalist provide valuable open data to scientific research projects, conservation agencies, other organizations, and the public. The project has been called \"a standard-bearer for natural history mobile applications.\"\n\niNaturalist.org began in 2008 as a UC Berkeley School of Information Master's final project of Nate Agrin, Jessica Kline, and Ken-ichi Ueda. Nate Agrin and Ken-ichi Ueda continued work on the site with Sean McGregor, a web developer. In 2011, Ueda began collaboration with Scott Loarie, a research fellow at Stanford University and lecturer at UC Berkeley. Ueda and Loarie are the current co-directors of iNaturalist.org. The organization merged with the California Academy of Sciences on April 24, 2014. In 2014, iNaturalist celebrated its one millionth observation. In 2017, iNaturalist became a joint initiative between the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society.\n\nThe iNaturalist platform is based on crowdsourcing of data. An iNaturalist observation records an encounter with an individual organism at a particular time and place. In addition to recording actual audio and photos of the organism, an iNaturalist observation may also record evidence of an organism, such as animal tracks, nests, and scat, but the scope of iNaturalist excludes natural but inert subjects such as geologic or hydrologic features. Users typically upload photos as evidence of their findings, though audio recordings are also accepted and such evidence is not a strict requirement. Users may share observation locations publicly, \"obscure\" them to display a less precise location, or make the locations private.\n\nOn iNaturalist, other users add identifications to each otherâs observations in order to confirm or improve the \"community identification.\" Observations are classified as \"casual,\" \"needs ID\" (needs identification), or \"research grade\" based on the quality of the data provided and the community identification process. \"Research grade\" observations are incorporated into other online databases such as The Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Users have the option to license their observations, photos, and audio recordings in several ways, including for the public domain, Creative Commons, or with all rights reserved. \nIn addition to observations being identified by others in the community, iNaturalist includes an automated species identification computer vision tool, called \"Computer Vision.\" Images can be identified via an artificial intelligence model which has been trained on the large database of the \"research grade\" observations on iNaturalist. A broader taxon such as a genus or family is typically provided if the model cannot decide what the species is. If the image has poor lighting, is blurry, or contains multiple subjects, it can be difficult for the model to determine the species and it may decide incorrectly. Multiple species suggestions are typically provided, with the one the software believes the image is most likely of at the top of the list.\n\n, iNaturalist users contributed over 15,900,000 observations of plants, animals, and other organisms worldwide, with over 88,000 users active in the previous 30 days. iNaturalist is the preferred application for crowd-sourced biodiversity data in Mexico and southern Africa.\n\nUsers have created and contributed to thousands of different projects on iNaturalist. The platform is commonly used to record observations during bioblitzes, which are biological surveying events that attempt to record all the species that occur within a designated area, and a specific project type on iNaturalist. Other project types include collections of observations by location or taxon, or documenting specific types of observations such as animal tracks and signs, the spread of invasive species, roadkill, fishing catches, or discovering new species. In 2011, iNaturalist was used as a platform to power the Global Amphibian and Global Reptile BioBlitzes, in which observations were used to help monitor the occurrence and distribution of the world's reptiles and amphibian species. The US National Park Service partnered with iNaturalist to record observations from the 2016 National Parks BioBlitz. That project exceeded 100,000 observations in August 2016. In 2017, the United Nations Environment Programme teamed up with iNaturalist to celebrate World Environment Day.\n\nThe City Nature Challenge\n\nIn 2016, Lila Higgins from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and Alison Young from the California Academy of Sciences co-founded the City Nature Challenge. In the first City Nature Challenge, naturalists in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area documented over 20,000 observations with the iNaturalist platform. In 2017, the challenge expanded to 16 cities across the United States and collected over 125,000 observations of wildlife in 5 days. \n\nIn 2018, the challenge expanded to a global audience, with 68 cities participating from 19 countries, with some cities using community science platforms other than iNaturalist to participate. In 4 days, over 17,000 people cataloged over 440,000 nature observations in urban regions around the world.\n\nSeek for kids/families\n\nIn spring of 2018, iNaturalist introduced Seek by iNaturalist for iOS mobile devices to help children and families learn about nearby nature, try to match a target species, and earn badges for observations. Billed as \"kid-safe\" and \"family-friendly,\" no registration is required and it collects no user data, meaning observations are not submitted to the iNaturalist database. An Android version is being considered.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9586885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9586885", "title": "Information seeking", "text": "Information seeking\n\nInformation seeking is the process or activity of attempting to obtain information in both human and technological contexts. Information seeking is related to, but different from, information retrieval (IR).\n\nTraditionally, IR tools have been designed for IR professionals to enable them to effectively and efficiently retrieve information from a source. It is assumed that the information exists in the source and that a well-formed query will retrieve it (and nothing else). It has been argued that laypersons' information seeking on the internet is very different from information retrieval as performed within the IR discourse. Yet, internet search engines are built on IR principles. Since the late 1990s a body of research on how casual users interact with internet search engines has been forming, but the topic is far from fully understood. IR can be said to be technology-oriented, focusing on algorithms and issues such as precision and recall. Information seeking may be understood as a more human-oriented and open-ended process than information retrieval. In information seeking, one does not know whether there exists an answer to one's query, so the process of seeking may provide the learning required to satisfy one's information need.\n\nMuch library and information science (LIS) research has focused on the information-seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work. Studies have been carried out into the information-seeking behaviors of librarians, academics, medical professionals, engineers, lawyers and mini-publics(among others). Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals' information seeking. The authors proposed an analytic model of professionals' information seeking behaviour, intended to be generalizable across the professions, thus providing a platform for future research in the area. The model was intended to \"prompt new insights... and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking\" (1996, p.Â 188). The model has been adapted by Wilkinson (2001) who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers.\n\nA variety of theories of information behavior â e.g. Zipf's Principle of Least Effort, Brenda Dervin's Sense Making, Elfreda Chatman's Life in the Round â seek to understand the processes that surround information seeking. In addition, many theories from other disciplines have been applied in investigating an aspect or whole process of information seeking behavior. \n\nA review of the literature on information seeking behavior shows that information seeking has generally been accepted as dynamic and non-linear (Foster, 2005; Kuhlthau 2006). People experience the information search process as an interplay of thoughts, feelings and actions (Kuhlthau, 2006). Donald O. Case (2007) also wrote a good book that is a review of the literature.\n\nInformation seeking has been found to be linked to a variety of interpersonal communication behaviors beyond question-asking, to include strategies such as candidate answers.\n\nRobinsonâs (2010) research suggests that when seeking information at work, people rely on both other people and information repositories (e.g., documents and databases), and spend similar amounts of time consulting each (7.8% and 6.4% of work time, respectively; 14.2% in total). However, the distribution of time among the constituent information seeking stages differs depending on the source. When consulting other people, people spend less time locating the information source and information within that source, similar time understanding the information, and more time problem solving and decision making, than when consulting information repositories. Furthermore, the research found that people spend substantially more time receiving information passively (i.e., information that they have not requested) than actively (i.e., information that they have requested), and this pattern is also reflected when they provide others with information.\n\nThe concepts of information seeking, information retrieval, and information behaviour are objects of investigation of information science. Within this scientific discipline a variety of studies has been undertaken analyzing the interaction of an individual with information sources in case of a specific information need, task, and context. The research models developed in these studies vary in their level of scope. Wilson (1999) therefore developed a nested model of conceptual areas, which visualizes the interrelation of the here mentioned central concepts.\n\nWilson defines models of information behavior to be \"statements, often in the form of diagrams, that attempt to describe an information-seeking activity, the causes and consequences of that activity, or the relationships among stages in information-seeking behaviour\" (1999: 250).\n\n\n"}

It is hoped that a better understanding of this dynamic will mitigate its effects on communications, GPS signals, and technology in general. It is part of NASA Explorers program and will be operated by UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory.\n\nOn 12 April 2013, NASA announced that \"ICON\", along with Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (\"GOLD\"), had been selected for development with the cost capped at , excluding launch costs. The principal investigator of \"ICON\" is Thomas Immel at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\"ICON\" was originally scheduled to launch in December 2017 and has been repeatedly delayed because of problems with its Pegasus XL rocket. Most recently, it was due to launch on 26 October 2018 but the launch was postponed to 7 November 2018. \n\nOnce launched, \"ICON\" will perform a two-year mission to observe conditions in both the thermosphere and ionosphere. \"ICON\" will be equipped with four instruments: a Michelson interferometer, built by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, will measure the winds and temperatures in the thermosphere; an ion drift meter, built by UT Dallas, will measure the motion of charged particles in the ionosphere; and two ultraviolet imagers built at UC Berkeley will observe the airglow layers in the upper atmosphere in order to determine both ionospheric and thermospheric density and composition.\n\nMany low-Earth orbiting satellites, including the International Space Station, fly through the ionosphere and can be affected by its changing electric and magnetic fields. The ionosphere also acts as a conduit for many communications signals, such as radio waves and the signals that make GPS systems work. The ionosphere is where space weather manifests, creating unpredicted conditions such as electric currents that can cause electrical charging of satellites, changing density that can affect satellite orbits, and shifting magnetic fields that can induce current in power systems, causing strain, disrupt communications and navigation or even blackouts. Improved understanding of this environment can help predict such events and improve satellite design.\n\n\"ICON\" was originally scheduled to launch in December 2017 and has been repeatedly delayed because of problems with its Pegasus XL rocket. Most recently, it was due to launch on 26 October 2018 but the launch was postponed indefinitely at that time. In 2017, ICON was going to be launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific. When that was launch was scrubbed, it was possible it to ferry the launch vehicle using the air-launch aircraft \"Stargazer\" back the United States where a new launch site was chosen, Cape Canaveral in Florida. The October 2018 launch was to be from Cape Canaveral, Florida before issues were detected with some new components. Whereas the delay in 2017 had to due concerns over the rocket-aircraft separation system;the launch system has a good track record launching small science payloads for NASA, and just had a successful launched in December 2016. The launch system has placed more than 80 satellites in low orbit since its first in 1990.\n\nLaunch windows:\n\nNorthrop Grumman's Pegasus XL rocket is carried aloft by the \"Stargazer\" aircraft to approximately 40,000 feet over the open ocean, where it is released and free-falls five seconds before igniting its first-stage rocket motor. The aircraft can also ferry the launch vehicle to different sites.\n\n\"ICON\" carries four scientific instruments designed to image even the faintest plasma or airglow to build up a picture of the ionosphere's density, composition and structure. The complete instrument payload has a mass of and are listed below: \n\n\nMIGHTI was developed at the United States Naval Research Laboratory, IVM at the University of Texas, and EUV and FUV were developed at the University of California. MIGHTI measures wind speed and temperature between 90 to 300 km in altitude. The velocity measurements are gathered by observing the doppler shift in the red and green lines of atomic oxygen. This is done with the Doppler Asymmetric Spatial Heterodyne (DASH) which uses Ã©chelle gratings. The temperature measurements are done by photometeric observations with a CCD. MIGHTI is designed to detect wind speeds as low as 10 mph even though the spacecraft would be traveling at over 14,000 mph (to stay in orbit).\n\nIVM collects \"in situ\" data about ions in the local environment around the spacecraft, whereas EUV and FUV are cameras. EUV is designed to observe height and density of the daytime ionosphere, and detect the glow of oxygen.\n\nThe solar panels produce 780 watts, but the instruments' power consumption ranges between 209-265 watts when in science mode.\n\n"}

{"id": "17553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17553", "title": "Kepler's laws of planetary motion", "text": "Kepler's laws of planetary motion\n\nIn astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.\n\nMost planetary orbits are nearly circular, and careful observation and calculation are required in order to establish that they are not perfectly circular. Calculations of the orbit of Mars, whose published values are somewhat suspect, indicated an elliptical orbit. From this, Johannes Kepler inferred that other bodies in the Solar System, including those farther away from the Sun, also have elliptical orbits.\n\nKepler's work (published between 1609 and 1619) improved the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus, explaining how the planets' speeds varied, and using elliptical orbits rather than circular orbits with epicycles.\n\nIsaac Newton showed in 1687 that relationships like Kepler's would apply in the Solar System to a good approximation, as a consequence of his own laws of motion and law of universal gravitation.\n\nKepler's laws improved the model of Copernicus. If the eccentricities of the planetary orbits are taken as zero, then Kepler basically agreed with Copernicus:\n\nThe eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are small, so the foregoing rules give fair approximations of planetary motion, but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than does the model proposed by Copernicus.\n\nKepler's corrections are not at all obvious:\n\nThe eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September equinox, around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the Sun parallel to the equator of the Earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately\n\nwhich is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see Earth's orbit).\n\nThe calculation is correct when perihelion, the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a solstice. The current perihelion, near January 3, is fairly close to the solstice of December 21 or 22.\n\nIt took nearly two centuries for the current formulation of Kepler's work to take on its settled form. Voltaire's \"ElÃ©ments de la philosophie de Newton\" (Elements of Newton's Philosophy) of 1738 was the first publication to use the terminology of \"laws\". The \"Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers\" in its article on Kepler (p.Â 620) states that the terminology of scientific laws for these discoveries was current at least from the time of Joseph de Lalande. It was the exposition of Robert Small, in \"An account of the astronomical discoveries of Kepler\" (1814) that made up the set of three laws, by adding in the third. Small also claimed, against the history, that these were empirical laws, based on inductive reasoning.\n\nFurther, the current usage of \"Kepler's Second Law\" is something of a misnomer. Kepler had two versions, related in a qualitative sense: the \"distance law\" and the \"area law\". The \"area law\" is what became the Second Law in the set of three; but Kepler did himself not privilege it in that way.\n\nJohannes Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe. Kepler's third law was published in 1619. Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the solar system, which called for circular orbits, but he could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbitâMars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercury. His first law reflected this discovery.\n\nKepler in 1621 and Godefroy Wendelin in 1643 noted that Kepler's third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter. The second law, in the \"area law\" form, was contested by Nicolaus Mercator in a book from 1664, but by 1670 his \"Philosophical Transactions\" were in its favour. As the century proceeded it became more widely accepted. The reception in Germany changed noticeably between 1688, the year in which Newton's \"Principia\" was published and was taken to be basically Copernican, and 1690, by which time work of Gottfried Leibniz on Kepler had been published.\n\nNewton was credited with understanding that the second law is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation, being a consequence just of the radial nature of that law; while the other laws do depend on the inverse square form of the attraction. Carl Runge and Wilhelm Lenz much later identified a symmetry principle in the phase space of planetary motion (the orthogonal group O(4) acting) which accounts for the first and third laws in the case of Newtonian gravitation, as conservation of angular momentum does via rotational symmetry for the second law.\n\nThe mathematical model of the kinematics of a planet subject to the laws allows a large range of further calculations.\n\nMathematically, an ellipse can be represented by the formula:\n\nwhere formula_3 is the semi-latus rectum, \"Îµ\" is the eccentricity of the ellipse, \"r\" is the distance from the Sun to the planet, and \"Î¸\" is the angle to the planet's current position from its closest approach, as seen from the Sun. So (\"r\",Â \"Î¸\") are polar coordinates.\n\nFor an ellipse 0Â <Â \"Îµ\"Â <Â 1 ; in the limiting case \"Îµ\" = 0, the orbit is a circle with the sun at the centre (i.e. where there is zero eccentricity).\n\nAt \"Î¸\" = 0Â°, perihelion, the distance is minimum\n\nAt \"Î¸\" = 90Â° and at \"Î¸\" = 270Â° the distance is equal to formula_3.\n\nAt \"Î¸\" = 180Â°, aphelion, the distance is maximum (by definition, aphelion is â invariably â perihelion plus 180Â°)\n\nThe semi-major axis \"a\" is the arithmetic mean between \"r\" and \"r\":\n\nThe semi-minor axis \"b\" is the geometric mean between \"r\" and \"r\":\n\nThe semi-latus rectum \"p\" is the harmonic mean between \"r\" and \"r\":\n\nThe eccentricity \"Îµ\" is the coefficient of variation between \"r\" and \"r\":\n\nThe area of the ellipse is\n\nThe special case of a circle is \"Îµ\" = 0, resulting in \"r\" = \"p\" = \"r\" = \"r\" = \"a\" = \"b\" and \"A\" = \"Ïr\".\n\nThe orbital radius and angular velocity of the planet in the elliptical orbit will vary. This is shown in the animation: the planet travels faster when closer to the sun, then slower when farther from the sun. Kepler's second law states that the blue sector has constant area.\n\nIn a small time formula_12 the planet sweeps out a small triangle having base line formula_13 and height formula_14 and area formula_15 and so the constant areal velocity is formula_16\n\nThe area enclosed by the elliptical orbit is formula_17 So the period formula_18 satisfies\n\nand the mean motion of the planet around the Sun\n\nsatisfies\n\nThis captures the relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their orbital periods.\n\nKepler enunciated in 1619 this third law in a laborious attempt to determine what he viewed as the \"music of the spheres\" according to precise laws, and express it in terms of musical notation.\nSo it was known as the \"harmonic law\".\n\nUsing Newton's Law of gravitation (published 1687), this relation can be found in the case of a circular orbit by setting the centripetal force equal to the gravitational force:\n\nThen, expressing the angular velocity in terms of the orbital period and then rearranging, we find Kepler's Third Law:\n\nA more detailed derivation can be done with general elliptical orbits, instead of circles, as well as orbiting the center of mass, instead of just the large mass. This results in replacing a circular radius, formula_24, with the elliptical semi-major axis, formula_25, as well as replacing the large mass formula_26 with formula_27. However, with planet masses being so much smaller than the sun, this correction is often ignored. The full corresponding formula is:\n\nwhere formula_26 is the mass of the sun, formula_30 is the mass of the planet, and formula_31 is the gravitational constant, formula_32 is the orbital period and formula_25 is the elliptical semi-major axis.\n\nThe following table shows the data used by Kepler to empirically derive his law: \nUpon finding this pattern Kepler wrote:\n\nFor comparison, here are modern estimates:\nIsaac Newton computed in his \"PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second law.\n\nThis implies that the Sun may be the physical cause of the acceleration of planets. However, Newton states in his Principia that he considers forces from a mathematical point of view, not a physical, thereby taking an instrumentalist view. Moreover, he does not assign a cause to gravity.\n\nNewton defined the force acting on a planet to be the product of its mass and the acceleration (see Newton's laws of motion). So:\n\nThe Sun plays an unsymmetrical part, which is unjustified. So he assumed, in Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\nAs the planets have small masses compared to that of the Sun, the orbits conform approximately to Kepler's laws. Newton's model improves upon Kepler's model, and fits actual observations more accurately (see two-body problem).\n\nBelow comes the detailed calculation of the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second laws.\n\nFrom the heliocentric point of view consider the vector to the planet formula_34 where formula_35 is the distance to the planet and formula_36 is a unit vector pointing towards the planet. \n\nwhere formula_38 is the unit vector whose direction is 90 degrees counterclockwise of formula_36, and formula_40 is the polar angle, and where a dot on top of the variable signifies differentiation with respect to time.\n\nDifferentiate the position vector twice to obtain the velocity vector and the acceleration vector:\n\nSo\n\nwhere the radial acceleration is\n\nand the transversal acceleration is\n\nKepler's second law says that\n\nis constant.\n\nThe transversal acceleration formula_46 is zero:\n\nSo the acceleration of a planet obeying Kepler's second law is directed towards the sun.\n\nThe radial acceleration formula_48 is\n\nKepler's first law states that the orbit is described by the equation:\n\nDifferentiating with respect to time\n\nor\n\nDifferentiating once more\n\nThe radial acceleration formula_48 satisfies\n\nSubstituting the equation of the ellipse gives\n\nThe relation formula_57 gives the simple final result\n\nThis means that the acceleration vector formula_59 of any planet obeying Kepler's first and second law satisfies the inverse square law\n\nwhere\n\nis a constant, and formula_36 is the unit vector pointing from the Sun towards the planet, and formula_13 is the distance between the planet and the Sun.\n\nAccording to Kepler's third law, formula_64 has the same value for all the planets. So the inverse square law for planetary accelerations applies throughout the entire solar system.\n\nThe inverse square law is a differential equation. The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a hyperbola or parabola or a straight line. See Kepler orbit.\n\nBy Newton's second law, the gravitational force that acts on the planet is:\n\nwhere formula_66 is the mass of the planet and formula_64 has the same value for all planets in the solar system. According to Newton's third Law, the Sun is attracted to the planet by a force of the same magnitude. Since the force is proportional to the mass of the planet, under the symmetric consideration, it should also be proportional to the mass of the Sun, formula_68. So\n\nwhere formula_31 is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe acceleration of solar system body number \"i\" is, according to Newton's laws:\n\nwhere formula_72 is the mass of body \"j\", formula_73 is the distance between body \"i\" and body \"j\", formula_74 is the unit vector from body \"i\" towards body \"j\", and the vector summation is over all bodies in the world, besides \"i\" itself.\n\nIn the special case where there are only two bodies in the world, Earth and Sun, the acceleration becomes\n\nwhich is the acceleration of the Kepler motion. So this Earth moves around the Sun according to Kepler's laws.\n\nIf the two bodies in the world are Moon and Earth the acceleration of the Moon becomes\n\nSo in this approximation the Moon moves around the Earth according to Kepler's laws.\n\nIn the three-body case the accelerations are\n\nThese accelerations are not those of Kepler orbits, and the three-body problem is complicated. But Keplerian approximation is the basis for perturbation calculations. See Lunar theory.\n\nKepler used his two first laws to compute the position of a planet as a function of time. His method involves the solution of a transcendental equation called Kepler's equation.\n\nThe procedure for calculating the heliocentric polar coordinates (\"r\",\"Î¸\") of a planet as a function of the time \"t\" since perihelion, is the following four steps:\n\n\nThe Cartesian velocity vector can along be trivially calculated as formula_82.\n\nThe important special case of circular orbit, \"Îµ\"Â =Â 0, gives \"Î¸\"Â =Â \"E\"Â =Â \"M\". Because the uniform circular motion was considered to be \"normal\", a deviation from this motion was considered an anomaly.\n\nThe proof of this procedure is shown below.\n\nThe Keplerian problem assumes an elliptical orbit and the four points:\nand\n\nThe problem is to compute the polar coordinates (\"r\",\"Î¸\") of the planet from the time since perihelion,Â \"t\".\n\nIt is solved in steps. Kepler considered the circle with the major axis as a diameter, and\n\nThe sector areas are related by formula_91\n\nThe circular sector area formula_92\n\nThe area swept since perihelion, \n\nis by Kepler's second law proportional to time since perihelion. So the mean anomaly, \"M\", is proportional to time since perihelion, \"t\".\n\nwhere \"n\" is the mean motion.\n\nWhen the mean anomaly \"M\" is computed, the goal is to compute the true anomaly \"Î¸\". The function \"Î¸\"Â =Â \"f\"(\"M\") is, however, not elementary. Kepler's solution is to use\nas an intermediate variable, and first compute \"E\" as a function of \"M\" by solving Kepler's equation below, and then compute the true anomaly \"Î¸\" from the eccentric anomaly \"E\". Here are the details.\n\nDivision by \"a\"/2 gives Kepler's equation\n\nThis equation gives \"M\" as a function of \"E\". Determining \"E\" for a given \"M\" is the inverse problem.

{"id": "8865843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8865843", "title": "Loop modeling", "text": "Loop modeling\n\nLoop modeling is a problem in protein structure prediction requiring the prediction of the conformations of loop regions in proteins with or without the use of a structural template. Computer programs that solve these problems have been used to research a broad range of scientific topics from ADP to breast cancer. Because protein function is determined by its shape and the physiochemical properties of its exposed surface, it is important to create an accurate model for protein/ligand interaction studies. The problem arises often in homology modeling, where the tertiary structure of an amino acid sequence is predicted based on a sequence alignment to a \"template\", or a second sequence whose structure is known. Because loops have highly variable sequences even within a given structural motif or protein fold, they often correspond to unaligned regions in sequence alignments; they also tend to be located at the solvent-exposed surface of globular proteins and thus are more conformationally flexible. Consequently, they often cannot be modeled using standard homology modeling techniques. More constrained versions of loop modeling are also used in the data fitting stages of solving a protein structure by X-ray crystallography, because loops can correspond to regions of low electron density and are therefore difficult to resolve.\n\nRegions of a structural model that are predicted by non-template-based loop modeling tend to be much less accurate than regions that are predicted using template-based techniques. The extent of the inaccuracy increases with the number of amino acids in the loop. The loop amino acids' side chains dihedral angles are often approximated from a rotamer library, but can worsen the inaccuracy of side chain packing in the overall model. Andrej Sali's homology modeling suite MODELLER includes a facility explicitly designed for loop modeling by a satisfaction of spatial restraints method. All methods require an upload of the PDB file and some require the specification of the loop location.\n\nIn general, the most accurate predictions are for loops of fewer than 8 amino acids. Extremely short loops of three residues can be determined from geometry alone, provided that the bond lengths and bond angles are specified. Slightly longer loops are often determined from a \"spare parts\" approach, in which loops of similar length are taken from known crystal structures and adapted to the geometry of the flanking segments. In some methods, the bond lengths and angles of the loop region are allowed to vary, in order to obtain a better fit; in other cases, the constraints of the flanking segments may be varied to find more \"protein-like\" loop conformations. The accuracy of such short loops may be almost as accurate as that of the homology model upon which it is based. It should also be considered that the loops in proteins may not be well-structured and therefore have no one conformation that could be predicted; NMR experiments indicate that solvent-exposed loops are \"floppy\" and adopt many conformations, while the loop conformations seen by X-ray crystallography may merely reflect crystal packing interactions, or the stabilizing influence of crystallization co-solvents.\n\nAs mentioned above homology-based methods use a database to align the target protein gap with a known template protein. A database of known structures is searched for a loop that fits the gap of interest by similarity of sequence and stems (the edges of the gap created by the unknown loop structure). The success of this method largely depends on the quality of that alignment. Since the loop is the least conserved portion of a proteinâs structure, the homology-based method cannot always find a known template that aligns with the target sequence. Fortunately, the template databases are always adding new templates so the problem of not being able to find an alignment is becoming less of an issue. Some programs that use this method are SuperLooper and FREAD.\n\nOtherwise known as an \"ab initio\" method, non-template based approaches use a statistical model to fill in the gaps created by the unknown loop structure. Some of these programs include MODELLER, Loopy, and RAPPER; but each of these programs approaches the problem in a different manner. For example, Loopy uses samples of torsion angle pairs to generate the initial loop structure then it revises this structure to maintain a realistic shape and closure, while RAPPER builds from one end of the gap to the other by extending the stem with different sampled angles until the gap is closed. Yet another method is the âdivide and conquerâ approach. This involves subdividing the loop into 2 segments and then repeatedly dividing and transforming each segment until the loop is small enough to be solved. Even with all these methods non-template based approaches are most accurate up to 12 residues (amino acids within the loop).\n\nThere are three problems that arise when using a non-template based technique. First, there are constraints that limit the possibilities for local region modeling. One such constraint is that loop termini are required to end at the correct anchor position. Also, the Ramachandran space cannot contain a backbone of dihedral angles. Second, a modeling program has to use a set procedure. Some programs use the âspare partsâ approach as mentioned above. Other programs use a \"de novo\" approach that samples sterically feasible loop conformations and selects the best one. Third, determining the best model means that a scoring method must be created to compare the various conformations.\n\n\n"}

With 1,200 Principal Investigators and over 4,000 Postdoctoral Fellows conducting basic, translational, and clinical research, the NIH Intramural Research Program is the largest biomedical research institution on earth. The unique funding environment of the IRP facilitates opportunities to conduct both long-term and high-impact science that would otherwise be difficult to undertake. With rigorous external reviews ensuring that only the most outstanding research secures funding, the IRP is responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery of fluoride to prevent tooth decay, the use of lithium to manage bipolar disorder, and the creation of vaccines against hepatitis, Hemophilus influenzae (HIB), and human papillomavirus (HPV). In addition, the IRP has also produced or trained 21 Nobel Prize-winning scientists.\n\nWithin the framework of the NIH mandate, the Intramural Research Programâs mission is to:\n\nThe NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP) traces its roots to 1887, when a one-room laboratory on Staten Island was created within the Marine Hospital Service, a predecessor agency to the U.S. Public Health Service. This laboratory evolved into the Hygienic Laboratory, which moved to Washington, D.C., in 1891 and, with the Ransdell Act of 1930, became the National Institute of Health. Several of the IRPâs initial Institutes were established over the next two decades and, after World War II, Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, outlined a program for postwar scientific research that affirmed the contributions of \"remote and unexpected fields of medicine and the underlying sciences\" in the progress against disease and the benefits of cooperative endeavors with industry and academia. \nThe disease orientation and categorical structure of the IRP had its genesis in the establishment of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1944. In 1948, Congress passed the National Heart Act, which created the National Heart Institute, and soon after established institutes for research on mental health, oral diseases, neurological problems, and blindness. Today, the IRP consists of individual programs housed in 23 of the NIH Institutes and Centers, creating a network of multi-disciplinary, federally funded laboratories with an emphasis on translational research. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, the worldâs largest clinical research hospital, is designed to foster smooth transitions between laboratory work, patient studies, and bedside cures, facilitating the translation of laboratory findings to new approaches for the prevention and cure of human diseases.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) is composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, most of which include research programs led by a Scientific Director and conducted by federal researchers and their trainees at one of several NIH campus locations. Collectively, these research programs encompass the Intramural Research Program (IRP). The IRP includes the United States National Library of Medicine, an international resource for researchers, and the NIH Clinical Center, the worldâs largest clinical research hospital.\n\nIntramural researchers are affiliated with individual Laboratories, Branches or Centers, which are typically organized around common thematic research goals and approaches, much like a department or center at an academic institution. Within these larger structures, Principal Investigators run Sections or Units devoted to their independent research goals. Core facilities, supported by staff scientists and clinicians, are among the shared resources available to IRP researchers.\n\nScientific interests are not bound by the organizational structure. There exists a full spectrum of scientific interest groups (called SIGs) that brings researchers from different Institutes and Centers together around common areas of scientific interest where ideas can be shared and collaborations initiated. In addition, institutes come together to work cooperatively on major initiatives focused on unraveling the complexities of disease. The Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation (CHI) is one example of this trans-NIH cooperative research approach. \n\nAs with all biomedical research, the scientific programs of the IRPâs 1,200 Principal Investigators are subject to periodic scientific review. Each Principal Investigator must be peer-reviewed at least once every four years by an external Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC). The BSC evaluates the quality of research, the resources that should be allocated to scientists, and the promise of tenure-track investigators for future success in their careers. These evaluations are based on the Principal Investigatorâs past accomplishments, objectives met, and future plans. The review criteria mirror those used by extramural peer review with the addition of considering whether the investigator is taking advantage of the special features of the NIH intramural scientific environment and employing useful collaborative arrangements. As a result of these reviews, recommendations for altering allocated resources are prepared by the BSC for the Scientific Director, the Institute or Center Director, the NIH Deputy Director for Intramural Research, and the Institute or Center (IC) National Advisory Council or Board.\n\nAdditionally, each IRP as a whole is subject to periodic review by Blue Ribbon Panels. These panels, made up of expert external reviewers appointed by the NIH Director, ensure that the programâs overall objectives are current, relevant, distinctive, and appropriate to the unique research environment of the IRP. Blue Ribbon Panel reports are addressed to the NIH Director, the Advisory Committee of the Director, and the IC Director. \n\nIn addition to the external NIH Boards of Scientific Counselors and Blue Ribbon Panels, the NIH IRP receives regular and periodic independent evaluations by the following external bodies:\n\nMichael M. Gottesman, M.D. is the Deputy Director for Intramural Research and heads the Office of Intramural Research (OIR). In this role, he is responsible for oversight and coordination of all intramural research, training and technology transfer activities.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, the worldâs largest hospital entirely devoted to clinical research, is a national resource that enables the rapid translation of scientific observations and laboratory discoveries into new approaches for diagnosing, treating and preventing disease. Due to its position on the main campus in Bethesda, Maryland, the Institutes and Centers of the IRP are able to mobilize clinical resources quickly and effectively to respond to emerging scientific challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe NIH Clinical Center is the 2011 recipient of the Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award, given by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation. This award honors the Clinical Center for serving as a model institution that has, since 1953, transformed scientific advances into innovative therapies and provided high-quality care to patients and recognizes the Clinical Centerâs rich history of medical discovery through clinical research.\n\nAt the NIH Clinical Center, clinical research participantsâmore than 480,000 since the hospital opened in 1953âare active partners in medical discovery. This partnership has resulted in a long list of medical milestones, including the development of chemotherapy; the first use of an immunotoxin to treat a malignancy; identification of the genes that cause kidney cancer, leading to the development of six new, targeted treatments for advanced kidney cancer; the discovery that lithium helps depression; the first gene therapy; the first AIDS treatment; and the development of tests to detect AIDS/HIV and hepatitis viruses in blood, which led to a safer blood supply. The NIH Clinical Center sees 10,000 new research participants a year from around the world.\n\n"}

According to Boeke, \"These three aspects are interdependent and in this connection typify a society, in this way that a prevailing social spirit and the prevailing forms of organisation and of technique give the society its style, its appearance, so that in their interrelation they may be called the social system, the social style or the social atmosphere of that society \".\n\nAccording to Boeke, it is not necessary that a society be dominated exclusively by one social system. If one social system does prevail, the society in question is a homogeneous society. When, on the contrary two (or more) social systems appear simultaneously, we have a dual society.\nBoeke qualifies the term dual society by using it only for societies \"showing a distinct cleavage of two synchronic and full grown social styles which in the normal, historical evolution of homogeneous societies are separated from each other by transitional forms, as for instance, pre-capitalism and high capitalism by early capitalism.\"\n\nThis qualification is necessary because every society going through the process of evolution or endogenic social progression shows besides the prevailing social systems, the remains of the preceding and the beginnings of its future social style. If, on the other hand, one social system is imported from abroad and this system fails to oust or assimilate the prevailing social system, a dual society obviously exists.\n\nOn this account Boeke defines a dual society as a society where \"one of the two prevailing social systems, as a matter of fact always the most advanced, will have been imported from abroad and have gained its existence in the new environment without being able to oust or assimilate the divergent social system that has grown up there, with the result that neither of them becomes general and characteristic for that society as a whole.\"\n\nThe first characteristic of dualistic economies pointed out by Boeke is the relatively greater importance of social needs as compared to western economies. Boeke states, \"Possessions in the share of cattle, land, clothes, and houses, the fulfilment of social duties in all the circumstances of likr, must be all regarded as largely the satisfaction of social needs. It is not their economic usefulness, not the individual services they render their possessor which determine the value of the goods. It is a matter of secondary importance whether the land produces reasonable profit in proportion to the money paid for it whether the cattle can be made reasonably useful to their owner in his own business,whether the clothing covers, protects,warms the wearer or affects him pleasantly in any way. For it is not the use of these objects to the subject himself that gives them their worth in his eyes; it is what the community thinks of them that sets the standard.\n\nThe social dualism theory has been criticised by Benjamin Higgins on the following grounds:\nHiggins argues that the main issue in dualistic economies is to provide employment opportunities and Boeke's theory fails to do it and has developed the theory of Technological dualism as a response.\n\n\n\n"}

The Thue-Morse sequence is an example of a cube-free word over a binary alphabet. This sequence is not square-free but is \"almost\" so: the critical exponent is 2. The ThueâMorse sequence has no overlap or \"overlapping square\", instances of 0\"X\"0\"X\"0 or 1\"X\"1\"X\"1: it is essentially the only infinite binary word with this property. Dejean's theorem characterizes the minimum possible critical exponents for each alphabet size.\n\nThe Thue number of a graph \"G\" is the smallest number \"k\" such that \"G\" has a \"k\"-coloring for which the sequence of colors along every simple path is squarefree.\n\nThe Kolakoski sequence is an example of a cube-free sequence.\n\nAn abelian \"p\"-th power is a subsequence of the form formula_6 where each formula_4 is a permutation of formula_1. There is no abelian-square-free infinite word over an alphabet of size three: indeed, every word of length eight over such an alphabet contains an abelian square. There is an infinite abelian-square-free word over an alphabet of size five.\n\n"}

These are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms. For example, concept of a \"cap and trade\" has been tested and works well for some pollutants. This is a system where companies are allowed to place a \"bubble\" over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a \"stack-by-stack\" and \"pipe-by-pipe\" approach, i.e. the so-called \"command and control\" approach. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operation and maintenance (O&M) technologies for the more difficult to treat stacks and pipes. But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a life-cycle analysis, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), difficulty in treating, and feasibility. The most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat, i.e. less feasible. Of course, as with all paradigm shifts, expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective. \nHistorically, sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated. The hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these did not entirely do the job, limiting rates of production. Green engineering recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach. Green engineering attempts to achieve four goals:\n\n\nGreen engineering encompasses numerous ways to improve processes and products to make them more efficient from an environmental and sustainable standpoint. Every one of these approaches depends on viewing possible impacts in space and time. Architects consider the sense of place. Engineers view the site map as a set of fluxes across the boundary. The design must consider short and long-term impacts. Those impacts beyond the near-term are the province of sustainable design. \nThe effects may not manifest themselves for decades. In the mid-twentieth century, designers specified the use of what are now known to be hazardous building materials, such as asbestos flooring, pipe wrap and shingles, lead paint and pipes, and even structural and mechanical systems that may have increased the exposure to molds and radon. Those decisions have led to risks to people inhabiting these buildings. It is easy in retrospect to criticize these decisions, but many were made for noble reasons, such as fire prevention and durability of materials. However, it does illustrate that seemingly small impacts when viewed through the prism of time can be amplified exponentially in their effects.\nSustainable design requires a complete assessment of a design in place and time. Some impacts may not occur until centuries in the future. For example, the extent to which we decide to use nuclear power to generate electricity is a sustainable design decision. The radioactive wastes may have half-lives of hundreds of thousands of years. That is, it will take all these years for half of the radioactive isotopes to decay. Radioactive decay is the spontaneous transformation of one element into another. This occurs by irreversibly changing the number of protons in the nucleus. Thus, sustainable designs of such enterprises must consider highly uncertain futures. For example, even if we properly place warning signs about these hazardous wastes, we do not know if the English language will be understood.\nAll four goals of green engineering mentioned above are supported by a long-term, life cycle point of view. A life cycle analysis is a holistic approach to consider the entirety of a product, process or activity, encompassing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use, maintenance, recycling, and final disposal. In other words, assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the product.\nThe first step in a life cycle assessment is to gather data on the flow of a material through an identifiable society. Once the quantities of various components of such a flow are known, the important functions and impacts of each step in the production, manufacture, use, and recovery/disposal are estimated. Thus, in sustainable design, engineers must optimize for variables that give the best performance in temporal frames.\n\n\nIn 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatt hours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh. Residential sector itself uses 18% of the total energy generated and therefore, incorporating sustainable construction practices there can be significant reduction in this number. Basic Sustainable construction practices include : \n\n\n\n"}

The book follows Humboldt from his early childhood and travels through Europe as a young man to his journey through Latin America and his return to Europe. Wulf makes the case that Humboldt synthesized knowledge from many different fields to form a vision of nature as one interconnected system, that would go on to influence scientists, activists and the public.\n\nPart 1. Departure: Emerging Ideas\n\nWulf describes Humboldt's childhood with his emotionally distant mother. As a child his interests in nature and travel were not taken seriously. His mother, on whom he was financially dependent, insisted he become a civil servant. As a young man, Humboldt became friends with Goethe and other German intellectuals. His mother's death allowed him the freedom and financial independence needed to journey to the new world.\n\nPart 2 Arrival: Collecting Ideas\n\nHumboldt arrives in Cuba with his companion Bonpland and begins his journey through Central and South America. He brought with him a plethora of scientific instruments. He chronicles his travels and the measurements he obtained using scientific instruments in his journals. Humboldt climbs the Chimborazo Volcano, which was then believed to be highest mountain in the world. The trip concludes with his visit to the United States where he visited the White House to discuss science and politics with Thomas Jefferson before returning to Europe.\n\nPart 3 Return: Sorting Ideas\n\nHumboldt returns to Europe where he is greeted as a celebrity. He lives as an expat in Paris for a seven months as he finds the city and its scientific culture more stimulating than that of Berlin. While in France, he meets a young Simon Bolivar, who is impressed with Humboldt's knowledge and passion for his home country of Venezuela, and they discuss South American politics. Humboldt returns to Prussia, to earn a salary in the King's court before returning to Paris. At this point he begins to work several manuscripts based on his travels. The books are widely read. As Bolivar begins to plan and execute Revolutions in South America, Humboldt publishes a series of books on the politics of Latin America that criticize colonialism.\n\nPart 4 New Worlds: Spreading Ideas\n\nWulf discusses Humboldt's personal correspondence and influence on a young Charles Darwin. Darwin attributed the inspiration for his voyage on the Beagle to Humboldt. Humboldt's influence on the American poet and philosopher Henry David Thoreau is explored. Humboldt's magnum opus \"Cosmos\", where he talks of the interconnections of the natural world, is discussed.\n\nInvention of Nature became a New York Times bestseller. Some critics felt that the book could have covered Humboldt more thoroughly instead of focusing on people he influenced. Others found that the book provided a contemporary Humboldt. In September 2016, the book was awarded the Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book Prize \n"}
{"id": "29974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29974", "title": "Total war", "text": "Total war\n\nTotal war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\"\n\nIn the mid-19th century, scholars identified \"total war\" as a separate class of warfare. In a total war, to an extent inapplicable in less total conflicts, the differentiation between combatants and non-combatants diminishes and sometimes it even vanishes entirely because opposing sides can consider nearly every human resource, even that of non-combatants, to be a part of the war effort.\n\nActions that may characterize the post-19th century concept of total war include:\n\nThe phrase can be traced back to the 1935 publication of the World War I memoir of German General Erich Ludendorff, \"Der totale Krieg\" (\"The total war\"). Some authors extend the concept back as far as classic work of Carl von Clausewitz, \"On War\", as \"absoluter Krieg\" (absolute war); however, different authors interpret the relevant passages in diverging ways. Total war also describes the French \"guerre Ã  outrance\" during the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nIn his letter to his Chief of Staff, Union General Henry Halleck on 24 December 1864 described that the Union was \"not only fighting hostile armies, but a hostile people, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war, as well as their organized armies,\" defending Sherman's March to the Sea, the operation that inflicted widespread destruction of infrastructure in Georgia.\n\nUnited States Air Force General Curtis LeMay updated the concept for the nuclear age. In 1949, he first proposed that a total war in the nuclear age would consist of delivering the entire nuclear arsenal in a single overwhelming blow, going as far as \"killing a nation\".\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, destruction under the Mongol Empire in the 13th century effectively exemplified total war. The military forces of Genghis Khan slaughtered whole populations and destroyed any city that resisted:\n\nAuthor and historian Mark van de Logt wrote: \"Although military historians tend to reserve the concept of 'total war' for conflicts between modern industrial nations, the term nevertheless most closely approaches the state of affairs between the Pawnees and the Sioux and Cheyennes. Both sides directed their actions not solely against warrior-combatants but against the people as a whole. Noncombatants were legitimate targets. Indeed, the taking of a scalp of a woman or child was considered honorable because it signified that the scalp taker had dared to enter the very heart of the enemy's territory.\"\n\nIn The American Revolution, also known as the American Revolutionary War, many basic tactics of Total War were created in a modern form, I.E. Scorched Earth. in 1779, The Sullivan Expedition began, marching through Western Pennsylvania and up through New York, burning Iroquois villages to the ground, leaving nothing behind but smoldering ruin and dead bodies. In the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War, The British and American Militia did similar campaigns of Extermination, but to their neighbors. Whole towns where depopulated. The British Cavalry led by Banastre Tarleton join the militia in the creation of the inferno called \"South Carolina\".\n\nThe French Revolutionary Wars introduced to mainland Europe some of the first concepts of total war, such as mass conscription. The fledgling republic found itself threatened by a powerful coalition of European nations. The only solution, in the eyes of the Jacobin government, was to pour the entire nation's resources into an unprecedented war effortâthis was the advent of the levÃ©e en masse. The following decree of the National Convention on August 23, 1793 demonstrates the immensity of the French war effort, when the French front line forces grew to some 800,000 with a total of 1.5 million in all servicesâthe first time an army in excess of a million had been mobilized in Western history:\n\nThe wars merged into the Napoleonic Wars of the First French Empire from ca. 1803. Over the coming two decades of almost constant warfare it is estimated that somewhere in the vicinity of five million diedâprobably about half of them civiliansâand France alone counted nearly a million (by some sources in excess of a million) deaths.\n\nIn the Russian campaign of 1812 the Russians resorted to destroying infrastructure and agriculture in their retreat in order to hamper the French and strip them of adequate supplies. In the campaign of 1813, Allied forces in the German theater alone amounted to nearly one million whilst two years later in the Hundred Days a French decree called for the total mobilization of some 2.5 million men (though at most a fifth of this was managed by the time of the French defeat at Waterloo). During the prolonged Peninsular War from 1808â1814 some 300,000 French troops were kept permanently occupied by, in addition to several hundred thousand Spanish, Portuguese and British regulars, an enormous and sustained guerrilla insurgencyâultimately French deaths would amount to 300,000 in the Peninsular War alone.\n\nThe Taiping Rebellion (1850â1864) was one of the deadliest wars in history. About 20 million people died, many due to disease and famine. It followed the secession of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom from the Qing Empire. Almost every citizen of the Heavenly Kingdom was given military training and conscripted into the army to fight against the Imperial forces.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Union Army General Philip Sheridan's stripping of the Shenandoah Valley, beginning on September 21, 1864 and continuing for two weeks, was considered \"total war\". Its purpose was to eliminate food and supplies vital to the South's military operations, as well as to strike a blow at Southern civilian morale. Sheridan took the opportunity when he realized opposing forces had become too weak to resist his army.\n\nUnion Army General William Tecumseh Sherman's 'March to the Sea' in November and December 1864 destroyed the resources required for the South to make war. General Ulysses S. Grant and President Abraham Lincoln initially opposed the plan until Sherman convinced them of its necessity.\n\nScholars taking issue with the notion that Sherman was employing \"total war\" include Noah Andre Trudeau. Trudeau believes that Sherman's goals and methods do not meet the definition of total war and to suggest as much is to \"misread Sherman's intentions and to misunderstand the results of what happened\".\n\nAlmost the whole of Europe and the European colonial empires mobilized to wage World War I. Young men were removed from production jobs to serve in military roles, and were replaced on the production line by women. Rationing occurred on the home fronts. Bulgaria went so far as to mobilize a quarter of its population or 800,000 people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war.\nOne of the features of Total War in Britain was the use of government propaganda posters to divert all attention to the war on the home front. Posters were used to influence public opinion about what to eat and what occupations to take, and to change the attitude of support towards the war effort. Even the Music Hall was used as propaganda, with propaganda songs aimed at recruitment.\n\nAfter the failure of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, the large British offensive in March 1915, the British Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal John French blamed the lack of progress on insufficient and poor-quality artillery shells. This led to the Shell Crisis of 1915 which brought down both the Liberal government and Premiership of H. H. Asquith. He formed a new coalition government dominated by Liberals and appointed David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions. It was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be geared for war if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front.\n\nAs young men left the farms for the front, domestic food production in Britain and Germany fell. In Britain the response was to import more food, which was done despite the German introduction of unrestricted submarine warfare, and to introduce rationing. The Royal Navy's blockade of German ports prevented Germany from importing food and hastened German capitulation by creating a food crisis in Germany.\nThe Second World War was the quintessential total war of modernity. The level of national mobilization of resources on all sides of the conflict, the battlespace being contested, the scale of the armies, navies, and air forces raised through conscription, the active targeting of non-combatants (and non-combatant property), the general disregard for collateral damage, and the unrestricted aims of the belligerents marked total war on an unprecedented and unsurpassed, multicontinental scale.\n\nDuring the first part of the ShÅwa era, the government of Imperial Japan launched a string of policies to promote a total war effort against China and occidental powers and increase industrial production. Among these were the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.\n\nThe National Mobilization Law had fifty clauses, which provided for government controls over civilian organizations (including labor unions), nationalization of strategic industries, price controls and rationing, and nationalized the news media. The laws gave the government the authority to use unlimited budgets to subsidize war production, and to compensate manufacturers for losses caused by war-time mobilization. Eighteen of the fifty articles outlined penalties for violators.\n\nTo improve its production, ShÅwa Japan used millions of slave labourers and pressed more than 18 million people in East Asia into forced labor.\n\nBefore the onset of the Second World War, the United Kingdom drew on its First World War experience to prepare legislation that would allow immediate mobilization of the economy for war, should future hostilities break out.\n\nRationing of most goods and services was introduced, not only for consumers but also for manufacturers. This meant that factories manufacturing products that were irrelevant to the war effort had more appropriate tasks imposed. All artificial light was subject to legal blackouts.\n\nNot only were men conscripted into the armed forces from the beginning of the war (something which had not happened until the middle of World War I), but women were also conscripted as Land Girls to aid farmers and the Bevin Boys were conscripted to work down the coal mines.\n\nEnormous casualties were expected in bombing raids, so children were evacuated from London and other cities en masse to the countryside for compulsory billeting in households. In the long term this was one of the most profound and longer-lasting social consequences of the whole war for Britain. This is because it mixed up children with the adults of other classes. Not only did the middle and upper classes become familiar with the urban squalor suffered by working class children from the slums, but the children got a chance to see animals and the countryside, often for the first time, and experience rural life.\n\nThe use of statistical analysis, by a branch of science which has become known as Operational Research to influence military tactics was a departure from anything previously attempted. It was a very powerful tool but it further dehumanised war particularly when it suggested strategies which were counter intuitive. Examples where statistical analysis directly influenced tactics include the work done by Patrick Blackett's team on the optimum size and speed of convoys and the introduction of bomber streams by the Royal Air Force to counter the night fighter defences of the Kammhuber Line.\n\nIn contrast, Germany started the war under the concept of Blitzkrieg. Officially, it did not accept that it was in a total war until Joseph Goebbels' Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943.\n\nThe commitment to the doctrine of the short war was a continuing handicap for the Germans; neither plans nor state of mind were adjusted to the idea of a long war until the failure of the Operation Barbarossa. A major strategical defeat in the Battle of Moscow forced Albert Speer, who was appointed as Germany's armament minister in early 1942, to nationalize German war production and eliminate the worst inefficiencies.\n\nUnder Speer's direction a threefold increase in armament production occurred and did not reach its peak until late 1944. To do this during the damage caused by the growing strategic Allied bomber offensive, is an indication of the degree of industrial under-mobilization in the earlier years. It was because the German economy through most of the war was substantially under-mobilized that it was resilient under air attack. Civilian consumption was high during the early years of the war and inventories both in industry and in consumers' possession were high. These helped cushion the economy from the effects of bombing.\n\nPlant and machinery were plentiful and incompletely used, thus it was comparatively easy to substitute unused or partly used machinery for that which was destroyed. Foreign labour, both slave labour and labour from neighbouring countries who joined the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany, was used to augment German industrial labour which was under pressure by conscription into the \"Wehrmacht\" (Armed Forces).\n\nThe Soviet Union (USSR) was a command economy which already had an economic and legal system allowing the economy and society to be redirected into fighting a total war. The transportation of factories and whole labour forces east of the Urals as the Germans advanced across the USSR in 1941 was an impressive feat of planning. Only those factories which were useful for war production were moved because of the total war commitment of the Soviet government.\n\nThe Eastern Front of the European Theatre of World War II encompassed the conflict in central and eastern Europe from June 22, 1941 to May 9, 1945. It was the largest theatre of war in history in terms of numbers of soldiers, equipment and casualties and was notorious for its unprecedented ferocity, destruction, and immense loss of life (see World War II casualties). The fighting involved millions of German, Hungarian, Romanian and Soviet troops along a broad front hundreds of kilometres long. It was by far the deadliest single theatre of World War II. Scholars now believe that at most 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war, including at least 8.7 million soldiers who fell in battle against Hitler's armies or died in POW camps. Millions of civilians died from starvation, exposure, atrocities, and massacres. The Axis lost over 5 million soldiers in the east as well as many thousands of civilians.\n\nDuring the Battle of Stalingrad, newly built T-34 tanks were drivenâunpainted because of a paint shortageâfrom the factory floor straight to the front. This came to symbolise the USSR's commitment to the Great Patriotic War and demonstrated the government's total war policy.\n\nThe United States underwent an unprecedented mobilization of national resources for the Second World War. Conditions in the United States were not as strained as they were in the United Kingdom or as desperate as they were in the Soviet Union, but the United States greatly curtailed nearly all non-essential activities in its prosecution of the Second World War and redirected nearly all available national resources to the conflict, including reaching the point of diminishing returns by late 1944, where the U.S. military was unable to find any more males of the correct military age to draft into service.\n\nThe strategists of the U.S. military looked abroad at the storms brewing on the horizon in Europe and Asia, and began quietly making contingency plans as early as the mid-1930s; new weapons and weapons platforms were designed, and made ready. Following the outbreak of war in Europe and the ongoing aggression in Asia, efforts were stepped up significantly. The collapse of France and the airborne aggression directed at Great Britain unsettled the Americans, who had close relations with both nations, and a peacetime draft was instituted, along with Lend-Lease programs to aid the British, and covert aid was passed to the Chinese as well.\n\nAmerican public opinion was still opposed to involvement in the problems of Europe and Asia, however. In 1941, the Soviet Union became the latest nation to be invaded, and the U.S. gave her aid as well. American ships began defending aid convoys to the Allied nations against submarine attacks, and a total trade embargo against the Empire of Japan was instituted to deny its military the raw materials its factories and military forces required to continue its offensive actions in China.\n\nIn late 1941, Japan's Army-dominated government decided to seize by military force the strategic resources of South-East Asia and Indonesia since the Western powers would not give Japan these goods by trade. Planning for this action included surprise attacks on American and British forces in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, and the U.S. naval base and warships at Pearl Harbor. In response to these attacks, the U.K. and U.S. declared war on the Empire of Japan the next day. Nazi Germany declared war on the U.S. a few days later, along with Fascist Italy; the U.S. found itself fully involved in a second world war.\nAs the United States began to gear up for a major war, information and propaganda efforts were set in motion. Civilians (including children) were encouraged to take part in fat, grease, and scrap metal collection drives. Many factories making non-essential goods retooled for war production. Levels of industrial productivity previously unheard of were attained during the war; multi-thousand-ton convoy ships were routinely built in a month-and-a-half, and tanks poured out of the former automobile factories. Within a few years of the U.S. entry into the Second World War, nearly every man fit for service, between 18 and 30, had been conscripted into the military \"for the duration\" of the conflict, and unprecedented numbers of women took up jobs previously held by them. Strict systems of rationing of consumer staples were introduced to redirect productive capacity to war needs.\n\nPreviously untouched sections of the nation mobilized for the war effort. Academics became technocrats; home-makers became bomb-makers (massive numbers of women worked in heavy industry during the war); union leaders and businessmen became commanders in the massive armies of production. The great scientific communities of the United States were mobilized as never before, and mathematicians, doctors, engineers, and chemists turned their minds to the problems ahead of them.\n\nBy the war's end a multitude of advances had been made in medicine, physics, engineering, and the other sciences. Even the theoretical physicists, whose theories were not believed to have military applications (at the time), were sent far into the Western deserts to work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory on the Manhattan Project that culminated in the Trinity nuclear test and changed the course of history.\n\nIn the war, the United States lost 407,316 military personnel, but had managed to avoid the extensive level of damage to civilian and industrial infrastructure that other participants suffered. The U.S. emerged as one of the two superpowers after the war.\n\nAfter the United States entered World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt declared at Casablanca conference to the other Allies and the press that unconditional surrender was the objective of the war against the Axis Powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Prior to this declaration, the individual regimes of the Axis Powers could have negotiated an armistice similar to that at the end of World War I and then a conditional surrender when they perceived that the war was lost.\n\nThe unconditional surrender of the major Axis powers caused a legal problem at the post-war Nuremberg Trials, because the trials appeared to be in conflict with Articles 63 and 64 of the Geneva Convention of 1929. Usually if such trials are held, they would be held under the auspices of the defeated power's own legal system as happened with some of the minor Axis powers, for example in the post World War II Romanian People's Tribunals. To circumvent this, the Allies argued that the major war criminals were captured after the end of the war, so they were not prisoners of war and the Geneva Conventions did not cover them. Further, the collapse of the Axis regimes created a legal condition of total defeat (\"debellatio\") so the provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention over military occupation were not applicable.\n\nSince the end of World War II, no industrial nation has fought such a large, decisive war. This is likely due to the availability of nuclear weapons, whose destructive power and quick deployment render a full mobilization of a country's resources such as in World War II unnecessary. Such weapons are developed and maintained with relatively modest peacetime defense budgets.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, the ideological stand-off of the Cold War between the Western World and the Soviet Union had resulted in thousands of nuclear weapons being aimed by each side at the other. Strategically, the equal balance of destructive power possessed by each side situation came to be known as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), considering that a nuclear attack by one superpower would result in nuclear counter-strike by the other. This would result in hundreds of millions of deaths in a world where, in words widely attributed to Nikita Khrushchev, \"The living will envy the dead\".\n\nDuring the Cold War, the two superpowers sought to avoid open conflict between their respective forces, as both sides recognized that such a clash could very easily escalate, and quickly involve nuclear weapons. Instead, the superpowers fought each other through their involvement in proxy wars, military buildups, and diplomatic standoffs.\n\nIn the case of proxy wars, each superpower supported its respective allies in conflicts with forces aligned with the other superpower, such as in the Vietnam War and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars, NATO conducted strikes against the electrical grid in enemy territory using graphite bombs. Some observers considered this to be an act of total war, owing to the fact that powerplants supported by the electrical grid were essential to water purification and thus the strike represented a direct attack on civilian resources. NATO claimed that the objective of their strikes was to disrupt military infrastructure and communications.\n\n\n"}

Schools from different divisions can and do attend the same Regional and Sectional, even though they do not compete against each other. Some Regionals may not be represented in certain Divisions if no schools of that enrollment participate in the competition. \n\nTests are graded and ranked from highest score to lowest score. At Regionals and Sectionals, the top 3 scores in each test, including ties, are awarded medals. At the State Finals, the top 6 scores including ties are awarded medals.\n\nIndividual tests are graded and ranked from highest score to lowest score. The two highest scores in each subject for a school are added together to determine the school's Raw Score for that subject. If a school has only one score in a subject, the Raw Score is zero.\n\nThe highest Raw Score for a subject is considered the Normalizing Raw Score. This Raw Score is divided into 100 to find the Normalizing Constant. (100/Top Raw Score=Normalizing Constant) Every Raw Score for that subject in that division is then multiplied by the Normalizing Constant to find the school's normalized score. This is done for each subject in each division.\n\nOnce the normalized scores have been found, the school's score is determined by adding the normalized scores for five of the seven tests together. The five tests are English, Chemistry, Mathematics, and the two highest normalized scores of the remaining four tests (Biology, Computer Science, Engineering Graphics, and Physics).\n\nIndividuals and teams advance from Regionals to Sectionals to the State Finals based on their placement at the current level of competition.\n\nIndividuals who place 1st or 2nd, including ties, at either Regionals or Sectionals advance to the next level. Thus, if there is one 1st place individual and a four-way tie for 2nd, five individuals will advance to the next level for that subject.\n\nAt the Sectional level, individuals can also advance to the State Finals by scoring a pre-determined qualifying score on a test. This prevents Sectionals from advancing only the top two scores when \nthere are additional high scores below the 2nd place finisher(s).\n\nIf an individual qualifies to advance for one test, that individual still takes two tests at the next level, even if their school does not advance with the individual.\n\nTeams advance to the next level based on their finish compared to the number of schools competing.\nIf there are 1 or 2 teams competing, both advance.\nIf there are from 3-7 teams, the top 2 advance.\nIf there are from 8-12 teams, the top 3 advance.\nIf there are from 13-16 teams, the top 4 advance.\nIf there are more than 16 teams, the top 5 advance.\n\nWYSE Website\n"}
