Cryogenic air separation units (ASUs) are built to provide nitrogen or oxygen and often co-produce argon. Other methods such as membrane, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) are commercially used to separate a single component from ordinary air. High purity oxygen, nitrogen, and argon used for semiconductor device fabrication requires cryogenic distillation. Similarly, the only viable source of the rare gases neon, krypton, and xenon is the distillation of air using at least two distillation columns.\n\nPure gases can be separated from air by first cooling it until it liquefies, then selectively distilling the components at their various boiling temperatures. The process can produce high purity gases but is energy-intensive. This process was pioneered by Carl von Linde in the early 20th century and is still used today to produce high purity gases.\n\nThe cryogenic separation process requires a very tight integration of heat exchangers and separation columns to obtain a good efficiency and all the energy for refrigeration is provided by the compression of the air at the inlet of the unit.\n\nTo achieve the low distillation temperatures an air separation unit requires a refrigeration cycle that operates by means of the Joule–Thomson effect, and the cold equipment has to be kept within an insulated enclosure (commonly called a \"cold box\"). The cooling of the gases requires a large amount of energy to make this refrigeration cycle work and is delivered by an air compressor. Modern ASUs use expansion turbines for cooling; the output of the expander helps drive the air compressor, for improved efficiency.\nThe process consists of the following main steps:\n\n\nThe separated products are sometimes supplied by pipeline to large industrial users near the production plant. Long distance transportation of products is by shipping liquid product for large quantities or as dewar flasks or gas cylinders for small quantities.\n\nPressure swing adsorption provides separation of oxygen or nitrogen from air without liquefaction. The process operates around ambient temperature; a zeolite (molecular sponge) is exposed to high pressure air, then the air is released and an adsorbed film of the desired gas is released. The size of compressor is much reduced over a liquefaction plant, and portable oxygen concentrators are made in this manner to provide oxygen-enriched air for medical purposes. Vacuum swing adsorption is a similar process; the product gas is evolved from the zeolite at sub-atmospheric pressure.\nMembrane technologies can provide alternate, lower-energy approaches to air separation. For example, a number of approaches are being explored for oxygen generation. Polymeric membranes operating at ambient or warm temperatures, for example, may be able to produce oxygen-enriched air (25-50% oxygen). Ceramic membranes can provide high-purity oxygen (90% or more) but require higher temperatures (800-900 deg C) to operate. These ceramic membranes include Ion Transport Membranes (ITM) and Oxygen Transport Membranes (OTM). Air Products and Chemicals Inc and Praxair are developing flat ITM and tubular OTM systems, .\n\nMembrane gas separation is used to provide oxygen poor and nitrogen rich gases instead of air to fill the fuel tanks of jet liners, thus greatly reducing the chances of accidental fires and explosions. Conversely, membrane gas separation is currently used to provide oxygen enriched air to pilots flying at great altitudes in aircraft without pressurized cabins.\n\nOxygen-enriched air can be obtained exploiting the different solubility of oxygen and nitrogen. Oxygen is more soluble than nitrogen in water, so if air is degassed from water, a stream of 35% oxygen can be obtained.\n\nIn steelmaking oxygen is required for the basic oxygen steelmaking. Today, modern basic oxygen steelmaking uses almost two tons of oxygen per ton of steel.\n\nNitrogen used in the Haber process to make ammonia.\n\nLarge amounts of oxygen are required for coal gasification projects; cryogenic plants producing 3000 tons/day are found in some projects.\n\nInerting storage tanks of ships and tanks for petroleum products, or for protecting edible oil products from oxidation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3950957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3950957", "title": "Athens Charter", "text": "Athens Charter\n\nThe Athens Charter () was a 1933 document about urban planning published by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier. The work was based upon Le Corbusier’s \"Ville Radieuse\" (Radiant City) book of 1935 and urban studies undertaken by the Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) in the early 1930s.\n\nThe Charter got its name from location of the fourth CIAM conference in 1933, which, due to the deteriorating political situation in Russia, took place on the S.S. Patris bound for Athens from Marseilles. This conference is documented in a film commissioned by Sigfried Giedion and made by his friend Laszlo Moholy-Nagy: \"Architects' Congress.\"\n\nThe Charter had a significant impact on urban planning after World War II.\n\nAlthough Le Corbusier had exhibited his ideas for the ideal city, the Ville Contemporaine in the 1920s, during the early 1930s, after contact with international planners he began work on the Ville Radieuse (Radiant City). In 1930 he had become an active member of the syndicalist movement and proposed the Ville Radieuse as a blueprint of social reform.\n\nUnlike the radial design of the Ville Contemporaine, the Ville Radieuse was a linear city based upon the abstract shape of the human body with head, spine, arms and legs. The design maintained the idea of high-rise housing blocks, free circulation and abundant green spaces proposed in his earlier work. Le Corbusier exhibited the first representations of his ideas at the third CIAM meeting in Brussels in 1930 and published a book of the same title as the city in 1935.\n\nThe concept of the Functional City came to dominate CIAM thinking after the conference in Brussels. At a meeting in Zürich in 1931, CIAM members Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Siegfried Giedion, Rudolf Steiger and Werner M. Moser discussed with Cornelis van Eesteren the importance of solar orientation in governing the directional positioning of low-cost housing on a given site. Van Eesteren had been chief architect of Amsterdam's Urban Development Section since 1929 and the group asked him to prepare a number of analytical studies of cities ready for the next main CIAM meeting planned to be in Moscow in 1933. The theme for these studies would be the Functional City, that is, one where land planning would be based upon function-based zones.\n\nVan Eesteren employed the city planner Theodor Karel van Lohuizen to use methods developed for the Amsterdam Expansion Plan, to prepare zoning plans that would predict overall future development in the city. He relied upon the more rational methods being promoted by CIAM at that time which sought to use statistical information for designing zone uses rather than designing them in any detail.\n\nAt a special congress meeting in Berlin later in 1931 van Eesteren presented his findings to his colleagues. He presented three drawings of Amsterdam. The first at a scale of 1:10000 showed land use and density, the second showed transportation networks and the third, at 1:50000 showed the regional setting of the city. He also presented supporting information on the four functions of dwelling, work, recreation and transport. Based upon his presentation it was decided that the separate national groups within CIAM would prepare similar presentation boards for the Moscow meeting. A standard set of notation was agreed.\n\nIn 1932 Le Corbusier's Palace of the Soviets competition entry failed to gain acceptance from the jury and, due to the political conditions in Russia, CIAM's agenda became increasingly ignored. A new venue for the fourth CIAM conference was required.\n\nThe fourth CIAM conference took place on board the S.S. Patris, an ocean-going liner journeying from Marseilles to Athens in July 1933.\n\nThe national groups reported to the conference with the findings from their city studies, presenting in each case the agreed three boards showing a total of 34 cities. In addition, Le Corbusier and the group who had met earlier in Zürich hosted a meeting to state the core goals of the Functional City.\n\nOn arrival in Athens on 3 August an exhibition of the Functional City boards was held at the National Technical University of Athens and inaugurated by Greece's prime minister. The boards were separated into seven categories: metropolises, cities of administration, ports, industrial cities, pleasure cities and cities of diverse function. The delegates remained in Athens for a number of days, some visited local classical sites and others visited nearby islands. On 10 August they embarked on the return journey to Marseilles.\n\nDuring meetings on the return journey delegates found it impossible to agree on resolutions for the Functional City. Van Eesteren's original Amsterdam plan had, with greater resources, a basis formed by scientific data. The plans presented by the national groups did not have this and, despite Giedion's insistence, delegates were reluctant to agree on guidelines. Eventually, two groups agreed on two separate texts: \"observations\" and \"resolutions\".\n\nThe \"observations\" taken from the studies of 33 cities set guidelines under the titles: living, working, recreation and circulation.\nCIAM demanded that housing districts should occupy the best sites, and a minimum amount of solar exposure should be required in all dwellings. For hygienic reasons, buildings should not be built along transportation routes, and modern techniques should be used to construct high apartment building spaces widely apart, to free the soil for large green parks.\n\n-Mumford, 2000, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960, The MIT Press, p85\nAdditionally they said it was important to reduce commuting times by locating industrial zones close to residential ones and buffering them with wide parks and sports areas. Street widths and requirements should be scientifically worked out to accommodate the speed and type of transport. Finally, with regards to conservation, historic monuments should be kept only when they were of true value and their conservation did not reduce their inhabitants to unhealthy living conditions.\n\nThe \"observations\" formed the basis of Josep Lluís Sert's book \"Can our cities survive?\" and were incorporated in Le Corbusier's \"Athens Charter\" published in 1943. The \"resolutions\" formed part of Le Corbusier's book \"The Radiant City\" published in 1935.\n\nThe text of the \"Athens Charter\" as published became an extension of the content of \"The Radiant City\" and Le Corbusier significantly re-worded the original \"observations\". As well as adding new material he also removed the urban plans upon which the original text was based. This treatment made the Athens Charter an abstract text of general value but also transformed the original force of the \"observations\" that were founded before on concrete references. Despite its title, the Athens Charter cannot be considered as the mutual outcome of the CIAM conference, which took place ten years earlier, but largely as an expression of Le Courbusier's individual concerns.\n\nThe CIAM 4 meeting was influential among attending architects from Switzerland, France, England, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Greece, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Brazil and Canada.\n\nAfter \"The Radiant City\" was published in France in 1935, Le Corbusier continued to develop his ideas of urban planning through a number of unrealised schemes. These included plans for Antwerp, Paris, Moscow, Algiers and Morocco.\n\nIn the Netherlands, CIAM delegates visited the Van Nelle factory designed in part by Mart Stam that was to have formed a larger part of a \"Functional City\" design.\n\nCIAM 4 was the first congress that the influential MARS Group from England was represented. In 1935 MARS member Berthold Lubetkin and his practice, the Tecton Group completed Highpoint in Highgate, London. The project comprised 56 dwellings grouped together as two crosses on plan, eight dwellings per arm. Each dwelling is linked to a central service core but is separated from its neighbour by a balcony - a design feature that virtually eliminated noise transfer between dwellings.\n\nIn 1937 with the fall of the Second Spanish Republic, Sert suggested that England and the United States may be the best place to focus CIAM's activities.\n\nThe \"Athens Charter\" had a huge impact on planning thought after World War II. However, its influence was more complicated because in the 1950s CIAM attempted to replace the Functional City described in the \"Charter\" with a different \"Charter of Habitat\".\n\nIn 1946 Le Corbusier received a commission for projects in La Rochelle and St Dié. The urban plan allowed him to experiment with urban monumentality that had been somewhat underplayed in the \"Charter\", but as part of the project he proposed eight Unité d'Habitation flanked by a civic centre. Although these proposals were unbuilt, he had more success in Marseilles where an initial study for three Unités resulted in one being built. In line with the \"Charter\", the Unité was a north-south orientated block eighteen storeys high set in parkland. There is a public 'street' on levels 7 and 8 that provides various shops, offices and a hotel. On the roof there is a nursery school, a running track and a pool. It opened in 1952 but had begun to influence architects even before it was complete.\n\nThe 1949 Housing Act in England paved the way for Local Authorities to provide a balance of housing types for a range of communities, not just the working class. In the socialist post war atmosphere, architectural writer J M Richards praised Le Corbusier's Unité for \"putting clean and healthy housing in a parkland setting\".\n\nBetween 1952 and 1958 London County Council built the Alton East and Alton West high-rise blocks in Roehampton. Alton East comprised 744 dwellings within mainly 10 storey blocks and Alton West was 1867 dwellings in 5, 6 and 12 storey blocks. Both projects are set within parkland and have since been listed.\n\nIn Sheffield in 1958, the city architect, Lewis Womersley, designed the Park Hill Estate. The product of an entire slum clearance, three times the size of the Unité, dwellings were housed in a series of high rise structures connected by external decks. These 'streets in the air' are wide enough to incorporate bicycles and milk floats. Initial success came because whole streets were moved into adjacent dwellings on the new scheme. Harold Macmillan said it would \"draw the admiration of the world\".\n\nIn Scotland, the Department of Housing for Scotland encouraged Local Authorities to build more unified and open schemes. The \"Functional City\" prescribed the separation of industrial zones from residential ones by parkland. This concept suited the regeneration of industrial decay in Scottish cities. From 1956 the Hutchesontown Gorbals area of Glasgow was redeveloped. The architect Robert Matthew designed one of the four areas using 18 storey blocks on a north-south axis that ignored local street patterns.\n\nThe Golden Lane London, was designed by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, who also designed the [Barbican], adjacent. It has a variety of dwellings and a good provision of supporting community buildings. Like the Unité it has a terrace on the roof.\n\nThe Smithsons (Alison and Peter Smithson) were against the four functions explored for the \"Functional City\", renaming them \"House\", \"Street\", \"District\" and \"City\". In the Golden Lane development the \"House\" became the family unit, the \"Street\" was an elevated access deck but the \"District\" and \"City\" lay outside the project's boundaries. Their work was never built at Golden Lane, but these ideas can be viewed in their book \"Urban Structuring\".\n\nLúcio Costa's conception of the plan for Brasília saw the city as a manifestation of the Functional City. Like Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse, it was seen as a method of imposing order, progress and stability to Brazil's new capital. Like Le Corbusier, Costa and Oscar Niemeyer aspired to produce a city based upon equality and justice.\n\nIn a variation of the \"Functional City\", Sert designed married-student housing for Harvard University in 1964. Known as Peabody Terraces it was made up of three main towers set in lawns and sheltered pedestrian routes. It avoided the usual vacuum at the base by grading the scale between the towers and the lawns.\n\nIn Japan in 1957, Kunio Maekawa designed the Harumi Apartment block in Tokyo based upon the idea of the Unité. Meanwhile, In Tel Aviv in 1963 CIAM member Jacob B. Bakema designed a \"Functional City\" proposal based upon Le Corbusier's Algiers scheme.\n\nThe Pruitt–Igoe housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri was designed in accordance with CIAM ideals for the \"Functional City\". It was made up of 14 storey blocks and is often claimed to have won an American Institute of Architects award when it was built in 1951, but no evidence of such exists. Charles Jencks proclaimed that the death of Modern Architecture was on 15 July 1972 at 3.32pm when the Pruitt–Igoe housing scheme was demolished with dynamite.\n\nArchitectural critic Reyner Banham was concerned that the supposed universality of the \"Charter\" concealed a very narrow view of architecture and planning that overly constrained the members of CIAM. The emphasis on tall high-density housing amongst wide, green spaces effectively killed research into other areas of urban housing.\n\nIn planning terms the \"Charter\" had set rigid geometries for urban planning, increasingly there became an awareness of words like 'neighbourhood', 'cluster' and 'association' that demanded a more organic approach to the image of the city.\n\nEven by 1954 during the Aix-en-Provence meeting of CIAM the younger generation riled against the pre-war utopian ideals that the Charter represented. This disillusionment would lead to the formation of Team X at the Dubrovnik meeting of CIAM that would eventually lead to the breakup of the Conference as an organisation.\n\nIn the case of Brasília, whilst Niemeyer remained faithful to the ideas of zoning and green spaces, his revised urban utopia became based upon a smaller city with a high vertical concentration of people with increased pedestrian facilities. In 1958 he had warned that his utopian dream could not be fulfilled unless society itself was reorganised to suit it. At its inauguration the city was branded a Kafkaesque Nightmare with an Orwellian environment.\nTo reduce the matter to high density when no due attention was given to communal facilities was to court disaster; to create open space without greenery was to devalue the idea of the community living in nature. The imitations of the Unité usually involved such drastic omissions. Does this mean that the prototype should be blamed for the later disastrous variations?\n\n−Curtis, 1986, Modern Architecture since 1900, Phaidon, p293\nIn 2003 the European Council of Spatial Planners wrote a new version of the Charter.\n\nJ. G. Ballard's book \"High Rise\" is set in a 40 storey block set in parkland with other high-rises in central London. On the tenth floor is a wide concourse with supermarket, shops and gymnasium and a swimming pool. On the 35th floor there is a smaller swimming pool, a sauna and a restaurant. As the affluent tenants embark upon an orgy of destruction, Ballard tells the story of how the whole block slowly degenerates into chaos.\n\n"}

{"id": "3783853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3783853", "title": "Bond graph", "text": "Bond graph\n\nA bond graph is a graphical representation of a physical dynamic system. It allows the conversion of the system into a state-space representation. It is similar to a block diagram or signal-flow graph, with the major difference that the arcs in bond graphs represent bi-directional exchange of physical energy, while those in block diagrams and signal-flow graphs represent uni-directional flow of information. Bond graphs are multi-energy domain (e.g. mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, etc) and domain neutral. This means a bond graph can incorporate multiple domains seamlessly.\n\nThe bond graph is composed of the \"bonds\" which link together \"single port\", \"double-port\" and \"multi-port\" elements (see below for details). Each bond represents the instantaneous flow of energy (\"dE\"/\"dt\") or power. The flow in each bond is denoted by a pair of variables called power variables, whose product is the instantaneous power of the bond. The power variables are broken into two parts: flow and effort. For example, for the bond of an electrical system, the flow is the current, while the effort is the voltage. By multiplying current and voltage in this example you can get the instantaneous power of the bond.\n\nA bond has two other features described briefly here, and discussed in more detail below. One is the \"half-arrow\" sign convention. This defines the assumed direction of positive energy flow. As with electrical circuit diagrams and free-body diagrams, the choice of positive direction is arbitrary, with the caveat that the analyst must be consistent throughout with the chosen definition. The other feature is the \"causality\". This is a vertical bar placed on only one end of the bond. It is not arbitrary. As described below, there are rules for assigning the proper causality to a given port, and rules for the precedence among ports. Causality explains the mathematical relationship between effort and flow. The positions of the causalities show which of the power variables are dependent and which are independent.\n\nIf the dynamics of the physical system to be modeled operate on widely varying time scales, fast continuous-time behaviors can be modeled as instantaneous phenomena by using a hybrid bond graph. Bond graphs were invented by Henry Paynter.\n\nThe tetrahedron of state is a tetrahedron that graphically shows the conversion between effort and flow. The adjacent image shows the tetrahedron in its generalized form. The tetrahedron can be modified depending on the energy domain. The table below shows the variables and constants of the tetrahedron of state in common energy domains.\n\nUsing the tetrahedron of state, one can find a mathematical relationship between any variables on the tetrahedron. This is done by following the arrows around the diagram and multiplying any constants along the way. For example, if you wanted to find the relationship between generalized flow and generalized displacement, you would start at the \"f(t)\" and then integrate it to get \"q(t)\". More examples of equations can be seen below.\n\nRelationship between generalized displacement and generalized flow.\n\nformula_1\n\nRelationship between generalized flow and generalized effort.\n\nformula_2\n\nRelationship between generalized flow and generalized momentum.\n\nformula_3\n\nRelationship between generalized momentum and generalized effort.\n\nformula_4\n\nRelationship between generalized flow and generalized involving the constant C.\n\nformula_5\n\nAll of the mathematical relationships remain the same when switching energy domains, only the symbols change. This can be seen with the following examples.\n\nRelationship between displacement and velocity.\n\nformula_6\n\nRelationship between current and voltage, this is also known as Ohm's law.\n\nformula_7\n\nRelationship between force and displacement, also known as Hooke's law. It should be noted that the negative sign is dropped in this equation because the sign is factored into the way the arrow is pointing in the bond graph. \n\nformula_8\n\nIf an engine is connected to a wheel through a shaft, the power is being transmitted in the rotational mechanical domain, meaning the effort and the flow are torque (τ) and angular velocity (ω) respectively. A word bond graph is a first step towards a bond graph, in which words define the components. As a word bond graph, this system would look like:\nA half-arrow is used to provide a sign convention, so if the engine is doing work when τ and ω are positive, then the diagram would be drawn:\nThis system can also be represented in a more general method. This involves changing from using the words, to symbols representing the same items. These symbols are based on the generalized form, as explained above. As the engine is applying a torque to the wheel, it will be represented as a source of effort for the system. The wheel can be presented by an impedance on the system. Further, the torque and angular velocity symbols are dropped and replaced with the generalized symbols for effort and flow. While not necessary in the example, it is common to number the bonds, to keep track of in equations. The simplified diagram can be seen below.\n\nformula_11\n\nGiven that effort is always above the flow on the bond, it is also possible to drop the effort and flow symbols altogether, without losing any relevant information. However, the bond number should not be dropped. The example can be seen below.\n\nformula_12\n\nThe bond number will be important later when converting from the bond graph to state-space equations.\n\nSingle port elements are elements in a bond graph that can have only one port.\n\nSources are elements that represent the input for a system. They will either input effort or flow into a system. They are denoted by a capital \"S\" with either a lower case \"e\" or \"f\" for effort or flow respectively. Sources will always have the arrow pointing away from the element. An examples of sources include: motors (source of effort, torque), voltage sources (source of effort), and current sources (source of flow).\n\nformula_13\n\nSinks are elements that represent the output for a system. They are represented the same way as sources, but have the arrow pointing into the element instead of away from it.\n\nformula_14\n\nInertance elements are denoted by a capital \"I\", and always have power flowing into them. Inertance elements are elements that store kinetic energy. Most commonly these are a mass for mechanical systems, and inductors for electrical systems.\n\nformula_15\n\nResistance elements are denoted by a capital \"R\", and always have power flowing into them. Resistance elements are elements that dissipate energy. Most commonly these are a dampener, for mechanical systems, and resistors for electrical systems.\n\nformula_16\n\nCapacitance elements are denoted by a capital \"C\", and always have power flowing into them. Capacitance elements are elements that store potential energy. Most commonly these are springs for mechanical systems, and capacitors for electrical systems.\n\nformula_17\n\nThese elements have two ports. They are used to change the power between or within a system. When converting from one to the other, no power is lost during the transfer. The elements have a constant that will be given with it. The constant is called a transformer constant or gyrator constant depending on which element is being used. These constants will commonly be displayed as a ratio below the element.\n\nA transformer applies a relationship between flow in flow out, and effort in effort out. Examples include an ideal electrical transformer or a lever.\n\nDenoted\n\nformula_18\n\nwhere the \"r\" denotes the modulus of the transformer. This means\nand\n\nA gyrator applies a relationship between flow in effort out, and effort in flow out. An example of a gyrator is a DC motor, which converts voltage (electrical effort) into Angular velocity (angular mechanical flow).\n\nformula_21\n\nmeaning that\nand\n\nJunctions, unlike the other elements can have any number of ports either in or out. Junctions split power across their ports. There are two distant junctions, the 0-junction and the 1-junction which differ only in the how effort and flow are carried across. It should be noted that the same junction in series can be combined, but different junctions in series cannot.\n\n0-junctions behave such that all efforts values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the flow values in equals the sum the flow values out.\n\nformula_24\n\nformula_25\n\nAn example is shown below.\n\nformula_26\n\nResulting equations:\n\nformula_27\n\nformula_28\n\n1-junctions behave opposite of 0-junctions. 1-junctions behave such that all flow values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the effort values in equals the sum the effort values out.\n\nformula_29\n\nformula_30\n\nAn example is shown below.\n\nformula_31\n\nResulting equations:\n\nformula_32\n\nformula_33\n\nBond graphs have a notion of causality, indicating which side of a bond determines the instantaneous effort and which determines the instantaneous flow. In formulating the dynamic equations that describe the system, causality defines, for each modeling element, which variable is dependent and which is independent. By propagating the causation graphically from one modeling element to the other, analysis of large-scale models becomes easier. Completing causal assignment in a bond graph model will allow the detection of modeling situation where an algebraic loop exists; that is the situation when a variable is defined recursively as a function of itself.\n\nAs an example of causality, consider a capacitor in series with a battery. It is not physically possible to charge a capacitor instantly, so anything connected in parallel with a capacitor will necessarily have the same voltage (effort variable) as the capacitor. Similarly, an inductor cannot change flux instantly and so any component in series with an inductor will necessarily have the same flow as the inductor. Because capacitors and inductors are passive devices, they cannot maintain their respective voltage and flow indefinitely—the components to which they are attached will affect their respective voltage and flow, but only indirectly by affecting their current and voltage respectively.\n\nNote: Causality is a symmetric relationship. When one side \"causes\" effort, the other side \"causes\" flow.\n\nIn bond graph notation, a causal stroke may be added to one end of the power bond to indicate that the opposite end is defining the effort. Consider a constant-torque motor driving a wheel, i.e. a source of effort (\"SE\"). That would be drawn as follows:\n\nSymmetrically, the side with the causal stroke (in this case the wheel) defines the flow for the bond.\n\nCausality results in compatibility constraints. Clearly only one end of a power bond can define the effort and so only one end of a bond can have a causal stroke. In addition, the two passive components with time-dependent behavior, \"I\" and \"C\", can only have one sort of causation: an \"I\" component determines flow; a \"C\" component defines effort. So from a junction, \"J\", the preferred causal orientation is as follows:\n\nThese equations can be manipulated to yield the state equations. For this example, you are trying to find equations that relate formula_36 and formula_37 in terms of formula_38, formula_39, and formula_40.\n\nTo start you should recall from the tetrahedron of state that formula_41starting with equation 2, you can rearrange it so that formula_42. formula_43 can be substituted for equation 4, while in equation 4, formula_44 can be replaced by formula_45due to equation 3, which can then be replaced by equation 5. formula_46 can likewise be replaced using equation 7, in which formula_47can be replaced with formula_48 which can then be replaced with equation 10. Following these substituted yields the first state equation which is shown below.\n\nformula_49\n\nThe second state equation can likewise be solved, by recalling that formula_50. The second state equation is shown below.\n\nformula_51\n\nBoth equations can further be rearranged into matrix form. The result of which is below.\n\nformula_52\n\nAt this point the equations can be treated as any other state-space representation problem.\n\nA bibliography on bond graph modeling may be extracted from the following conferences :\n\n\n"}

Most of the work on this very vital field of discrete mathematics is concerned with \"binary\" constant-weight codes.\n\nBinary constant-weight codes have several applications, including frequency hopping in GSM networks.\nMost barcodes use a binary constant-weight code to simplify automatically setting the threshold.\nMost line codes use either a constant-weight code, or a nearly-constant-weight paired disparity code.\nIn addition to use as error correction codes, the large space between code words can also be used in the design of asynchronous circuits such as delay insensitive circuits.\n\nConstant-weight codes, like Berger codes, can detect all unidirectional errors.\n\nThe central problem regarding constant-weight codes is the following: what is the maximum number of codewords in a binary constant-weight code with length formula_1, Hamming distance formula_2, and weight formula_3? This number is called formula_4.\n\nApart from some trivial observations, it is generally impossible to compute these numbers in a straightforward way. Upper bounds are given by several important theorems such as the first and second Johnson bounds, and better upper bounds can sometimes be found in other ways. Lower bounds are most often found by exhibiting specific codes, either with use of a variety of methods from discrete mathematics, or through heavy computer searching. A large table of such record-breaking codes was published in 1990, and an extension to longer codes (but only for those values of formula_2 and formula_3 which are relevant for the GSM application) was published in 2006.\n\nA special case of constant weight codes are the one-of-\"N\" codes, that encode formula_7 bits in a code-word of formula_8 bits. The one-of-two code uses the code words 01 and 10 to encode the bits '0' and '1'. A one-of-four code can use the words 0001, 0010, 0100, 1000 in order to encode two bits 00, 01, 10, and 11. An example is dual rail encoding, and chain link used in delay insensitive circuits. For these codes, formula_9 and formula_10.\n\nSome of the more notable uses of one-hot codes include\nbiphase mark code uses a 1-of-2 code;\npulse-position modulation uses a 1-of-\"n\" code;\naddress decoder,\netc.\n\nIn coding theory, a balanced code is a binary forward error correction code for which each codeword contains an equal number of zero and one bits. Balanced codes have been introduced by Donald Knuth; they are a subset of so-called unordered codes, which are codes having the property that the positions of ones in a codeword are never a subset of the positions of the ones in another codeword. Like all unordered codes, balanced codes are suitable for the detection of all unidirectional errors in an encoded message. Balanced codes allow for particularly efficient decoding, which can be carried out in parallel. \n\nSome of the more notable uses of balanced-weight codes include\nbiphase mark code uses a 1 of 2 code;\n6b/8b encoding uses a 4 of 8 code;\nthe Hadamard code is a formula_11 of formula_12 code (except for the zero codeword),\nthe code;\netc.\n\nAn \"m\"-of-\"n\" code is a separable error detection code with a code word length of \"n\" bits, where each code word contains exactly \"m\" instances of a \"one\". A single bit error will cause the code word to have either or \"ones\". An example \"m\"-of-\"n\" code is the 2-of-5 code used by the United States Postal Service.\n\nThe simplest implementation is to append a string of ones to the original data until it contains \"m\" ones, then append zeros to create a code of length \"n\".\n\nExample:\n\nSome of the more notable uses of constant-weight codes, other than the one-hot and balanced-weight codes already mentioned above, include\nCode 39 uses a 3-of-9 code;\nbi-quinary coded decimal code uses a 2-of-7 code,\nthe 2-of-5 code,\netc.\n\n"}

It is similar to an interfluve. In the \"Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary\", R. S. McGregor defines it as \"a region lying between and reaching to the confluence of two rivers (esp. that between the Ganges and Yamuna).\"\n\nSince North India and Pakistan are coursed by a multiplicity of Himalayan rivers that divide the plains into \"doabs\" (i.e. regions between two rivers), the Indo-Gangetic plains consist of alternating regions of river, \"khadir\" and \"bangar\". The regions of the \"doabs\" near the rivers consist of low-lying, floodplains, but usually very fertile \"khadir\" and the higher-lying land away from the rivers consist of \"bangar\", less prone to flooding but also less fertile on average. \n\nKhadir is also called Nali or Naili, specially in northern Haryana the fertile prairie tract between the Ghaggar river and the southern limits of the Saraswati channel depression in that gets flooded during the rains. \n\nWithin bangar area, the Barani is any low rain area where the rain-fed dry farming is practiced, which nowadays are dependent on the tubewells for irrigation. Bagar tract, an example of barani land, is the dry sandy tract of land on the border of Rajasthan state adjoining the states of Haryana and Punjab. Nahri is any canal-irrigated land, for example, the \"Rangoi tract\" which is an area irrigated by the \"Rangoi channel/canal\" made for the purpose of carrying flood waters of Ghagghar river to dry areas. \n\nHistorically, villages in the \"doabs\" have been officially classified as \"khadir\", \"khadir-bangar\" (i.e. mixed) or \"bangar\" for many centuries and different agricultural tax rates applied based on a tiered land-productivity scale.\n\nThe Yamuna-Ganga Doab or Uttar Pradesh Doab designates the flat alluvial tract between the Ganges and Yamuna rivers extending from the Sivalik Hills to the two rivers' confluence at Allahabad. The region has an area of about 23,360 square miles (60,500 square km); it is approximately in length and in width.\n\nThe region of the \"Doab\" figures prominently in the history and myths of Vedic period. The British raj divided the \"Doab\" into three administrative districts, viz., Upper Doab (Meerut), Middle Doab (Agra) and Lower Doab (Allahabad).\n\nCurrently the following states and districts form part of the \"Ganga Doab\":\n\nUttarakhand:\nDehradun and Haridwar\n\nUttar Pradesh:\nSaharanpur, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Gautam Buddh Nagar and Bulandshahr\n\nDelhi\n\nEtah, Kasganj, Aligarh, Agra, Hathras, Firozabad, Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Mainpuri, Etawah, Auraiya and Mathura. Mathura is in the trans-Yamuna region of Braj.\n\nKanpur, Fatehpur, Kaushambi and Allahabad.\n\nEach of the tracts of land lying between the confluent rivers of the Punjab region of Pakistan and India has a distinct name, said to have been coined by Raja Todar Mal, a minister of the Mughal emperor Akbar. The names (except for 'Sindh Sagar') are a combination of the first letters, in the Persian alphabet, of the names of the rivers that bound the Doab. For example, Jech = 'Je'(Jhelum) + 'Ch'(Chenab). The names are (from west to east):\n\nThe Sindh Sagar Doab lies between the Indus and Jhelum rivers.\n\nThe Jech Doab (also \"Chaj Doab\") (small portion of the Jech Doab is Majha) lies between the Jhelum and the Chenab rivers.\n\nThe Rechna Doab (considerable portion of the Rechna Doab is Majha) lies between the Chenab and the Ravi rivers.\n\nThe Bari Doab (considerable portion of the Bari Doab is Majha) lies between the Ravi and the Beas rivers.\n\nThe Bist Doab (or Doaba) - between the Beas and the Sutlej rivers.\n\nThe rivers flowing through the Malwa region, covering current states of Madhya Pradesh and parts of north-eastern Rajasthan, also has doab region such as \"Upper Malwa doab\" and \"Lower Malwa doab\".\n\nThe Raichur Doab is the triangular region of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states which lies between the Krishna River and its tributary the Tungabhadra River, named for the town of Raichur.\n\n"}

Set for a launch in June of 2023, the spacecraft is being developed to study the Galilean moon Europa through a series of flybys while in orbit around Jupiter.\n\nThis mission is a scheduled flight of the Planetary Science Division, designated a Large Strategic Science Mission, and funded under the Planetary Missions Program Office's Solar System Exploration program as its second flight. It is also supported by the new Ocean Worlds Exploration Program. \"Europa Clipper\" will perform follow-up studies to those made by the \"Galileo\" spacecraft during its eight years in Jupiter orbit, which indicated the existence of a subsurface ocean underneath Europa. Plans to send a spacecraft to Europa were initially conceived with projects such as \"Europa Orbiter\" and \"Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter\", in which a spacecraft would be injected into orbit around Europa. However, due to the strong impact of radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere in Europan orbit, it was decided that it would be safer to inject a spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around Jupiter and make 45 close flybys of the moon instead. The mission began as a joint investigation between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nThe mission will complement ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer launching in 2022, which will fly-by Europa twice and Callisto multiple times before moving into orbit around Ganymede. Launching around the same time as the \"Europa Clipper\", the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will have a cruise phase some three times as long.\n\nThe \"Europa Clipper\" orbiter will be built and manufactured with a scientific payload of nine instruments, contributed by the JPL, APL, Southwest Research Institute, University of Texas, Arizona State University and University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nEuropa has been identified as one of the locations in the Solar System that could possibly harbor microbial extraterrestrial life. Immediately following the \"Galileo\" spacecraft's discoveries, JPL conducted preliminary mission studies that envisioned a capable spacecraft such as the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (a $16B mission concept), the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (a $4.3B concept), an orbiter ($2B concept), and a multi-flyby spacecraft: \"Europa Clipper\".\n\nThe proposed \"Europa Clipper\" is still in its planning phase, but the approximate cost is estimated at $2 billion. The mission is a joint project between the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The mission's name is a reference to the lightweight clipper ships of the 19th century that routinely plied trade routes around the world. The moniker was chosen because the spacecraft will \"sail\" past Europa, as frequently as every two weeks.\n\nIn March 2013, $75 million USD were authorized to expand on the formulation of mission activities, mature the proposed science goals, and fund preliminary instrument development, as suggested in 2011 by the Planetary Science Decadal Survey. In May 2014, a House bill substantially increased the \"Europa Clipper\" (referred to as \"Europa Multiple Flyby Mission\") funding budget for the 2014 fiscal year from $15 million to $100 million to be applied to pre-formulation work.\n\nFollowing the 2014 election cycle, bipartisan support was pledged to continue funding for the \"Europa Multiple Flyby Mission\" project. The executive branch has also granted $30 million for preliminary studies.\n\nIn April 2015, NASA offered to the European Space Agency to submit concepts for an additional probe to fly together with the \"Europa Clipper\" spacecraft, with a mass limit of 250 kg maximum. It could be a simple probe, an impactor, or a lander. An internal assessment at ESA is underway to see if there is interest and funds available, opening a collaboration scheme similar to the very successful \"Cassini-Huygens\" approach.\n\nIn May 2015, NASA chose nine instruments that would fly on board the orbiter. They will cost about $110 million over the next three years. In June 2015, NASA announced its approval of the mission concept, allowing the orbiter to move to its formulation stage, and in January 2016 it approved a lander as well. In May 2016 the Ocean Worlds Exploration Program was approved, of which the Europa mission is part. In February 2017 the mission moved from Phase A to Phase B. Phase B is the preliminary design phase of the mission, planned to continue through September 2018. In addition, subsystem vendors will be selected, as well as prototype hardware elements for the science instruments. Spacecraft subassemblies will be built and tested as well. Phases C and D include final design, spacecraft fabrication, assembly and testing, and launch.\n\nIn 18 July 2017, the House Space Subcommittee held hearings on the \"Europa Clipper\" as a scheduled Large Strategic Science Missions class, and to discuss a possible follow up mission simply known as the Europa Lander.\n\nThe goals of \"Europa Clipper\" are to explore Europa, investigate its habitability and aid in the selection of a landing site for the future Europa Lander. This exploration is focused on understanding the three main requirements for life: liquid water, chemistry, and energy. Specifically, the objectives are to study:\n\nBecause Europa lies well within the harsh radiation fields surrounding Jupiter, even a radiation-hardened spacecraft in near orbit would be functional for just a few months. Another key limiting factor on science for a Europa orbiter is not the time the instruments can make observations. Rather, it is the time available to return data to Earth. Most instruments can gather data far faster than the communications system can transmit it to Earth because there are a limited number of antennas available to receive the scientific data.\n\nStudies by scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory show that by performing several flybys with many months to return data, the \"Europa Clipper\" concept will enable a $2B mission to conduct the most crucial measurements of the cancelled $4.3B Jupiter Europa Orbiter concept. Between each of the flybys, the spacecraft will have seven to ten days to transmit data stored during each brief encounter. That will let the spacecraft have up to a year of time to transmit its data compared to just 30 days for an orbiter. The result will be almost three times as much data returned to Earth, while reducing exposure to radiation. The \"Europa Clipper\" will not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 flybys of Europa at altitudes from each during its 3.5-year mission. A key feature of the mission concept is that\nthe \"Clipper\" would use gravitational attraction from Europa, Ganymede and Callisto to change its trajectory, allowing the spacecraft to return\nto a different close approach point with each flyby. Each flyby would cover a different sector of Europa in order to achieve a medium-quality global topographic survey, including ice thickness. The \"Europa Clipper\" could conceivably flyby at low altitude through the plumes of water vapor erupting from the moon's icy crust, thus sampling its subsurface ocean without having to land on the surface and drill though the ice.\n\nThe \"Europa Clipper\" will inherit tested technology of the \"Galileo\" and \"Juno\" Jupiter orbiters with regards to radiation protection. Shielding will be provided by 150 kilograms of titanium. To maximize its effectiveness, the electronics will be nested in the core of the spacecraft for additional radiation protection.\nBoth radioisotope thermoelectric generator and photovoltaic power sources were assessed to power the orbiter. Although solar power is only 4% as intense at Jupiter as it is in Earth's orbit, powering a Jupiter orbital spacecraft by solar panels was demonstrated by the Juno Mission. The alternative to solar panels was a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, fueled with plutonium-238. The power source has already been demonstrated in the Mars Science Laboratory mission. Five units were available, with one reserved for the Mars 2020 rover mission and another as backup. In September 2013 it was decided that the solar array was the less expensive option to power the spacecraft, and on October 3, 2014, it was announced that solar panels were chosen to power \"Europa Clipper\". The mission's designers determined that solar was both cheaper than plutonium and practical to use on the spacecraft. Despite the increased weight of solar panels compared to plutonium-powered generators, the vehicle's mass had been projected to still be within acceptable launch limits.\n\nInitial analysis suggest that each panel will have a surface area of and produce 150 watts continuously when pointed towards the Sun while orbiting Jupiter. While in Europa's shadow, batteries will enable the spacecraft to continue gathering data. However, ionizing radiation can damage solar panels. The \"Europa Clipper\" orbit will pass through Jupiter's intense magnetosphere, which is expected to gradually degrade the solar panels as the mission progresses. The solar panels will be provided by Airbus Defense and Space Netherlands.\n\nThe \"Europa Clipper\" mission is equipped with a sophisticated suite of 9 instruments to study Europa's interior and ocean, geology, chemistry, and habitability. The spacecraft payload and trajectory are subject to change as the mission design matures. The nine science instruments for the orbiter, announced in May 2015, have an estimated total mass of and are listed below:\n\nThe \"Europa Clipper\" mission considers an extra mass of about 250 kg to carry an additional flight element. About a dozen proposals have been suggested, a few of which are described next:\n\nSince the \"Europa Clipper\" mission may not be able to easily modify its orbital trajectory or altitude to fly through the episodic water plumes, scientists and engineers working on the mission have investigated deploying from the spacecraft several miniaturized satellites of the CubeSat format, possibly driven by ion thrusters, to fly through the plumes and assess the habitability of Europa's internal ocean. Some early proposals include \"Mini-MAGGIE\", \"DARCSIDE\", and \"Sylph\". The \"Europa Clipper\" would relay signals from the nanosatellites back to Earth. With propulsion, some nanosatellites could also be capable of entering orbit around Europa.\n\n\n\nThe \"Europa Life Signature Assayer\" (ELSA) concept by the University of Colorado consists of a probe that is flown as a secondary payload. ELSA would use a small impactor to create a plume of subsurface particles and catapult them to altitudes where it would be able to pass through to collect samples and analyze them on board. A variation of this concept is the 1996 \"Ice Clipper\", which involves a 10 kg impactor that would be jettisoned from the main spacecraft to impact Europa, thereby creating a debris cloud in nearby space about 100 km altitude, subsequently sampled by a small spacecraft on a close flyby and use Europa's gravitational force for a free return trajectory. The collection mechanism is tentatively considered to be Aerogel (similar to \"Stardust\" mission).\n\nAn early \"Europa Clipper\" concept called for including a stationary lander about 1 meter in diameter, perhaps about with a maximum of for instruments plus propellant. Suggested instruments were a mass spectrometer and a Raman spectrometer to determine the chemistry of the surface. The lander was proposed to be delivered to Europa by the main spacecraft and possibly require the sky crane system for a high precision, soft landing near an active crevasse. The lander would operate about 10 days on the surface using battery power. In January 2016 it was determined that including the additional mass of a lander and detachable probes, meant the \"Europa Clipper\" may need be launched with NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) heavy lift launch vehicle that could arrive at Jupiter on a direct trajectory in less than three years.\n\nThe \"Europa Clipper\" would take about three years to image 95% of the surface of Europa at about 50 meters per pixel. With this data, scientists could then find a suitable landing site. By one estimate, including a lander could add as much as $1 billion to the mission's cost.\n\n\nIt was determined that designing a system capable of landing on a surface about which very little is known, is too much risk, and that the \"Europa Clipper\" will lay the foundation for a future landing mission by performing detailed reconnaissance first. This led to a stand-alone mission proposal in 2017: the Europa Lander. The NASA Europa Lander, if funded, would be launched separately in 2024 to complement the studies by the \"Europa Clipper\" mission. If funded, approximately 10 proposals may be selected to proceed into a competitive process with a $1.5 million budget per investigation.\n\nIn the baseline mission profile, \"Europa Clipper\" is planned to be carried aboard NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lift launch vehicle, on a direct trajectory to Jupiter in less than three years. , departure is scheduled for 2023. Since the development and readiness of the SLS may not match the mission's timing, an alternative trajectory profile would use a commercial rocket such as Delta IV Heavy or Falcon Heavy, with a longer 6-year cruise time involving gravity assist maneuvers at Venus, Earth and Earth again. Launch windows are available from 2022 to 2025.\n\n\n"}

This means that all practical decisions made within LIS should 1) be based on research studies and 2) that these research studies are selected and interpreted according to some specific norms characteristic for EBP. Typically such norms disregard theoretical studies and qualitative studies and consider quantitative studies according to a narrow set of criteria of what counts as evidence. If such a narrow set of methodological criteria are not applied, it is better instead to speak of \"research based library and information practice.\" \n\nEvidence-based practice in general has been characterised as a positivist approach; EBLIP is therefore also a positivist approach to LIS. As such, EBLIP is an approach in contrast to other approaches to LIS. The use of statistical approaches known as meta-analysis to conclude what evidence has been reported in the literature is one among other methods which is typical for the evidence-based approach.\n\nIn 2002, Booth noted the three schools of EBILP had some commonalities, including the context of day-to-day decision-making, an emphasis on improving the quality of professional practice, a pragmatic focus on the 'best available evidence', incorporation of the user perspective, the acceptance of a broad range of quantitative and qualitative research designs, and access, either first-hand or second-hand, to the (process of) evidence-based\npractice and its products. He added one more, that EBILP is concerned with getting the best value for money.\n\nEvidence-based practice in general is based on a very thorough search of the scientific literature and a very thorough selection and analysis of the retrieved literature. A close familiarity with database searching is needed, and library and information professionals have important roles to play in this respect. Therefore LIS professionals should be well suited to help professionals in other disciplines doing EBP. EBLIP is the application of this approach on LIS itself. It should be mentioned, however, that EBP started in medicine as evidence-based medicine (EBM) from which it spread to other fields. Only slowly and to a limited extent has EBP moved on to LIS. The EBLIP process can be applied to a variety of scenarios in LIS, including customer service, collection development, library management and information literacy instruction. In general, quantitative methods are used in LIS research.\n\nA 2010 study revealed that professionals experienced evidence-based practice as variously: not relevant; learning from published research; service improvement; a way of being and as a weapon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31512146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31512146", "title": "Far Eastern Party", "text": "Far Eastern Party\n\nThe Far Eastern Party was a sledging component of the 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, which investigated the previously unexplored coastal regions of Antarctica west of Cape Adare. Led by expedition commander Douglas Mawson, the party aimed to explore the area far to the east of their main base in Adélie Land, pushing about towards Victoria Land. Accompanying Mawson were Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz; the party used sledge dogs to increase their speed across the ice. Initially they made good progress, crossing two huge glaciers on their route south-east.\n\nOn 14 December 1912, with the party more than from the safety of the main base at Cape Denison, Ninnis and the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a crevasse and were lost. Their supplies now severely compromised, Mawson and Mertz turned back west, gradually shooting the remaining sledge dogs for food to supplement their scarce rations. As they crossed the first glacier on their return journey Mertz became sick, making progress difficult. After almost a week of making very little headway Mertz died, leaving Mawson to carry on alone.\n\nFor almost a month he pulled his sledge across the Antarctic, crossing the second glacier, despite an illness that increasingly weakened him. Mawson reached the comparative safety of Aladdin's Cave—a food depot from the main base—on 1 February 1913, only to be trapped there for a week while a blizzard raged outside. As a result, he missed the ship back to Australia; the SY \"Aurora\" had sailed on 8 February, just hours before his return to Cape Denison, after waiting for more than three weeks. With a relief party, Mawson remained at Cape Denison until the \"Aurora\" returned the following summer in December 1913.\n\nThe causes of Mertz's death and Mawson's related illness remain uncertain; a 1969 study suggested hypervitaminosis A, presumably caused by the men eating the livers of their Greenland Huskies, which are now known to be unusually high in vitamin A. While this is considered the most likely theory, dissenting opinions suggest prolonged cold exposure or psychological stresses. In 1976 explorer and mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary described Mawson's month-long journey as \"probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration\".\n\nThe Australasian Antarctic Expedition, commanded by Douglas Mawson, explored part of East Antarctica between 1911 and 1914. The expedition's main base was established in January 1912 at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay, Adélie Land. This was much farther west than originally intended; dense pack ice had prevented the expedition ship SY \"Aurora\" from landing closer to Cape Adare, the original eastern limit. Only after the \"Aurora\"—heading west—had rounded the ice tongue of the Mertz Glacier was a landing made.\n\nBattling katabatic winds that swept down from the Antarctic Plateau, the shore party erected their hut and began preparations for the following summer's sledging expeditions. The men readied clothing, sledges, tents and rations, conducted limited survey parties, and deployed several caches of supplies. The most notable of these depots was Aladdin's Cave, excavated from the ice on the slope to the south of the main hut.\n\nOn 27 October 1912 Mawson outlined the summer sledging program. Of the seven sledging parties that would depart from Cape Denison, three would head east. The Eastern Coastal Party, led by the geologist Cecil Madigan, was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue; they would initially be supported by the Near Eastern Party led by Frank Stillwell, which would then turn to mapping the area between Cape Denison and the glacier.\n\nThe final party, led by Mawson, would push rapidly inland to the south of the Coastal Party towards Victoria Land, an area he had explored during Ernest Shackleton's British Antarctic Expedition in 1908–09. He hoped to travel about east, collecting geological data and specimens, mapping the coast, and claiming territory for the crown.\n\nAssisting him on this Far Eastern Party would be Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz. They were in charge of the expedition's sledge dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the \"Aurora\" to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.\n\nBlizzards prevented the parties from leaving Cape Denison until 10 November 1912, four days after the scheduled start date. In his diary, Mertz recorded the clearing weather as \"definitely a good omen\". Mawson wrote a short letter to his fiancée, Paquita Delprat:\n\nAllowing Madigan and Stillwell's parties a head-start, Mawson, Ninnis, Mertz and the seventeen dogs left Cape Denison early in the afternoon, reaching Aladdin's Cave four hours later. Stopping for the night, they took on extra supplies and rearranged the sledges. The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges, which collectively carried half the weight of the party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge, towed by the second dog team.\n\nHeading south the following day to avoid crevasses to the east, they travelled about before poor weather forced them to stop and camp. Strong winds confined them to the tent until 13 November, and they were able to travel just a short distance before the weather picked up again. For three more days they remained in their tent, unable even to light the stove. When the weather cleared on 16 November, Madigan and Stillwell's parties joined them. The three parties travelled together for much of the following day, before Mawson's party separated and pushed on ahead in the late afternoon.\n\nHeading south-east towards the Mertz Glacier, with Mertz skiing ahead and Mawson and Ninnis driving the dogs, the party covered on 18 November. This was despite encountering sastrugi—ridges in the ice caused by wind—as high as , that caused the dogs to slip and the sledges to roll. During the day they passed two peaks, which Mawson named Madigan Nunatak and Aurora Peak, after the leader of the Eastern Coastal Party and the expedition's ship. The following day they began the steep descent to the Mertz Glacier. After the sledges several times overtook the dogs, the huskies were allowed to run free down the slope.\n\nFollowing a particularly steep descent the following day, half of Mawson's team of dogs—reattached to his sledges—were almost lost when they fell into a crevasse. They were hauled out, but Mawson decided to camp when one of the dogs, Ginger Bitch, gave birth to the first in a litter of fourteen pups.\n\nOver the next several days, the party continued across the glacier. They developed a method of crossing the many crevasses; the forerunner, on skis, would cross the snow covering the hole (the lid), and once across the first of the two dog teams would follow. Only after the first dog team was across would the second follow, \"otherwise\", wrote Mawson, \"the dogs in the rear would make a course direct for wherever the front dogs happened to be, cutting across corners and probably dragging their sledge sideways into a crevasse\". But despite their precautions Ninnis fell down and was rescued from three crevasses, once when they found they had pitched their tent on its lip.\n\nAfter Mawson slipped into a crevasse, they began to tie themselves to their sledges as a precaution. Ninnis developed photokeratitis (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride. They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse. On 24 November, the party reached the eastern side of the glacier and ascended to the plateau.\n\nOn level ground again, they began to make quick progress. They awoke on the morning of 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger than the first. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once at the bottom of the glacier they spent four days crossing fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.\n\nIn the harsh conditions, the dogs began to grow restless; one of them, Shackleton, tore open the men's food bag and devoured a pack of butter, crucial for their nourishment to supplement the hoosh. On 30 November, the party reached the eastern limit of the glacier and began the ascent to the plateau beyond, only to find themselves confronted at the top by sastrugi so sharp-edged the dogs were useless. Worse still, temperatures rose to , melting the snow and making pulling difficult; the party switched to travelling at night to avoid the worst of the conditions.\n\nFrom atop the ridge on the eastern side of the Ninnis Glacier, Mawson began to doubt the accuracy of the reports of land to the east by Charles Wilkes during the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition. By Wilkes' reckoning, Mawson recorded in his diary, \"We now appear to be off the real continent edge.\" Concerned about overlap with Madigan's party to the north, he turned his party south. They made good progress initially, but beginning on 6 December a blizzard confined them to their tent for three days. On 9 December, they set off again, but Ninnis was struggling. He had developed neuralgia on the left side of his face and a whitlow on one of his fingers. The latter was making sleep difficult for him, and on 13 December Mawson lanced the finger.\n\nOn the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.\n\nBy noon the next day they had covered from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted:\n\nNinnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as , too far for their ropes to reach. \"Dog ceased to moan shortly\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations. Came back, called & sounded for an hour. Read the burial service.\"\n\nAlong with the heavy-weather tent, most of their own food and all of the dogs' food, they had lost the pickaxe, the shovel, and Mertz's waterproof overpants and helmet. On Mawson's sledge they had their stove, fuel, sleeping bags, and ten days' worth of food. Their best immediate hope was to reach the camp of two days earlier where they had left the abandoned sledge and supplies, west. They reached it in five-and-a-half-hours, where Mertz used the tent cover, with the runners from the abandoned sledge and a ski as poles, to erect a shelter.\n\nThey were faced with two possible routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat, and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly to the south of their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs. The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs. \"On the whole it was voted good\" wrote Mawson of the meat, \"though it had a strong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed\".\n\nBefore setting off again they raised the flag—which they had forgotten to do at their furthest point—and claimed the land for the crown. With the temperature rising, they switched to travelling at night to take advantage of the harder surface the cold provided. With the five remaining dogs, Mawson and Mertz pushed on. Starving, the dogs began to struggle; two more—Johnson and Mary—were shot and divided between men and dogs over the following days. Mawson and Mertz found most of the meat tough, but enjoyed the liver; it, at least, was tender. With the pulling power of the dogs now severely depleted, Mertz stopped making trail and instead helped Mawson to pull the sledge. Despite the challenges, they made good progress; in the first four nights they travelled . As they approached the Ninnis Glacier on 21 December, Haldane—once the largest and strongest of the dogs—was shot.\n\nBoth men were suffering, but Mertz in particular started to feel ill. He complained of stomach pains, and this began to slow them down. Pavlova was killed, leaving only one remaining dog. Mawson decided to lighten their sledge, and much of the equipment—including the camera, photographic films, and all of the scientific equipment save the theodolite—was abandoned. On 29 December, the day they cleared the Ninnis Glacier, the last dog was killed. Mawson recorded: \"Had a great breakfast off Ginger's skull—thyroids and brain\". Two days later Mawson recorded that Mertz was \"off colour\"; Mertz wrote that he was \"really tired [and] shall write no more\".\n\nThey made on 31 December, no progress for the following two days, and 5 miles more on 3 January. \"[The] cold wind frost-bit Mertz's fingers\" recorded Mawson, \"and he is generally in a very bad condition. Skin coming off legs, etc—so had to camp though going was good.\" Not until 6 January did they make any more progress; they went before Mertz collapsed. The following day Mawson placed Mertz onto the sledge in his sleeping bag and continued, but was forced to stop and camp when Mertz's condition again deteriorated. Mawson recorded:\n\nStrong winds prevented Mawson from continuing for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove, he boiled the remainder of the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.\n\nAs the weather cleared on 11 January, Mawson continued west, estimating the distance back to Cape Denison at . He travelled 2 miles before pain in his feet forced him to stop; he found that the soles of his feet had separated as a complete layer. Applying lanolin to his feet and wrapping them in several pairs of socks under his boots, he continued. \"My whole body is apparently rotting from lack of nourishment\" he recorded, \"frost-bitten fingertips festering, mucous membrane of nose gone, saliva glands of mouth refusing duty, skin coming off whole body\". Averaging around 5 miles a day, he began to cross the Mertz Glacier. On 17 January he broke through the lid of a crevasse, but the rope around his waist held him to the sledge and halted his fall.\n\nTo save himself from future crevasses, Mawson constructed a rope ladder, which he carried over his shoulder and was attached to the sledge. It paid off almost immediately, and twice in the following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses. Once out of the Mertz Glacier his mileage increased, and on 28 January Madigan Nunatak came into view. The following day, after travelling 5 miles, a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about to his right. In it he found food and a note from Archibald Lang McLean, who along with Frank Hurley and Alfred Hodgeman had been sent out by \"Aurora\"'s captain John King Davis to search for the Far Eastern Party.\n\nFrom the note, Mawson learned he was south-east of Aladdin's Cave, and near two further food depots. The note also reported on the other parties of the expedition—all had returned to the hut safely—and on Roald Amundsen's attainment of the South Pole in December 1911. The cairn had been left there just six hours before, when the three men had returned to the hut. Struggling on his injured feet and lacking crampons (he had thrown his away after he crossed the Mertz Glacier), Mawson took three days to reach Aladdin's Cave.\n\nAlthough supplies had been left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed up the hill to meet him.\n\nThe \"Aurora\" arrived at Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east along the coast as far as the Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and reaching the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the \"Aurora\" was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.\n\nThe \"Aurora\" returned to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, to take the men home. The delay may have saved Mawson's life; he later told Phillip Law, then-director of Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE), that he did not believe he could have survived the sea journey so soon after his ordeal.\n\nThe cause of Mawson and Mertz's illnesses remains in part a mystery. At the time, McLean—the expedition's chief surgeon and one of the men who had remained at Cape Denison—attributed their sickness to colitis; Mawson wrote in \"The Home of the Blizzard\", his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and appendicitis. A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and R. V. Southcott of the University of Adelaide concluded that the symptoms Mawson described—hair, skin and weight loss, depression, dysentery and persistent skin infections—indicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A, an excessive intake of vitamin A. This is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland Huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts.\n\nWhile hypervitaminosis A is the generally accepted medical diagnosis for Mertz's death and Mawson's illness, the theory has its detractors. Law believed it was \"completely unproven ... The symptoms that were described are exactly the ones you get from cold exposure. You don't have to predicate a theory of this sort to explain the soles coming off your feet.\" A 2005 article in \"The Medical Journal of Australia\" by Denise Carrington-Smith suggested it may have been \"the psychological stresses related to the death of a close friend and the deaths of the dogs he had cared for\", and a switch from a predominately vegetarian diet that killed Mertz, not hypervitaminosis A.\nSuggestions of cannibalism—that Mawson may have eaten Mertz after his death—surfaced during Mawson's lecture tour of the United States following the expedition. Several reports in American newspapers quoted Mawson as saying he considered eating Mertz, but these claims were denied by Mawson, who labelled them \"outrageous\" and an \"invention\". Mawson's biographers believe the suggestion of cannibalism is probably wrong; Beau Riffenburgh notes that Mawson nursed Mertz for days, even at the possible risk to his own life. Moreover, he notes, Mawson had no way of knowing why Mertz died; eating his flesh could possibly have been very dangerous. These sentiments are echoed by Philip Ayres, who also notes that with Mertz's death Mawson had sufficient rations without having to resort to cannibalism. Law, who knew Mawson well, believed \"He was a man of very solid, conservative morals. It would have been impossible for him to have considered it.\"\n\nIn November 1913, shortly before the \"Aurora\" arrived to return them to Australia, the men remaining at Cape Denison erected a memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis on Azimuth Hill to the north-west of the main hut. The cross, constructed from pieces of a broken radio mast, was accompanied by a plaque cut from wood from Mertz's bunk. The cross still stands, although the crossbar has required reattaching several times, and the plaque was replaced with a replica in 1986. The two glaciers the Far Eastern Party crossed—previously unnamed—were named by Mawson for Mertz and Ninnis. At a celebration in the centre of Adelaide on his return from Antarctica, Mawson praised his dead companions: \"The survivors might have an opportunity of doing something more, but these men had done their all\".\n\nMawson's return was celebrated at the Adelaide Town Hall, in an event attended by the Governor-General, Lord Denman. A typical speaker stated that \"Mawson has returned from a journey that was absolutely unparalleled in the history of exploration—one of the greatest illustrations of how the sternest affairs of Nature were overcome by the superb courage, power and resolve of man\". Including the Far Eastern Party, sledging parties from the Cape Denison base covered over of previously unexplored land; the expedition's Western Base Party on the Shackleton Ice Shelf, under Frank Wild, covered a further .\n\nThe expedition was the first to use wireless radio in the Antarctic—transmitting back to Australia via a relay station established on Macquarie Island—and made several important scientific discoveries. First published in 1915, Mawson's account of the expedition, \"The Home of the Blizzard\", devotes two chapters to the Far Eastern Party; one contemporary reviewer commented that \"undoubtedly to the general public the interest of the book centres in [this] moving account\".\n\nA later analysis by J. Gordon Hayes, while commending most of the expedition, was critical of Mawson's decision not to use skis, but Fred Jacka, writing in the \"Australian Dictionary of Biography\", suggests that \"for Mawson and Ninnis, who were manoeuvring heavy sledges, this would have been difficult much of the time\". In his 1976 foreword to Lennard Bickel's book on the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, explorer and mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary described Mawson's journey as \"probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration\".\n\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\n\n"}

Early modern publications dealing with Old Norse culture appeared in the 16th century, e.g. \"Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus\" (Olaus Magnus, 1555) and the first edition of the\n13th century \"Gesta Danorum\" (Saxo Grammaticus), in 1514.\nIn 1603, Melchior Goldast made the first edition of Middle High German poetry, Tyrol and Winsbeck, including a commentary which focused on linguistic problems and set the tone for the approach to such works in the subsequent centuries. He later gave similar attention to the Old High German Benedictine Rule. In England, Cotton's studies of the manuscripts in his collection marks the beginnings of work on Old English language.\nThe pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the Edda (notably Peder Resen's \"Edda Islandorum\" of 1665).\n\nGermanic philology, together with linguistics as a whole, emerged as a serious academic discipline in the early 19th century, pioneered particularly in Germany by such linguists as Jacob Grimm, who discovered Grimm's law, on the sound change across Germanic languages.

Some argue that Shalit’s argument implies that a girl’s end goal is to remain modest for her ultimate end goal of marriage.

Manufacturers have said supposedly that the holograms \"optimise the natural flow of energy around the body, and supposedly improve an athlete's strength, balance and flexibility\". Only anecdotal evidence supports these claims and tests performed by the Australian Skeptics, the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, and the RMIT's School of Health Sciences have been unable to identify any effect on performance.\n\nHologram bracelets include a small hologram which manufacturers say is \"programmed\" through an undisclosed process. Power Balance, who have manufactured the bracelets since 2007, say that the programming \"mimics Eastern philosophies\". The holograms are most usually installed in bracelets and wristbands but are also sold as pendants or necklaces, anklets, shoe inserts, pet tags, or separately for users to apply to the back of a watch, for example.\n\nManufacturers including Power Balance and EFX Performance make no claims on their websites for their products, but carry testimonials from users who say that they improve athletic performance. Until 2010, Power Balance said that their bracelets helped improve an athlete's strength, balance and flexibility because the holograms are embedded with an \"electrical frequency\" that restores the body's \"electrical balance\" on contact with its natural energy field. In December 2010, following a successful legal action by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Power Balance admitted that there was no credible scientific evidence for these claims.\n\nMark Hodgkinson, writing in the Daily Telegraph in 2010, called hologram bracelets a fad with many professional athletes seen wearing them and several actively endorsing them. Footballers David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo have worn them, and tennis players Sam Querrey and Mardy Fish both wore them during the final of the 2010 Queen's Club Championships. Endorsements for the Power Balance bracelet have come from Shaquille O'Neal, Rubens Barrichello, and the London Wasps rugby team, while ice hockey team the Cardiff Devils announced a partnership with Power Balance in early 2010. NASCAR reported in 2011 that many drivers wore EFX Performance bracelets with the Hendrick Motorsports and Stewart-Haas Racing teams entering into licensing deals.\n\nSeveral groups have investigated the effects of hologram bracelets on athletic performance. A 2011 study by RMIT University's School of Health Sciences found that there was an overall decrease in the balance and stability of wearers, although it was not statistically significant and the overall conclusion was that the bracelets had no effect on performance. The Australian Skeptics group found that the bracelets has no more than a placebo effect.\n\nResearch by the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, commissioned by the BBC, also found that wearing the bracelets had no effect on performance in standard sports industry tests, adding that neither the physiology or the biology of wearers was changed. However, Dr Gareth Irwin who carried out the tests said that there may be changes in performance because of the placebo effect, a view which has been echoed by sports psychologists. Sports psychologist Victor Thompson says the bracelets play on superstition, simply giving people the expectation that they can improve their sporting performance. Cricket coach Jeremy Snape said he prefers that athletes have belief in themselves rather than in an external product, while Roberto Forzoni described the bracelets as \"gimmicks\" which allow athletes to avoid addressing real issues in their performance, with the high-profile endorsements giving the sense of belonging to an elite group of athletes.\n\n"}

The film stars Rutger Hauer as the commander of \"K-219\" and claims to be based on the true story. The film was produced by World Productions for the BBC and HBO, in association with Invision Productions and UFA Filmproduktions. It was written by Troy Kennedy Martin and directed by David Drury, and was first transmitted on BBC One on 26 July 1997.\n\n\"K-219\" performs a Crazy Ivan, and USS \"Aurora\" collides with her, causing a rupture of the seal on one of its ballistic missile tubes. The leaking seawater causes a corrosive reaction which floods the sub with toxic gas. The corrosive reaction starts a fire that floods the sub with more toxic gas, and smoke.\n\nThe captain surfaces the boat and moves the crew out to the deck, and attempts to vent the sub. The chief engineer informs the captain that the fire may cook off the nukes and cause a nuclear explosion. The launch doors are opened on the sub to vent smoke.\n\n\"Aurora\" ascertains that a fire is aboard \"K-219\", and informs the Pentagon. The Pentagon, fearing radiological contamination of the Eastern Seaboard, orders \"Aurora\" to prepare to sink \"K-219\". The fact that the launch doors are open on the SLBMs causes consternation in Washington D.C., with calls for the immediate sinking of the sub, should it appear to be preparing to launch.\n\nThe captain of \"K-219\" prepares a bold plan to dive with the launch doors open, to flood the missile bay and quench the fires. As the captain dives the sub, \"Aurora\" prepares to fire, assuming \"K-219\" is setting about to launch its missiles. After a brief but heated argument the U.S. commander is convinced to wait before launching and realises that the Soviet sub is diving, rather than launching its SLBMs.\n\n\"K-219\"'s tactic works, and the sub resurfaces with the fires out. A new crisis develops: Both nuclear reactors are overheating, and the cooling rods must be lowered manually by two crew members who have only limited oxygen left. The rods are lowered, and both reactors are shut down, averting disaster, but one crew member remains locked inside the reactor room, running out of oxygen. With seawater flooding the submarine, the captain of \"K-219\" decides to abandon ship. Throughout the crisis, Washington insists that no information on the possibility of nuclear fallout along the eastern American coastline be leaked to the Governors and no evacuation plans be activated to protect the population, in order not to derail the forthcoming Reykjavik Summit between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan.\n\nCapt. Britanov and his surviving crew members return safely to Moscow with some crew decorated and he being dismissed from the navy. The Reykjavik Summit takes place as planned.\n\nThe film's postscript details that as a legacy almost a decade after the end of the Cold War, fifty one nuclear war heads and seven nuclear reactors from nuclear submarines litter the North Atlantic ocean floor.\n"}

It needed only support a mission of no more than 36 hours with a spacecraft less complex than those used on future missions. Positions included those for monitoring the spacecraft and astronauts during flight as well as positions for supporting the launch and recovery of the capsule.\n\nThe MCC also featured a large backlit status map for display of the capsule position. Unlike later mission control centers which featured computer generated graphics, this Mercury era display operated with a physical two-dimensional representation of the capsule suspended and lit in front of the map.\n\nMore modern mission control centers were split between launch control, which is located at the launch site such as Cape Canaveral, and Mission Control which is located at the Lyndon B.

Glowing balls are alleged to naturally rise from the water high into the air. The balls are said to be reddish and to range in size from smaller sparkles up to the size of basketballs. They quickly rise up to a couple of hundred metres before disappearing. The number of fireballs reported varies between tens and thousands per night. The phenomenon is attributed to \"phaya nak\", a giant serpent said to live in the Mekong.\n\nThe fireballs are most often reported around the night of Wan Ok Phansa at the end of Buddhist Lent in late-October.\n\nNaga fireballs have been reported over an approximately 250 kilometre-long section of the Mekong River centered approximately on Phon Phisai in the Phon Phisai District. Fireballs have also been reported rising from smaller rivers, lakes, and ponds in the region.\n\nThe fireballs were called \"ghost lights\" by locals until the mid-1980s, when the local council, not unaware of their tourism potential, officially named them \"phaya nak lights\". One observer noted that, \"...the 'age-old' tradition is, actually, 35 years old.\"\n\nAlthough the fireballs are regularly seen on the river during the Phayanak Festival, a 2002 iTV documentary showed Laotian soldiers firing tracer rounds into the air across the river from the festival. Skeptic Brian Dunning suggests that it would be impossible for anyone across the half-mile river to hear a gunshot because it would take 2.5 seconds for the sound to travel to the spectators, and by then the crowd watching would have already noticed the light and started cheering, drowning out any sound to reach them. Thai biologist Jessada Denduangboripant analysed footage of a Naga fireball event and concluded that the effect was caused by the firing of flare guns from the other side of the river.\n\nSome individuals have attempted to explain the phenomenon scientifically. One explanation is that the fireball is a result of flammable phosphine gas generated by the marshy environment. Dunning writes that such fireballs are very unlikely to spontaneously ignite, and would not stay lit when at the speeds the fireballs travel, and that there is no science that can explain \"the Naga Fireballs to be naturally produced burning gas bubbles.\"\n\nA similar explanation involves a similar phenomenon in plasma physics. A free-floating plasma orb, created when surface electricity (e.g., from a capacitor) is discharged into a solution. However, most plasma ball experiments are conducted using high voltage capacitors, microwave oscillators, or microwave ovens, not under natural conditions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29873865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29873865", "title": "Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist", "text": "Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist\n\nNight Thoughts of a Classical Physicist is an historical novel by historian of science Russell McCormmach, published in 1982 by Harvard University Press. Set in 1918, the book explores the world of physics in the early 20th century—including the advent of modern physics and the role of physicists in World War I—through the recollections of the fictional Viktor Jakob. Jakob is an old German physicist who spent most of his career during the period of classical physics, a paradigm being confronted by the rapid and radical developments of relativistic physics in 1900s and 1910s. This conflict allows for extensive examination of the various tensions placed on Jakob by the academic environment, the German academic system, and the changing academic culture of the early 20th century.\n\nThe character of Jakob, a professor at a minor German university, is an amalgam of German physicists based on archival research by McCormmach. In the novel, he recalls interactions and events, documented in extensive footnotes to genuine publications and archival sources, involving many of the well-known physicists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \"Night Thoughts\", pointedly criticized for its lack of literary merit by some reviewers, was generally praised for its attempt at forging a new approach to history and historical fiction by incorporating extensive research into the text.\n\nThe novel is written as a traditional fictional biography. However, it uses footnotes to provide examples of historical proof for events and situations in Jakob's life as a way to prove the feasibility of situations. Also, alongside the historical footnotes which point to the lives of historical scientists, his study is decorated with photographs of the same scientists, creating a reflection of how he has been shaped by their precedence.\n\nHistorical reflections, and flashbacks – focusing mostly on the Franco-Prussian war and World War I – form a considerable part of the narrative.\n\nGeorge Steiner called McCormmach \"no novelist\" pointing to how he \"wisely ... avoids dialogue,\" commits numerous gaucheries, and how many of the dream sequences are flat. He felt that the work fails to show the passion which scientists feel for science. On the other hand, Mary Jo Nye wrote that McCormach's work \"might have pleased Polanyi\", who \"wanted to see passion, not only reason, in the depiction of the scientist’s life\".\n\nVictor Jakob, a Physics professor in a small German university, reflects on his life as a physicist, recalling major discoveries and ideas of recent decades and his interactions with prominent physicists whose ideas challenge the classical physics worldview. Meanwhile, the tide of World War I is turning against Germany, as the Allies mount The Second Battle of the Somme, pushing the German Second Army back over a 34 mi (55 km) front.\n\nAs he meditates on the changing world, Jakob hikes to a mountain overlooking his university, where he becomes trapped in a muddy ditch, while gunfire rings out below. In an apparently hopeless situation, he takes out his revolver and \"open[s] his mouth.\" (Some reviewers characterize his apparent death as an accident, while others interpret it as suicide, a parallel to that of Ludwig Boltzmann; John Maddox considered it open to interpretation whether Jakob succeeds in killing himself.)\n\nA major theme of \"Night Thoughts\" is the reinforcement of Thomas Kuhn's conception of history of science as a convoluted mesh of non-linear progress effected by the biography of the scientists. Jakob's research becomes the central means by which the author expresses Kuhn's theory, reinforcing each situation with footnotes which point to events in Jakob's life that mirror historical events. Jakob does not progress linearly in constructing his scientific theories, instead he must handle \"intellectual upheaval\" caused by factions in the study of physics, competition for recognition in the hierarchical German University system, tension caused by his students and his own feelings of incompetency. (Kuhn reviewed the manuscript before publication.)\n\nThe conflict between classical physics and relativistic physics is reflective of more than just the non-linear approach to science; it represents a larger conflict between the \"klassiche Bildung\", or a concept of education imbued from the greats of the past, and the newer forms of learning which were breaking away from this reliance on old knowledge. Jakob's reflections are similar to the reflections found in commentary on other aspects of society, including art and literature, comparing them to classical and romantic approaches to physics.\n\nA more traditional theme, indicated by the novel's title, is the crumbling world of an old man as he nears death and meditates on his life. The world of Physics that Jakob has known for most of his career is being overthrown by new theories and discoveries of younger scientists, while at the same time his country is nearing defeat in World War I. Jakob struggles with his own relative meager place in the German academic system, as professor at a minor university who is increasingly out of place in the world of modern physics. Jakob's desperation leads him to thoughts of suicide again and again.\n\nThe character of Viktor Jakob was based on extensive archival research and studies of personnel files of many German physicists who were contemporaries of the fictional professor, who (apparently) dies at the novel's conclusion at the age of 69, in 1918. McCormmach's research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation.\n\nVictor Weisskopf points out that there are several \"strange omissions\" from the historical context of the novel including Rutherford's discovery of the planetary atom and radioactivity which was the work of Rutherford, Kazimierz Fajans and Frederick Soddy.\n\nDue in part to its hybrid nature as both a novel and a work of historical scholarship, \"Night Thoughts\" was widely reviewed soon after publication from an unusually wide variety of perspectives. Literary critics, historians of science, and physicists took an interest in the book, and described its genre in a number of ways: from novel to historical novel to an \"intellectual-historical novel\" to \"a new art form: the scientific historical novel\". The novelty of the book was widely noted, with many reviewers calling it an experiment—in literary genre, or in historiographical technique. While generally praised as a work of history of science, the book received mixed reviews as a novel, with the emphasis on science and historical detail a detraction from a successful narrative.\n\nIn a review of the book's varied reception and interpretation, Lewis A. Lawson concluded that \"the book is a bad novel. Yet it would be a valuable addition to college courses ... most valuable in one of the new interdisciplinary courses that transcend specific disciplines in order to distinguish several different approaches to the acquisition of knowledge and to the validation of experience\". George Steiner responded similarly, saying that while the novel was poor and the writing \"no literary masterpiece\", \"they nevertheless constitute a very remarkable imaginative deed\" for \"bridging the gap between the ideals of literature and ... history of science\".\n\nPhilip Mirowski of Tufts University said that he \"would recommend this volume to any and all historians of economic thought who are dissatisfied with the self-satisfied air and narrow theoretical scope of existing texts.\" Similarly, Laurie Brown, a physicist at Northwestern University, noting that \"the idea of this book as a possible new genre in science history is so appealing that I should like to recommend it to a large audience.\" However, he also pointed out that it may not be very appealing as a novel because Jakob is not a \"fully developed character in the social world.\"\n\nCaitlin McKenna said McCormmach was wrong in referring to Jakob as an underdeveloped character; she praised Jakob and the novel extremely: \"What emerges is a whole and wholly believable character who single-handedly embodies the bafflement of the Western mind at the dawn of modernity. At once writer and scientist, McCormmach has called on both these roles to create a novel of imagination and intellect.\"\n\nIn 1995, Steven Weinberg presented a lecture, \"Night Thoughts of a Quantum Physicist\", to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences which expounded his view on the manner by which a new \"standard model\" for physics requires a change, similar to the paradigm shift which Jakob saw in the change from classical physics to quantum mechanics.\n\n"}

{"id": "1156815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1156815", "title": "Organizational ecology", "text": "Organizational ecology\n\nOrganizational ecology (also organizational demography and the population ecology of organizations) is a theoretical and empirical approach in the social sciences that is considered a sub-field of organizational studies. Organizational ecology utilizes insights from biology, economics, and sociology, and employs statistical analysis to try to understand the conditions under which organizations emerge, grow, and die.\n\nThe ecology of organizations is divided into three levels, the community, the population, and the organization. The community level is the functionally integrated system of interacting populations. The population level is the set of organizations engaged in similar activities. The organization level focuses on the individual organizations (some research further divides organizations into individual member and sub-unit levels).\n\nWhat is generally referred to as organizational ecology in research is more accurately population ecology, focusing on the second level.\n\nWharton School researcher William Evan called the population level the \"organization-set\", and focused on the interrelations of individual organizations within the population as early as 1966. However, prior to the mid-1970s, the majority of organizational studies research focused on adaptive change in organizations (See also adaptive management and adaptive performance). The ecological approach moved focus to the environmental selection processes that affect organizations.\n\nIn 1976, Eric Trist defined population ecology as \"the study of the organizational field created by a number of organizations whose interrelations compose a system at the level of the whole field\". He also advocated for organizational studies research to focus on populations and individual organizations as part of open rather than closed systems that have both bureaucratic (internal) regulation and ecological (community environment) regulation (see also Open and closed systems in social science).\n\nThe first explicit formulation of a theory of population ecology, by Michael T. Hannan and the late John H. Freeman in their 1977 \"American Journal of Sociology\" piece \"The population ecology of organizations\" and later refined in their 1989 book \"Organizational Ecology\", examines the environment in which organizations compete and how a process like natural selection occurs. This theory looks at the death of organizations (firm mortality), the birth of new organizations (organizational founding), as well as organizational growth and change.\n\nOrganizational ecology has over the years become one of the central fields in organizational studies, and is known for its empirical, quantitative character. Ecological studies usually have a large-scale, longitudinal focus (datasets often span several decades, sometimes even centuries). The books \"The Demography of Corporations and Industries\" by Glenn Carroll and Michael Hannan (2000) and \"Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Codes, and Ecologies\" by Michael Hannan, Laszlo Polos, and Glenn Carroll (2007), provide the most comprehensive overview of the various theories and methods in organizational ecology.\n\nOrganizational ecology focuses on how social (community) forces affect:\n\nOrganizational ecology is concerned with the capacity of the environment to support organizations and the rate of growth and decline of organizations within the environment. Each of these forces is a part of what is called \"Organizational Mortality\".\n\nThis factor holds that organizations that are reliable and accountable are those that can survive (favored by selection). A negative by-product, however, of the need for reliability and accountability is a high degree of inertia and a resistance to change. A key prediction of organizational ecology is that the process of change itself is so disruptive that it will result in an elevated rate of mortality.\n\nTheories about inertia and change are fundamental to the research program of organizational ecology, which seeks a better understanding of the broader changes in the organizational landscape. Given the limits on firm-level adaptation, most of these broader changes thus come from the entry and selective replacement of organizations. Hence organizational ecology has spent considerable effort on understanding the founding and mortality rates of organizations.\n\nHannan and Freeman define organizational inertia in terms of internal and external restraints. Internal restraints include investment and sunk costs; availability of information for decision makers; political restraints such as organizational culture; and organization history. External restraints include legal and fiscal barriers to market entry and exit; availability of information about the environment; external legitimacy; and collective rationality and strategy (See also Bounded rationality).\n\nNiche width distinguishes broadly between two types of organizations: generalists and specialists. Specialist organizations maximize their exploitation of the environment and accept the risk of experiencing a change in that environment. On the other hand, generalist organizations accept a lower level of exploitation in return for greater security.\n\nNiche theory shows that specialization is generally favored in stable or certain environments. However, the main contribution of the niche theory is probably the finding that \"generalism is not always optimal in uncertain environments\". The exception is produced by environments which \"place very different demands on the organization, and the duration of environmental states is short relative to the life of the organization\".\n\nThus, the niche theory explains variations in industrial structure in different industries. The theory shows how different structures in different industries (generalist vs specialist organizations) are shaped by relevant environments.\n\nOrganizational ecology also predicts that the rates of founding and mortality are dependent on the number of organizations (density) in the market. The two central mechanisms here are legitimization (the recognition or taken-for-grantedness of that group of organizations) and competition. Legitimization generally increases (at a decreasing rate) with the number of organizations, but so does competition (at an increasing rate). The result is that legitimization processes will prevail at low numbers of organizations, while competition will at high numbers.\n\nThe founding rate will therefore first increase with the number of organizations (due to an increase in legitimization) but will decrease at high numbers of organizations (due to competition). The reverse holds for mortality rates. Thus, the relationship of density to founding rates has an inverted U shape and the relationship of density to mortality rates follows a U-shaped pattern.\n\nHow an organization's risk of mortality relates to the age of that organization has also been extensively examined. Here, organizational ecologists have found a number of patterns:\n\n\nOrganizational ecology can be usefully compared with evolutionary theories in economics (e.g. Nelson & Winter, 1982). Hannan and Freeman also note the influences of biological ecology and economic evolution on their population ecology model (specifically Elton, 1927; Durkheim, 1947; Hawley, 1950; and Hutchison, 1959). Main similarities between these strands of literature are: (1) the emphasis on organizational routines and the limits to organizational adaptability, (2) the population or system level of analysis and (3) the importance of environmental selection. Organizational ecology's perspective is more Darwinistic (see Hannan & Freeman, 1989, pp 20–22), while Nelson & Winter (1982, p. 11) provide a more Lamarckian perspective. Another important difference concerns the question: What is selected by the environment-- 'organizational forms', as in organizational ecology, or 'routines' as in the evolutionary economics literature? Authors like Joel Baum and Arjen van Witteloostuijn have argued for the potential of cross-fertilization between these two research strands.\n\nA social networks perspective on the evolution of large scale interfirm organizational networks was presented by Braha et al. who propose micro-dynamic models that reproduce actual large-scale interfirm perceived competition networks. Several evolutionary mechanisms of organizational networks are identified: spatial locations of firms are positively correlated with the population density; interfirm competition is governed by cumulative advantage rules and geographic distance; and competition network formation and firm size dynamics are closely intertwined.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8376552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8376552", "title": "Plows, Plagues and Petroleum", "text": "Plows, Plagues and Petroleum\n\nPlows, Plagues and Petroleum: How Humans Took Control of Climate is a 2005 book published by Princeton University Press and written by William Ruddiman, a paleoclimatologist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Virginia. He has authored and co-authored several books and academic papers on the subject of climate change. Scientists often refer to this period as the “Anthropocene” and define it as the era in which humans first began to alter the earth’s climate and ecosystems. Ruddiman contends that human induced climate change began as a result of the advent of agriculture thousands of years ago and resulted in warmer temperatures that could have possibly averted another ice age; this is the early anthropocene hypothesis.\n\nRuddiman begins the book with a brief introduction to the science of climate change and the various individuals that have been key in influencing the field over the years. He also notes that the earth’s climate has been drifting toward cooler temperatures for the last 55 million years. The dominant hypothesis for this trend is that large volcanic eruptions have subsided while increasing amounts of carbon dioxide have been absorbed out of the atmosphere due to interactions between monsoon rains and ground up rock exposed by India pushing into Asia and creating the Himalayas. Additionally it is believed that the melting ice that produced higher sea levels resulted in the ocean absorbing more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. These two natural occurrences resulted in less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hence possibly producing the general cooling trend.\n\nAccording to Ruddiman, beginning about 900,000 years ago the earth has begun to go through regular glacial cycles in which glaciers or ice have covered approximately one quarter of the earth’s total surface. These conditions typically last for about 100,000 years and are followed by brief interglacial periods of more temperate weather. Ruddiman cites various researchers in geology and astronomy who pioneered the understanding of earth’s climate as a function of its orbit. The various cycles of earth’s climate seem to be explained by the eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit as well as cycles in the amount of solar radiation. Ruddiman primarily relies on the groundwork by Milutin Milankovitch to explain the effects of solar radiation and earth’s orbit on the climate. By examining ice cores from around the world scientists have been able to link levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane to the various cycles of earth’s climate history. The discovery of carbon dating aided a great deal in developing this understanding. Upon investigating the levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the earth’s atmosphere in the most recent interglacial period--10,000 years ago--Ruddiman noticed that levels of carbon dioxide and methane were steadily rising despite the fact that the earth’s natural cycles determined that they should have been decreasing. It was this discovery that lead to Ruddiman’s search for an explanation and ultimately the creation of this book.\n\nRuddiman’s central argument is that this most recent interglacial period has deviated from the natural cycle because of human activities, most importantly farming. Approximately 10,000 years ago the ice that once covered large portions of the northern hemisphere began to recede and gave rise to a new way of life for early humans. In the beginning these early humans had little impact on the environment because they were primarily hunter gatherer societies that moved from location to location allowing previously inhabited locations to be reclaimed by nature. However, about 8,000 years ago humans first developed agriculture and a domesticated lifestyle that allowed them to continually inhabit regions and build large civilizations. Ruddiman claims that carbon dioxide emission records indicate that levels in the atmosphere began to rise at about this same time. This process was intensified as the centuries passed and new technologies such animal husbandry and the plow made their way into more and more cultures. These new technologies allowed for more efficient methods of clearing forests and making room for increasing populations. According to previous interglacial periods the concentration of carbon dioxide should have fallen by about 20 parts per million instead of rising by 20 parts per million. Ruddiman uses estimates of population, forest cleared per person and carbon emitted per each square kilometer cleared to approximate the total impact and concludes that the magnitude is reasonably close to the extra carbon dioxide accumulated during the period.\nRuddiman also attributes the rise of methane gas in the atmosphere to human related activities. The most notable of these activities is the cultivation of rice in artificial wetlands in Asia and increased animal waste due to increasing populations of domesticated animals. According to Ruddiman methane concentrations should have peaked about 11,000 years ago slightly above 700 parts per billion and then declined to about 450 parts per billion today. Methane levels followed this cycle at first, but about 5000 years ago they began to rebound and currently the concentration is about 275 parts per billion above the previous trends.\n\nAccording to Ruddiman farming and related activities resulted in large amounts of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane) being released into the atmosphere at a time when natural cycles of the earth indicated they should have been falling. The result has been an unintended warming cycle that prevented the earth from entering into another ice age. Ruddiman goes as far as to say that if these gases had not been released into the atmosphere, areas in northern Canada such as Hudson Bay and Baffin Island would currently be covered in ice today. The implications of this theory are wide-ranging and most certainly worthy of further exploration.\n\nThroughout the record of carbon dioxide and methane emissions there are drops and rises in the amount of concentrations present in the atmosphere. Ruddiman explains these “wiggles” by claiming that they appear at times of major outbreaks of disease such as the bubonic plague in the 1,300’s and the prevalence of old world diseases in the Americas after the arrival of Columbus. Both of these events resulted in large numbers of people dying and the land they once inhabited being reclaimed by the forest. This resulted in increased amounts of carbon dioxide being taken out of the atmosphere, hence causing global temperatures to cool down. Ruddiman claims that the little ice age, starting in the 13th century and ending sometime in the early 19th century was caused by the decreased population and the re-forestation of previously cleared lands as a result from the diseases that killed off so many people.\n\nThe last aspect of Ruddiman's discussion of climate change relates to the future of petroleum use on earth. It is commonly known that the world’s supply of fossil fuels is rapidly depleting and even conservative estimates claim that the supply will not last much more than 150-200 more years. Ruddiman claims that when this sources of natural fuels has been depleted, human kind will have to resort to using the large quantities of coal that still exist all over the planet. This, according to Ruddiman, will result in a continued warming trend that will only stop when technology either produces a new source of fuel or figures out a way to separate the carbon dioxide emissions prior to being released into the atmosphere. Ruddiman is quite skeptical of both scenarios in the near future because of the increased costs and technological advancements that would have to be made in such a short time. Eventually carbon and methane emissions will be controlled and lowered a great deal and Ruddiman asserts when this happens the earth will most likely begin an era of cooling temperatures.\n\nGavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, described Ruddiman's ideas as intriguing, but the conclusions largely depended on a comparison of methane changes in the current warm period with those in the Vostok ice core which correlated with orbital changes, and more recent research indicated that these might not be applicable to present changes. The newer EPICA core showed only a small increase in methane during the last 5,000 years, which was generally attributed to the development of the boreal wetlands and major river deltas after the ice from the previous ice age melted and caused the sea level to rise to its current location. It was very uncertain that the relatively small human populations and cultivated areas could have made a significant difference. More research was needed to quantify relevant factors.\n\n\n\n"}

The winning mission proposals received $450 million in funding towards mission development and construction, along with bonus funding if missions were able to incorporate certain technologies. For Discovery Mission 13 and 14, NASA received 28 proposals, 16 of which notably centered around small Solar System bodies. \"Lucy\", a multiple-flyby mission to the Jupiter trojans, and \"Psyche\", a mission to the metallic asteroid 16 Psyche, were announced as the winners of the competition in January 2017, with launches in October 2021 and October 2023, respectively.\n\nBoth \"Lucy\" and \"Psyche\" were part of a finalist shortlist that was announced by NASA in September 2015, which also included \"DAVINCI\", a Venus atmospheric probe, \"VERITAS\", a Venus orbiter in the style of \"Magellan\", and \"NEOCam\", a space observatory focusing on the detection of potentially hazardous Near-Earth objects. It was the first time since the Discovery Mission 7 and 8 selection in 1999 that five finalists were chosen, as opposed to the traditional three. Each finalist received $3 million to develop their mission proposals, with the \"NEOCam\" concept winning additional year in funding from NASA at the end of the competition. It was also the first time since the selection of Discovery Mission 9 and 10 in 2001 that two missions were chosen to fly in a single round.\n\nThe ability for the Discovery program to launch missions on a regular basis was hampered by cuts to NASA's budget over the course of the late 2000s and early 2010s, leading to only two Announcements of Opportunities for the Discovery program in the 21st century. NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG), in their \"Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022\" survey published in March 2011, made a recommendation to NASA, calling to \"maintain the original goals of the Discovery program\" by creating a short time-frame cadence of two years between launches. They also made a recommendation to select and fund two mission concepts during each 18-24 month period, rather than one, which would ultimately result in one Discovery mission launch each year.\n\nPrior to the call of opportunity that started the competition for the 13th Discovery mission, 11 missions had been launched in the program. The 12th mission, \"InSight\", was delayed from its initial March 2016 launch date, following failed attempts to contain leaks in one of the spacecraft's main instruments, during numerous vacuum tests. The launch has since been delayed to May 2018 - a year after the end of the competition and two years before the launch of the 13th Discovery mission, with a cost overrun of $150 million. Concern for the cost overrun, the seven-year gap in Discovery program launches, and their effect on the program were raised, though officials at NASA insisted that the issues faced with \"InSight\" would not affect the program and the Discovery Mission 13 competition.\n\nFor the first time, the $450 million cost cap will not include post-launch operations expenses. The final requirements were released on November 5, 2014; amongst other things they clarified the laser communication package was not a requirement but, if included, could grant a budgetary bonus.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Discovery Mission 12 competition, the congressional deadline for the next Announcement of Opportunity (AO) was set for May 1, 2014. The United States Congress approved of a $75 million increase in the budget for the Discovery program from the Obama Administration's original FY14 request, as with other divisions and projects at NASA. Officials from NASA's Science Mission Directorate, however, stated in January 2014 that this deadline would not be met, and that it would possibly be delayed by several months. James \"Jim\" Green, Director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, noted in a press conference that \"they gave us the date of May 1st, and that's not realistic,\" stating that the deadline was not feasible in context of the declining budget allocated for the Discovery program over the past decade. A month later, a draft AO for the 13th mission of the Discovery Program was released by the Goddard Space Flight Center, outlining a process in which three finalists will be chosen to receive $3 million to further develop their proposals, with the winner receiving $450 million in funding to construct their spacecraft and operate the mission, excluding launch costs – a $50 million decrease from the $500 million in funding originally anticipated by NASA. The draft AO, which included potential financial incentives for technologies that would eventually make it into the final AO for Discovery Mission 13, such as the Heat Shield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) and the Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) The device will be able to increase spacecraft communications performance and efficiency by 10 to 100 times over conventional means. stated an anticipated release date for the final AO in September 2014 – four months after the original congressional deadline. The official text of the draft was released in full on July 2, 2014, with the final AO being released on November 5.\n\n28 proposals for the next Discovery mission were received by NASA before its deadline of February 26, 2015. On the day of the deadline, Lockheed Martin Space Systems announced that they were supporting many of the proposals as contractors. While NASA does not disclose which proposals they receive for Discovery program missions, many mission teams went public with their proposals, through various scientific and astronomical meetings and conferences throughout the year. One particular entrant in the competition aimed at Enceladus, the astrobiology \"Enceladus Life Finder\" mission, received significant attention from news media over the course of the first round. The \"Io Volcano Observer\" was also revealed as an entrant in the competition at the 64th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in March 2015 - its third attempt after previously entering in the competitions for Discovery Mission 12 and New Frontiers Mission 3. A number of proposals targeting minor planets were also unveiled by their respective teams through briefings held at the NASA Small Bodies Assessment Group's three-hour meeting on June 30, 2015. During the meeting, three more contractors were revealed as supporting numerous entrants in the competition – Ball Aerospace, Boeing Defense, Space & Security, and Orbital ATK. A notable event that occurred during the competition's first round was the September 2015 announcement of NASA's termination of involvement with the B612 Foundation's \"Sentinel Space Telescope\", an infrared space observatory focused on discovering a number of new Near-Earth objects (NEOs). The mostly similar \"NEOCam\" proposal, which was also a NEO-seeking infrared space observatory mission, sought to benefit from the termination of NASA's involvement with \"Sentinel\" by acting as a suitable replacement mission.\n\nIn September 2015, out of the numerous proposals sent to NASA for consideration, five were officially chosen for selection to participate in the competition's final round. The selections included \"DAVINCI\" and \"VERITAS\", two spacecraft targeted at Venus; a planet NASA had not visited since 1994 with \"Magellan\". Also selected were \"Psyche\" and \"Lucy\", two missions targeted at asteroids, and \"NEOcam\", a space observatory focused on Near-Earth objects. This is the first time since the selection of Discovery Mission 7 and 8, back in 1999, that five missions were selected to be finalists; typically only three are chosen to compete. The reasoning behind this, according to NASA, was to open up the possibility of selecting two missions, instead of one, to fund and launch. Site visits by NASA personnel of the proposed operations and manufacturing centers of each of the five proposed missions occurred in November and December 2016. In particular, Karin Valentine of the Arizona State University recounted 30 representatives of NASA arriving at Space Systems Loral, the proposed manufacturing site for the \"Psyche\" mission, spending nine hours interviewing staff and members of the mission team during their site visit. Principal investigator Linda Elkins-Tanton stated that the \"Psyche\" team had spent up to six months preparing for the visit, though remarking that \"was almost not enough time [...] presenting answers to these complex and technical questions about our mission really took the team of about 140 people many long and hard-worked days.\"\nThroughout the year of the final, renewed focus and attention was drawn on Venus, following the selection of \"DAVINCI\" and \"VERITAS\". Contemporary public and media interest in Venus had escalated after the successful second orbital insertion attempt of \"Akatsuki\" in December 2015, and its subsequent early data returns from the planet through the year afterward. Both \"VERITAS\" and \"DAVINCI\" were featured prominently in the media during this time, through recent discoveries concerning volcanism on the planet, and a frigid cold layer in Venus atmosphere; both subjects of interest to each respective mission. In addition, the missions were also treated features in journals and websites such as \"Nature,\" and \"Universe Today\". \"Psyche\" was also publicized in the media in the final months leading up to the selection, after evidence for water on 16 Psyche, the target of the mission, was discovered in October 2016.\n\nThe press conference convened to publicly reveal the winner of the competition on January 4, 2017 was announced the day earlier, after two delays from original selection dates in September and December 2016. The winners of the competition, \"Lucy\" and \"Psyche\", were announced via a press release two hours before the conference. An additional end result of the competition was also an additional year of funding for proposal development for \"NEOCam\" under a \"Phase A\" study. Jim Green stated that the selection of the missions were a part of NASA's \"larger strategy of investigating how the Solar System formed and evolved\", describing asteroids and minor planets as the \"additional pieces of the puzzle [that will] help us understand how the sun and its family of planets formed, changed over time, and became places where life could develop and be sustained, and what the future may hold.\"\n\nThe deadline for proposals was February 16, 2015 and may have included some of the following mission candidates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the competition to select the 13th Discovery mission, 28 proposals were submitted to NASA from various institutions; roughly the same number of proposals received during the competition for the 12th Discovery mission in 2011. 16 of these proposals were notably focused on small Solar System bodies, including asteroids, comets, kuiper belt objects, and planetary moons. 27 of the 28 proposals were disclosed to the public before finalists were chosen in September 2015:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17446193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17446193", "title": "Serfdom in Tibet controversy", "text": "Serfdom in Tibet controversy\n\nThe serfdom in Tibet controversy rests on Chinese claims of moral authority for governing Tibet, portraying Tibet as a \"feudal serfdom\" and a \"hell on earth\" prior to its invasion in 1950. Claims of unfree labour practices have been a recurrent theme, covering periods both before and after the Chinese takeover. Supporters of the Chinese position highlight statements by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) that, prior to 1959, 95% of Tibetans lived in \"feudal serfdom\", and cite cases of abuse and cruelty in the traditional Tibetan system. Western responses have tended to attempt to discredit the Chinese claims as part of an effort to discredit the takeover of Tibet.\n\nOne of the central points of contention in the debate about labour and human rights in the historical region of Tibet before and after its incorporation into the modern state of the People's Republic of China is the very definition of Tibet and serfdom itself, with some scholars claiming that the debate is framed around Eurocentric, Sinocentric and anachronistic ideas about statehood and society which are projected onto the history of the area in a way that distorts understanding. Some western scholars reject claims of \"serfdom in Tibet\" outright based on the view that \"Tibet\" cannot be defined as one political entity or social system; its political and socioeconomic structures have varied greatly over time and between sub-districts. The various polities comprising Tibet have changed significantly over the past 2,000 years, and even during the modern period there have been dramatic changes in what Tibet is, as anthropologist Geoff Childs writes: \"[Tibet] has undergone numerous political transformations from a unified empire (640–842) incorporating parts of what are now Nepal, India, Pakistan, and several provinces of China (Gansu, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan), to a collection of independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities associated with various monasteries (842–1248), to protectorate under the power of an expanding Mongol empire (1248–1368), back to a collection of independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities associated with various monasteries (1368–1642), to a centralized state under the clerical administration of the Dalai Lamas (1642–1720), to a protectorate of the Manchu Qing Dynasty (1720–1911), and finally to a nation having de facto independence under the clerical administration of the Dalai Lamas (1911–1951)\"Although the central leadership in Lhasa had authority of these areas for various periods, some Western writers claim that this did not imply the kind of political control of modern Western states. According to Luciano Petech, \"K'ams [the Kham region, largely synonymous with the province of XIkang which was abolished in 1950] was practically independent of Lhasa under its great lamas\" in the 18th century CE. Furthermore, the areas of Qinghai with large Tibetan populations were not continuously ruled by Lhasa, including in the period leading up to the establishment of the PRC (in the late 1930s and 1940s) when the Kuomintang Muslim warlord Ma Bufang ruled Qinghai within the Republic of China (ROC).\n\nThe definition of Tibet has been contested with a map of competing claims identifying six distinct types of Tibetan regions claimed by various entities. In the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and in the ROC (1912-1949), the part of Tibet governed by Lhasa was limited to the modern Tibet Autonomous Region, and did not include the Kham (Xikang) Province of China. Meanwhile, the western part of Xikang (i.e. Qamdo) and Qinghai was only occupied by Lhasa in the Tibet-Kham War which lasted from the 1910s to 1930s.\n\nGenerally, the government of the PRC also limits Tibet to the area it has designated the Tibet Autonomous Region, consisting of the traditional areas of Ü, Tsang, Ngari, along with Qamdo (i.e. the western Kham/Xikang) which was legally incorporated into the TAR when Xikang Province was abolished by the NPC in 1955. The Tibetan government in exile claims that other ethnically Tibetan areas to the east and to the north also belong to Tibet, i.e. \"Greater Tibet\". These areas now respectively belong to Qinghai Province, Gansu Province, Sichuan Province and Yunnan Province of China. Scholarship frequently represents a limited survey, restricted to the central region of Tibet, and may not accurately represent the whole of cultural Tibet or all Tibetan speaking peoples.\n\nDiscussing the social structure of Tibet inevitably leads to difficulties with defining terms. Not only may serf and feudalism be Western terms inappropriate for Asian use but the geography and peoples of Tibet vary according to interpreter. The lack of agreement of the various sides as to terminology highlights that the \"serfdom in Tibet\" controversy is a politicised debate, with the term \"feudal serfdom\" largely being used by the People's Republic of China as a justification for their taking control of Tibet. According to the PRC:...there was a historically imperative need for the progress of Tibetan society and the welfare of the Tibetan people to expel the imperialists and shake off the yoke of feudal serfdom. The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 brought hope for the deeply distressed Tibetan people. In conforming to the law of historical development and the interests of the Tibetan people, the Central People's Government worked actively to bring about Tibet's peaceful liberation. After that, important policies and measures were adopted for Tibet's Democratic Reform, regional autonomy, large-scale modernization and reform and opening-up.\n\nHowever, the Tibetan government in exile responds: \n...the Chinese justifications make no sense. First of all, international law does not accept justifications of this type. No country is allowed to invade, occupy, annex and colonize another country just because its social structure does not please it. Secondly, the PRC is responsible for bringing more suffering in the name of liberation. Thirdly, necessary reforms were initiated and Tibetans are quite capable of doing so.\n\nIt is difficult to find academic consensus on the nature of society in Tibetan history. Sources on the history of Tibet are available from both pro-Chinese and pro-Tibetan writers.\n\nPro-Chinese materials may be published by mainstream Western printers, or within the People's Republic of China. Tibetan materials, similarly, may be published by mainstream Western printers, or by the Tibetan Government in Exile. Both sides hope to persuade foreign readers to support their own point of view through these publications.\n\nMany of the pro-Chinese works in English on the subject were translated from Chinese. Translators are not named, but censors are. Asian studies scholar John Powers concludes that ideology was the most powerful influence on the translations: \"In contemporary China, the Communist Party strictly controls the presentation of history, and several formal resolutions have been issued by the Central Committee, which are intended to guide historians in the \"correct\" interpretation of historical events and actors.\" The writings of contemporary Chinese historians conform to Marxist-Leninist doctrine, which asserts that societies progress from primitive communism, to slave societies, which are then overthrown and replaced by feudalism, which are in their turn overthrown and replaced by capitalism, which is followed - via rebellion, again - by socialism, which may progress peacefully toward communism. Several Chinese sources insert peasant rebellions into their accounts of Tibetan history, to achieve conformity with this structure required by political dogma. Historians in China are prevented from performing research that could challenge orthodoxy. Marx condemned religion as \"the opiate of the masses\", and this doctrine is also infused in Chinese writings on history. In accordance with their political perspectives, Chinese sources claim that the common Tibetans suffered appallingly before the Chinese takeover.\n\nWestern authors' writings on Tibetan history are sometimes controversial. For example, whilst Hugh Richardson, who lived in Lhasa in the 1930s and 1940s, before the takeover by the PRC in 1951, writes in \"Tibet and Its History\" that Chinese versions of Tibetan history are contemptible and he considers the Chinese rule brutal and illegal, Israel Epstein, a naturalized Chinese citizen born in Poland who similarly claims the authority of first-hand knowledge, although following the Chinese takeover, supports Chinese rule. There are few academic assessments of the recent history of Tibet. Anthropologist and historian Melvyn Goldstein, who is fluent in Tibetan and has done considerable fieldwork with Tibetans in exile and in Tibet, considers pre-1950 Tibet to have been a feudal theocracy impaired by corrupt and incompetent leaders. It was \"de facto\" independent of China from 1911 to 1949, but not recognised as \"de jure\" independent of China by any nation, including its protective power Great Britain.\n\nThe Chinese side seeks to persuade international perception as to the appropriate nature and justifiability of Chinese rule in Tibet. Their position is that Tibet truly and historically belongs to China, that affairs of Tibet are internal matters, and Tibetans seek to internationalize their cause, in part by convincing readers that Tibet was independent. Concentrating as it does on questions of national sovereignty, the official position of the Tibetan Government in Exile is more moderate in tone than that of some of its more extreme supporters who conflate the rule of the lamas with Tibetan Buddhist ideals, seeking to promote a Buddhist dogma that competes with the Marxist dogma of \"feudal serfdom\" by portraying Tibet under the lamas as, in Robert Thurman's words: \"a mandala of the peaceful, perfected universe\".\n\nTibetologist Robert Barnett writes:\n\nChinese sources portray Tibet before 1950 as a feudal serfdom in which serfs suffered terribly under the despotic rule of lamas and aristocrats. Some Tibetan sources describe the people as happy, content, and devoted to Buddhism. On the other hand the Tibetan Phuntsok Wangyal, who founded the Tibetan communist party in the 40's, describes the old system as unequal and exploitative.\n\nOne of the earliest publications in English to apply the term \"serf\" to Tibet was Marxist sympathiser Anna Louise Strong's work from 1960, \"When Serfs Stood up in Tibet\", published by the Chinese government. Another seminal promoter of the term is historian A. Tom Grunfeld, who based his writings on the work of British explorers of the region, in particular Sir Charles Bell. It has been argued that his book is not supported by traditional Tibetan, Chinese, or Indian histories, that it contains inaccuracies and distortions, and that Grunfeld's extracts from Bell were taken out of context to mislead readers. Grunfeld is a polarizing figure for the Chinese, who praise his work, his scholarship, and his integrity; and the Tibetans, who match this praise with condemnation, calling him a \"sinologist\" who lacks authority on Tibetan history due to his inability to read Tibetan and his not having been to Tibet before writing his book. Political scientist Michael Parenti's 2003 (revised in 2007) essay \"Friendly Feudalism:The Tibet Myth\" was largely based on the preceding work of Stuart and Roma Gelder (\"Timely Rain: Travels in New Tibet\" 1964), Strong and Grunfeld.\n\nMelvyn Goldstein has produced many works on Tibetan society since the 1960s and used \"serf\" to translate the Tibetan term \"mi ser\" (literally \"yellow person\"; also translated as peasant\") and to describe both the landless peasant classes and the wealthier land holding and taxpaying class of families. He has written, \"with the exception of about 300 noble families, all laymen and laywomen in Tibet were serfs (\"Mi ser\") bound via ascription by parallel descent to a particular lord (dPon-po) though an estate, in other words sons were ascribed to their father's lord but daughters to their mother's lord.\" In his 1989 book \"A History of Modern Tibet\" Goldstein argued that although serfdom was prevalent in Tibet, this did not mean that it was an entirely static society. There were several types of serf sub-status, of which one of the most important was the \"human lease\", which enabled a serf to acquire a degree of personal freedom. This was an alternative which, despite retaining the concept of lordship, partially freed the \"mi ser\" from obligations to a landed estate, usually for an annual fee. In 1997 Goldstein used the term \"serf\" in the following, more cautious, way \"...monastic and aristocratic elites ... held most of the land in Tibet in the form of feudal estates with hereditarily bound serflike peasants.\" Powers has characterized Goldstein as \"generally pro-China\" but also called his \"History of Modern Tibet\" \"the most balanced treatment\". Goldstein describes himself as having conservative political views. According to William Monroe Coleman, China misrepresents Goldstein's usage as support for their version of Tibetan history.\n\nGoldstein distinguished serfdom from feudalism, and applied the term \"serfdom\" but not \"feudalism\" to old Tibet. Furthermore, he made some effort to avoid appearing to support China's invasion of Tibet, writing that the PRC left the traditional system in place, not only after the invasion of 1950, but even after the Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959. He pointed out that in 1950, Chinese rhetoric claimed that China was freeing Tibet, not from serfdom, but from imperialist influence. Nevertheless, his usage has been misinterpreted as support for the Chinese Marxist viewpoint, in which feudalism and serfdom are inseparable, and old Tibet is consistently described as \"feudal serfdom\".\n\nNot all writers who use the term \"serfdom\" to describe pre-Communist society in Tibet do so pejoratively. Pico Iyer, a journalist whose father is a friend of the Dalai Lama and who has himself been in private conversation with him for over thirty years writes: \"Almost as soon as he came into exile, in 1959, the Dalai Lama seized the chance to get rid of much of the red tape and serfdom that had beset Tibet in the past\". The Dalai Lama himself used the term \"serf\" in 1991, saying: \"The relationship between landlord and serf was much milder in Tibet than in China and conditions for the poor were much less harsh.\"\n\nSeveral Tibetan sources portray Tibetan peasants and workers to support their own view of a Tibetan people who were not only independent of China, but found the Chinese alien and incomprehensible, and who suffered genocide under Chinese rule. Richardson, the British Trade Envoy to Tibet in the 1940s, agrees with Tibetan authors, stating there was little difference between the rich and the poor.\n\nJournalist Thomas Laird notes that scholars debate the applicability of these terms to Tibet, and struggle with a lack of sufficient data. Journalist Barbara Crossette asserted in 1998 that \"scholars of Tibet mostly agree that there has been no systematic serfdom in Tibet in centuries.\"\n\nThe Tibetan Government-in-Exile says about conditions in Tibet pre-Communism:\n\nTraditional Tibetan society was, by no means, perfect and was in need of changes. The Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders have admitted as much. That is the reason why the Dalai Lama initiated far-reaching reforms in Tibet as soon as he assumed temporal authority. The traditional Tibetan society, however, was not nearly as bad as China would have us believe.\nThe academic debate as to whether \"serf\" is an applicable term for a society such as pre-Communist Tibet continues to this day. Goldstein and Miller's exchanges in an academic journal between 1986 and 1989 were a notable part of this debate. The applicability of the concept of serfdom to Tibet was debated between Melvyn Goldstein and anthropologist Beatrice D. Miller of Wisconsin University over a series of five articles in the \"Tibet Journal\". The debate was initiated by Goldstein in the XI edition of the \"Tibet Journal\", in which he defended his description of the features of Tibetan society as being very comparable to European serfdom. He based the comparison on the features of serfdom described by French historian Marc Bloch including:\n\n\nGoldstein argued that Tibetan society fulfilled all these requirements, and argued in detail against the specific diverging opinions of fellow scholars Miller, Micheal, Dargyay and Aziz. He underpinned his assertions by research, first hand accounts and case studies, and responded to criticisms which had been voiced by these researchers in the preceding years.\n\nOnly Miller responded in the next \"The Tibet Journal\", in a short letter, in 1987. She acknowledged Goldstein's scholarship, stating \"Goldstein's article ... cannot be faulted. It is an outstanding example of his exemplary collection of fine data.\" She disagreed however with his interpretation, specifically the use of the word \"serf\" and challenged him by asserting the following:\n\n\nIn the following issue Goldstein replied in brief arguing:\n\n\nIn a later publication and response Goldstein agreed to differ on the use of the word \"serf\" to prevent a terminological discussion distracting from the examination of societal conditions. He argued that running away was an act of desperation severing familial, social and economic ties. He discussed the form of partial manumission known as \"human lease\" and argued that: it only temporarily freed from daily service but not occasional service at the lord's discretion; the payment of an annual fee decided by the lord was required; it was revocable at will by the lord. Thus he felt it was a very weak form of manumission.\n\nColeman, integrating Goldstein's research with subsequent work done by other scholars including Rebecca French, Graham Clarke, and Franz Michael, argues that Goldstein overemphasized the \"de jure\" status of the \"mi ser\" at the expense of \"de facto\" characteristics - a high degree of social and economic mobility, and hence autonomy; frequently successful negotiations with lords to improve their status; and flight from untenable situations such as unpayable debts and exorbitant labor requirements. He concludes that \"serf\" is a misleading term for the Tibetan \"mi ser\".\n\nIn the political debate regarding the nature of pre-Communist Tibet, Chinese sources assert human rights abuses as a justification for the Communist invasion. Both before and after the Communist takeover of 1950 there have been examples of human rights abuses, both state-sanctioned and otherwise. The political debate associated with the Serfdom in Tibet controversy rests on whether these incidents justify the positions of the opposing parties. Sympathisers of the Chinese government's position view the pre-1950s abuses as justifying the Communist regime in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Supporters of the Tibetan Government in Exile argue that the 13th Dalai Lama had already effected reforms which were ahead of the world at the time, and that further reforms were underway, and no outside intervention was justified.\n\nJudicial mutilation - principally the gouging out of eyes, and the cutting off of hands or feet - was formalized under the Sakya school as part of the 13th century Tibetan legal code, and was used as a legal punishment until being declared illegal in 1913 by a proclamation of the 13th Dalai Lama. In this same reform, the Dalai Lama banned capital punishment, making Tibet one of the first countries to do so (preceding, for instance, Switzerland, Britain, and France). The 14th Dalai Lama's brother Jigme Norbu reports that, along with these reforms, living conditions in jails were improved, with officials being designated to see that these conditions and rules were maintained.\"\n\nIncidents of mutilation have been recorded in Tibet in the period between the start of the 20th century and the Chinese occupation. Tibetan communist Phuntso Wangye recalled his anger at seeing freshly severed human ears hanging from the gate of the county headquarters in Damshung north of Lhasa in 1945.\n\nRobert W. Ford, one of the few Westerners to have been appointed by the Government of Tibet at the time of \"de facto\" independent Tibet, spent five years in Tibet, from 1945 to 1950, before his arrest by the invading Chinese army. In his book \"Wind Between the Worlds: Captured in Tibet\", he writes\n\nHeinrich Harrer who lived in Tibet at the same time (1944 to 1951) wrote in his book \"Return to Tibet\" that these treatments had already ceased at that time:\nBecause Tibetan Buddhism prohibits killing, mutilation and other extremely cruel punishments were widely used instead in old Tibet. The mutilation of top level Tibetan official Lungshar in 1934 gave an example. Tsepon Lungshar, an official educated in England, introduced reform in the 1920s; after losing a political struggle the reformist was sentenced to be blinded by having his eyeballs pulled out. \"The method involved the placement of a smooth, round yak's knucklebone on each of the temples of the prisoner. These were then tied by leather thongs around the head and tightened by turning the thongs with a stick on top of the head until the eyeballs popped out. The mutilation was terribly bungled. Only one eyeball popped out, and eventually the ragyaba had to cut out the other eyeball with a knife. Boiling oil was then poured into the sockets to cauterize the wound.\" This was sufficiently unusual that the untouchables (\"ragyaba\") carrying it out had no previous experience of the correct technique and had to rely on instructions heard from their parents. An attempt was made at anesthetizing the alleged criminal with intoxicants before performing the punishment, which unfortunately did not work well.\n\nAs late as 1949 the Tibetan government still sentenced people to mutilation. When an CIA officer Douglas Mackiernan was killed against official entry permit, six Tibetan border guards were tried and sentenced in Lhasa. \"The leader was to have his nose and both ears cut off. The man who fired the first shot was to lose both ears. A third man was to lose one ear, and the others were to get 50 lashes each.\" The sentence was reduced to 200, 50 and 25 lashes, respectively, after another CIA agent Frank Bessac requested leniency.\n\nWhipping was legal and common as punishment in Tibet including in the 20th century, also for minor infractions and outside judicial process. Whipping could also have fatal consequences, as in the case of the trader Gyebo Sherpa subjected to the severe \"corca\" whipping for selling cigarettes. He died from his wounds 2 days later in the Potala prison. Tashi Tsering, a self-described critic of traditional Tibetan society, records being whipped as a 13-year-old for missing a performance as a dancer in the Dalai Lama's dance troop in 1942, until the skin split and the pain became excruciating.\n\nIn its \"100 Questions and Answers About Tibet\" the People's Republic of China states that human rights were 'severely infringed upon' by the Dalai Lama's administration. The evidence for these accusations is disputed.\n\nAccording to writer Rebecca French, Tibetans viewed criminal offenses as uncommon, but there are few records to establish frequency. However, Tibetans also believe that theft and banditry were common especially along trade routes. Because it was considered harsh by most Tibetans, they tended to seek alternative settlements and leniency from local courts instead of pursuing government action in disputes. Local officials were also more likely to find peaceful outcomes in a community setting than to resort to harsher government resolution.\n\nPolitical power could play a role in a judicial process in Tibet. In the eye gouging case above the alleged criminal was a deposed member of the Kashag called Lungshar who had proposed democratic reform. The charge was planning a coup and the attempted murder of another Kashag member who opposed reform. It was strenuously denied by the accused. Conviction was based on the evidence of one informer who claimed to have seen a document which was never produced. He was richly rewarded, and the trial seems to have been a show trial by traditionalists seeking to prevent reform. From arrest to execution of the sentence was only ten days, limiting the possibilities of appeal.\n\nOne evidence of Chinese brutality in Eastern Tibet was reported by an American missionary in the following terms:\nThere is no method of torture known that is not practised in here on these Tibetans, slicing, boiling, tearing asunder and all …To sum up what China is doing here in eastern Tibet, the main things are collecting taxes, robbing, oppressing, confiscating, and allowing her representatives to burn and loot and steal.\nBelieving that the American missionary's account might be a mistake, Sir Eric Teichman, a British diplomat, noted that whatever brutality existed, it was \"in no way due to any action of the Chinese government in Peking or the provincial authorities in Szechuana.\"\n\nIsrael Epstein wrote that prior to the Communist takeover, poverty in Tibet was so severe that in some of the worst cases peasants had to hand over children to the manor as household slaves or nangzan, because they were too poor to raise them. On the other hand, Laird asserted that in the 1940s Tibetan peasants were well off and immune to famine, whereas starvation was common in China. According to other sources, the so-called \"slaves\" were domestic servants (nangtsen) and managers of estates in reality.\n\nIn 1904 the British army invaded and held the Tibetan Chumbi Valley, in the border region adjacent to Bhutan and India. Sir Charles Bell was put in charge of the district from September 1904 to November 1905 and wrote that slavery was still practiced in Chumbi but had declined greatly over the previous thirty years. He noted that only a dozen or two dozen slaves remained, unlike nearby Bhutan where slavery was more widespread. Bell further remarked, \"The slavery in the Chumpi valley was of a very mild type. If a slave was not well treated, it was easy for him to escape into Sikkim and British India.\"\n\nJust as the Chinese and the Tibetan exile community argue over whether common Tibetans suffered or flourished before the Chinese takeover, they take diametrically opposing views on the fate of ordinary Tibetans since 1950. This is understood to be highly important in persuading readers of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of Chinese rule. Chinese sources in English claim rapid progress for prosperous, free, and happy Tibetans participating in democratic reforms. Tibetans, on the other hand, write of Chinese genocide in Tibet, comparing the Chinese to the Nazis. After the Cultural Revolution, according to Powers, scholar Warren Smith, whose work became focused on Tibetan history and politics after spending five months in Tibet in 1982, portrays the Chinese as chauvinists who believe they are superior to the Tibetans, and claims that the Chinese use torture, coercion and starvation to control the Tibetans.\n\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region is much poorer than other provinces of China. In 1980, in order to help Tibet out of poverty, the 1st Tibet Work Forum (moderated by Hu Yaobang, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China), decided to give the Tibet Autonomous Region financial support, in order to build a \"united, prosperous, civilized new Tibet\". After this Forum, in the Tibet Autonomous Region, all taxes on agriculture and animal husbandry were waived, while other provinces had to wait until 2006 for the same. The old “people's commune” economic system was dismantled (while in other provinces it was ended in 1985), so farmland started to be used by the household, and livestock started to be owned and used by the household. In the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region is the only provincial level administrative region that enjoys some tax incentives, and after 1988 is the only provincial level administrative region that receives growing substantial quota subsidies from the central government. Under the \"partner assistance\" policy, all the rich provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, most of the Central Government organs, and some central enterprises respectively assist the prefectures and cities of the Tibet Autonomous Region. With this assistance, in 1988, the Tibet Autonomous Region eliminated its fiscal deficit for the first time in history. As the only provincial level \"poverty-stricken areas which lie in vast, contiguous stretches\" in the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region developed a lot of anti-poverty programs, and the impoverished population has been shrinking substantially. However, there are still many difficulties in poverty reduction. Until the end of 2012, the social security system in the Tibet Autonomous Region has been completely established. This system not only includes ordinary people, but also all the 29,000 monks and nuns of Tibetan Buddhism in the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nThere is also evidence of human rights infringements, including the 2006 Nangpa La shootings. See human rights in the People's Republic of China and Human rights in Tibet (include all the Tibetan areas) for an overview. The \"Human Rights Watch World Report 2008: Events in China 2007\" states:\n\nWidespread and numerous instances of repression target ordinary citizens, monks, nuns, and even children in an effort to quash alleged \"separatism.\" Seven Tibetan boys in Gansu province were detained for over a month in early September after they allegedly wrote slogans on the walls of a village police station and elsewhere calling for the return of the Dalai Lama and a free Tibet. Ronggyal Adrak was detained and charged under state security offenses by police on August 1 after he called for the Dalai Lama's return at a horse race festival in Sichuan province. He is awaiting trial. The Chinese government has failed to bring to justice those responsible for the shooting death by People's Armed Police officers of a 17-year-old nun, Kelsang Namtso, while trying to cross the border into Nepal on September 30, 2006. \nIt is notable in this Report that most of the examples are not in the Tibet Autonomous Region, but in other provinces of China, such as Gansu Province and Sichuan Province (Tibetan areas in Sichuan are the eastern part of Kham). These areas (i.e. the Tibetan areas in Sichuan Province, Gansu Province, Yunnan Province and Qinghai Province) were not included in political Tibet, so they were not involved in the Serfs' Emancipation, which was in the Tibet Autonomous Region. During the \"reform and opening up\" after 1978, when the central government of the PRC gave numerous support policies and substantial financial support to the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibetan areas in the four provinces did not get the same. Although some of them (such as the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan) are rich enough, others of them are not rich, and some of them in Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai are poor enough. The Tibetan areas in the four provinces ask the central government to benefit them as the Tibet Autonomous Region. And the poverty in these areas makes some of their Tibetan residents support the idea of \"Greater Tibet\" which is claimed by Tibetan exile groups.\n\nIn 2010, on the 5th Tibet Work Forum, the central government declared its intention to make the Tibetan areas in the four provinces steadily progress as well as the Tibet Autonomous Region. The goal is to bring the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibetan areas in the four provinces in line together with the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-around way in 2020.\n\nDebate continues as to whether pre-Communist Tibetan society was especially oppressive or was comparable to, or better than, similar social structures in nearby regions. According to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile: \"In terms of social mobility and wealth distribution, independent Tibet compared favourably with most Asian countries\" the fact that most Dalai Lamas, including Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama and Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama, came from peasant families being cited as an example of this. Travelers who witnessed conditions in both China and Tibet in the 1940s found the Tibetan peasants to be far better off than their Chinese counterparts. Academics debate whether tribal cultures, such as the Mongolian nomadic steppe culture, are feudal in nature. Much of Mongolian, Tibetan and Chinese political history is inter-related but the extent of their shared social culture is uncertain.\n\nAccording to the 'United Nations Research Institute for Social Development', bonded labor and other forms of economic exploitation currently exist in nearby regions including India, Nepal, and several Chinese provinces. Kamaiya, the bonded labour system in neighbouring Nepal, was formally abolished in the year 2000. In 2007 Shanxi, China was the scene of its own slave scandal that turned out to involve human trafficking and slave labor in Hebei, Guangdong and Xinjiang provinces as well. According to the U.S. Dept of State \"Trafficking in Persons Report 2008\" Bangladesh, Nepal, Mongolia and Pakistan are all Tier 2 countries, with China and India both on the Tier 2 watchlist. However no local regions are in Tier 3.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "560394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=560394", "title": "Shadow (psychology)", "text": "Shadow (psychology)\n\nIn Jungian psychology, the \"shadow\", \"Id\", or \"shadow aspect/archetype\" may refer to (1) an unconscious aspect of the personality which the conscious ego does not identify in itself, or (2) the entirety of the unconscious, i.e., everything of which a person is not fully conscious. In short, the shadow is the \"dark side\".\n\nBecause one tends to reject or remain ignorant of the least desirable aspects of one's personality, the shadow is largely negative. There are, however, positive aspects that may also remain hidden in one's shadow (especially in people with low self-esteem, anxieties, and false beliefs). \n\nContrary to a Freudian definition of shadow, the Jungian shadow can include everything outside the light of consciousness and may be positive or negative. \"Everyone carries a shadow,\" Jung wrote, \"and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.\" It may be (in part) one's link to more primitive animal instincts, which are superseded during early childhood by the conscious mind.\n\nCarl Jung stated the shadow to be the unknown dark side of the personality. According to Jung, the shadow, in being instinctive and irrational, is prone to psychological projection, in which a perceived personal inferiority is recognized as a perceived moral deficiency in someone else. Jung writes that if these projections remain hidden, \"The projection-making factor (the Shadow archetype) then has a free hand and can realize its object—if it has one—or bring about some other situation characteristic of its power.\" These projections insulate and harm individuals by acting as a constantly thickening veil of illusion between the ego and the real world.\n\nFrom one perspective, \"the shadow...is roughly equivalent to the whole of the Freudian unconscious\"; and Jung himself asserted that \"the result of the Freudian method of elucidation is a minute elaboration of man's shadow-side unexampled in any previous age\".\n\nKaufman wrote that \"in spite of its function as a reservoir for human darkness—or perhaps because of this—the shadow is the seat of creativity\"; so that for some, it may be, \"the dark side of his being, his sinister shadow... represents the true spirit of life as against the arid scholar\".\n\nThe shadow may appear in dreams and visions in various forms and typically 'appears as a person of the same sex as that of the dreamer'. The shadow's appearance and role depend greatly on the living experience of the individual because much of the shadow develops in the individual's mind rather than simply being inherited in the collective unconscious. Nevertheless, some Jungians maintain that \"The shadow\" contains, besides the personal shadow, the shadow of society ... fed by the neglected and repressed collective values'.\n\nInteractions with the shadow in dreams may shed light on one's state of mind. A conversation with an aspect of the shadow may indicate that one is concerned with conflicting desires or intentions. Identification with a despised figure may mean that one has an unacknowledged difference from the character, a difference which could point to a rejection of the illuminating qualities of ego-consciousness. These examples refer to just two of many possible roles that the shadow may adopt and are not general guides to interpretation. Also, it can be difficult to identify characters in dreams—\"all the contents are blurred and merge into one another ... 'contamination' of unconscious contents\"—so that a character who seems at first to be a shadow might represent some other complex instead.\n\nJung also made the suggestion of there being more than one layer making up the shadow. The top layers contain the meaningful flow and manifestations of direct personal experiences. These are made unconscious in the individual by such things as the change of attention from one thing to another, simple forgetfulness, or a repression. Underneath these idiosyncratic layers, however, are the archetypes which form the psychic contents of all human experiences. Jung described this deeper layer as \"a psychic activity which goes on independently of the conscious mind and is not dependent even on the upper layers of the unconscious—untouched, and perhaps untouchable—by personal experience\" (Campbell, 1971).\n\nThe eventual encounter with the shadow plays a central part in the process of individuation. Jung considered that \"the course of individuation...exhibits a certain formal regularity. Its signposts and milestones are various archetypal symbols\" marking its stages; and of these \"the first stage leads to the experience of the SHADOW\". If \"the breakdown of the persona constitutes the typical Jungian moment both in therapy and in development\", it is this that opens the road to the shadow within, coming about when \"Beneath the surface a person is suffering from a deadly boredom that makes everything seem meaningless and empty ... as if the initial encounter with the Self casts a dark shadow ahead of time.\" Jung considered as a perennial danger in life that \"the more consciousness gains in clarity, the more monarchic becomes its content...the king constantly needs the renewal that begins with a descent into his own darkness\"—his shadow—which the \"dissolution of the persona\" sets in motion.\n\n\"The shadow personifies everything that the subject refuses to acknowledge about himself\" and represents \"a tight passage, a narrow door, whose painful constriction no one is spared who goes down to the deep well\". If and when 'an individual makes an attempt to see his shadow, he becomes aware of (and often ashamed of) those qualities and impulses he denies in himself but can plainly see in others—such things as egotism, mental laziness, and sloppiness; unreal fantasies, schemes, and plots; carelessness and cowardice; inordinate love of money and possessions—...[a] painful and lengthy work of self-education\".\n\nThe dissolution of the persona and the launch of the individuation process also brings with it 'the danger of falling victim to the shadow ... the black shadow which everybody carries with him, the inferior and therefore hidden aspect of the personality'—of a merger with the shadow.\n\nAccording to Jung, the shadow sometimes overwhelms a person's actions; for example, when the conscious mind is shocked, confused, or paralyzed by indecision. 'A man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into his own traps ... living below his own level': hence, in terms of the story of \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", 'it must be Jekyll, the conscious personality, who integrates the shadow ... and \"not\" vice versa. Otherwise the conscious becomes the slave of the autonomous shadow'.\n\nIndividuation inevitably raises that very possibility. As the process continues, and \"the libido leaves the bright upper world ... sinks back into its own depths...below, in the shadows of the unconscious\", so too what comes to the forefront is \"what was hidden under the mask of conventional adaptation: the shadow\", with the result that \"ego and shadow are no longer divided but are brought together in an—admittedly precarious—unity.\"\n\nThe impact of such \"confrontation with the shadow produces at first a dead balance, a stand-still that hampers moral decisions and makes convictions ineffective...\"tenebrositas\", chaos, melancholia.\" Consequently, (as Jung knew from personal experience) \"in this time of descent—one, three, seven years, more or less—genuine courage and strength are required\", with no certainty of emergence. Nevertheless, Jung remained of the opinion that while \"no one should deny the danger of the descent ... every descent is followed by an ascent ...enantiodromia\"; and assimilation of—rather than possession by—the shadow becomes at last a real possibility.\n\nEnantiodromia launches a different perspective. \"We begin to travel [up] through the healing spirals...straight up.\" Here the struggle is to retain \"awareness\" of the shadow, but not identification with it. \"Non-identification demands considerable moral effort...prevents a descent into that darkness\"; but though \"the conscious mind is liable to be submerged at any moment in the unconscious... understanding acts like a life-saver. It integrates the unconscious\"—reincorporates the shadow into the personality, producing a stronger, wider consciousness than before. \"Assimilation of the shadow gives a man body, so to speak\", and provides thereby a launching-pad for further individuation. \"The integration of the shadow, or the realisation of the personal unconscious, marks the first stage of the analytic process...without it a recognition of anima and animus is impossible.\" Conversely \"to the degree to which the shadow is recognised and integrated, the problem of the anima, i.e., of relationship, is constellated\", and becomes the centre of the individuation quest.\n\nNevertheless, Jungians warn that \"acknowledgement of the shadow must be a continuous process throughout one's life\"; and even after the focus of individuation has moved on to the animus/anima, \"the later stages of shadow integration\" will continue to take place—the grim \"process of washing one's dirty linen in private\", accepting one's shadow.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1604816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1604816", "title": "Steric factor", "text": "Steric factor\n\nSteric factor \"ρ\" is a term used in collision theory.\n\nIt is defined as the ratio between the experimental value of the rate constant and the one predicted by collision theory. It can also be defined as the ratio between the preexponential factor and the collision frequency, and it is most often less than unity. Physically, the steric factor can be interpreted as the ratio of the cross section for reactive collisions to the total collision cross section.\n\nUsually, the more complex the reactant molecules, the lower the steric factors. Nevertheless, some reactions exhibit steric factors greater than unity: the harpoon reactions, which involve atoms that exchange electrons, producing ions. The deviation from unity can have different causes: the molecules are not spherical, so different geometries are possible; not all the kinetic energy is delivered into the right spot; the presence of a solvent (when applied to solutions); and so on.\n\nWhen collision theory applied to reactions in solution the solvent cage has an effect on the reactant molecules, as several collisions can take place in a single encounter, which leads to predicted preexponential factors being too large. \"ρ\" values greater than unity can be attributed to favorable entropic contributions.\n\nUsually there is no simple way to accurately estimate steric factors without performing trajectory or scattering calculations.\n"}
{"id": "32039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32039", "title": "The Dispossessed", "text": "The Dispossessed\n\nThe Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is a 1974 utopian science fiction novel by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, set in the same fictional universe as that of \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" (the Hainish Cycle). The book won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1974, won both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1975, and received a nomination for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1975. It achieved a degree of literary recognition unusual for science fiction works due to its exploration of many themes, including anarchism and revolutionary societies, capitalism and individualism and collectivism.\n\nIt features the development of the mathematical theory underlying the fictional ansible, an instantaneous communications device that plays a critical role in Le Guin's Hainish Cycle. The invention of the ansible places the novel first in the internal chronology of the Hainish Cycle, although it was the fifth Hainish novel published.\n\nIn her new introduction to the Library of America reprint in 2017, the author wrote:\nLe Guin's parents, academic anthropologists Alfred and Theodora Kroeber, were friends with J. Robert Oppenheimer; Le Guin stated that Oppenheimer was the model for Shevek, the book's protagonist.\n\n\"The Dispossessed\" is set on Anarres and Urras, the twin inhabited worlds of Tau Ceti. Urras is divided into several states and dominated by its two largest, the rivals A-Io and Thu. The former has a capitalist economy and patriarchal system, and the latter is an authoritarian system that claims to rule in the name of the proletariat. A-Io has oppositional left-wing parties, one of which is closely linked to the rival society Thu.\n\nThe other world, Anarres, represents a third ideological structure: anarcho-syndicalism. Its society has weakened influence due to their ancestors' self-imposed exile from Urras. Some citizens of A-Io contact the Anarresti protagonist Shevek, chiding him for betraying his beliefs by working at the university and accepting the government's hospitality.\n\nA revolution sparks in the major, yet undeveloped third area of Benbili. A-Io invades the Thu-supported revolutionary area, generating a proxy war. Although there are a wide variety of political parties in A-Io, there are none on Anarres.\n\nThe chapters alternate between the two planets and in time. The even-numbered chapters, which are set on Anarres, take place first chronologically and are followed by the odd-numbered chapters, which take place on Urras. The only exceptions occur in the first and last chapters, which take place in both worlds.\n\nIn order to forestall an anarcho-syndicalist rebellion, the major Urrasti states gave the revolutionaries (inspired by a visionary named Odo) the right to live on Anarres, along with a guarantee of non-interference, approximately two hundred years before the events of \"The Dispossessed\". (The story is told in Le Guin's \"The Day Before the Revolution\".) Before this, Anarres had had no permanent settlements, apart from some mining facilities.\n\nThe economic and political situation of Anarres and its relation to Urras is ambiguous. The people of Anarres consider themselves as being free and independent, having broken off from the political and social influence of the old world. However, the powers of Urras consider Anarres as being essentially their mining colony, as the annual consignment of Anarres' precious metals and their distribution to major powers on Urras is a major economic event of the old world.\n\nChapter One begins in the middle of the story. The protagonist Shevek is a physicist attempting to develop a General Temporal Theory. The physics of the book describes time as having a much deeper, more complex structure than we understand it. It incorporates not only mathematics and physics, but also philosophy and ethics. Shevek finds his work blocked by a jealous superior, as his theories conflict with the prevailing political philosophy and are thus distrusted by the society. His work is further disrupted by his obligation to perform manual labor during a drought in this anarchist society; in order to ensure survival in a harsh environment, the people of Anarres must put the needs of society ahead of their own personal desires, so Shevek performs hard agricultural labor in a dusty desert instead of working on his research. He arranges to go to Urras to finish and publish his theory.\n\nArriving on Urras, Shevek is feted. Shevek soon finds himself disgusted with the social, sexual and political conventions of the hierarchical capitalist society of Urras. He joins in a labor protest that is violently suppressed, but he escapes to safety. Finally, he is sponsored by ambassadors of Terra who provide him safe passage back to Anarres.\n\nThe ambiguity of Anarres' economic and political situation in relation to Urras is symbolically manifested in the low wall surrounding Anarres' single spaceport. This wall is the only place on the anarchist planet where \"No Trespassing!\" signs may be seen, and it is where the book begins and ends. The people of Anarres believe that the wall divides a free world from the corrupting influence of an oppressor's ships. On the other hand, the wall could be a prison wall keeping the rest of the planet imprisoned and cut off. Shevek's life attempts to answer this question.\n\nIn addition to Shevek's journey to answer questions about his society's true level of freedom, the meaning of his theories themselves weave their way into the plot; they not only describe abstract physical concepts, but they also reflect ups and downs of the characters' lives, and the transformation of the Anarresti society. An oft-quoted saying in the book is \"true journey is return.\" The meaning of Shevek's theories—which deal with the nature of time and simultaneity—have been subject to interpretation. For example, there have been interpretations that the non-linear nature of the novel is a reproduction of Shevek's theory.\n\nLe Guin's foreword to the novel notes that her anarchism is closely akin to that of Peter Kropotkin, whose \"\" closely assessed the influence of the natural world on competition and cooperation.\n\nMany conflicts occur between the freedom of anarchism and the constraints imposed by authority and society, both on Anarres and Urras. These constraints are both physical and social. Physically, Odo was imprisoned in the Fort for nine years. Socially speaking, 'time after time the question of who is being locked out or in, which side of the wall one is on, is the focus of the narrative.' Mark Tunik emphasises that \"the wall\" is the dominant metaphor for these social constraints. Shevek hits ‘the wall of charm, courtesy, indifference.” He later notes that he let a “wall be built around him” that kept him from seeing the poor people on Urras. He had been co-opted, with walls of smiles of the rich, and he didn’t know how to break them down. Shevek at one point speculates that the people on Urras are not truly free, precisely because they have so many walls built between people and are so possessive. He says, “You are all in jail. Each alone, solitary, with a heap of what he owns. You live in prison, die in prison. It is all I can see in your eyes – the wall, the wall!” ‘ It is not just the state of mind of those inside the prisons that concerns Shevek, he also notes the effect on those outside the walls. Steve Grossi says, ‘by building a physical wall to keep the bad in, we construct a mental wall keeping ourselves, our thoughts, and our empathy out, to the collective detriment of all.\" Shevek himself later says, “those who build walls are their own prisoners.” Le Guin makes this explicit in chapter two, when the schoolchildren construct their own prison and detain one of their own inside. The deleterious effect on the children outside parallels the effect on the guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment of 1971 (three years before \"The Dispossessed\" was published).\n\nThe language spoken on Anarres also reflects anarchism. Pravic is a constructed language in the tradition of Esperanto. Pravic reflects many aspects of the philosophical foundations of utopian anarchism. For instance, the use of the possessive case is strongly discouraged, a feature that also is reflected by the novel's title. Children are trained to speak only about matters that interest others; anything else is \"egoizing\" (pp. 28–31). There is no property ownership of any kind. Shevek's daughter, upon meeting him for the first time, tells him, \"You can share the handkerchief I use\" rather than \"You may borrow my handkerchief\", thus conveying the idea that the handkerchief is not owned by the girl, but is merely used by her.\n\nThe work is sometimes said to represent one of the few modern revivals of the utopian genre. When first published, the book included the tagline: \"The magnificent epic of an ambiguous utopia!\" which was shortened by fans to \"An ambiguous utopia\" and adopted as a subtitle in certain editions. There are also many characteristics of a utopian novel found in this book. For example, Shevek is an outsider when he arrives on Urras, which capitalizes on the utopian and scientific fiction theme of the \"estrangement-setting\".\n\nLe Guin's utopianism, however, differs from the traditional \"anarchist commune.\" Whereas most utopian novels attempt to convey a society that is absolutely good, this world differs as it is portrayed only as \"ambiguously good.\"\n\nThere is some disagreement as to whether \"The Dispossessed\" should be considered a feminist utopia or a feminist science fiction novel. According to Mary Morrison of the State University of New York at Buffalo, the anarchist themes in this book help to promote feminist themes as well. Other critics, such as William Marcellino of SUNY Buffalo and Sarah Lefanu, writer of \"Popular Writing and Feminist Intervention in Science Fiction,\" argue that there are distinct anti-feminist undertones throughout the novel.\n\nMorrison argues that Le Guin's portrayed ideals of Taoism, the celebration of labor and the body, and desire or sexual freedom in an anarchist society contribute greatly to the book's feminist message. Taoism, which rejects dualisms and divisions in favor of a Yin and Yang balance, brings attention to the balance between not only the two planets, but between the male and female inhabitants. The celebration of labor on Anarres stems from a celebration of a mother's labor, focusing on creating life rather than on building objects. The sexual freedom on Anarres also contributes to the book's feminist message.\n\nOn the other hand, some critics believe that Le Guin's feminist themes are either weak or not present. Some believe that the Taoist interdependence between the genders actually weakens Le Guin's feminist message. Marcellino believes that the anarchist themes in the novel take precedence and dwarf any feminist themes. Lefanu adds that there is a difference between the feminist messages that the book explicitly presents and the anti-feminist undertones. For example, the book says that women created the society on Anarres. However, female characters seem secondary to the male protagonist, who seems to be a traditional male hero; this subversion weakens any feminist message that Le Guin was trying to convey.\n\nIt has been suggested that Le Guin's title is a reference to Dostoyevsky's novel about anarchists, \"Demons\" (, \"Bésy\"), one popular English-language translation of which is titled \"The Possessed\". Much of the philosophical underpinnings and ecological concepts came from Murray Bookchin's \"Post-Scarcity Anarchism\" (1971), according to a letter Le Guin sent to Bookchin. Anarres citizens are \"dispossessed\" not just by political choice, but by the very lack of actual resources to possess. Here, again, Le Guin draws a contrast with the natural wealth of Urras, and the competitive behaviors this fosters.\n\nIn the last chapter of \"The Dispossessed\", we learn that the Hainish people arrived at Tau Ceti 60 years previously, which is more than 150 years after the secession of the Odonians from Urras and their exodus to Anarres. Terrans are also there, and the novel occurs some time in the future, according to an elaborate chronology worked out by science fiction author Ian Watson in 1975: \"the baseline date of AD 2300 for The Dispossessed is taken from the description of Earth in that book (§11) as having passed through an ecological and social collapse with a population peak of 9 billion to a low-population but highly centralized recovery economy.\" In the same article, Watson assigns a date of AD 4870 to The Left Hand of Darkness; both dates are problematic — as Watson says himself, they are contradicted by \"Genly Ai's statement that Terrans 'were ignorant until about three thousand years ago of the uses of zero' \".\n\nThe novel received generally positive reviews. Baird Searles characterized the novel as an \"extraordinary work\", saying Le Guin had \"created a working society in exquisite detail\" and \"a fully realized hypothetical culture [as well as] living breathing characters who are inevitable products of that culture\". Gerald Jonas, writing in \"The New York Times\", said that \"Le Guin's book, written in her solid, no-nonsense prose, is so persuasive that it ought to put a stop to the writing of prescriptive Utopias for at least 10 years\". Theodore Sturgeon praised \"The Dispossessed\" as \"a beautifully written, beautifully composed book\", saying \"it performs one of [science fiction's] prime functions, which is to create another kind of social system to see how it would work. Or if it would work.\" Lester del Rey, however, gave the novel a mixed review, citing the quality of Le Guin's writing but claiming that the ending \"slips badly\", a \"deus ex machina\" that \"destroy[s] much of the strength of the novel\".\n\n\nIn 1987, the CBC Radio anthology program \"Vanishing Point\" adapted \"The Dispossessed\" into a series of six 30 minute episodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book became a best-seller. The predicted catastrophes did not occur.\n\nAstronomers had long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the Sun, within an arc 95 degrees wide. But no effect could be expected as the tidal forces of the other planets affecting the Earth's crust are negligible even at the planets' closest approach. In this book, the authors sought to partially sidestep these objections by considering the effect of the alignment on the Sun, and hence on the solar wind, which in turn is known to affect weather on the Earth. Atmospheric conditions on the Earth can alter the speed of its rotation. The effect on the Sun would also be quite small, however, and in fact there had been an even closer alignment in the year 1128 without any incident.\n\nThere was some influence by the planets mentioned above, with the high tides calculated as being about 40 micrometres higher than normal. In April 1982, Gribbin and Plagemann published a lesser-selling book, \"The Jupiter Effect Reconsidered\". In it they theorized that the effect had actually taken place in 1980, despite the lack of planetary alignment then, and that it had triggered the volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens. \n\nIn his book, \"The Little Book of Science\" (pub. 1999), Gribbin admitted about his \"Jupiter Effect\" theory \"...I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it.\"\n"}

In general, if the behaviour of a system of more than two objects cannot be described by the two-body interactions between all possible pairs, as a first approximation, the deviation is mainly due to a three-body force. \n\nThe fundamental strong interaction does exhibit such behaviour, the most important example being the stability experimentally observed for the helium-3 isotope, which can be described as a 3-body quantum cluster entity of two protons and one neutron [PNP] in stable superposition. Direct evidence of a 3-body force in helium-3 is known: . The existence of stable [PNP] cluster calls into question models of the atomic nucleus that restrict nucleon interactions within shells to 2-body phenomenon. The three-nucleon-interaction is fundamentally possible because gluons, the mediators of the strong interaction, can couple to themselves. In particle physics, the interactions between the three quarks that compose hadrons can be described in a diquark model which might be equivalent to the hypothesis of a three-body force. There is growing evidence in the field of nuclear physics that three-body forces exist among the nucleons inside atomic nuclei for many different isotopes (three-nucleon force).\n\n\n"}

The concept was introduced, but not fully developed, by psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1896–1934) during the last ten years of his life. Vygotsky stated that a child follows an adult's example and gradually develops the ability to do certain tasks without help. Vygotsky and some other educators believe that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning such as skills and strategies.\n\nThe concept of the zone of proximal development was originally developed by Vygotsky to argue against the use of academic, knowledge-based tests as a means to gauge students' intelligence. He also created ZPD to further develop Jean Piaget's theory of children being lone learners. Vygotsky spent a lot of time studying the impact of school instruction on children and noted that children grasp language concepts quite naturally, but that maths and writing don’t come naturally, that these are concepts taught in schools and tend to come along with some difficulty, while Piaget believed that there was a clear distinction between development and teaching. He said that development is a spontaneous process that is initiated and completed by the children, stemming from their own efforts. Piaget was a proponent of independent thinking and critical of the standard teacher-led instruction that was common practice in schools.\n\nAlternatively, Vygotsky saw natural, spontaneous development as important, but not all-important. He believed that children would not advance very far if they were left to discover everything on their own. It's crucial for a child's development that they are able to interact with more knowledgeable others. They would not be able to expand on what they know if this wasn't possible. He noted cultural experiences where children are greatly helped by knowledge and tools handed down from previous generations. Vygotsky noted that good teachers shouldn't present material that is too difficult and “pull the students along.”\n\nVygotsky argued that, rather than examining what a student knows to determine intelligence, it is better to examine their ability to solve problems independently and ability to solve problems with an adult's help. He proposed a question: \"if two children perform the same on a test, are their levels of development the same?\" He concluded that they were not. However, Vygotsky's untimely death interrupted his work on the zone of proximal development, and it remained mostly incomplete.\n\nSince Vygotsky's original conception, the definition for the zone of proximal development has been expanded and modified. The zone of proximal development is an area of learning that occurs when a person is assisted by a teacher or peer with a higher skill set. The person learning the skill set cannot complete it without the assistance of the teacher or peer. The teacher then helps the student attain the skill the student is trying to master, until the teacher is no longer needed for that task.\n\nAny function within the zone of proximal development matures within a particular internal context that includes not only the function’s actual level but also how susceptible the child is to types of help, the sequence in which these types of help are offered, the flexibility or rigidity of previously formed stereotypes, how willing the child is to collaborate, along with other factors. This context can impact the diagnosis of a function’s potential level of development.\n\nVygotsky stated that we can’t just look at what students are capable of doing on their own; we have to look at what they are capable of doing in a social setting. In many cases students are able to complete a task within a group before they are able to complete it on their own. He notes that the teacher’s job is to move the child’s mind forward step-by-step (after all, teachers can’t teach complex chemical equations to first-graders). At the same time, teachers can’t teach all children equally; they must determine which students are ready for which lessons. An example is the often-used accelerated reading program in schools. Students are assessed and given a reading level and a range. Books rated below their level are easy to read, while books above their level challenge the student. Sometimes students are not even allowed to check out books from the school library that are outside their range. Vygotsky argued that a major shortcoming of standardized tests is that they only measure what students are capable of on their own, not in a group setting where their minds are being pushed by other students.\n\nIn the context of second language learning, the ZPD can be useful to many adult users. Prompted by this fact as well as the finding that adult peers don't necessarily need to be more capable to provide assistance in the ZPD, Vygotsky’s definition has been adapted to better suit the adult L2 developmental context \n\nThe concept of the ZPD is widely used to study children's mental development as it relates to education. The ZPD concept is seen as a scaffolding, a structure of \"support points\" for performing an action. This refers to the help or guidance received from an adult or more competent peer to permit the child to work within the ZPD. Although Vygotsky himself never mentioned the term, scaffolding was first developed by Jerome Bruner, David Wood, and Gail Ross, while applying Vygotsky's concept of ZPD to various educational contexts. According to Wass and Golding, giving students the hardest tasks they can do with scaffolding leads to the greatest learning gains.\n\nScaffolding is a process through which a teacher or a more competent peer helps a student in their ZPD as necessary and tapers off this aid as it becomes unnecessary—much as workers remove a scaffold from a building after they complete construction. \"Scaffolding [is] the way the adult guides the child's learning via focused questions and positive interactions.\" This concept has been further developed by Mercedes Chaves Jaime, Ann Brown, among others. Several instructional programs were developed based on this interpretation of the ZPD, including reciprocal teaching and dynamic assessment. For scaffolding to be effective, one must start at the child's level of knowledge and build from there. \n\nOne example of children using ZPD is when they are learning to speak. As their speech develops, it influences the way the child thinks, which in turn influences the child's manner of speaking. This process opens more doors for the child to expand their vocabulary. As they learn to convey their thoughts in a more effective way, they receive more sophisticated feedback, therefore increasing their vocabulary and their speaking skills. Wells gives the example of dancing: when a person is learning how to dance, they look to others around them on the dance floor and imitate their moves. A person does not copy the dance moves exactly, but takes what they can and adds their own personality to it. \n\nIn mathematics, proximal development uses mathematical exercises for which students have seen one or more worked examples. In secondary school some scaffolding is provided, and generally much less at the tertiary level. Ultimately students must find library resources or a tutor when presented with challenges beyond the zone.\n\nAnother example of scaffolding is learning to drive. Parents and driving instructors guide driving students along the way by showing them the mechanics of how the car operates, the correct hand positions on the steering wheel, the technique of scanning the roadway, etc. As the student progresses, less and less instruction is needed, until they are ready to drive on their own.\n\nThe concept of scaffolding can be observed in various life situations and arguably in the basis of how everyone learns. One does not (normally) begin knowing everything that there is to know about a subject. The basics must be learned first so one can build on prior knowledge towards mastery of a particular subject or skill. \n\nVarious investigations, using different approaches and research frameworks have proved collaborative learning to be effective in many kinds of settings and contexts. Teachers should assign tasks that students cannot do on their own, but which they can do with assistance; they should provide just enough assistance so that students learn to complete the tasks independently and then provide an environment that enables students to do harder tasks than would otherwise be possible. Teachers can also allow students with more knowledge to assist students who need more assistance. Especially in the context of collaborative learning, group members who have higher levels of understanding can help the less advanced members learn within their zone of proximal development. In the context of adults, peers should challenge each other in order to support collaboration and success.\n\n\n"}
