For example, studies have been conducted to measure discrimination against racial minorities by real estate agents, as well as gender discrimination against women applying for restaurant jobs. Most employment-related audit studies have focused on overqualified college students applying for low-paying jobs during the summer. They have also been used to measure racial and gender discrimination in academia, as well as racial discrimination in the low and high ends of the labor market.\n\nAudit studies have been criticized because the auditors may look different to employers, and this may result in the appearance of discrimination when employers were really just making decisions based on appearance. The other limitations of these studies, according to their critics, include that they are unable to audit jobs found through interactions with other people directly, only those found through newspapers. Additionally, others have noted the lack of standardization of signals (primarily names) to indicate race through correspondence (e.g. resumes, emails, etc.).\n"}

BCN, which went online in 1968, provided on-line access to nine databases, including MEDLINE and BIOSIS PREVIEWS, to large universities and medical schools primarily in the Northeast of the USA. State funding for the project was withdrawn in 1975, and Bibliographic Retrieval Services (BRS) was formed as a non-profit concern the following year. It was incorporated in May 1976 as a for-profit corporation with Ron Quake as president, Jan Egeland as vice president in charge of marketing and training, and Lloyd Palmer as vice president of systems.\n\nIn December 1976, the First BRS User Meeting was held in Syracuse, N.Y. and by January 1977 BRS started commercial operations with 20 databases (including the first national commercial availability of MEDLINE) and 9 million records, using modified IBM STAIRS (STorage And Information Retrieval System) software, Telenet for telecommunications, and timesharing mainframe computers of Carrier Corporation. In October 1980 BRS was sold by Egeland and Quake to Indian Head, Inc., a subsidiary of the Dutch company Thyssen-Bornemisza Corporation.\n\nIn 1989 Robert Maxwell acquired BRS and the BRS/Search software; he announced the planned incorporation of the ORBIT Search Service and BRS Information Technologies and renamed the whole group Maxwell Online, Inc. At that time BRS Information Technologies was serving the medical and academic library marketplace with over 150 databases. Maxwell later bought the publishing company Macmillan and put Maxwell Online under Macmillan. In the same year BRS/LINK (hypertext connection of databases; first application delivering full text) was announced.\n\nAt the time of Robert Maxwell’s death in 1991, Macmillan brought in Andrew Gregory to represent the company during the 2 years that Maxwell’s affairs were being settled and to prepare Maxwell Online to be able to sell the components. Maxwell Online shortly thereafter underwent yet another name change, this time to InfoPro Technologies.\n\nEarly in 1994, InfoPro Technologies, a subsidiary of MHC Inc. (holding company for Macmillan Inc.), the former Maxwell Online service, sold off all its subsidiaries. ORBIT Search Services went to the French-owned Questel, the dial-up BRS Search Services to CD Plus Technologies (later to become OVID), and BRS Software Products (including BRS/SEARCH) to Dataware Technologies. Almost up to the end of InfoPro Technologies, BRS Software had been the fastest growing segment of the company.\n\nAt the 14th BRS North American Users Group Conference in 1999, Dave Schubmehl of Dataware Technologies presented a paper in which he stated \"The purpose of this presentation is to update BRS users on upcoming releases of BRS/Search, NetAnswer, and other Dataware products. BRS/Search 7.0 will include features specifically requested by customers, as well as other enhancements. Earlier this year, Dataware acquired Sovereign Hill Software, makers of InQuery. In light of that acquisition, and Dataware's other development projects, we'll look at Dataware's plans for all products, including BRS/Search and NetAnswer.\"\n\nIn 2001 BRS/Search was acquired by Open Text and became LiveLink ECM Discovery Server.

{"id": "41985381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41985381", "title": "Chemical shift index", "text": "Chemical shift index\n\nThe chemical shift index or CSI is a widely employed technique in protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy that can be used to display and identify the location (i.e. start and end) as well as the type of protein secondary structure (beta strands, helices and random coil regions) found in proteins using only backbone chemical shift data The technique was invented by Dr. David Wishart in 1992 for analyzing Hα chemical shifts and then later extended by him in 1994 to incorporate C backbone shifts. The original CSI method makes use of the fact that Hα chemical shifts of amino acid residues in helices tends to be shifted upfield (i.e. towards the right side of a NMR spectrum) relative to their random coil values and downfield (i.e. towards the left side of a NMR spectrum) in beta strands. Similar kinds of upfield/downfiled trends are also detectable in backbone C chemical shifts.\n\nThe CSI is a graph-based technique that essentially employs an amino acid-specific digital filter to convert every assigned backbone chemical shift value into a simple three-state (-1, 0, +1) index. This approach generates a more easily understood and much more visually pleasing graph of protein chemical shift values. In particular, if the upfield Hα chemical shift (relative to an amino acid-specific random coil value) of a certain residue is > 0.1 ppm, then that amino acid residue is assigned a value of -1. Similarly, if the downfield Hα chemical shift of a certain amino acid residue is > 0.1 ppm then that residue is assigned a value of +1. If an amino acid residue’s chemical shift is not shifted downfield or upfield by a sufficient amount (i.e. <0.1 ppm), it is given a value of 0. When this 3-state index is plotted as a bar graph over the full length of the protein sequence, simple inspection can allow one to identify beta strands (clusters of +1 values), alpha helices (clusters of -1 values), and random coil segments (clusters of 0 values). A list of the amino acid-specific random coil chemical shifts for CSI calculations is given in Table 1. An example of a CSI graph for a small protein is shown in Figure 1 with the arrows located above the black bars indicating locations of the beta strands and the rectangular box indicating the location of a helix.\n\nUsing only Hα chemical shifts and simple clustering rules (clusters of 3 or more vertical bars for beta strands and clusters of 4 or more vertical bars for alpha helices), the CSI is typically 75-80% accurate in the identification of secondary structures. This performance depends partly on the quality of the NMR data set as well as the technique (manual or programmatic) used to identify the protein secondary structures. As noted above, a consensus CSI method that filters upfield/downfield chemical shift changes in Cα, Cβ, and C' atoms in a similar manner to Hα shifts has also been developed. The consensus CSI combines the CSI plots from backbone H and C chemical shifts to generate a single CSI plot. It can be up to 85-90% accurate.\n\nThe link between protein chemical shifts and protein secondary structure (specifically alpha helices) was first described by John Markley and colleagues in 1967. With the development of modern 2-dimensional NMR techniques, it became possible to measure more protein chemical shifts. With more peptides and proteins were being assigned in the early 1980s it soon became obvious that amino acid chemical shifts were sensitive not only to helical conformations, but also to β-strand conformations. Specifically, the secondary Hα chemical shifts of all amino acids exhibit a clear upfield trend on helix formation and an obvious downfield trend on β-sheet formation. By the early 1990s, a sufficient body of C and N chemical shift assignments for peptides and proteins had been collected to determine that similar upfield/downfield trends were evident for essentially all backbone Cα, Cβ, C', HN and N (weakly) chemical shifts. It was these rather striking chemical shift trends that were exploited in the development of the chemical shift index.\n\nThe CSI method is not without some shortcomings. In particular, its performance drops if chemical shift assignments are mis-referenced or incomplete. It is also quite sensitive to the choice of random coil shifts used to calculate the secondary shifts and it generally identifies alpha helices (>85% accuracy) better than beta strands (<75% accuracy) regardless of the choice of random coil shifts. Furthermore, the CSI method does not identify other kinds of secondary structures, such as β-turns. Because of these shortcomings, a number of alternative CSI-like approaches have been proposed. These include: 1) a prediction method that employs statistically derived chemical shift/structure potentials (PECAN); 2) a probabilistic approach to secondary structure identification (PSSI); 3) a method that combines secondary structure predictions from sequence data and chemical shift data (PsiCSI), 4) a secondary structure identification approach that uses pre-specified chemical shift patterns (PLATON) and 5) a two-dimensional cluster analysis method known as 2DCSi. The performance of these newer methods is generally slightly better (2-4%) than the original CSI method.\n\nSince its original description in 1992, the CSI method has been used to characterize the secondary structure of thousands of peptides and proteins. Its popularity is largely due to the fact that it is easy to understand and can be implemented without the need for specialized computer programs. Even though the CSI method can be easily performed manually, a number of commonly used NMR data processing programs such as NMRView, NMR structure generation web servers such as CS23D as well as various NMR data analysis web servers such as RCI, Preditor and PANAV have incorporated the CSI method into their software.\n\n\n"}

Geoarchaeologists' work frequently involves studying soil and sediments as well as other geographical concepts to contribute an archaeological study. Geoarchaeologists may also use computer cartography, geographic information systems (GIS) and digital elevation models (DEM) in combination with disciplines from human and social sciences and earth sciences. Geoarchaeology is important to society because it informs archaeologists about the geomorphology of the soil, sediments and the rocks on the buried sites and artifacts they're researching on.

These readings are often used to detect buried soil horizons. A buried soil's horizons may not be visible in section and this horizon is an indicator of possible occupation levels. Ancient land surfaces especially from the prehistoric era can be difficult to discern so this technique is useful for evaluating an areas potential for prehistoric surfaces and archaeological evidence. Comparative measurements down the profile are made and a sudden rise in organic content at some point in the profile combined with other indicators is strong evidence for buried surfaces.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of a material is a measure of its ability to become magnetised by an external magnetic field (Dearing, 1999). The magnetic susceptibility of a soil reflects the presence of magnetic iron-oxide minerals such as maghaematite; just because a soil contains a lot of iron does not mean that it will have high magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic forms of iron can be formed by burning and microbial activity such as occurs in top soils and some anaerobic deposits. Magnetic iron compounds can also be found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.\n\nThe relationship between iron and burning means that magnetic susceptibility is often used for:\n\nThe relationship between soil formation and magnetic susceptibility means that it can also be used to:\n\nPhosphate in man-made soils derives from people, their animals, rubbish and bones. 100 people excrete about 62 kg of phosphate annually, with about the same from their rubbish. Their animals excrete even more. A human body contains about 650g of PO4,(500g-80% in the skeleton), which results in elevated levels in burial sites. Most is quickly immobilised on the clay of the soil and ‘fixed’, where it can persist for thousands of years. For a 1 ha site this corresponds to about 150 kg PO4 ha-1yr-1 about 0.5% to 10% of that already present in most soils. Therefore, it doesn’t take long for human occupation to make orders of magnitude differences to the phosphate concentration in soil. Phosphorus exist in different ‘pools’ in the soil 1) organic (available), 2) occluded (adsorbed), 3) bound (chemically bound). Each of these pools can be extracted using progressively more aggressive chemicals. Some workers (Eidt especially), think that the ratios between these pools can give information about past land use, and perhaps even dating.\nWhatever the method of getting the phosphorus from the soil into solution, the method of detecting it is usually the same. This uses the ‘molybdate blue’ reaction, where the depth of the colour is proportional to phosphorus concentration. In the lab, this is measured using a colorimeter, where light shining through a standard cell produces an electric current proportional to the light attenuation. In the field, the same reaction is used on detector sticks, which are compared to a colour chart.\n\nPhosphate concentrations can be plotted on archaeological plans to show former activity areas, and is also used to prospect for sites in the wider landscape.\n\nThe particle size distribution of a soil sample may indicate the conditions under which the strata or sediment were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated by means of dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as till, gravel and sands, sometimes coarser silts) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodiumpyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (finer silts, clays). A rotating clock-glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a heat lamp is useful in separating particles.\n\nThe results are plotted on curves which can be analyzed with statistical methods for particle distribution and other parameters.\n\nThe fractions received can be further investigated for cultural indicators, macro- and microfossils and other interesting features, so particle size analysis is in fact the first thing to do when handling these samples.\n\nTrace element geochemistry is the study of the abundances of elements in geological materials that do not occur in a large quantity in these materials. Because these trace elements' concentrations are determined by a large number of particular situations under which a certain geological material is formed, they are usually unique between two locations which contain the same type of rock or other geological material.\n\nGeoarchaeologists use this uniqueness in trace element geochemistry to trace ancient patterns of resource-acquisition and trade. For example, researchers can look at the trace element composition of obsidian artifacts in order to \"fingerprint\" those artifacts. They can then study the trace element composition of obsidian outcrops in order to determine the original source of the raw material used to make the artifact.\n\nGeoarchaeologists study the mineralogical characteristics of pots through macroscopic and microscopic analyses. They can use these characteristics to understand the various manufacturing techniques used to make the pots, and through this, to know which production centers likely made these pots. They can also use the mineralogy to trace the raw materials used to make the pots to specific clay deposits.\n\nNaturally occurring Ostracods in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity and pH due to human activities. Analysis of Ostracod shells in sediment columns show the changes brought about by farming and habitation activities. This record can be correlated with age dating techniques to help identify changes in human habitation patterns and population migrations.\n\nArchaeological geology is a term coined by Werner Kasig in 1980. It is a sub-field of geology which emphasises the value of earth constituents for human life.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24990951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24990951", "title": "Great Hippocampus Question", "text": "Great Hippocampus Question\n\nThe Great Hippocampus Question was a 19th-century scientific controversy about the anatomy of apes and human uniqueness. The dispute between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen became central to the scientific debate on human evolution that followed Charles Darwin's publication of \"On the Origin of Species\". The name comes from the title of a satire the Reverend Charles Kingsley wrote about the arguments, which in modified form appeared as \"the great hippopotamus test\" in Kingsley's book for children, \"The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby\". Together with other humorous skits on the topic, this helped to spread and popularise Darwin's ideas on evolution.\n\nThe key point that Owen asserted was that only humans had part of the brain then known as the hippocampus minor (now called the calcar avis), and that this gave us our unique abilities. But careful dissection showed that apes and monkeys also have a hippocampus minor.\n\nIn October 1836 Charles Darwin returned from the \"Beagle\" voyage with fossil collections which the anatomist Richard Owen described, contributing to the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin outlined his theory in an Essay of 1844, and discussed transmutation with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker. He did not tell Owen, who as the up-and-coming \"English Cuvier\" held the conventional belief that every species was uniquely created and perfectly adapted. Owen's brilliance and political skills made him a leading figure in the scientific establishment, developing ideas of divine archetypes produced by vague secondary laws similar to a form of theistic evolution, while emphasising the differences separating man from ape. At the end of 1844 the anonymous book \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\" brought wide public interest in transmutation of species and the idea that humans were descended from apes, and after a slow initial response, strong condemnation from the scientific establishment.\n\nDarwin discussed his interest in transmutation with friends including Charles Lyell, and Hooker eventually read Darwin's \"Essay\" in 1847. When Thomas Henry Huxley savagely reviewed the latest edition of \"Vestiges\" in 1854, Darwin wrote to him, making friends while cautiously admitting to being \"almost as unorthodox about species\". Huxley had become increasingly irritated by Owen's condescension and manipulation, and having gained a teaching position at the school of mining, began openly attacking Owen's work.\n\nIn 1564 a prominent feature on the floor of the Lateral ventricles of the brain was named the hippocampus by Aranzi as its curved shape on each side supposedly reminded him of a seahorse, the Hippocampus (apart from a time after Mayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by others until 1829). At that same time a ridge on the occipital horn was named the calcar avis, but in 1786 this was renamed the hippocampus minor, with the hippocampus being called the hippocampus major.\nRichard Owen presented several papers on the anatomical differences between apes and humans, arguing that they had been created separately and stressing the impossibility of apes being transmuted into men. In 1857 he went even further, presenting an authoritative paper to the Linnean Society of London on his anatomical studies of primate brains and asserting that humans were not merely a distinct biological order of primates, as had been accepted by great anatomists such as Carl Linnaeus and Georges Cuvier, but a separate sub-class of mammalia, distinct from all the other primates and mammals generally. Owen supported his argument with a figure by himself of a South American monkey, a figure of a negro's brain by Friedrich Tiedemann, and of a chimpanzee's brain by Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk and Willem Vrolik.\n\nWhile Owen conceded the \"all-pervading similitude of structure—every tooth, every bone, strictly homologous\" which made it difficult for anatomists to determine the difference between man and ape, he based his new classification on three characteristics which to him distinguished mankind's \"highest form of brain\", the most important being his claim that only the human brain has a hippocampus minor. To Owen in 1857, this feature together with the extent to which the \"posterior lobe\" projected beyond the cerebellum and the presence of the posterior horn were how man \"fulfills his destiny as the supreme master of this earth and of the lower creation.\" Charles Darwin commented, \"Owen's is a grand Paper; but I cannot swallow Man making a division as distinct from a Chimpanzee, as an ornithorhynchus from a Horse: I wonder what a Chimpanzee wd. say to this?\". Owen repeated the paper as the Rede Lecture at the University of Cambridge on 10 May 1859 when he was the first to be given an honorary degree by the university.\n\nTo Thomas Henry Huxley the claim about the hippocampus minor appeared to be a significant blunder by Owen, and Huxley began systematically dissecting the brains of monkeys, determined that \"before I have done with that mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a barn door, an example to all evil doers.\" He did not discuss this in public at this stage, but continued to attack Owen's other ideas, aiming to undermine Owen's status. At his 17 June 1858 Royal Institution Croonian Lecture \"On the Theory of the Vertebrate Skull\", Huxley directly challenged Owen's central idea of archetypes shown by homology, with Owen in the audience. Huxley's aim was to overcome the domination of science by wealthy clergymen led by Owen, in order to create a professional salaried scientific civil service and make science secular. Under Darwin's influence he took up transmutation as a way of dividing science from theology, and in January 1859 argued that \"it is as respectable to be modified monkey as modified dirt\".\n\nHuxley was among the friends rallying round the publication of Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\", and was sharpening his \"beak and claws\" to disembowel \"the curs who will bark and yelp\". Charles Kingsley was sent a review copy, and told Darwin that he had \"long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated animals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species.\" Darwin was delighted that this \"celebrated author and divine\" had \"gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws.\"\n\nWhile reviews were by custom anonymous, their authors were usually known. Huxley's reviews of \"On the Origin of Species\" irritated Owen, whose own anonymous review in April praised himself and his own \"axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things\", took offence at the way the creationist position had been depicted, and complained that his own pre-eminence had been ignored. Owen bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \"ordained becoming\", with new species appearing by natural birth.\n\nThe dispute between Huxley and Owen over human uniqueness began in public at the 1860 Oxford evolution debate, during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford on Thursday 28 June 1860. After Charles Daubeny's paper \"On the Final Causes of the Sexuality of Plants with Particular Reference to Mr. Darwin's Work\", the chairman asked Huxley for comments, but he declined as he thought the public venue inappropriate. Owen then spoke of facts which would enable the public to \"come to some conclusions ... of the truth of Mr. Darwin's theory\", reportedly arguing that \"the brain of the gorilla was more different from that of man than from that of the lowest primate particularly because only man had a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor.\" In response, Huxley flatly but politely \"denied altogether that the difference between the brain of the gorilla and man was so great\" in a \"direct and unqualified contradiction\" of Owen, citing previous studies as well as promising to provide detailed support for his position.\n\nAnguish over the death of his son of scarlet fever in September 1860 pushed Huxley to the brink, from which Kingsley rescued him by a series of letters. Huxley put his fury over the death into composing a paper which violently assaulted Owen's ideas and professional reputation. It was published in January 1861 in the first issue of Huxley's relaunched \"Natural History Review\" magazine, and presented citations, quotations and letters from leading anatomists to attack Owen's three claims, aiming to prove him \"guilty of wilful and deliberate falsehood\" by citing Owen himself, and (with less clear cut justification) the anatomists whose illustrations Owen had used in the 1857 paper. While readily agreeing that the human brain differed from that of apes in size, proportions and complexity of convolutions, Huxley played the significance of these features down, and argued that to a lesser extent these also differed between the \"highest\" and \"lowest\" human races. Darwin congratulated Huxley on this \"smasher\" against the \"canting humbug\" Owen. From February to May Huxley delivered a very popular series of sixpenny lectures for working men at the School of Mines where he taught, on \"The Relation of Man to the Rest of the Animal Kingdom\". He told his wife that \"My working men stick by me wonderfully, the house being fuller than ever last night. By next Friday evening they will all be convinced that they are monkeys.\"\nGorillas became the topic of the day with the return of the explorer Paul Du Chaillu. Owen arranged for him to speak and display his collections on stage at a spectacular Royal Geographical Society meeting on 25 February, and followed this by giving a lecture at the Royal Institution on 19 March on the brains of \"The Gorilla and the Negro\", asserting that the dispute was one of interpretation rather than fact, and hedging his previous claim by stating that humans alone had a hippocampus minor \"as defined in human anatomy\". This lecture was published in the \"Athenæum\" on 23 March with unlabelled and inaccurate illustrations, and Huxley's response in the next issue a week later, \"Man and the Apes\", ridiculed Owen's use of these illustrations and failure to mention the findings of anatomists that the three structures were present in animals. In the following week's issue Owen's letter blamed \"the Artist\" for the illustrations, but claimed that the argument was correct and referred the reader to his 1858 paper. In the \"Athenæum\" of 13 April Huxley responded to this repetition of the claim by writing that \"Life is too short to occupy oneself with the slaying of the slain more than once.\"\n\nEach Saturday, Darwin read the latest ripostes in the \"Athenæum\". Owen tried to smear Huxley by portraying him as an \"advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape\", and one of his contributions was titled \"Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain\". This backfired, as Huxley had already delighted Darwin by speculating on \"pithecoid man\" (ape-like man), and was glad of the invitation to publicly turn the anatomy of brain structure into a question of human ancestry. Darwin egged him on from Down, writing \"Oh Lord what a thorn you must be in the poor dear man's side\". Huxley told Darwin's friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, \"Owen occupied an entirely untenable position ... The fact is he made a prodigious blunder in commencing the attack, and now his only chance is to be silent and let people forget the exposure. I do not believe that in the whole history of science there is a case of any man of reputation getting himself into such a contemptible position. He will be the laughing-stock of all the continental anatomists.\"\n\nThis very public slanging match attracted wide attention, and humorists were quick to take up the opportunity for satire. \"Punch\" featured the issue several times that year, notably on 18 May 1861 when a cartoon under the heading \"Monkeyana\" showed a standing gorilla with a sign parodying Josiah Wedgwood's anti-slavery slogan \"Am I Not A Man And A Brother?\". This was accompanied by a satirical poem by \"Gorilla\" at the zoo asking to be told if he was \"A man in ape's shape, An anthropoid ape, Or monkey deprived of his tail?\", and noting:\nIt then recounts Huxley's ripostes, and: \nThe poem was actually by the eminent palaeontologist Sir Philip Egerton who, as a trustee of the Royal College of Surgeons and the British Museum, acted as Owen's patron. When a delighted Huxley found out who the author of the piece was, he thought it \"speaks volumes for Owen's perfect success in damning himself.\"\n\nIn the second issue of Huxley's \"Natural History Review\", an article by George Rolleston on the orangutan brain showed the features that Owen claimed apes lacked, and when Owen responded in a letter to the \"Annals and Magazine of Natural History\" that the issue was a matter of definition rather than fact, Huxley made a public dissection of a spider monkey that had died at the zoo, to support his case. In the following issue John Marshall provided detailed measurements making the same point about the chimpanzee, as well as explaining how a chimpanzee's brain could be distorted by not being properly preserved and removed from the skull, so that it would look like the one in Owen's illustration.\n\nThe debate continued in 1862. A detailed paper by William Henry Flower in the prestigious journal, the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\", reviewed the earlier literature and presented his own studies based on having dissected sixteen species of primates, including prosimians, monkeys and an orangutan. Having stated at the outset that he had no opinion on transmutation or the origin of humans, he refuted Owen's three claims, and went further, stating that in relation to the mass of the brain, the hippocampus minor was proportionately largest in the marmoset, and proportionately smallest in mankind. The paper used terms recently coined by Huxley, and Flower was one of his close colleagues. Huxley presented more evidence against Owen in his \"Natural History Review\". The Dutch anatomists Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk and Willem Vrolik found that Owen had repeatedly used their 1849 illustration of a chimpanzee's brain to support his arguments, and to prevent the public from being misled they dissected the brain of an orangutan that had died in the Amsterdam zoo, reporting at a meeting of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences that the three features Owen claimed were unique to humans were present in this ape. They admitted that their earlier illustration was incorrect due to the way they had removed the brain for inspection, and suggested that Owen had become \"lost\" and \"fell into a trap\" in debating against Darwin. Huxley reprinted the report, in French, in his \"Review\". His confrontations with Owen went on.\nAt the 1862 British Association meeting in Cambridge that year, Owen presented two papers opposing Darwin: one claimed that the adaptations of the Aye-aye disproved evolution, and the second paper reiterated Owen's claims about human brains being unique, as well as discussing the question of whether apes have toes or thumbs. Huxley said Owen appeared to be \"lying & shuffling\", and Huxley's allies presented successive attacks on Owen. This was the first British Association annual meeting attended by Charles Kingsley, and during the meeting he produced a privately printed satirical skit on the argument, \"a little squib for circulation among his friends\" written in the style of the then popular stage character Lord Dundreary, a good natured but brainless aristocrat known for huge bushy sideburns and for mangling proverbs or sayings in \"Dundrearyisms\". The skit was titled \"Speech of Lord Dundreary in Section D, on Friday Last, On the Great Hippocampus Question\".\n\nThe \"British Medical Journal\" asked, \"Is it not high time that the annual passage of barbed words between Professor Owen and Professor Huxley, on the cerebral distinction between men and monkeys, should cease? ... Continued on its present footing, it becomes a hindrance and an injury to science, a joke for the populace, and a scandal to the scientific world.\" The London \"Quarterly Review\" took up the joke, describing the confrontation of Owen with Huxley and his supporters Rolleston and Flower dramatically: \"Animation increased, 'decorous reticence' was at an end, and all parties enjoyed the scene except the disputants. Surely apes were never before so honoured, as to be the theme of the warmest discussion in one of the two principal university towns in England. Strange sight was this, that three or four most accomplished anatomists were contending against each other like so many gorillas, and either reducing man to a monkey, or elevating the monkey to the man!\" In October the \"Medical Times and Gazette\" reported Owen's presentation with full detail of the responses by Huxley, Rolleston and Flower, as well as Owen's rebuttal. The dispute continued in the next two issues of the magazine.\n\nAt about the same time as he was attending the Cambridge British Association meeting in 1862, instalments of Charles Kingsley's story for children \"The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby\" were being published in \"Macmillan's Magazine\" as a serial. Kingsley incorporated material modified from his skit about Dundreary's speech \"On the Great Hippocampus Question\", as well as other references to the protagonists, the British Association, and notable scientists of the day. When the protagonist Tom is turned into a water-baby by the fairies, the question is raised that if there were water-babies, surely someone would have caught one and \"put it into spirits, or into the \"Illustrated News\", or perhaps cut it into two halves, poor dear little thing, and sent one to Professor Owen, and one to Professor Huxley, to see what they would each say about it.\" As for the suggestion that a water-baby is contrary to nature;\nKeeping up an even-handed treatment, Kingsley introduced as a character in the story Professor Ptthmllnsprts (Put-them-all-in-spirits) as an amalgam of Owen and Huxley, satirising each in turn. Like the very possessive Owen, the Professor was \"very good to all the world as long as it was good to him. Only one fault he had, which cock-robins have likewise, as you may see if you look out of the nursery window—that, when any one else found a curious worm, he would hop round them, and peck them, and set up his tail, and bristle up his feathers, just as a cock-robin would; and declare that he found the worm first; and that it was his worm; and, if not, that then it was not a worm at all.\" Like Huxley, \"the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true, merely because people thought them beautiful. ... The professor, indeed, went further, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle.\" A paragraph on \"the great hippopotamus test\" opens with the Professor, like Huxley, declaring \"that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have\", but then like Owen presenting the argument that \"If you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, you are no ape\".\n\nThen, presented with the awkward question, \"But why are there not water-babies?\", the Professor in Huxley's characteristic voice answered quite sharply: \"Because there ain’t.\"\n\n\"The Water-Babies\" was published in book form in 1863, and in the same year an even more satirical short play was published anonymously by George Pycroft. In \"A Report of a Sad Case Recently Tried before the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley... the Great Bone Case\", the vulgarity of the behaviour of Owen and Huxley is parodied as them being taken to court for brawling\nin the streets and disturbing the peace. In court, they shout terms such as \"posterior cornu\" and \"hippocampus minor\". In giving evidence, Huxley states \"Well, as I was saying, Owen and me is in the same trade; and we both cuts up monkeys, and I finds something in the brains of them. Hallo! says I, here's a hippocampus. No, there ain't says Owen. Look here says I. I can't see it he says and he sets to werriting and haggling about it, and goes and tells everybody, as what I finds ain't there, and what he finds is\".\n\nHuxley expanded his lectures for working men into a book titled \"Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature\", published in 1863. His intention was expressed in a letter to Charles Lyell which referred to the \"Monkeyana\" poem of 1861: \"I do not think you will find room to complain of any want of distinctness in my definition of Owen's position touching the Hippocampus question. I mean to give the whole history of the business in a note, so that the paraphrase of Sir Ph. Egerton's line 'To which Huxley replies that Owen he lies', shall be unmistakable.\" Darwin exclaimed, \"Hurrah the monkey book has come\". A central part of the book provides a step by step explanation suitable for newcomers to anatomy of how the brains of apes and humans are fundamentally similar, with particular reference to both having a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor. The chapter concludes that this close similarity between apes and mankind proves that the original definition by Linnaeus of the biological Order of Primates was correct to include both, and mentions that an explanation of humans originating from apes is provided by Darwin's theory. The book also includes six pages of small print giving \"a succinct History of the Controversy respecting the Cerebral Structure of Man and the Apes\" describing how Owen had \"suppressed\" and denied what Huxley had now shown to be the truth regarding the hippocampus minor, posterior horn, and posterior lobe, describing this as reflecting on Owen's \"personal veracity\". Reviewers regarded the book as a polemic against Owen, and a majority of them sided with Huxley.\nSir Charles Lyell's authoritative \"Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man\" was also published in 1863, and included a detailed review of the hippocampus question which gave solid and unambiguous support to Huxley's arguments. In an attempt to refute Lyell's judgement, Owen again defended his classification scheme, introducing a new claim that the hippocampus minor was virtually absent in an \"idiot\". Then in 1866 Owen's book \"On the Anatomy of Vertebrates\" presented accurate brain illustrations. In a long footnote, Owen cited himself and the earlier literature to admit at last that in apes \"all the homologous parts of the human cerebral organ exist\". However, he still believed that this did not invalidate his classification of man in a separate subclass. He now claimed that the structures concerned – the posterior lobe, the posterior horn, and the hippocampus minor – were in apes only \"under modified form and low grades of development\". He accused Huxley and his allies of making \"puerile\", \"ridiculous\" and \"disgraceful\" attacks on his scheme of classification.\n\nThe publicity surrounding the affair tarnished Owen's reputation. While Owen had a laudable aim of finding an objective way of defining the uniqueness of humanity and distinguishing their brain anatomy in a qualitative way, not just a quantitative way, his obstinacy in refusing to admit his errors in trying to find that difference led to his fall from the pinnacle of British science. Huxley gained influence, and his X Club of like minded scientists used the journal \"Nature\" to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science. Even many of his supporters, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that though humans shared a common ancestor with apes, the higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in 1871 in the \"Descent of Man\".\n\nIn a talk about biological systematics (classification) and cladistics given at the American Museum of Natural History in 1981, the paleontologist Colin Patterson discussed an argument put in a paper by Ernst Mayr that humans could be distinguished from apes by the presence of Broca's area in the brain. Patterson commented that this reminded him of \"The Great Hippocampus Question\" as recorded in fiction by Kingsley, and as in fact being a controversy between Huxley and Owen that \"eventually as usual, Huxley won.\"\n\n\n (subscription required)\n"}

Such guided modes are also called \"leaky modes\", as they do not remain guided, and have been observed in one and two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs.\n\nAn example of guided-mode resonance is a \"grating coupler\", which is a region on top of or below a waveguide where there is a grating. Off-resonance light incident on the grating behaves almost the same as it would if it was incident in an area where there is no grating. Waveguides are usually made of dielectric and are transparent. For specific combinations of incident angles and light frequency, there is resonance, allowing the grating to couple light into a guided mode of the waveguide.\n\nTypically, the grating coupler has only a few periods, so light can be coupled into the waveguide, but not back out. In such a case, light will be guided in the waveguide until it reaches the waveguide edge, or an additional coupling element, which will couple the light out. The larger the diffraction efficiency of the grating, the larger percent of light that would be coupled in. If the grating is used as a coupling-out element, the larger the diffraction efficiency, the fewer periods would be needed to couple the light out.\n\nA grating coupler that is extended over the whole surface of the grating results in a combined structure sometimes called a \"grating waveguide structure.\" In such a structure, light cannot be guided, as any light coupled in is also coupled out. At resonance, a normally transparent structure becomes reflective. If the grating period is sub-wavelength, then the normally-transparent structure becomes a mirror under resonance conditions. These conditions include the angle, frequency (wavelength), and polarization of the incident light. At resonance, there is also a much higher intensity in the waveguide region. Such intensities are called \"evanescent\" as they decay exponentially outside of the waveguide region.\n\nThe guided mode resonance can be used to design filters and sensors.\n\n"}

A material or image that is homogeneous is uniform in composition or character (i.e. color, shape, size, weight, height, distribution, texture, language, income, disease, temperature, radioactivity, architectural design, etc.); one that is heterogeneous is distinctly nonuniform in one of these qualities.\n\nThe words homogeneous and heterogeneous come from Medieval Latin \"homogeneus\" and \"heterogeneus\", from Ancient Greek ὁμογενής (\"homogenēs\") and ἑτερογενής (\"heterogenēs\"), from ὁμός (\"homos\", “same”) and ἕτερος (\"heteros\", “other, another, different”) respectively, followed by γένος (\"genos\", “kind”); -ous is an adjectival suffix.\n\nThe alternate spellings omitting a final \"e\" are commonly, but incorrectly, used: homogenous strictly is a biological/pathological term which has largely been replaced by \"homologous\". Use of homogenous to mean \"homogeneous\" has seen a sufficient rise since 2000 to render it an \"established variant\". \"Heterogenous\" is a spelling also traditionally reserved to biology and pathology which refers to the property of an object in the body having its origin outside the body.\n\nThe concept is the same to every level of complexity, from atoms to populations of animals or people, and galaxies. Hence, an element may be homogeneous on a larger scale, compared to being heterogeneous on a smaller scale. This is known as an effective medium approach, or effective medium approximations.\n\nVarious disciplines understand \"heterogeneity\", or being \"heterogeneous\", in different ways. For example:\n\nIn chemistry, a heterogeneous mixture consists of either or both of a) multiple states of matter or b) hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances in one mixture; an example of the latter would be a mixture of water, octane, and silicone grease. Heterogeneous solids, liquids, and gases may be made homogeneous by melting, stirring, or by allowing time to pass for diffusion to distribute the molecules evenly. For example, adding dye to water will create a heterogeneous solution at first, but will become homogeneous over time. Entropy allows for heterogeneous substances to become homogeneous over time.\n\nA heterogeneous mixture is a mixture of two or more compounds. Examples are: mixtures of sand and water or sand and iron filings, a conglomerate rock, water and oil, a salad, trail mix, and concrete (not cement). A mixture can be determined to be homogeneous when everything is settled and equal, and the liquid, gas, the object is one color or the same form. Various models have been proposed to model the concentrations in different phases. The phenomena to be considered are mass rates and reaction.\n\nHomogeneous reactions are chemical reactions in which the reactants and products are in the same phase, while heterogeneous reactions have reactants in two or more phases. Reactions that take place on the surface of a catalyst of a different phase are also heterogeneous. A reaction between two gases or two miscible liquids is homogeneous. A reaction between a gas and a liquid, a gas and a solid or a liquid and a solid is heterogeneous. \n\nEarth is a heterogeneous substance in many aspects. e.g. rocks (geology) are inherently heterogeneous, usually occurring at the micro-scale and mini-scale.\n\nWith information technology, heterogeneous computing occurs in a network comprising different types of computers, potentially with vastly differing memory sizes, processing power and even basic underlying architecture. \nIn algebra, homogeneous polynomials have the same number of factors of a given kind.\n\nIn the study of binary relations, a homogeneous relation is a relation on a set X (\"R\" ⊆ \"X\" × \"X\" ) while a heterogeneous relation concerns distinct sets (\"R\" ⊆ \"X\" × \"Y\",  \"X\" ≠ \"Y\" ).\n\nIn statistical meta-analysis, study heterogeneity is when multiple studies on an effect are actually measuring somewhat different effects due to differences in subject population, intervention, choice of analysis, experimental design, etc.; this can cause problems in attempts to summarize the meaning of the studies.\n\nIn medicine and genetics, a genetic or allelic heterogeneous condition is one where the same disease or condition can be caused, or contributed to, by several factors, or in genetic terms, by varying or different genes or alleles.\n\nIn cancer research, cancer cell heterogeneity is thought to be one of the underlying reasons that make treatment of cancer difficult.\n\nIn physics, \"heterogeneous\" is understood to mean \"having physical properties that vary within the medium\".\n\nIn sociology, \"heterogeneous\" may refer to a society or group that includes individuals of differing ethnicities, cultural backgrounds, sexes, or ages. Diverse is the more common synonym in the context.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1385342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1385342", "title": "Leonard Digges (scientist)", "text": "Leonard Digges (scientist)\n\nLeonard Digges (c.1515 – c.1559) was a well-known English mathematician and surveyor, credited with the invention of the theodolite, and a great populariser of science through his writings in English on surveying, cartography, and military engineering. His birth date is variously suggested as c.1515 or c.1520 (but certainly by 1530).\n\nMuch of his work was expanded on, annotated, and published by his son, Thomas Digges. His son followed in his footsteps and was a pivotal player in the popularisation of Copernicus's book \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\". Notes written by Thomas Digges in the publication of the book \"Pantometria\" in 1570 contain descriptions of how Leonard Digges made use of a \"proportional Glass\" to view distant objects and people. Some, such as astronomer and historian Colin Ronan, claim this describes a reflecting or refracting telescope built between 1540 and 1559, but its vague description and claimed performance makes it dubious.\n\nLeonard Digges, born about 1515, was the only son of James Digges (born c.1473), esquire, of Digges Court and Broome in Barham, Kent, by his second wife, Philippe Engham, the daughter of John Engham, esquire, of Chart, Kent. James Digges had been High Sheriff of Kent in 1510–11, and had married as his first wife Mildred Fineux, the daughter of Sir John Fineux, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and Elizabeth Apuldrefield, by whom he had an only son, John Digges, who married Mildred Scott, the daughter of Sir John Scott (d. 7 October 1533) of Scot's Hall in Smeeth, Kent. John Digges predeceased his father, leaving two sons by his wife, Mildred Scott, William Digges and Francis Digges. James Digges made his last will on 20 February 1535/6 requesting burial in the north chancel of the church of Barham, 'where my mother and my wife do lie', and naming as executors his second wife, Philippe; John Sackville, esquire; his nephew, Robert Brent, gentleman; and his son, Leonard, with Sir William Hawte as overseer. The will was proved on 24 November 1540, at which time his second wife, Philippe, was still living.\n\nLeonard Digges was the grandson of John Digges, esquire, of Digges Court and Broome, High Sheriff of Kent in 1495-6, and his wife Joan Clifton, the daughter and co-heiress of Sir Gervase Clifton of Clifton, Nottinghamshire, London, and Brabourne, Kent, by his first wife, Isabel Herbert, daughter of Vincent Herbert, esquire. Leonard Digges' aunt, Isabel Digges, the daughter of John Digges and Joan Clifton, married Richard Sackville (d. 28 July 1524), esquire, and was the mother of John Sackville.\n\nIn 1542 Digges, in company with three other gentlemen, visited the castle of Guînes, 'where they impressed their host through debate and demonstration of their skills in geometry, navigation, measurement, and artillery'.\n\nIn January 1554 Digges took part in an unsuccessful rebellion led by the Protestant Sir Thomas Wyatt, who opposed the projected marriage between Philip II of Spain and England's new Catholic Queen, Mary I. Digges was convicted of high treason, attainted, and condemned to death. His life was pardoned on 1 April 1554, but according to Johnston 'his lands and goods, which had been seized after his attainder, continued to be held subject to payment of recognizances to the crown'. In February 1555 Digges was fined 400 marks. After being paid off in instalments, the fine was discharged on 7 May 1558. The date of Digges' death is unknown; he is thought to have died about 1559:\n\nFrom Thomas's autobiographical comments in a legal dispute of the 1590s it can be inferred that Leonard died about 1559, shortly after he had resumed possession of his confiscated lands.\n\nDigges married Bridget Wilford, the daughter of Thomas Wilford, esquire, of Hartridge in Cranbrook, Kent, by his first wife, Elizabeth Culpeper, the daughter of Walter Culpeper, esquire, by whom he had three sons and three daughters:\n\n\nThe first publication of many by Leonard Digges was \"A General Prognostication\" published in 1553, which became a best-seller as it contained a perpetual calendar, collections of weather lore and a wealth of astronomical material, until then largely only obtainable through books published in Latin or Greek. It was revised in 1555 (the earliest surviving edition) and again in 1556 with the title \"A Prognostication everlasting\". Subsequent editions reprint the text from 1556; editions from 1576 and later include additional material by his son.\nThere are claims Leonard Digges independently invented the reflecting telescope, and/or the refracting telescope as part of his need to see accurately over long distances during his surveying works. In the preface to the 1591 \"Pantometria,\" (a book on measurement, partially based on his father's notes and observations) Leonard's son Thomas lauded his father's accomplishments. Some of the praise of the son for the father appears to be extravagant exaggeration, while other claims appear more credible. On the fifth page of the preface, Thomas Digges provides a remarkable account of his father's accomplishments:\n[H]is divine mind aided with this science of Geometrical mensurations, found out the quantities, distances, courses, and strange intricate miraculous motions of these resplendent heavenly Globes of Sun, Moon, Planets and Stares fixed, leaving the rules and precepts thereof to his posterity. Archimedes also (as some suppose) with a glass framed by revolution of a section Parabolicall, fired the Roman navy in the sea coming to the siege of Syracuse. But to leave these celestial causes and things done of antiquity long ago, my father by his continual painful [painstaking] practices, assisted with demonstrations Mathematical, was able, and sundry times hath by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places. \n\nThe writings left by Digges' colleague William Bourne contain further detail on the experiments with lenses and mirrors conducted by Leonard Digges and his son. It is these details which led some researchers, most notably Colin Ronan, to claim that Leonard Digges invented a functioning telescope sometime between 1540 and 1559. The description seemed to suggest that Digges created a rudimentary instrument incorporating lenses and a concave mirror, in a manner rather different from a modern reflecting telescope. However, the construction of lenses to the required optical precision would have been very difficult in the 16th century, and the construction of an adequate mirror would have been much harder still. It is doubtful that Digges built a successful instrument, and the optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away was far beyond the technology of the time.\n\n\n"}

The competition originally focused on Logic programming of Multi-agent systems. The goals, raised in 2005, have proven to be a solid basis for multi-agent system development and are still valid:\nIn 2007, a third goal has been added:\nAlthough it is necessary to find a solution for the contest quest to win, the organizers pursue the intention that the solution is a system of cooperating autonomous programs that achieve the objectives together. They are also interested in how the contest participants develop the solution.\n\nAgents have to look for food and bring it to a depot on a two-dimensional grid world. Each cell can contain an agent, or food. The agents can only see a small part of the map. Initially there is no food available, it appears randomly during the game, so that agents need to search the map constantly in order to win. This scenario was used in 2005.\n\nOn a grid based map, teams of agents look for gold and transport it to the depot. As opposed to the food scenario, cells can also contain trees which block the agents and can form more or less complex labyrinths. Also, there are now two opposing teams competing for the gold. This scenario was used in the contests of 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the scenario was extended to allow the agents to carry more than one piece of gold, and to push opposing agents aside.\n\nA grid based map contains trees, corrals, cows and agents. Two opposing teams try to drive as many cows as possible in ones corral. Cows behave using Swarm intelligence. They are also afraid of cowboys and try and run away. This scenario was used in 2008, 2009 and 2010. For the last two years, gates were introduced to make the scenario more challenging.\n\nThe 2011 contest introduces a scenario called agents on mars.

{"id": "23275384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23275384", "title": "Nuclear Power and the Environment", "text": "Nuclear Power and the Environment\n\nNuclear Power and the Environment, sometimes simply called the Flowers Report, was released in September 1976 and is the sixth report of the UK Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir Brian Flowers. The report was dedicated to \"the Queen's most excellent Majesty.\" \"He was appointed \"to advise on matters, both national and international, concerning the pollution of the environment; on the adequacy of research in this field; and the future possibilities of danger to the environment.\" One of the recommendations of the report was that:\n\n\"There should be no commitment to a large programme of nuclear fission power until it has been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that a method exists to ensure the safe containment of longlived, highly radioactive waste for the indefinite future.\"\n\nThe \"Flowers Report\" was prompted by a proposal in 1975 to set up an international nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Windscale. Windscale is a large nuclear facility on the coast of Cumbria in Northwest England that was built after World War II to produce plutonium for England's nuclear weapons program. The facility suffered a leak in 1973, which put it out of commission until the plans for the international nuclear fuel reprocessing plant were proposed. This proposal was met with strong resistance after it became known to the public and as a result, the plans to build the nuclear reprocessing plant were never acted upon. \nRadioactive waste management and disposal strategies have been enacted since the publishing of \"The Flowers Report\". This put the responsibility of disposing radioactive waste into the hands of those who are producing it. It was not until 1982 that the Department of the Environment, after their previous method proved to be not as effective as they had hoped, decided to enact stronger guidelines and rules regarding radioactive waste. The responsibility of disposal was then passed over to the government. This led to the Department of the Environment gaining a few new responsibilities: securing the disposal process at an establishment, making sure the method of disposal is safe and well researched, and lastly, keeping the waste secured and away from the public after it has been disposed of.\nIn the United States, as of 2008, uranium ore reserves are primarily kept in Wyoming and New Mexico, totaling an estimated one billion, 227 million pounds. This uranium ore will be turned into fuel that will be used in the operation of nuclear power plants, creating low-levels of radioactive waste. \"Spent\" uranium fuel becomes radioactive waste as a result of the fission process. This \"spent\" fuel must be removed and replaced from nuclear power plants every 18 to 24 months; it is then shipped to specifically designed and licensed disposal sites. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation carefully control and regulate the management, packing, transport, and disposal of waste.\n\nThe Flower's report is composed of eleven chapters in a compilation of over 200 pages. The chapters cover a wide range of subjects and topics related to radioactive activity.\n\nThe Flower's Report introduction chapter consists of six pages. The report introduces the topics of nuclear technology, future projections on commercial reactors, concerns for left over radioactive waste, other uses of nuclear technology (that will not be the focus of the report), and concerns with development of nuclear reactors.\nThis chapter also gives an arrangement of the entire report's information that acts as an outline for the information presented, including later chapters' topics and main points.\n\nThe focus of the first half of the chapter is designed to provide basic information about atoms and radiation to aid in later chapters. The first half covers the basics on atoms such as: an atom consists of Neutrons, Protons, and Electrons; the atomic number of an atom determines the amount of protons in one atom; and that protons are roughly 2000 times heavier than electrons (see atom). The concept of radiation is introduced through ionization which is the process of adding one or more electrons to, or removing one or more electrons from, atoms or molecules, thereby creating ions. From there certain particles can cause ionization. The ionizing particles are alpha particles (a type of ionizing radiation ejected by the nuclei of some unstable atoms that are large subatomic fragments consisting of two protons and two neutrons), beta particles (subatomic particles ejected from the nucleus of some radioactive atoms that are equivalent to electrons), gamma particles (electromagnetic energy photon) and energetic neutron radiation (energy released from an atom in the form of neutral particles called neutrons). The second half focuses on knowledge of radiation introduced into the environment and humans. Flower's and his team concluded in 1976 that low levels over a long exposure time can prevent a cell from dividing or further damaging genetic information.\nOther topics covered are the effects of plutonium in the body. For instance, animals being susceptible to radiation causes birth defects among the litter. Chapter two concludes with a concern of radiation affecting an entire species of animals as opposed to a group.\n\nChapter Three focuses on nuclear power. This chapter main concentration is on nuclear reactors and the basic physical principals of which reactor operation is based. An understanding of the different types of reactors that are in use or plan to be used is given. It also accounts for the nuclear fuel cycle and the operations that are involved in the fabrication and treatment of nuclear fuel. It begins with the extraction of uranium from the mine to the fuel fabrication plant and then to reactors. Furthermore, it incorporates the removal of spent fuel and its treatment to extract material suitable for incorporation of fresh fuel along with the treatment and disposal of wastes.\n\nChapter Four emphasizes on major issues raised by nuclear power. The reason why chapter two and chapter three are so detailed in the effects of radioactivity and the principles of nuclear power along with the nuclear fuel cycle is so that there could be a better understanding on the problems that could cause environmental effects. Concerns about nuclear development, which is considered in detail in other chapters, centers on a few major issues. This chapter focuses on issues as a whole to ensure that they can be seen in the perspective that allows people to understand the underlying social and ethical questions that they raise. It begins with the world energy demand, the problem scale of nuclear development, and nuclear hazards that stem from other technological developments. The advantages must be weighed against the fears and risks attached to nuclear power, which can lead to many people disregarding nuclear power as an acceptable means of energy, also referred to as \"the Faustian bargain.\" Certainly these fears must be taken seriously and can not be disregarded. This chapter concludes with the concerns of the future and the fact that the world is on the threshold of a huge commitment to fission power, which if fully entered into, it may be effectively impossible to reverse for a century or more.\n\nChapter Five focuses on the internal and national control arrangements. It begins by accepting that the hazards of ionizing radiation are well appreciated by anyone who works in the field and that there is, and has been, an elaborate system at the national and international level to minimize these risks. Although there are many questions to be answered, much has been learned and there has been a stricter management with respect to ionizing radiation and protecting the health of both radiation workers and the general public. It suggests that greater resources should be allocated to a critical group that is most exposed to a particular pollutant in order to determine a safe discharge criteria. This chapter also focuses on the organizational arrangements of responsibility, which may still be unclear. If a rapid expansion in the near future occurs, new problems are likely to rise; thus, creating new changes in the allocation of responsibilities. It focuses on the present arrangements, their efficacy, and recommendations that arise in order to sustain efficacy and effectiveness. It does not discuss discharges of radioactivity to the environment, but rather presents arrangements that are made in order to ensure protection to the general public and the environment.\n\nChapter Six stresses on reactor safety and compares the risks of reactor accidents with those arising from other activities or events. It clearly states that absolute safety cannot be ensured and that the advancing scale and complexity of technology tends to increase the possible consequences of serious accidents as well as the problems by which these accidents may be caused. Accordingly, all that can be expected is that the techniques and disciplines used to ensure safety are enough to reduce accidents to acceptable rates. The biggest concern in this chapter is the environmental effects of possible reactor accidents. The focus is on looking into the principles that are applied in seeking reactor safety.\n\nChapter Seven focuses on security and the safeguarding of plutonium. Much of the concern that is presented with nuclear power is not strictly on the effects of normal operations, but to those that might be created by illicit activities directed towards nuclear installations or materials. The issues that arise within this chapter are the safeguarding of society, security arrangements, and the viewpoint of the ordinary citizen about the restrictions on their freedom that might result from security measures. One of the risks discussed is the sabotage of nuclear installation which could release harmful substances into the environment along with radioactivity. Another risk is the diversion of plutonium which could be made into a bomb or dispersed deliberately and will only increase along with the reliance of plutonium in fast conductors. Lastly, in regards to whether or not the measures necessary to protect society against these risks are going to interfere with civil liberties.\n\nChapter Eight focuses on radioactive waste management which is generated at various stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. This chapter focuses more strictly on radioactive waste, specifically on the waste that presents particularly difficult problems regarding its disposal and management. It also covers the harms that are present in the storage of nuclear waste along with the steps that are being taken to ensure that no harm is caused to the environment. Furthermore, this chapter considers the possibilities that exist for a safe disposal of these wastes and the organization needed to pursue the search and judge its results.\n\nChapter Nine focuses on energy storage and the environment along with the implications of a large nuclear power program. This chapters seeks and attempts to provide some understanding of those issues that bear on the question of whether great future dependence on nuclear fission power must be regarded as inevitable. It also helps understand if these implications should be accepted and what other alternate strategies might be available along with their economic, social, and environmental consequences. Some examples mentioned as acceptable means of energy are wave power and CHP systems.\n\nChapter Ten reflects on nuclear power and public safety. This chapter draws the line on which policy should be adopted towards the development of nuclear power. Due to the popular belief that the spread of technology is responsible for the environment progressively deteriorating, nuclear power is highly opposed in some countries. This chapter mainly focuses on the United States and how the debate between the nuclear industry and the environmental movement has become increasingly controversial. One side of the spectrum sees technology as \"blind to the dangers of the world\", whereas the other side believes they \"are making an essential contribution to the well-being of humanity.\" Also, this issue brings about the concerns of large scale nuclear power leading to a nuclear war on account of the connection of civil and military uses of nuclear power with the expansion of nuclear development.\n\nChapter Eleven is a summary of principal conclusions and recommendations.\n\n"}

The game is part of the ScienceAtHome umbrella project, developed by AU Ideas Center for Community Driven Research (CODER). CODER aims to merge theoretical and experimental quantum research with online community efforts to explore the potential for online citizen science in this otherwise highly specialized field.\n\nThe objective of the game is to complete challenges that are simulations of logical operations in a quantum computer. The team behind the game are building a scalable quantum computer with a processor consisting of 300 atoms. Logical operations are performed by moving the atoms with optical tweezers. Moving atoms in a controlled way is a difficult task because the atom becomes excited and the atomic wave function delocalises. Approaching the presumed quantum speed limit is a huge challenge for quantum algorithms and the task that Quantum Moves players are asked to tackle.\n\nIn Quantum Moves, the atomic wave function is represented as a sloshy liquid in an energy potential well created by the optical tweezers. Players control the depth and the horizontal location of the well, simulating the path on the optical tweezers. The wave function reacts to changes in the potential function as dictated by the Schrödinger equation leading to sloshing seen by the players. Players are asked to move the well without sloshing the atomic wave function too much. A path created by a player maps one-to-one to a solution of the Schrödinger equation. Top results of the game play are then used to provide guidance into the algorithm’s search space, resulting in solutions superior to those found by the algorithm alone.\n\nIn 2012, the first version of the game was developed in the programming language MATLAB and tested in several high schools across Denmark. The feedback was positive, but there were many technical issues that made the interaction in the game cumbersome. In the summer of 2012, the game was translated into Java and the first version of Quantum Moves was released. Since then, Quantum Moves has been built in Unity multi-platform development engine and released in the App Store and Google Play for use in touch screen devices.\n\n, Quantum Moves had been played over 8 million times by more than 200,000 players worldwide. In April 2016, the journal Nature published an article “Exploring the quantum speed limit with computer games”, detailing the analysis of one of the levels in Quantum Moves called BringHomeWater, and showing that players excel at solving the corresponding atomic transport problem.\n"}

{"id": "8008600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8008600", "title": "Second voyage of HMS Beagle", "text": "Second voyage of HMS Beagle\n\nThe second voyage of HMS \"Beagle\", from 27 December 1831 to 2 October 1836, was the second survey expedition of HMS \"Beagle\", under captain Robert FitzRoy who had taken over command of the ship on its first voyage after the previous captain committed suicide. FitzRoy had already thought of the advantages of having an expert in geology on board, and sought a gentleman naturalist to accompany them as a supernumerary. The young graduate Charles Darwin had hoped to see the tropics before becoming a parson, and accepted the opportunity. He was greatly influenced by reading Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\" during the voyage. By the end of the expedition, Darwin had already made his name as a geologist and fossil collector, and the publication of his journal which became known as \"The Voyage of the Beagle\" gave him wide renown as a writer.\n\n\"Beagle\" sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, and then carried out detailed hydrographic surveys around the coasts of the southern part of South America, returning via Tahiti and Australia after having circumnavigated the Earth. While the expedition was originally planned to last two years, it lasted almost five.\n\nDarwin spent most of this time exploring on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage he decided that he could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.\n\nThe main purpose of the expedition was to conduct a hydrographic survey of the coasts of the southern part of South America. This was a continuation and correction of the work of previous surveys, in order to produce accurate nautical charts showing navigational and sea depth information for the navy and for commerce.\n\nAn Admiralty memorandum set out the detailed instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; \"Beagle\" carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey the extent of the Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.\n\nThe real work of the survey was then to commence south of the Río de la Plata, with return trips to Montevideo for supplies; details were given of priorities, including surveying Tierra del Fuego and approaches to harbours on the Falkland Islands. The west coast was then to be surveyed as far north as time and resources permitted. The commander would then determine his own route west: season permitting, he could survey the Galápagos Islands. Then \"Beagle\" was to proceed to Point Venus,Tahiti and on to Port Jackson, Australia which were known points to verify the chronometers.\n\nNo time was to be wasted on elaborate drawings; charts and plans should have notes and simple views of the land as seen from the sea showing measured heights of hills. Continued records of tides and meteorological conditions were also required. An additional suggestion was for a geological survey of a circular coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean including its profile and of tidal flows, to investigate the formation of such coral reefs.\n\nThe previous survey expedition to South America involved HMS \"Adventure\" and HMS \"Beagle\" under the overall command of the Australian Commander Phillip Parker King. During the survey \"Beagle\"'s captain, Pringle Stokes, committed suicide and command of the ship was given to the young aristocrat Robert FitzRoy, a nephew of George FitzRoy, 4th Duke of Grafton. When a ship's boat was taken by native Fuegians, FitzRoy took some of them hostage. After their return to Devonport dockyard on 14 October 1830 Captain King retired.\n\nThe 26-year-old FitzRoy had hopes of commanding a second expedition to continue the South American survey, but when he heard that the Lords of the Admiralty no longer supported this, he grew concerned about how to return the Fuegians who had been taught English with the idea that they could become missionaries. He made an agreement with the owner of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the Admiralty. Soon afterwards FitzRoy heard that he was to be appointed commander of HMS \"Chanticleer\" to go to Tierra del Fuego, but due to her poor condition \"Beagle\" was substituted. On 27 June 1831 FitzRoy was commissioned as commander of the voyage, and Lieutenants John Clements Wickham and Bartholomew James Sulivan were appointed.\n\nCaptain Francis Beaufort, the Hydrographer of the Admiralty, was invited to decide on the use that could be made of the voyage to continue the survey, and he discussed with FitzRoy plans for a voyage of several years, including a continuation of the trip around the world to establish median distances. \"Beagle\" was commissioned on 4 July 1831 under the command of Captain Robert FitzRoy, who promptly spared no expense in having \"Beagle\" extensively refitted. \"Beagle\" was immediately taken into dock for extensive rebuilding and refitting. As she required a new deck, FitzRoy had the upper deck raised considerably, by aft and forward. The \"Cherokee\"-class brig-sloops had the reputation of being \"coffin brigs\", which handled badly and were prone to sinking. By helping the decks to drain more quickly with less water collecting in the gunnels, the raised deck gave \"Beagle\" better handling and made her less liable to become top-heavy and capsize. Additional sheathing to the hull added about seven tons to her burthen and perhaps fifteen to her displacement.\n\nThe ship was one of the first to test the lightning conductor invented by William Snow Harris. FitzRoy obtained five examples of the \"Sympiesometer\", a kind of mercury-free barometer patented by Alexander Adie and favoured by FitzRoy as giving the accurate readings required by the Admiralty.\n\nIn addition to its officers and crew, \"Beagle\" carried several supernumeraries, passengers without an official position. FitzRoy employed a mathematical instrument maker to maintain his 22 marine chronometers kept in his cabin, as well as engaging the artist/draughtsman Augustus Earle to go in a private capacity. The three Fuegians taken on the previous voyage were going to be returned to Tierra del Fuego on \"Beagle\" together with the missionary Richard Matthews.\n\nFor Beaufort and the leading Cambridge \"gentlemen of science\" the opportunity for a naturalist to join the expedition fitted with their drive to revitalise British government policy on science. This elite disdained research done for money and felt that natural philosophy was for gentlemen, not tradesmen. The officer class of the Army and Navy provided a way to ascend this hierarchy; it was commonly the Ship's Surgeon who collected specimens on voyages, and Robert McCormick had secured the official position of surgeon on \"Beagle\" after taking part in earlier expeditions and studying natural history. A sizeable collection had considerable social value, attracting wide public interest, and McCormick aspired to fame as an exploring naturalist. Collections made by the Ship's Surgeon and other officers were government property, though the Admiralty was not consistent on this, and went to important London establishments, usually the British Museum. The Admiralty instructions for the first voyage had required officers \"to use their best diligence in increasing the Collections in each ship: the whole of which must be understood to belong to the Public\", but on the second voyage this requirement was omitted, and the officers were free to keep all the specimens for themselves.\n\nFitzRoy's narrative recalls that, when investigating islands on the first voyage, he had regretted that no-one on board had expertise on mineralogy or geology to make use of the opportunity of \"ascertaining the nature of the rocks and earths\" of the areas surveyed, and resolved that if on a similar expedition, he would \"endeavour to carry out a person qualified to examine the land; while the officers, and myself, would attend to hydrography.\" This clearly indicated a need for a naturalist qualified to examine geology, who would spend considerable periods onshore away from the ship. McCormick lacked expertise in geology, and had to attend to his duties on the ship.\n\nFitzRoy knew that commanding a ship could involve stress and loneliness; he was fully aware of the suicide of Captain Stokes, and his own uncle Viscount Castlereagh had committed suicide under stress of overwork. For the first time he would be fully in charge with no commanding officer or second captain to consult, and it has been suggested that he felt the need for a gentleman companion who shared his scientific interests and could dine with him as an equal. There is no direct evidence to support this. Henslow described the position \"more as a companion than a mere collector\", but this was an assurance that FitzRoy would treat his guest as a gentleman naturalist. Several other ships at this period carried unpaid civilians as naturalists.\n\nEarly in August, FitzRoy discussed this position with Beaufort, who had a scientific network of friends at the University of Cambridge. At Beaufort's request, mathematics lecturer George Peacock wrote from London to Professor John Stevens Henslow about this \"rare opportunity for a naturalist\", saying that an \"offer has been made to me to recommend a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition\", and suggesting the Reverend Leonard Jenyns. Though Jenyns nearly accepted, and even packed his clothes, he had concerns about his obligations as vicar of Swaffham Bulbeck and his health, so declined. Henslow briefly thought of going, but his wife \"looked so miserable\" that he quickly dropped the idea. Both recommended the 22-year-old Charles Darwin who had just completed the ordinary Bachelor of Arts degree which was a prerequisite for his intended career as a parson, and was on a geology field trip with Adam Sedgwick.\n\nDarwin fitted well the expectations of a gentleman natural philosopher, and was well trained as a naturalist. When he had studied geology in his second year at Edinburgh he had found it dull, but from Easter to August 1831 he learned a great deal with Adam Sedgwick and developed a strong interest during their geological field trip. \nOn 24 August Henslow wrote to Darwin:\n...that I consider you to be the best qualified person I know of who is likely to undertake such a situation— I state this not on the supposition of yr. being a finished Naturalist, but as amply qualified for collecting, observing, & noting any thing worthy to be noted in Natural History. Peacock has the appointment at his disposal & if he can not find a man willing to take the office, the opportunity will probably be lost— Capt. F. wants a man (I understand) more as a companion than a mere collector & would not take any one however good a Naturalist who was not recommended to him likewise as a \"gentleman\". ... there never was a finer chance for a man of zeal & spirit... Don't put on any modest doubts or fears about your disqualifications for I assure you I think you are the very man they are in search of.\nThe letter went first to George Peacock, who quickly forwarded it to Darwin with further details, confirming that the \"ship sails about the end of September\". Peacock had discussed the offer with Beaufort, \"he entirely approves of it & you may consider the situation as at your absolute disposal\". When Darwin returned home late on 29 August and opened the letters, his father objected strongly to the voyage so the next day he wrote declining the offer, and left to go shooting at the estate of his uncle Josiah Wedgwood II. With Wedgwood's help, Darwin's father was persuaded to relent and fund his son's expedition, and on Thursday 1 September Darwin wrote accepting Peacock's offer. That day, Beaufort wrote to tell FitzRoy that his friend Peacock had \"succeeded in getting a 'Savant' for you—A Mr Darwin grandson of the well known philosopher and poet—full of zeal and enterprize and having contemplated a voyage on his own account to S. America\". On Friday Darwin left for Cambridge, where he spent Saturday with Henslow getting advice on preparations, and references to experts.\n\nAlexander Charles Wood (an undergraduate whose tutor was Peacock) wrote from Cambridge to his cousin FitzRoy to recommend Darwin. Around midday on Sunday 4 September Wood received FitzRoy's response, \"straightforward and gentlemanlike\" but strongly against Darwin joining the expedition; both Darwin and Henslow then \"gave up the scheme\". Darwin went to London anyway, and next morning met FitzRoy who explained that he had promised the place to his friend Mr. Chester, (possibly the novelist Harry Chester) but Chester had turned it down in a letter received not five minutes before Darwin arrived. FitzRoy emphasised the difficulties including cramped conditions and plain food. Darwin would be on the Admiralty's books to get provisions (worth £40 a year) and, like the ship's officers and captain, would pay £30 a year towards the mess bill. Including outfitting, the cost to him was unlikely to reach £500. The ship would sail on 10 October, and would probably be away for three years. They talked and dined together, and soon found each other agreeable. The Tory FitzRoy had been cautious at the prospect of companionship with this unknown young gentleman of Whig background, and later admitted that his letter to Wood was \"to throw cold water on the scheme\" in \"a sudden horror of the chances of having somebody he should not like on board\". He half-seriously told Darwin later that, as \"an ardent disciple of Lavater\", he had nearly rejected Darwin on the phrenological basis that the shape (or physiognomy) of Darwin's nose indicated a lack of determination.\n\nWhile he continued to get acquainted with Fitzroy, going shopping together, Darwin rushed around to arrange his supplies and equipment, getting advice from experts on specimen preservation such as William Yarrell at the Zoological Society of London, Robert Brown at the British Museum, Captain Phillip Parker King who led the first expedition, and invertebrate anatomist Robert Edmond Grant who had tutored Darwin at Edinburgh. Yarrell gave invaluable advice, and bargained with shopkeepers so Darwin paid £50 for two pistols and a rifle, while FitzRoy had spent £400 on firearms. On Sunday 11 September, FitzRoy and Darwin took the steam packet for Portsmouth. Darwin was not seasick, and had a pleasant \"sail of three days\". For the first time he saw the \"very small\" cramped ship, met the officers, and was glad to get a large cabin, shared with the assistant surveyor John Lort Stokes. On Friday Darwin rushed back to London, \"250 miles in 24 hours\", and on via Cambridge to arrive in Shrewsbury on 22 September for a last quick visit to family and friends, leaving for London on 2 October. Delays to \"Beagle\" gave Darwin an extra week to consult experts and complete packing his baggage. After sending his heavy goods down by steam packet, he took the coach along with Augustus Earle, and arrived at Devonport on 24 October.\n\nThe geologist Charles Lyell asked FitzRoy to record observations on geological features such as erratic boulders. Before they left England, FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\" which explained features as the outcome of a gradual process taking place over extremely long periods of time. In his autobiography Darwin recalled Henslow giving advice at this time to obtain and study the book, \"but on no account to accept the views therein advocated\".\n\nDarwin's position as a naturalist on board was as a self-funded guest with no official appointment, and he could leave the voyage at any suitable stage. At the outset George Peacock had advised that \"The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish you with an official appointment & every : if a salary should be required however I am inclined to think that it would be granted\". Far from wanting this, Darwin's concern was to maintain control over his collection. He was even reluctant to be on the Admiralty's books for victuals until he got assurances from FitzRoy and Beaufort that this would not affect his rights to assign his specimens. Darwin did not want his collection to go to the British Museum as he had heard that specimens from the first \"Beagle\" voyage were still waiting to be described. Beaufort assured him that he \"should have no difficulty\" as long as he \"presented them to some public body\" such as the Zoological or Geological societies. Darwin himself thought his new finds should go to the \"largest & most central collection\", not the Cambridge Philosophical Society museum that Henslow was setting up at Cambridge, but after getting Henslow's willing agreement to take delivery of the consignments of specimens, Darwin replied that he hoped to give some to the Cambridge museum.\n\nThe captain had to record his survey in painstaking paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log as well as detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring the shores of the Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once \"Beagle\" had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.\n\nGeology was Darwin's \"principal pursuit\" on the expedition and his notes on that subject were almost four times larger than his zoology notes, although he kept extensive records on both. During the voyage, he wrote to his sister that \"there is nothing like geology; the pleasure of the first days partridge shooting or first days hunting cannot be compared to finding a fine group of fossil bones, which tell their story of former times with almost a living tongue\". To him, investigating geology brought reasoning into play and gave him opportunities for theorising.\nCharles Darwin had been told that \"Beagle\" was expected to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, \"Beagle\" left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe on the west side of Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.\n\n\"Beagle\" touched at Madeira for a confirmed position without stopping. Then on 6 January it reached Tenerife in the Canary Islands, but was quarantined there because of cholera in England. Although tantalisingly near to the town of Santa Cruz, to Darwin's intense disappointment, they were denied landing. With improving weather conditions, they sailed on. On 10 January Darwin tried out a plankton net he had devised to be towed behind the ship – only the second recorded use of such a net (after use by John Vaughan Thompson in 1816). Next day, he noted the great number of animals collected far from land and wrote \"Many of these creatures so low in the scale of nature are most exquisite in their forms & rich colours. — It creates a feeling of wonder that so much beauty should be apparently created for such little purpose.\"\n\nSix days later they made their first landing at Porto Praya on the volcanic island of St. Jago in the Cape Verde Islands. It is here that Darwin's description in his published \"Journal\" begins. His initial impression was of a desolate and sterile volcanic island, but after visiting the town he came to a deep valley where he \"first saw the glory of tropical vegetation\" and had \"a glorious day\", finding overwhelming novelty in the sights and sounds. FitzRoy set up tents and an observatory on Quail Island to determine the exact position of the islands, while Darwin collected numerous sea animals, delighting in vivid tropical corals in tidal pools, and investigating the geology of Quail Island. Though Daubeny's book in \"Beagle\"'s library described the volcanic geology of the Canary Islands, it said that the structure of the Cape Verde Islands was \"too imperfectly known\". Darwin saw Quail Island as his key to understanding the structure of St. Jago, and made careful studies of its stratigraphy in the way he had learnt from Adam Sedgwick. He collected specimens and described a white layer of hard white rock formed from crushed coral and seashells lying between layers of black volcanic rocks, and noted a similar white layer running horizontally in the black cliffs of St. Jago at above sea level. The seashells were, as far as he could tell, \"the same as those of present day\". He speculated that in geologically recent times a lava flow had covered this shell sand on the sea bed, and then the strata had slowly risen to their present level. Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\" presented a thesis of gradual rising and falling of the Earth's crust illustrated by the changing levels of the Temple of Serapis. Darwin implicitly supported Lyell by remarking that \"Dr. Daubeny when mentioning the present state of the temple of Serapis. doubts the possibility of a surface of country being raised without cracking buildings on it. – I feel sure at St Jago in some places a town might have been raised without injuring a house.\" In a letter to Henslow he wrote that \"The geology was preeminently interesting & I believe quite new: there are some facts on a large scale of upraised coast ... that would interest Mr. Lyell. While still on the island, Darwin was inspired to think of writing a book on geology, and later wrote of \"seeing a thing never seen by Lyell, one yet saw it partially through his eyes\".\n\nCustomarily the ship's surgeon took the position of naturalist, and \"Beagle\"'s surgeon Robert McCormick sought fame and fortune as an explorer. When they first met at the start of the voyage, Darwin had commented that \"My friend [McCormick] is an ass, but we jog on very amicably\". They walked into the countryside of St. Jago together, and Darwin, influenced by Lyell, found the surgeon's approach old-fashioned. They found a remarkable baobab tree, which FitzRoy measured and sketched. Darwin went on subsequent \"riding expeditions\" with Benjamin Bynoe and Rowlett to visit Ribeira Grande and St Domingo. FitzRoy extended their stay to 23 days, to complete his measurements of magnetism. Darwin subsequently wrote to Henslow that his collecting included \"several specimens of an Octopus, which possessed a most marvellous power of changing its colours; equalling any chamaelion, & evidently accommodating the changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over.—yellowish green, dark brown & red were the prevailing colours: this fact appears to be new, as far as I can find out.\" Henslow replied that \"The fact is not new, but any fresh observations will be highly important.\"\n\nMcCormick increasingly resented the favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame that they could be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat. That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, and in the morning they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.\n\nDarwin had a special position as guest and social equal of the captain, so junior officers called him \"sir\" until the captain dubbed Darwin \"Philos\" for \"ship's philosopher\", and this became his suitably respectful nickname.\n\nIn South America, \"Beagle\" carried out its survey work going to and fro to along the coasts to allow careful measurement and rechecking.\nDarwin made long journeys inland with travelling companions from the locality. He spent much of the time away from the ship, returning by prearrangement when \"Beagle\" returned to ports where mail could be received and Darwin's notes, journals, and collections sent back to England. He had ensured that his collections were his own and they were shipped back to Henslow in Cambridge to await his return. Several others on board including FitzRoy and other officers were able amateur naturalists, and they gave Darwin generous assistance as well as making collections for the Crown, which the Admiralty placed in the British Museum.\n\nDue to heavy surf they only stayed at Fernando de Noronha for a day to make the required observations, and Fitzroy decided to make for Bahia, Brazil, to rate the chronometers and take on water. On 28 February they reached the continent, arriving at the magnificent sight of the town now known as Salvador, with large ships at harbour scattered across the bay. On the next day, Darwin was in \"transports of pleasure\" walking by himself in the tropical forest, and in \"long naturalizing walks\" with others continued to \"add raptures to the former raptures\". He found the sights of slavery offensive and when FitzRoy defended the practice by describing a visit to a slaveowner whose slaves replied \"no\" on being asked by their master if they wished to be freed, Darwin suggested that answers in such circumstances were worthless. Enraged that his word had been questioned, FitzRoy lost his temper and banned Darwin from his company. The officers had nicknamed such outbursts \"hot coffee,\" and within hours FitzRoy apologised and asked Darwin to remain. Later, FitzRoy had to remain silent when Captain Paget visited them and recounted \"facts about slavery so revolting\" that refuted his claim. \nSurveying of sandbanks around the harbour was completed on 18 March, and the ship made its way down the coast to survey the extent and depths of the Abrolhos reefs, completing and correcting Roussin's survey.\n\nOn 4 April they entered the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, to make observations of longitude from Villegagnon Island. Darwin took in the sights of the city then made an expedition into the interior, returning to the ship on 24 April. By then Robert McCormick had left the ship, with permission from the admiral in command, and returned to England. Assistant Surgeon Benjamin Bynoe was made acting surgeon in his place. McCormick felt \"very much disappointed in my expectations of carrying out my natural history pursuits, every obstacle having been placed in the way of my getting on shore and making collections\" while the gentleman Darwin received all the invitations from dignitaries onshore and was given facilities to pack his collections. On 26 April Darwin moved into a house he had rented at Botafogo, and stayed there with three others when \"Beagle\" left on 10 May to recheck observations at Bahia. FitzRoy had found a discrepancy of in the meridian distance of longitude between his measurements and those of Albin Roussin, and decided to go back. A seaman, a ship's boy and a young midshipman had caught a fever after visiting the Macacu River, and died. When the ship returned to Rio on 3 June, FitzRoy confirmed that his measurements of Bahia and of the Abrolhos reefs were correct, and sent these corrections to Roussin. They sailed from Rio on 5 July.\n\nAfter storms, \"Beagle\" reached Montevideo on 26 July 1832, and took observations for the chronometers. An attempt to call at Buenos Aires for information was thwarted by officials, then FitzRoy agreed a request for ship's crew (and Darwin) to briefly occupy a Montevideo fort to dispel a revolution. On 22 August, after taking soundings in Samborombón Bay, \"Beagle\" began survey work down the coast from Cape San Antonio, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.\nAt Bahía Blanca, in the southern part of present Buenos Aires Province, Darwin rode inland into Patagonia with gauchos: he saw them use bolas to bring down \"ostriches\" (rheas), and ate roast armadillo. With FitzRoy, he went for \"a very pleasant cruize about the bay\" on 22 September, and about from the ship they stopped for a while at Punta Alta. In low cliffs near the point Darwin found conglomerate rocks containing numerous shells and fossilised teeth and bones of gigantic extinct mammals, in strata near an earth layer with shells and armadillo fossils, suggesting to him quiet tidal deposits rather than a catastrophe. With assistance (possibly from the young sailor Syms Covington acting as his servant) Darwin collected numerous fossils over several days, amusing others with \"the cargoes of apparent rubbish which he frequently brought on board\".\n\nMuch of the second day was taken up with excavating a large skull which Darwin found embedded in soft rock, and seemed to him to be allied to the rhinoceros. On 8 October he returned to the site, and found a jawbone and tooth which he was able to identify using Bory de Saint-Vincent's \"Dictionnaire classique\". He wrote home describing this and the large skull as \"Megatherium\" fossils, or perhaps \"Megalonyx\", and excitedly noted that the only specimens in Europe were locked away in the King's collection at Madrid. In the same layer he found a large surface of polygonal plates of bony armour. His immediate thought was that they came from an enormous armadillo like the small creatures common in the area, but from Cuvier's misleading description of the Madrid specimen and a recent newspaper report about a fossil found by Woodbine Parish, Darwin thought that the bony armour identified the fossil as \"Megatherium\". With FitzRoy, Darwin went about across the bay to Monte Hermoso on 19 October, and found numerous fossils of smaller rodents in contrast to the huge Edentatal mammals of Punta Alta. In November at Buenos Aires he \"purchased fragments of some enormous bones\" which he \"was assured belonged to the former giants!!\", and subsequently took any chance to get fossils \"by gold or galloping\".\n\nAt Montevideo in November the mail from home included a copy of the second volume of Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\", a refutation of Lamarckism in which there was no shared ancestry of different species or overall progress to match the gradual geological change, but a continuing cycle in which species mysteriously appeared, closely adapted to their \"centres of creation\", then became extinct when the environment changed to their disadvantage.\n\nThey reached Tierra del Fuego on 18 December 1832 and Darwin was taken aback at what he perceived as the crude savagery of the Yaghan natives, in stark contrast to the \"civilised\" behaviour of the three Fuegians they were returning as missionaries (who had been given the names York Minster, Fuegia Basket and Jemmy Button). He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians as being \"without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement.\" In contrast, he said of Jemmy that \"It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here.\" (Four decades later, he recalled these impressions in \"The Descent of Man\" to support his argument that just as humans had descended from \"a lower form\", civilised society had arisen by graduations from a more primitive state. He recalled how closely the Fuegians on board \"Beagle\" \"resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties.\")\n\nAt the island of \"Buttons Land\" on 23 January 1833 they set up a mission post, with huts, gardens, furniture and crockery, but when they returned nine days later the possessions had been looted and divided up equally by the natives. Matthews gave up, rejoining the ship and leaving the three civilised Fuegians to continue the missionary work. \"Beagle\" went on to the Falkland Islands arriving just after the British return. Darwin studied the relationships of species to habitats and found ancient fossils like those he had found in Wales. Fitzroy bought a schooner to assist with the surveying, and they returned to Patagonia where this was fitted with a new copper bottom and renamed \"Adventure\". Darwin was assisted by Syms Covington in preserving specimens and his collecting was so successful that with FitzRoy's agreement he took on Covington as a full-time servant for £30 a year.\n\nThe two ships sailed to the Río Negro in Argentina and on 8 August 1833 Darwin left on another journey inland with the gauchos. On 12 August he met General Juan Manuel de Rosas who was then leading a punitive expedition in his military campaign against native \"Indians\", and obtained a passport from him. As they crossed the pampas the gauchos and Indians told Darwin of a rare smaller species of rhea. After three days at Bahía Blanca he grew tired of waiting for \"Beagle\" and on 21 August revisited Punta Alta where he reviewed the geology of the site in light of his new knowledge, wondering if the bones were older than the seashells. He was very successful with searching for bones, and on 1 September found a near complete skeleton with its bones still in position.\n\nHe set off again and on 1 October searching the cliffs of the Carcarañá River found \"an enormous gnawing tooth\" then in a cliff of the Paraná River saw \"two great groups of immense bones\" which were too soft to collect but a tooth fragment identified them as mastodons. Illness delayed him at Santa Fe, and after seeing the fossilised casing of a huge armadillo embedded in rock, he was puzzled to find a horse tooth in the same rock layer, since horses had been introduced to the continent with European migration. They took a riverboat down the Paraná River to Buenos Aires but became entangled in a revolution as rebels allied to Rosas blockaded the city. The passport helped and with Covington he managed to escape in a boatload of refugees. They rejoined \"Beagle\" at Montevideo.\n\nAs surveys were still in progress Darwin set off on another \"galloping\" trip in Banda Oriental to see the Uruguay River and visit the Estancia of Mr Keen near Mercedes on the Río Negro. On 25 November he \"heard of some giants bones, which as usual turned out to be those of the Megatherium\" but could only extract a few broken fragments, then on the next day visited a nearby house and bought for about two shillings \"a head of a Megatherium which must have been when found quite perfect\", though the teeth had since been broken and the lower jaw had been lost. Mr Keen arranged to ship the skull down river to Buenos Aires. At Las Piedras a clergyman let him see fossils including a club-like tail which he sketched and called an \"extraordinary weapon\". His notes included a page showing his realisation that the cliff banks of the rivers exposed two strata formed in an estuary interrupted by an undersea stratum, indicating that the land had risen and fallen.\nBack at Montevideo, Darwin was introduced to Conrad Martens, the replacement artist brought on board \"Beagle\" after Augustus Earle had to leave due to health problems. They sailed south, putting in at Port Desire on 23 December, and the following day Darwin shot a guanaco which provided them with a Christmas meal. Early in the new year, Martens shot a rhea which they enjoyed eating before Darwin realised that this was the elusive smaller rhea, and preserved the remains. On 9 January 1834, further south, they reached Port St Julian and exploring the local geology in cliffs near the harbour Darwin found fossils of pieces of spine and a hind leg of \"some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon\". On 26 January they entered the Straits of Magellan and at St. Gregory's Bay they met half-civilised Patagonian \"giants\" over tall, described by Darwin as \"excellent practical naturalists\". One told him that the smaller rheas were the only species this far south, while the larger rheas kept to the north, the species meeting around the Rio Negro.\n\nAfter further surveying in Tierra del Fuego they returned on 5 March 1834 to visit the missionaries, but found the huts deserted. Then canoes approached and they found that one of the natives was Jemmy Button, who had lost his possessions and had settled into the native ways, taking a wife. Darwin had never seen \"so complete & grievous a change\". Jemmy came on board and dined using his cutlery properly, speaking English as well as ever, then assured them that he \"had not the least wish to return to England\" and was \"happy and contented\", leaving them gifts of otter skins and arrowheads before returning to the canoe to join his wife. Of the first visit Darwin had written that \"Viewing such men, one can hardly make oneself believe that they are fellow creatures placed in the same world. ... It is a common subject of conjecture; what pleasure in life some of the less gifted animals can enjoy? How much more reasonably it may be asked with respect to these men\", yet Jemmy had readily adapted to civilisation and then chosen to return to his primitive ways. This raised awkward questions; it jarred with Charles Lyell's sheltered views, expressed in volume 2 of his \"Principles of Geology\", that human races \"showed only a slight deviation from a common standard\", and that acceptance of transmutation meant renouncing man's \"belief in the high genealogy of his species\".\n\nAbout this time Darwin wrote \"Reflection on reading my Geological notes\", the first of a series of essays included in his notes. He speculated on possible causes of the land repeatedly being raised, and on a history of life in Patagonia as a sequence of named species.\n\nThey returned to the Falkland Islands on 16 March just after an incident where gauchos and Indians had butchered senior members of Vernet's settlement, and helped to put the revolt down. Darwin noted the immense number of organisms dependent on the kelp forests. He received word from Henslow that his first dispatch of specimens had reached Cambridge, with the South American fossils being prized by the expert William Clift as showing hitherto unknown species and features of the Megatherium, and displayed by William Buckland and Clift before the cream of British science, making Darwin's reputation.\n\n\"Beagle\" now sailed to southern Patagonia, and on 19 April an expedition including FitzRoy and Darwin set off to take boats as far as possible up the Santa Cruz river, with all involved taking turn in teams dragging the boats upstream. The river cut through a series of rises then plateaux forming wide plains covered with shells and shingle, and Darwin discussed with FitzRoy his interpretation that these terraces had been shores that had gradually raised in accordance with Lyell's theories. Several of the smaller rheas were seen in the distance, but were too elusive to catch. The expedition approached the Andes but had to turn back.\n\nDarwin summarised his speculation in his essay on the \"Elevation of Patagonia\". Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by \"Beagle\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s officers as well as his own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.\n\n\"Beagle\" and \"Adventure\" now surveyed the Straits of Magellan before sailing north round up the west coast, reaching the island of Chiloé in the wet and heavily wooded Chiloé Archipelago on 28 June 1834. They then spent the next six months surveying the coast and islands southwards. On Chiloé, Darwin found fragments of black lignite and petrified wood, at least two of which the British Geological Survey discovered in 2011 locked away in their collection labeled \"unregistered fossil plants\". Exchanged with Joseph Dalton Hooker about ten years later, one slide was signed \"Chiloe, C. Darwin Esq\".\n\nThey arrived at Valparaiso on 23 July. After several walks in the area, Darwin obtained horses and on 14 August set off up the volcanic Andes with a companion. Three days later they spent an enjoyable day on the summit of the Bell mountain. Darwin visited a copper mine and spent five days scrambling in the mountains before going on to Santiago, Chile. On his way back, he fell ill on 20 September and had to spend a month in bed. It is possible that he contracted Chagas' disease here, leading to his health problems after his return to England, but this diagnosis of his symptoms is disputed. He learnt that the Admiralty had reprimanded FitzRoy for buying \"Adventure\". FitzRoy had taken it badly, selling the ship and announcing they would go back to recheck his survey, then had resigned his command doubting his sanity, but was persuaded by his officers to withdraw his resignation and proceed. The artist Conrad Martens left the ship and took passage to Australia.\n\nAfter waiting for Darwin, \"Beagle\" sailed on 11 November to survey the Chonos Archipelago. From here they saw the eruption of the volcano Osorno in the Andes. They sailed north, and Darwin wondered about the fossils he had found. The giant \"Mastodon\"s and \"Megatherium\"s were extinct, but he had found no geological signs of a \"diluvial debacle\" or of the changed circumstances that, in Lyell's view, led to species no longer being adapted to the position they were created to fit. He agreed with Lyell's idea of \"the gradual birth & death of species\" but, unlike Lyell, Darwin was willing to believe Giovanni Battista Brocchi's idea that extinct species had somehow aged and died out.\nThey arrived at the port of Valdivia on 8 February 1835, then twelve days later Darwin was on shore when he experienced a severe earthquake and returned to find the port town badly damaged. They sailed north to Concepción, and arrived on 4 March to find that the same earthquake had devastated the city by repeated shocks and a tsunami, with even the cathedral in ruins. Darwin noted the horrors of death and destruction, and FitzRoy carefully established that mussel beds were now above high tide, giving clear evidence of the ground rising some which he confirmed a month later. They had actually experienced the gradual process of the continent emerging from the ocean as Lyell had indicated.\n\nBack in Valparaiso, Darwin set out on another trek up the Andes and on 21 March reached the continental divide at : even here he found fossil seashells in the rocks. He felt the glorious view \"was like watching a thunderstorm, or hearing in the full Orchestra a Chorus of the Messiah.\" After going on to Mendoza they were returning by a different pass when they found a petrified forest of fossilised trees, crystallised in a sandstone escarpment showing him that they had been on a Pacific beach when the land sank, burying them in sand which had been compressed into rock, then had gradually been raised with the continent to stand at in the mountains. On returning to Valparaiso with half a mule's load of specimens he wrote to his father that his findings, if accepted, would be crucial to the theory of the formation of the world. After another gruelling expedition in the Andes while \"Beagle\" was refitted he rejoined it and sailed to Lima, but found an armed insurrection in progress and had to stay with the ship. Here he was writing up his notes when he realised that Lyell's idea that coral atolls were on the rims of rising extinct volcanoes made less sense than the volcanoes gradually sinking so that the coral reefs around the island kept building themselves close to sea level and became an atoll as the volcano disappeared below. This was a theory he would examine when they reached such islands.\n\nA week out of Lima, \"Beagle\" reached the Galápagos Islands on 15 September 1835. The next day Captain FitzRoy dropped anchor near the site of the modern town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on Chatham Island. At the location that is now known as Frigatebird Hill/Cerro Tijeretas, Darwin spent his first hour on shore in the Galapagos islands.\n\nDarwin eagerly looked forward to seeing newly formed volcanic islands, and took every opportunity to go ashore while \"Beagle\" was methodically moved round to chart the coast. He found broken black rocky volcanic lava scorching under the hot sun, and made detailed geological notes of features including volcanic cones like chimneys which reminded him of the iron foundries of industrial Staffordshire. He was disappointed that he did not see active volcanoes or find strata showing uplift as he had hoped, though one of the officers found broken oyster-shells high above the sea on one of the islands. Abundant giant Galápagos tortoises appeared to him almost antediluvian, and large black marine iguanas seemed \"most disgusting, clumsy Lizards\" well suited to their habitat – he noted that someone had called them \"imps of darkness\". Darwin had learnt from Henslow about studying the geographical distribution of species, and particularly of linked species on oceanic islands and on nearby continents, so he endeavoured to collect plants in flower. He found widespread \"wretched-looking\" thin scrub thickets of only ten species, and very few insects. Birds were remarkably unafraid of humans, and in his first field note he recorded that a mockingbird was similar to those he had seen on the continent.\n\"Beagle\" sailed on to Charles Island. By chance they were greeted by the Englishman Nicholas Lawson, acting Governor of Galápagos for the Republic of the Equator, who accompanied them up to the penal colony. It was said that tortoises differed in the shape of the shells from island to island, and Darwin noted Lawson's statement that on seeing a tortoise he could \"pronounce with certainty from which island it has been brought\". Though Darwin remembered this later, he did not pay much attention at the time. However, he found a mockingbird and \"fortunately happened to observe\" that it differed from the Chatham Island specimen, so from then on carefully noted where mockingbirds had been caught. He industriously collected all the animals, plants, insects & reptiles, and speculated about finding \"from future comparison to what district or 'centre of creation' the organized beings of this archipelago must be attached.\" At this stage his thoughts reflected Lyell's rejection of transmutation of species.\n\nThey went on to Albemarle Island, where Darwin saw a small jet of smoke from a recently active volcano. On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater. There he saw his first Galapagos land iguanas. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the finches he was not bothering to label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird.\n\nAfter passing the northern islands of Abingdon, Tower and Bindloe, Darwin was put ashore at James Island for nine days together with the surgeon Benjamin Bynoe and their servants, and they busily collected all sorts of specimens while \"Beagle\" went back to Chatham Island for fresh water.\n\nAfter further surveying, \"Beagle\" set sail for Tahiti on 20 October 1835. Darwin wrote up his notes, and to his astonishment found that all the mockingbirds caught on Charles, Albemarle, James and Chatham Islands differed from island to island. He wrote \"This birds which is so closely allied to the Thenca of Chili (Callandra of B. Ayres) is singular from existing as varieties or distinct species in the different Isds.— I have four specimens from as many Isds.— These will be found to be 2 or 3 varieties.— Each variety is constant in its own Island...\".\n\nThey sailed on, dining on Galapagos tortoises, and passed the atoll of Honden Island on 9 November. They passed through the Low Islands archipelago, with Darwin remarking that they had \"a very uninteresting appearance; a long brilliantly white beach is capped by a low bright line of green vegetation.\" Arriving at Tahiti on 15 November he soon found interest in luxuriant vegetation and the pleasant intelligent natives who showed the benefits of Christianity, refuting allegations he had read about tyrannical missionaries overturning indigenous cultures.\n\nOn 19 December they reached New Zealand where Darwin thought the tattooed Māori to be savages with character of a much lower order than the Tahitians, and noted that they and their homes were \"filthily dirty and offensive\". He saw missionaries bringing improvement in character as well as new farming practices with an exemplary \"English farm\" employing natives. Richard Matthews was left here with his elder brother Joseph Matthews who was a missionary at Kaitaia. Darwin and FitzRoy were agreed that missionaries had been unfairly misrepresented in tracts, particularly one written by the artist Augustus Earle which he had left on the ship. Darwin also noted many English residents of the most worthless character, including runaway convicts from New South Wales. By 30 December he was glad to leave New Zealand.\n\nThe first sight of Australia on 12 January 1836 reminded him of Patagonia, but inland the country improved and he was soon filled with admiration at the bustling city of Sydney. On a journey into the interior he came across a group of aborigines who looked \"good-humoured & pleasant & they appeared far from such utterly degraded beings as usually represented\". They gave him a display of spear throwing for a shilling, and he reflected sadly on how their numbers were rapidly decreasing. At a large sheep farm he joined a hunting party and caught his first marsupial, a \"potoroo\" (rat-kangaroo). Reflecting on the strange animals of the country, he thought that an unbeliever \"might exclaim 'Surely two distinct Creators must have been [at] work; their object however has been the same & certainly the end in each case is complete',\" yet an antlion he was watching was very similar to its European counterpart. That evening he saw the even stranger platypus and noticed that its bill was soft, unlike the preserved specimens he had seen. Aboriginal stories that they laid eggs were believed by few Europeans.\n\n\"Beagle\" visited Hobart, Tasmania, where Darwin was impressed by the agreeable high society of the settlers, but noted that the island's \"Aboriginal blacks are all removed & kept (in reality as prisoners) in a Promontory, the neck of which is guarded. I believe it was not possible to avoid this cruel step; although without doubt the misconduct of the Whites first led to the Necessity.\" They then sailed to King George's Sound in south west Australia, a dismal settlement then being replaced by the Swan River Colony. Darwin was impressed by the \"good disposition of the aboriginal blacks... Although true Savages, it is impossible not to feel an inclination to like such quiet good-natured men.\" He provided boiled rice for an aboriginal \"Corrobery\" dancing party performed by the men of two tribes to the great pleasure of the women and children, a \"most rude barbarous scene\" in which everyone appeared in high spirits, \"all moving in hideous harmony\" and \"perfectly at their ease\". \"Beagle\"'s departure in a storm was delayed when she ran aground. She was refloated and got on her way.\n\nFitzRoy's instructions from the Admiralty required a detailed geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly whether they rose from the bottom of the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of tides measured with specially constructed gauges. He chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work. Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a limited range of native plants and no land birds, but hermit crabs everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of the theory he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank. This idea was supported by the numerous soundings FitzRoy had taken showing a steep slope outside the reef with no living corals below 20–30 fathoms (40–60 m).\n\nArriving at Mauritius on 29 April 1836, Darwin was impressed by the civilised prosperity of the French colony which had come under British rule. He toured the island, examining its volcanic mountains and fringing coral reefs. The Surveyor-general Captain Lloyd took him on the only elephant on the island to see an elevated coral plain. By then FitzRoy was writing the official \"Narrative\" of the \"Beagle\" voyages, and after reading Darwin’s diary he proposed incorporating it into the account, a suggestion Darwin discussed with his family.\n\n\"Beagle\" reached the Cape of Good Hope on 31 May. In Cape Town Darwin received a letter dated 29 December from his sister Caroline telling him that his fame was spreading. On 18 November 1835 Sedgwick had read extracts from Darwin's geological notes to the Geological Society of London, and this had been reported in \"The Athenæum\" on 21 November. On 25 December their father received a letter from Henslow which said that Darwin would become one of the premier naturalists of the time, and enclosed some copies of a book of extracts of Darwin's letters on South American geology which had been printed for private distribution. Their father \"did not move from his seat till he had read every word of \"your\" book & he was very much gratified – he liked so much the simple clear way you gave your information\". Darwin was horrified that his careless words were in print, but \"No hay remedio\" (it can't be helped). He explored the geology of the area, reaching conclusions about slate formation and the injection of granite seams as liquid which differed from the ideas of Lyell and Sedgwick. The zoologist Andrew Smith showed him formations, and later discussed the large animals living on sparse vegetation, showing that a lack of luxuriant vegetation did not explain the extinction of the giant creatures in South America.\n\nAround 15 June Darwin and FitzRoy visited the noted astronomer Sir John Herschel. In his diary Darwin called this \"the most memorable event which, for a long period, I have had the good fortune to enjoy.\" His zeal for science had been stirred at Cambridge by reading Herschel's book on philosophy of science, which had guided his theorising during the voyage. Their discussion is not recorded, but a few months earlier, on 20 February 1836, Herschel had written to Lyell praising his \"Principles of Geology\" as a work which would bring \"a complete revolution in [its] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated.\" and opening a way for bold speculation on \"that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others.\" Herschel himself thought catastrophic extinction and renewal \"an inadequate conception of the Creator\", and by analogy with other intermediate causes \"the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\".\n\nIn Cape Town missionaries were being accused of causing racial tension and profiteering, and after \"Beagle\" set to sea on 18 June FitzRoy wrote an open letter to the evangelical \"South African Christian Recorder\" on the \"Moral State of Tahiti\" incorporating extracts from both his and Darwin's diaries to defend the reputation of missionaries. This was given to a passing ship which took it to Cape Town to become FitzRoy's (and Darwin's) first published work.\n\nOn 8 July they stopped at St. Helena for six days. Darwin took lodgings near Napoleon's tomb, and when writing to Henslow asking to be proposed for the Geological Society, mentioned his suspicions \"that differently from most Volcanic Islds. its structure is rather complicated. It seems strange, that this little centre of a distinct creation should, as is asserted, bear marks of recent elevation.\" With a guide he wandered over the island, noting its complex sloping strata showing fault lines, interlaced with volcanic dykes. He examined beds high on the hill which had been taken as seashells showing that St. Helena had risen from the ocean in recent times, but Darwin identified them as extinct species of land-shells. He noted that woodland had been destroyed by goats and hogs which had run wild since being introduced in 1502, and native vegetation only predominated on high steep ridges, having been replaced by imported species.\n\nAt this stage Darwin had an acute interest in island biogeography, and his description of St Helena as \"a little centre of creation\" in his geological diary reflects Charles Lyell's speculation in Volume 2 of \"Principles of Geology\" that the island would have acted as a \"focus of creative force\". He later recalled believing in the permanence of species, but \"as far as I can remember, vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind\". When organising his \"Ornithological Notes\" between mid June and August, Darwin expanded on his initial notes on the Galapagos mockingbird \"Mimus thenca\":\n\nThese birds are closely allied in appearance to the Thenca of Chile or Callandra of la Plata. ... In each Isld. each kind is \"exclusively\" found: habits of all are indistinguishable. When I recollect, the fact that the form of the body, shape of scales & general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce, from which Island any Tortoise may have been brought. When I see these Islands in sight of each other, & [but del.] possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure & filling the same place in Nature, I must suspect they are only varieties.The only fact of a similar kind of which I am aware, is the constant asserted difference — between the wolf-like Fox of East & West Falkland Islds. If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks the zoology of Archipelagoes — will be well worth examining; for such facts [would \"inserted\"] undermine the stability of Species.\n\nThe term \"would\" before \"undermine\" had been added after writing what is now noted as the first expression of his doubts about species being immutable, which led to him becoming convinced about the transmutation of species and hence evolution. In opposing transmutation, Lyell had proposed that varieties arose due to changes in environment, but these varieties lived in similar conditions though each on its own island. Darwin had just reviewed similar inconsistencies with mainland bird genera such as \"Pteroptochos\". Though his suspicions about the Falkland Island fox may have been unsupported, the differences in Galápagos tortoises between islands were remembered, and he later wrote that he had been greatly struck from around March 1836 by the character of South American fossils and of species on the Galapagos Archipelago, noting \"These facts origin (especially latter) of all my views\".\n\n\"Beagle\" reached Ascension Island on 19 July 1836, and Darwin was delighted to receive letters from his sisters with news that Sedgwick had written \"He is doing admirably in S. America, & has already sent home a Collection above all praise.— It was the best thing in the world for him that he went out on the Voyage of Discovery— There was some risk of his turning out an idle man: but his character will now be fixed, & if God spare his life, he will have a great name among the Naturalists of Europe.\" Darwin later recalled how he \"clambered over the mountains... with a bounding step and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer!.\" He agreed with the saying attributed to the people of St Helena that \"We know we live on a rock, but the poor people at Ascension live on a cinder\", and noted the care taken to sustain \"houses, gardens & fields placed near the summit of the central mountain\". (In the 1840s Darwin worked with Hooker, who proposed in 1847 that the Royal Navy import tree species, a project started in 1850 which led to the creation of an artificial cloud forest.)\n\nOn 23 July they set off again longing to reach home, but FitzRoy wanted to ensure the accuracy of his longitude measurements and so took the ship across the Atlantic back to Bahia in Brazil to take check readings. Darwin was glad to see the beauties of the jungle for a last time, but now compared \"the stately Mango trees with the Horse Chesnuts of England.\" The return trip was delayed for a further 11 days when weather forced \"Beagle\" to shelter further up the coast at Pernambuco, where Darwin examined rocks for signs of elevation, noted \"Mangroves like rank grass\" and investigated marine invertebrates at various depths on the sandbar. \"Beagle\" departed for home on 17 August. After a stormy passage including a stop for supplies at the Azores, the Beagle finally reached Falmouth, Cornwall, England on 2 October 1836. A plaque now commemorates his arrival point in Falmouth, Cornwall.\n\nUpon his return, Darwin was quick to take the coach home, arriving late at night on 4 October 1836 at The Mount House, the family home in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Darwin reportedly headed straight to bed and greeted his family at breakfast. After ten days of catching up with family he went on to Cambridge and sought Henslow's advice on organising the description and cataloguing of his collections.\n\nDarwin's father gave him an allowance that enabled him to put aside other careers, and as a scientific celebrity with a reputation established by his fossils and Henslow's publication of his letters on South American geology, he toured London's society institutions. By this time he was part of the \"scientific establishment\", collaborating with expert naturalists to describe his specimens, and working on ideas he had been developing during the voyage. Charles Lyell gave him enthusiastic backing. In December 1836, Darwin presented a talk to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. He wrote a paper proving that Chile, and the South American continent, was slowly rising, which he read to the Geological Society of London on 4 January 1837.\n\nDarwin thought of having his diary published mixed in with FitzRoy's account, but his relatives including Emma and Hensleigh Wedgwood urged that it be published separately. On 30 December the question was settled by FitzRoy taking the advice of William Broderip that Darwin's journal should form the third volume of the \"Narrative\". Darwin set to work reorganising and trimming his diary, and incorporating scientific material from his notes. He completed his \"Journal and Remarks\" (now commonly known as \"The Voyage of the Beagle\") in August 1837, but FitzRoy was slower and the three volumes were published in August 1839.\n\nSyms Covington stayed with Darwin as his servant, then on 25 February 1839 (shortly after Darwin's marriage) Covington parted on good terms and migrated to Australia.\n\nDarwin had shown great ability as a collector and had done the best he could with the reference books he had on ship. It was now the province of recognised expert specialists to establish which specimens were unknown, and make their considered taxonomic decisions on defining and naming new species.\n\nRichard Owen had expertise in comparative anatomy and his professional judgements revealed a succession of similar species in the same locality, giving Darwin insights which he would later recall as being central to his new views. Owen met Darwin on 29 October 1836 and quickly took on the task of describing these new fossils. At that time the only fully described fossil mammals from South America were three species of \"Mastodon\" and the gigantic \"Megatherium\". On 9 November Darwin wrote to his sister that \"Some of them are turning out great treasures.\" The near complete skeleton from Punta Alta was apparently very closely allied to anteaters, but of the extraordinary size of a small horse. The rhinoceros sized head bought for two shillings near Mercedes was not a megatherium, but \"as far as they can guess, must have been a gnawing animal. Conceive a Rat or a Hare of such a size— What famous Cats they ought to have had in those days!\" Over the following years Owen published descriptions of the most important fossils, naming several as new species.\nThe fossils from Punta Alta included a nearly perfect head and three fragments of heads of the \"Megatherium Cuvierii\", the jaw of a related species which Owen named \"Mylodon Darwinii\", and jaws of \"Megalonyx Jeffersonii\". The near complete skeleton was named \"Scelidotherium\" by Owen, who found it had most of its bones nearly in their proper relative positions. At the nearby Monte Hermoso beds the numerous rodents included species allied to the Brazilian tuco-tuco and the capybara.\n\nOwen decided that the fossils of polygonal plates of bony armour found at several locations were not from the Megatherium as Cuvier's description implied, but from a huge armadillo as Darwin had briefly thought. Owen found a description of an earlier unnamed specimen which he named \"Glyptodon clavipes\" in 1839. Darwin's find from Punta Alta, a large surface about doubled over with toe bones still inside the folded armour, was identified as a slightly smaller \"Glyptodont\" named \"Hoplophorus\" by Lund in the same year.\n\nThe huge skull from near Mercedes was named \"Toxodon\" by Owen, and he showed that the \"enormous gnawing tooth\" from the cliffs of the Carcarañá River was a molar from this species. The finds near Mercedes also included a large fragment of \"Glyptodont\" armour and a head which Owen initially identified as a \"Glossotherium\", but later decided was a \"Mylodon\". Owen found fragments of the jaw and a tooth of another \"Toxodon\" in the fossils from Punta Alta.\n\nThe fossils from near Santa Fé included the horse tooth which had puzzled Darwin as it had been previously thought that horses had only come to the Americas in the 16th century, close to a \"Toxodon\" tooth and a tooth of \"Mastodon andium\" (now \"Cuvieronius hyodon\"). Owen confirmed that the horse tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named \"Equus curvidens\", and its age was confirmed by a corroded horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils. This discovery was later explained as part of the evolution of the horse.\n\nThe \"soft as cheese\" \"Mastodon\" bones at the Paraná River were identified as two gigantic skeletons of \"Mastodon andium\", and mastodon teeth were also identified from Santa Fé and the Carcarañá River. The pieces of spine and a hind leg from Port S. Julian which Darwin had thought came from \"some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon\" gave Owen difficulties, as the creature which he named \"Macrauchenia\" appeared to be a \"gigantic and most extraordinary pachyderm\", allied to the \"Palaeotherium\", but with affinities to the llama and the camel. The fossils at Punta Alta included a pachyderm tooth which was thought probably came from \"Macrauchenia\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Multidisciplinary student teams from universities worldwide design and build biosensing systems, and demonstrate their prototypes and business models during a final public contest event. The competition stimulates education and innovation in the field of biosensing, with a worldwide scope. The long term aim is to improve the quality of life of patients.\n\nEach year, SensUs adresses a different healthcare theme and a corresponding biomarker. The participating teams develop biosensors that can measure the selected biomarker. The teams have the same functional end goal, but develop creative solutions and unique biosensor prototypes. The prototypes are shown, shared and discussed at the annual SensUs contest event. SensUs is an international platform for learning and innovation in the field of molecular biosensors for healthcare applications.\n\nThe theme of SensUs 2019 is Rheumatoid Arthritis and the molecule to be detected is Adalimumab (brand name Humira).\nAdalimumab is a biological drug that binds to TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. The overexpression of this cytokine plays an important rolein rheumatoid arthritis. Many patients do not respond to treatment with Adalimumab or lose response during treatment. A biosensor for Adalimumab could detect this at an early stage and help save unnecessary costs. Worldwide annual sales of Adalimumab are more than 10 billion US dollars.\nA list of the participating universities in SensUs 2019 can be found below.\nThe finals of SensUs 2019 will take place on the 6th and 7th of September 2019 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. \n\nOn the 7 and 8 of September 2018, the final contest of the third edition of the Sensus Student Competition took place in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The theme was “Measuring antibiotics for better healthcare”. The teams developed biosensors for the detection of vancomycin, an important last resort antibiotic drug .\n\nAwards were given for Analytical Performance (AP), Creativity (CR), Translational Potential (TP) and Public Inspiration (PI), conferred by an international multidisciplinary jury and by public votes. The teams tested vancomycin in blood plasma and pitched the business models that they had developed. The public votes were casted on the online platform called SensUs Digital. More than 10.000 users watched SensUs via the digital platform and 3750 people cast their votes. In parallel, a competition was held for teams of High school students. \nPhotos of SensUs 2018 can be found here.\nSensUs 2017 was the second edition of the competition. The finals took place on the 8 and 9 of September 2017. Ten student teams from three continents built a biosensor to detect NT-proBNP in blood plasma, which is an important biomarker for Heart failure. During the event the teams showed their biosensors to the public, measured NT-proBNP live and presented pitches on technology and on translation to society. \nThe teams were judged by an international multidisciplinary jury, who conferred awards for Analytical Performance (AP), Creativity (CR), and Translational Potential (TP). \n\nAbout 500 people visited the event at Eindhoven University of Technology. The event was broadcast on the SensUs Digital platform, including livestreams, live data, Q&A, photos and videos and voting functionality. The cumulative visitor count on SensUs digital was 5000 from 74 countries, of which 1500 people cast their votes for the Public Inspiration award (PI).\nPhotos of SensUs 2017 can be found here.\n\nSensUs 2016 was the first edition of the competition. The aim was to develop biosensors for the measurement of creatinine in blood plasma, which is a key biomarker for Kidney failure. The student teams originated from five universities: University of Leuven, Imperial College London, Uppsala University, Technical University of Denmark and Eindhoven University of Technology. The teams had worked during 9 months to develop biosensors in their own universities, and thereafter all came to the final contest event on the 9th and 10th of September 2016 at Eindhoven University of Technology. Here they could win four awards; the Analytical Performance award (AP), the Creativity Award (CR), the Translational Potential award (TP) and the Public Inspiration award (PI).

The houses are built by the Hong Kong Government beginning in 1964 to replace wooden huts and squatter areas that began to emerge in the late 1940s and 1950s. The name was created in the 1980s to replace the original reference of \"Licensed area\".\n\nThe building design was likely influenced from military barracks.\n\nEach house is divided into tens of tiny flats, with one flat per household. Most of the THAs were demolished by the 1990s and the last demolished was in 2001.\n\nThe THA is being replaced by Interim Housing, a more resilient temporary home concept since the 1970s.\n\nLiving in a THA affords little privacy. Interior walls are only visual barriers. Cooking and showering can only be done outside the flat. Toilets were common areas for all residents to use and open sewer channels along the walkways connecting the THAs were often used by residents to brush their teeth or laundry.\n\nTemporary housing serves displaced people while the city is being planned or if their house is being remodeled or relocation from disasters like fire or typhoons.\n\n\n"}

The book was initially published on January 1, 1997 by Oxford University Press.\n\nIn the book, Smolin details his Fecund universes which applies the principle of natural selection to the birth of universes. Smolin posits that the collapse of black holes could lead to the creation of a new universe. This daughter universe would have fundamental constants and parameters similar to that of the parent universe though with some changes, providing for both inheritance and mutations as required by natural selection. However, while there is no direct analogue to Darwinian selective pressures, it is theorised that a universe with \"unsuccessful\" parameters will reach heat death before being able to reproduce, meaning that certain universal parameters become more likely than others.\n\n—Review by \"Jupiter Scientific\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23755918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23755918", "title": "This Is Your Brain on Music", "text": "This Is Your Brain on Music\n\nThis Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession is a popular science book written by the McGill University neuroscientist Daniel J. Levitin, and first published by Dutton Penguin in the U.S. and Canada in 2006, and updated and released in paperback by Plume/Penguin in 2007. It has been translated into 18 languages and spent more than a year on \"The New York Times\", \"The Globe and Mail\", and other bestseller lists, and sold more than one million copies.\n\nThe aim of \"This Is Your Brain on Music\" was to make recent findings in cognitive neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed.\n\n\"This Is Your Brain on Music\" describes the components of music, such as timbre, rhythm, pitch, and harmony and ties them to neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, cognitive psychology, and evolution, while also making these topics accessible to nonexpert readers by avoiding the use of scientific jargon. One particular focus of the book is on cognitive models of categorization and expectation, and how music exploits these cognitive processes. The book challenges Steven Pinker's \"auditory cheesecake\" assertion that music was an incidental by-product of evolution, arguing instead that music served as an indicator of cognitive, emotional and physical health, and was evolutionarily advantageous as a force that led to social bonding and increased fitness, citing the arguments of Charles Darwin, Geoffrey Miller and others.\n\n\"This Is Your Brain on Music\" was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Award in 2006-2007 for best in the Science and Engineering category, and a Quill Award for best debut author of 2006-2007. It was named one of the best books of the year by \"The Globe and Mail\", \"The Independent\" and \"The Guardian\". A long list of prominent scientists and musicians have praised it, including Oliver Sacks, Francis Crick, Brian Greene, David Byrne, George Martin, Yoko Ono, Neil Peart, Victor Wooten, Pete Townshend and Keith Lockhart, and it has been adopted for course use in both science and literature classes at dozens of universities including MIT, Dartmouth College, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Kenyon College, the University of Wisconsin. Two documentary films were based on the book: \"The Musical Brain\" (2009) featuring Levitin as host, along with appearances by Sting, Michael Bublé, Feist, and former Fugees leader Wyclef Jean; and \"The Music Instinct\" (2009) with Levitin and Bobby McFerrin as co-hosts, with appearances by Yo Yo Ma, Jarvis Cocker, Daniel Barenboim, Oliver Sacks and others. In 2009, Harvard University announced \"This Is Your Brain on Music\" would be required reading in its Freshman Core Program in General Education.In 2011-2012, the Physics Department at the California Institute of Technology adopted it as a textbook.\n\n\n"}

This theory was invented by economists Edward Lazear and Sherwin Rosen.\n\nThe theory has been applied to professional sports and to the practice of law. Tournament theory also was applied to writing - one writer may be fractionally better at writing than another (and therefore have a better book), but because people allocate small amounts of time to reading, the writer with the marginally better book will sell far more copies.\n\nThis paper, which proposed tournament theory, looks at performance related pay. Under conventional systems workers are paid a piece rate - an amount of money that relates to their output, rather than the time they input. Tournament theory suggests that workers can be rewarded by their rank in an organization, suggesting why large salaries are given to senior executives: to provide a 'prize' to those who put in enough effort to garner one of the top positions.\n\nThe paper invites the reader to consider the lifetime output of a worker at a firm. This output is dictated by two things - chance and skill. The worker can control his lifetime output by investing in skills early on in life,like studying hard at school and getting good qualifications, but a part of that output will be determined by chance. Participants in the tournament commit their investment early on in life and are unlikely to know each other previously, within the firm they work in, and may not even know each other within the firm. This prevents collusion or cheating in the tournament.\n\nLooking at the tournament in its simplest form, a two player tournament, where there is a prize for the winner and a smaller consolation for the loser. The incentive to win increases as the difference between the losing and winning prize increases, and therefore the investment of the worker is increased as the difference between the winning and losing prizes is increased. It is in the interest of the firm to increase the spread of prizes. However there is a drawback for the firms. As the workers invest more their costs rise. Competing firms could offer a tournament with a lower spread and attract more workers because they would have to invest less. Therefore, there is an optimal prize spread that firms set, high enough to induce investment but low enough so that the investment is not too expensive for the worker. The prize may take the form of extra cash or a promotion - which means more money, as well as entering a higher level of tournament, where the stakes may be higher.\n\nThe idea that the prize may be in the form of a promotion explains why presidents are paid significantly more than vice presidents. In one day a Vice-President may be promoted to President of a company and have his pay tripled. Considering piece rates this seems illogical - his output is unlikely to have tripled in one day. But looking at it using tournament theory it seems logical - he has won the tournament and received his prize - presidency.\n\nTournament theory is an efficient way of labour compensation when quantifying output is difficult or expensive, but ranking workers is easy. It is also effective as it provides goals for workers and incentivises hard work so that they may one day attain one of the coveted positions at the top. An advantage to workers over a piece rate would be that in the event of a natural disaster they would preserve their wage as their output would go down in absolute terms but stay the same relative to their colleagues. This means that in times of disaster workers could maintain their wage.\nBenefits of tournament\n(+) Motivates workers \n(+) Encourage Long-run behaviour to stay\n\nChronological order:\n\n"}
