The journal was bought by Richard Taylor in 1827, and closed down for the benefit of the \"Philosophical Magazine\".\n\nThe \"Annals of Philosophy\" were issued monthly following a standard pattern. Often the first article was a biographical article (10 pages) on a living or recently deceased scientist. This was then followed by a series of extended pieces (5-10 pages) on particular topics, sometimes by eminent authors. Then there were shorter news items and correspondence. Summaries followed: first of the proceedings of learned bodies (Royal Society, Linnean, French Institute -if available: the Napoleonic Wars made communications with the continent difficult at first, etc.), then of patents, and finally of new books. The last section was a meteorological journal. Every six months a title page, index, and preface were issued which could be bound before the six monthly issues to make a half-yearly volume. Including front matter, volumes were just under 500 pages each.\n\n\n"}

One uses appreciative listening when listening to good music, poetry or maybe even the stirring words of a great leader.\n\nIt involves listening to music that one enjoys, people the listener likes to listen to because of their style and the choices the listener make in the films and television he/she watches, radio programmes and plays and musicals in the theatre. Unlike informative listening or relationship listening, appreciative listening does not rely on the message from the speaker it is how one responds as a listener. Our appreciation of what we hear will vary depending on our individual tastes, but will also be affected by three different factors:\n\nThere are many different factors that encompass presentation including the medium, the setting and the style and personality of a presenter. Of course this works both ways and equally you will have been entranced by others because of the force of their personality and their delivery style.\n\nThe environment can also impact your appreciation of the presentation. Seating, temperature, clarity and volume of sound will all impact on whether it’s a good or poor experience.\n\nPerception is an important factor in appreciative listening. As one is exposed to different experiences his/her perceptions can change. For example: individual's taste in music. We need to listen to various types of music to have a preference over other types and appreciate them. An individual's expectations also affects our perception. \n\nAn individual's perception and expectations are driven by his/her attitudes which determine how he/she reacts to and interact to the world in which he/she lives.\n\nSome of our perceptions are clearly influenced by our previous experience and impact on whether or not we enjoy listening to something, or whether we are even willing to listen. Whether our memories evoke pleasant or unpleasant reminders will affect our appreciation. However, it’s important to remain open to new experiences. We can develop our appreciative listening skills.\n\n"}

The notion of \"biological pollution\" and \"biological pollutants\" described by Elliott (2003) is generally accepted in invasion biology; it was used to develop the concept of biopollution level assessment (Olenin et al., 2007) and criteria for a Good Ecological Status descriptor in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (Olenin et al., 2010)\nThe magnitude of the bioinvasion impact or biopollution level (Olenin et al., 2007) may be quantified using a free online service BINPAS.\n\nIn 1991 The Indiana Academy of Science held a national cross disciplinary conference in Indianapolis (McKnight 1993), the first of its find dealing with the issue.\n\"Biopollution Level (BPL)\" is a quantitative measure of the magnitude of the biological invasion impact, ranging from \"no impact\" (BPL=0) through \"weak\" (BPL=1), \"moderate\" (BPL=2), \"strong\" (BPL=3) and \"massive\" (BPL=4) impact.\nInitially the method of calculation involves assessing the abundance and distribution range of a non-indigenous species (NIS) for a specific area (this can be, for example, an entire regional sea, bay, inlet, lagoon, pond, lake, marina, a sand bank, an aquaculture site etc.). Abundance of a NIS may be ranked as \"low\", \"moderate\" or \"high\"; and the distribution may be scored as \"one locality\" (when a NIS was found only at one locality within the assessment area), \"several localities\", \"many localities\" or \"all localities\" (found at all localities). Combination of the abundance and distribution scores gives five classes of the abundance and distribution range. Once obtained this value aids in calculating an impact on 1) native communities, 2) habitats and, 3) ecosystem functioning. The calculation is based on ecological concepts, e.g. \"key species\", \"type specific communities\", \"habitat alteration, fragmentation and loss\", \"functional groups\", \"food web shift\", etc. Calculations are for a stated time period to enable assessment of temporal changes.\nThe method can be used for a single species or for several species for a specific (assessment) area. The method was designed for species in aquatic ecosystems (Olenin et al., 2007) but is currently being tested for terrestrial environments and there is a free on-line service BINPAS.\nThe biopollution level enables quantification of an impact in a robust manner in a standard and repeatable way. It makes it possible for comparison between different regions and taxonomic groups at different time intervals. The most impacting biota can be readily distinguished for a given region. It does not evaluate whether an impact effect is either good or bad, it states the change in an ecosystem due to an alien species invasion and measures the magnitude of this change. However, the method requires adequate information in order to obtain the magnitude of the impact, assessed at three levels of confidence (low, medium and high) according to the quality of the data available.\nThe method is simple to undertake and provide a means of quantifying impacts within any world region. Some assessments have been published (Olenina et al., 2010).\n\nThis is a free online system that calculates the magnitude of the biological invasion impact or biopollution level (Narščius et al., 2012).\nBINPAS translates the existing data on miscellaneous invasive alien species impacts on population, community, habitat or ecosystem into uniform biopollution measurement units. The service is free of charge and available at for anyone interested in biological invasions. Experts willing to perform the assessment for their studied regions are welcome to register and compile the information as contributors.\n\n"}

{"id": "38433123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38433123", "title": "Cognitive inhibition", "text": "Cognitive inhibition\n\nCognitive inhibition refers to the mind's ability to tune out stimuli that are irrelevant to the task/process at hand or to the mind's current state. Cognitive inhibition can be done either in whole or in part, intentionally or otherwise. Cognitive inhibition in particular can be observed in many instances throughout specific areas of cognitive science.\n\nThe early models of what would become the study and concept of cognitive inhibition were developed by Sigmund Freud. Inhibition was believed to play two primary roles: the prevention of unwanted thoughts or behaviors, and the repression of experiences from infancy and childhood. Freud believed cognitive inhibition was not just a lack of awareness to stimuli but an active process, requiring a constant energy expenditure.\n\nOther early theories of cognitive inhibition focused on its central developmental mechanisms and were founded by Luria and Vygotsky, two Russian psychologists. They proposed that children acquire control of behavior and thought through internalized speech, and that they consciously exhibit a cognitively inhibitory process in order to regulate their own behavior. Cognitive inhibition was thought to develop as mental control over behavior developed.\n\nDuring the past 30 years inhibitory mechanisms such as cognitive inhibition have not been particularly prominent in developmental psychology, but currently they are undergoing a revival in the study of inefficient inhibition (explored in a later section) and resource limitations.\n\nCognitive inhibition can be seen at work during studies in developmental psychology. An experiment done by Friedman and Leslie explained children's performance in the false belief task as relying on a critical inhibitory process. What this demonstrated is that reaching the age of 3 or 4 triggers cognitive inhibition ability formation. The idea is that children who are 3 or 4 can suppress information from their cognitive experience in order to evaluate a situation from another's point of view. This is very important developmentally as it may interact with the formation of empathy: cognitive inhibition cannot be so great as to completely block one's experiences while evaluating another point of view, but must be strong enough to enable an accurate representation of that point of view. Other elements of cognitive inhibition that are studied in developmental psychology include memory formation or memory inhibition. It has been demonstrated that intentional inhibition of memory commitment is not fully developed until adulthood, and is very difficult for children to accomplish. This illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition tasks, such as those in memory processing, are a gradually acquired skill rather than instinctual. Other cognitive functions that are developed gradually throughout childhood include exercising self-control over retained representational structures of information and quickly adapting cognitive processing to changing behavioral situations. Both of these functions were determined to be present throughout development, but not at full capacity until young adulthood. Evidently, the ability to intentionally ignore irrelevant details and to focus attention and cognitive ability on more relevant details is not present in young children and is a highly developmentally-related process.\n\nCognitive inhibition may have played a role in the survival of human children, in what is called betrayal trauma theory. \"In situations involving treacherous acts by a caregiver, a 'cognitive information blockage' may occur that results in an isolation of knowledge of the event from awareness\". This motivated forgetting caused by cognitive inhibition would have been necessary in the past to maintain the crucial relationship between child and caregiver so that the child would survive; therefore, cognitive inhibition has endured through evolution. For example, a parent or caregiver may have been abusive physically or emotionally to a child, perhaps not intentionally, but the effect would be the same to the child. However, the world outside the protection of the caregiver would be even less forgiving and almost certainly fatal to the child in ancient history. So, they cognitively inhibited the memory of the abuse in order to maintain the relationship.\n\nBehavioral psychology may play an important part in the development of cognitive inhibition.\nCognitive inhibition is believed to strongly influence both sexual and aggressive urges within human society. When signals or stimuli are perceived by an individual, the mind processes the information and the body elicits a response. However, in the case of sexual arousal or perceived aggressive behavior, the individual needs to exercise caution in the cognitive processing of the incoming signals. This is where cognitive inhibition plays its part, preventing the individual from cognitively processing the stimuli and selecting an inappropriate response, thus potentially saving crucial social relationships. Behavior towards others in a social circle is strongly influenced by empathy, which can be seen as a form of cognitive inhibition. Empathy causes an individual to understand the physical/emotional pain and suffering of others. When an interaction occurs, cognitive inhibition on the part of the individual causes him or her to respond appropriately and avoid upsetting someone already in physical or emotional pain. Again, this is important in maintaining social relationships.\n\nBehavioral control is an important application of cognitive inhibition in behavioral psychology, as is emotional control. Depression is an example of cognitive inhibition failure in emotion control. Correctly functioning cognitive inhibition would result in reduced selective attention to negative stimuli and retention of negative thoughts. \"There is emerging evidence that depression is characterized by deficits in the inhibition of mood-congruent material. These deficits could result in prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information thereby hindering recovery from negative mood and leading to the sustained negative affect that characterizes depressive episodes\". Anger is another important emotion affected by cognitive inhibition. \"Trait anger is a robust predictor of the angry and aggressive response to hostile situational input, but it is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying this personality...individuals low in trait anger systematically recruit cognitive control resources within hostile contexts\". When situations that may elicit anger leading to violence arise, cognitive inhibition is used extensively. Hostile stimuli magnitude are considered and ignored to avoid confrontation. Social context situations that may be interpreted as hostile are processed, and through cognitive inhibition, logic and reasoning are used to handle the situation. When a degree of cognitive inhibition ability is absent in an individual, it can result in \"trait anger\", or frequent angry and violent outbursts at relatively inoffensive stimuli. Without cognitive inhibition and its resulting omission of irrelevant or unimportant information, emotional stability can be compromised.\n\nBehavioral neuroscience applies the principles of neurobiology, to the study of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior. Cognitive inhibition is caused by several different interacting biological factors. The first is the existence of inhibitory neurotransmitters, or chemicals emitted by brain cells to both communicate and inhibit communication between each other. \"GABA, an inhibitory transmitter substance that has been implicated in certain simple behavioral measures of inhibition and the control of aggressive behavior, was discovered in the cerebral cortex in substantial quantities\". Given the cerebral cortex's importance in many brain functions such as memory and thought, the presence of the inhibitory substance GABA supports the cognitive inhibition processes that go on in this area of the brain. Serotonin and dopamine, which can play inhibitory roles as well, are present in the brain in large quantities. All three of these neurotransmitters are capable of \"blocking\" the transmissions between neurons, which can ultimately result in cognitive inhibition. In addition, the presence of inhibitory connections in the central nervous system has been firmly demonstrated (Eccles, 1969). A process known as lateral inhibition, which involves the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors, is integral in the biology of cognitive inhibition. It provides much of the neural background behind it and explains what exactly is going on at the cellular level.\n\nMany contemporary cognitive theorists postulate models featuring a central pool \"of mental resources that must be allocated to the various operations involved in processing, retaining, and reporting information\". This means that working memory and the various areas of the brain responsible for it are theoretically limited to a finite set of \"mental resources\" or mental capacity with which to carry out operation. Cognitive inhibition, of course, is responsible for determining what is relevant to the working memory and shuts out what is irrelevant, \"freeing up space\" and mental capacity needed for more pressing matters. In the theory of inefficient inhibition, cognitive inhibition does not perform its function fully, and a shortage of mental resources leads to decreased performance or inefficiency in tasks that require more mental capacity. While inefficient inhibition can result naturally in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, this effect is especially pronounced in methamphetamine-dependent individuals. Clinically, these individuals can be highly distractible and exhibit difficulty focusing, which illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition is being impaired and that inefficient inhibition is resulting. Because of the nature of the psychoactive drug, the brain is unable or reduced in its capacity to shut out irrelevant stimuli to the task at hand, and so tries to process and respond to any and all stimuli. This is most likely due to the effects of methamphetamine on inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA, discussed in an earlier section.\n\nIf an individual experiences impaired or damaged cognitive inhibition abilities, the psychological results can be extremely debilitating. Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can experience the effects of reduced cognitive inhibition. \"Failures of inhibition were identified in treatment of adults with OCD. In Go/No-Go tasks, subjects have to make a simple motor response (such as pressing a button) as quickly as possible when target stimuli are presented, and withhold the motor response when non-target stimuli are presented. Bannon et al. (2002) found that OCD patients made significantly more commission errors than matched panic disorder control subjects in a computerized task necessitating the inhibition of responses on a proportion of trials— OCD patients tended to make inappropriate motor responses to non-target stimuli\". Evidently, the cognitive inhibition that OCD patients experience can have such effects as impairing response time to significant stimuli and decreasing the ability to shut out irrelevant stimuli. This may be why OCD responses to certain stimuli can be difficult to control. Suicidal behavior may also be related to cognitive inhibition impairment. In one meta-analysis involving 164 studies, it was discovered that executive dysfunction and higher cognitive inhibition deficit is positively correlated and more frequently found among patients with suicidal behaviors. In attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), studies of cognitive control have not emphasized the ability to actively suppress pre-potent mental representations. This indicates that people diagnosed with ADHD experience an impaired cognitive inhibition ability and find it difficult to suppress irrelevant stimuli. The result is decreased mental representation control and perhaps a degree of working memory deficit. Finally, there are age-related effects on an individual's ability to execute cognitive inhibition, which mostly include language impairment. \"In language production, older adults' increased word-finding deficits have been explained under \"inhibitory deficit theory\" as a consequence of their reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant words (competitors) that impair retrieval of the target\". When speaking, many older adults experience difficulty \"finding\" the words they want to use, which is evidence of cognitive inhibition skills not functioning properly. Because they are not omitting synonyms or replacements entirely from their working memory (which can be considered irrelevant stimuli), they exhibit similar types of mental representation degradation that patients with depression, ADHD, or OCD indicate.\n"}

{"id": "7964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7964", "title": "Definition", "text": "Definition\n\nA definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.\n\nIn mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, instead of describing a pre-existing term. Definitions and axioms are the basis on which all of modern mathematics is constructed.\n\nIn modern usage, a \"definition\" is something, typically expressed in words, that attaches a meaning to a word or group of words. The word or group of words that is to be defined is called the \"definiendum\", and the word, group of words, or action that defines it is called the \"definiens\". In the definition \"An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa\", the word \"elephant\" is the \"definiendum\", and everything after the word \"is\" is the \"definiens\".\n\nThe \"definiens\" is not \"the meaning\" of the word defined, but is instead something that \"conveys the same meaning\" as that word.\n\nThere are many sub-types of definitions, often specific to a given field of knowledge or study. These include, among many others, lexical definitions, or the common dictionary definitions of words already in a language; demonstrative definitions, which define something by pointing to an example of it (\"\"This,\" [said while pointing to a large grey animal], \"is an Asian elephant.\"\"); and precising definitions, which reduce the vagueness of a word, typically in some special sense (\"'Large', among female Asian elephants, is any individual weighing over 5,500 pounds.\").\n\nAn \"intensional definition\", also called a \"connotative\" definition, specifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing being a member of a specific set. Any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something, such as that by genus and differentia, is an intensional definition.\n\nAn \"extensional definition\", also called a \"denotative\" definition, of a concept or term specifies its \"extension\". It is a list naming every object that is a member of a specific set.\n\nThus, the \"seven deadly sins\" can be defined \"intensionally\" as those singled out by Pope Gregory I as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation. An \"extensional\" definition would be the list of wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. In contrast, while an intensional definition of \"Prime Minister\" might be \"the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system\", an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who future prime ministers will be.\n\nA genus–differentia definition is a type of intensional definition that takes a large category (the genus) and narrows it down to a smaller category by a distinguishing characteristic (i.e. the differentia).\n\nMore formally, a genus-differentia definition consists of:\n\nFor example, consider the following genus-differentia definitions:\n\nThose definitions can be expressed as a genus (\"a plane figure\") and two differentiae (\"that has three straight bounding sides\" and \"that has four straight bounding sides\", respectively).\n\nIt is possible to have two different genus-differentia definitions that describe the same term, especially when the term describes the overlap of two large categories. For instance, both of these genus-differentia definitions of \"square\" are equally acceptable:\n\nThus, a \"square\" is a member of both the genus \"rectangle\" and the genus \"rhombus\".\n\nOne important form of the extensional definition is \"ostensive definition\". This gives the meaning of a term by pointing, in the case of an individual, to the thing itself, or in the case of a class, to examples of the right kind. So one can explain who \"Alice\" (an individual) is by pointing her out to another; or what a \"rabbit\" (a class) is by pointing at several and expecting another to understand. The process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nAn \"enumerative definition\" of a concept or term is an \"extensional definition\" that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the objects that fall under the concept or term in question. Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets.\n\n\"Divisio\" and \"partitio\" are classical terms for definitions. A \"partitio\" is simply an intensional definition. A \"divisio\" is not an extensional definition, but an exhaustive list of subsets of a set, in the sense that every member of the \"divided\" set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of \"divisio\" lists all sets whose only member is a member of the \"divided\" set. The difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list \"members\", and not subsets.\n\nIn classical thought, a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing. Aristotle had it that an object's essential attributes form its \"essential nature\", and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes.\n\nThe idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between \"nominal\" and \"real\" essence, originating with Aristotle. In a passage from the Posterior Analytics, he says that the meaning of a made-up name can be known (he gives the example \"goat stag\"), without knowing what he calls the \"essential nature\" of the thing that the name would denote, if there were such a thing. This led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the \"quid nominis\" or \"whatness of the name\", and the underlying nature common to all the things it names, which they called the \"quid rei\" or \"whatness of the thing\". (Early modern philosophers like Locke used the corresponding English terms \"nominal essence\" and \"real essence\"). The name \"hobbit\", for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a \"quid nominis\". But one could not know the real nature of hobbits, and so the real nature or \"quid rei\" of hobbits cannot be known. By contrast, the name \"man\" denotes real things (men) that have a certain \"quid rei\". The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that thing must have in order that the name apply to it.\n\nThis leads to a corresponding distinction between \"nominal\" and \"real\" definitions. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means, i.e. which says what the \"nominal essence\" is, and is definition in the classical sense as given above. A real definition, by contrast, is one expressing the real nature or \"quid rei\" of the thing.\n\nThis preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy. Analytic philosophy in particular is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing. Russell described essence as \"a hopelessly muddle-headed notion\".\n\nMore recently Kripke's formalisation of possible world semantics in modal logic led to a new approach to essentialism. Insofar as the essential properties of a thing are \"necessary\" to it, they are those things it possesses in all possible worlds. Kripke refers to names used in this way as rigid designators.\n\nA definition may also be classified as an operational definition or theoretical definition.\n\nA homonym is, in the strict sense, one of a group of words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different meanings. Thus homonyms are simultaneously homographs (words that share the same spelling, regardless of their pronunciation) \"and\" homophones (words that share the same pronunciation, regardless of their spelling). The state of being a homonym is called homonymy. Examples of homonyms are the pair \"stalk\" (part of a plant) and \"stalk\" (follow/harass a person) and the pair \"left\" (past tense of leave) and \"left\" (opposite of right). A distinction is sometimes made between \"true\" homonyms, which are unrelated in origin, such as \"skate\" (glide on ice) and \"skate\" (the fish), and polysemous homonyms, or polysemes, which have a shared origin, such as \"mouth\" (of a river) and \"mouth\" (of an animal).\n\nPolysemy is the capacity for a sign (such as a word, phrase, or symbol) to have multiple meanings (that is, multiple semes or sememes and thus multiple senses), usually related by contiguity of meaning within a semantic field. It is thus usually regarded as distinct from homonymy, in which the multiple meanings of a word may be unconnected or unrelated.\n\nIn mathematics, definitions are generally not used to describe existing terms, but to give meaning to a new term. The meaning of a mathematical statement changes if definitions change. The precise meaning of a term given by a mathematical definition is often different than the English definition of the word used, which can lead to confusion for students who do not pay close attention to the definitions given.\n\nAuthors have used different terms to classify definitions used in formal languages like mathematics. Norman Swartz classifies a definition as \"stipulative\" if it is intended to guide a specific discussion. A stipulative definition might be considered a temporary, working definition, and can only be disproved by showing a logical contradiction. In contrast, a \"descriptive\" definition can be shown to be \"right\" or \"wrong\" with reference to general usage.\n\nSwartz defines a \"precising definition\" as one that extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) for a specific purpose by including additional criteria. A precising definition narrows the set of things that meet the definition.\n\nC.L. Stevenson has identified \"persuasive definition\" as a form of stipulative definition which purports to state the \"true\" or \"commonly accepted\" meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an altered use (perhaps as an argument for some specific belief). Stevenson has also noted that some definitions are \"legal\" or \"coercive\" – their object is to create or alter rights, duties, or crimes.\n\nA recursive definition, sometimes also called an \"inductive\" definition, is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way. Normally this consists of three steps:\n\nFor instance, we could define a natural number as follows (after Peano): \n\nSo \"0\" will have exactly one successor, which for convenience can be called \"1\". In turn, \"1\" will have exactly one successor, which could be called \"2\", and so on. Notice that the second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves self-reference. Although this sort of definition involves a form of circularity, it is not vicious, and the definition has been quite successful.\n\nIn the same way, we can define ancestor as follows:\nOr simply: an ancestor is a parent or a parent of an ancestor.\n\nIn medical dictionaries, definitions should to the greatest extent possible be:\n\nCertain rules have traditionally been given for definitions (in particular, genus-differentia definitions).\n\nGiven that a natural language such as English contains, at any given time, a finite number of words, any comprehensive list of definitions must either be circular or rely upon primitive notions. If every term of every \"definiens\" must itself be defined, \"where at last should we stop?\" A dictionary, for instance, insofar as it is a comprehensive list of lexical definitions, must resort to circularity.\n\nMany philosophers have chosen instead to leave some terms undefined. The scholastic philosophers claimed that the highest genera (the so-called ten \"generalissima\") cannot be defined, since a higher genus cannot be assigned under which they may fall. Thus being, unity and similar concepts cannot be defined. Locke supposes in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition. More recently Bertrand Russell sought to develop a formal language based on logical atoms. Other philosophers, notably Wittgenstein, rejected the need for any undefined simples. Wittgenstein pointed out in his \"Philosophical Investigations\" that what counts as a \"simple\" in one circumstance might not do so in another. He rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained: \"As though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one\", claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed to avoid misunderstanding.\n\nLocke and Mill also argued that individuals cannot be defined. Names are learned by connecting an idea with a sound, so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used. This is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has \"fallen under our notice\". Russell offered his theory of descriptions in part as a way of defining a proper name, the definition being given by a definite description that \"picks out\" exactly one individual. Saul Kripke pointed to difficulties with this approach, especially in relation to modality, in his book \"Naming and Necessity\".\n\nThere is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the \"definiens\" can be stated. Wittgenstein argued that for some terms this is not the case. The examples he used include \"game\", \"number\" and \"family\". In such cases, he argued, there is no fixed boundary that can be used to provide a definition. Rather, the items are grouped together because of a family resemblance. For terms such as these it is not possible and indeed not necessary to state a definition; rather, one simply comes to understand the \"use\" of the term.\n\n\n\n"}

The authors refer to it as a \"semi-analytical\" theory because they developed their expressions not purely symbolically, but introduced numerical values for orbital constants from the outset; but they also constructed partial derivatives of all terms with respect to these constants, so they could make corrections afterwards to reach the final solution.\n\nELP has been fitted not directly to observations, but to the numerical integrations known as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris (which includes the Lunar Ephemerides), that in their turn have been fitted to actual astronomical observations.

Fluxnet is a global 'network of regional networks' that serves to provide an infrastructure to compile, archive and distribute data for the scientific community. It works to ensure that different flux networks are calibrated to facilitate comparison between sites, and it provides a forum for the distribution of knowledge and data between scientists.\n\nAs of April 2014, there are over 683 tower sites in continuous long-term operation. Researchers also collect data on site vegetation, soil, trace gas fluxes, hydrology, and meteorological characteristics at the tower sites.\n\nAccording to the Fluxnet website, the goals of the project are as follows:\n\n\nScientists have been measuring water vapor and carbon dioxide exchange between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere since the late 1950s. The relatively undeveloped computing capabilities and solid state measurement capabilities made it almost impossible to be able to get accurate measurements. Early scientists such as John Monteith used the \"flux gradient\" method to make semi-accurate assessments of the fluxes in a variety of natural settings. The work of scientists such as Monteith realized that the Flux Gradient method was not nearly as accurate as it needed to be when used to measure trace gas exchange in tall forests. Eventually, they realized that the downfall of their models was caused by \"large scale transport in the roughness sublayer\". The reason for these data inaccuracies was hypothesized to arise from Monin-Obukhov scaling theory.\n\nAs digital technology advanced throughout the 1970s and 80s, so did advances in the sensors and digital hardware necessary to provide the means to make advanced measurements of fluxes with what became known as the eddy covariance technique. With this method as well as further advances in digital data storage, it became possible for curious scientists to make these eddy flux measurements for long periods of time and consequently get a sense of annual carbon dioxide and water vapor changes in the biosphere. As these techniques became more widespread in the scientific community, more research groups took the initiative to establish further measurement sites. Eventually, enough sites were established to allow research of fluxes over wide areas of land with the help of multiple investigators. An example of such a study is the \"Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study\".\n\nWith the success of such projects, participating scientists began to explore the idea of creating a global network of sensor sites that could be used to integrate their data and provide access for the members of the academic community and general public. At a meeting in La Thuile, Italy during 1995, contributing scientists began to discuss the feasibility of such a network. With the successful conclusion of this meeting, there was an increase in the rate of sensor site installation and the growth of regional networks. Eventually, the Euroflux network took hold in 1996 and was soon followed by the AmeriFlux network in 1997. When NASA saw the enthusiasm from the scientific community for these two networks as well as the possibility to integrate trace gas data from the ground with data from the Earth Observatory Satellite, it finally funded the Fluxnet project as a whole in 1998.\n\nIn 2002, Fluxnet was added to the NOAA Observing System Architecture (NOSA).\n\nFuture FluxNet sites are planned according to a desirable accuracy in the acquired data. With the current model used to determine flux between the surface and the atmosphere, it is desirable to situate the tower in an area with uniform vegetative cover and minimal disturbances in the terrain. Deviations in terrain or plant cover would prevent a constant gas flux along the height of the tower.\n\nAnother very important part of the sensor array is the tower on which it rests. The sensor tower must fit within a certain design criteria dependent on:\n\nTypically, investigators who are monitoring fluxes in agricultural cropland place their sensors close to the ground. Meanwhile, scientists who hope to measure the fluxes in tall forests must place their sensors on relatively high scaffolding. The difference in sizes is attributed to the boundary layers that form close to the ground because of the vegetation.\nTo minimize turbulence from the tower itself, instrumentation is often placed at the top of the tower and offset several feet with the help of booms.\n\nMost FluxNet sites have at minimum sensors to accurately measure the wind speed as well as the concentration of the trace gases in question. To obtain the necessary data, it is common for the towers to employ a sonic anemometer, an infrared gas analyzer and some sensor to measure humidity. These tools are necessary because they provide the necessary variables to be put into the eddy covariance model of gas flux in the biosphere.\n\nThe principle behind the eddy covariance technique is that parcels of air have eddy like characteristics in the atmosphere. In other words, when trace gases are respired by vegetation, their velocity can be represented by a 3D vector. The purpose of using such a precise anemometer is to measure value of the wind velocity component in three dimensions. Using the infrared gas analyzer and the humidity sensor, the concentration of water vapor and trace gases in the air sample is measured and sent to a computer which quickly figures out the mass flux of the gas in question. This mass flux makes the FluxNet project a valuable tool to scientists trying to monitor long term changes in trace gas flux within the atmosphere.\n\nMany different forms of anemometer exist on the current market. Unfortunately, the majority of the anemometers can only measure wind velocity in one plane and require a certain start-up wind speed. Sonic anemometers are solid state devices that measure the wind speed by passing ultrasonic sound waves through the moving air. As wind speed changes, so does the air density and when the density changes, so does the speed of sound. By measuring the change in time it takes for the ultrasonic sound wave to make its way from the emitter to the sensor, the sonic anemometer can measure the total air speed as well as its direction.\n\nThis sensor works because Infrared light is absorbed by a variety of gases at different wavelengths within the spectrum including methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen. To measure the concentration, a beam of light is emitted into the air sample. By measuring the difference between the input and output of the infrared beam, the sensor can determine the amount of the trace gases in the sample. It is common for an infrared gas analyzer to have two configurations. The \"open design\" operates by shooting a beam of infrared light through the air outside of the sensor body. Meanwhile, the closed design works by sucking air into the sensor body measuring the concentration of trace gases inside of a sealed chamber. Usually, open sensors are placed within half a meter of the anemometer while closed sensors use a collection tube mounted inside the anemometer to get their air sample.\nThe hygrogemeter is an essential tool used to figure out the concentration of water vapor in the air. Unfortunately, water vapor absorbs several frequencies of light in the infrared range and most of these bands overlap that of the trace gases. Without accounting for water vapor, the Infrared gas analyzer would give false data. To solve this problem, an accurate water vapor measurement is needed. Solid state hygrometers are designed to have two metal plates separated by a small air gap. Differing levels of humidity in the air change the capacitance of the air gap. This can be measured by applying a high frequency AC voltage to the plates and measuring the capacitance through an RC circuit.\n\nThe state of Israel is afforesting the Negev desert, which accounts for 60% of the country's land mass but remains sparsely populated. The Yatir Forest is located on the southern slopes of Mount Hebron, on the edge of the Negev Desert. Covering an area of 30,000 dunams (30 square kilometers), it is the largest planted forest in Israel. It is named after the ancient Levite city within its territory, Yatir, as written in the Torah The Yatir forest is a tower site of NASAs research project FluxNet. \nThere is a multitude of modern Israeli scientific research conducted in the Yatir Forest to meet the challenge of climate change, which may result in rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances. Studies of the Weizmann Institute of Science, in collaboration with the Desert Research Institute at Sde Boker, have shown that the trees function as a trap for carbon in the air. Shade provided by trees planted in the desert also reduces evaporation of the sparse rainfall. Arava Institute for Environmental Studies conducts research at Yatir forest that focuses on crops such as dates and grapes grown in the vicinity of Yatir forest. The research is part of a project aimed at introducing new crops into arid and saline zones.\n\n\n\n"}

In astronomy, the most common use of such an astronomical interferometer is to determine the apparent angular diameter of a radio source or star. If the distance to the object can then be determined by parallax or some other method, the physical diameter of the star can then be inferred. An example of an optical intensity interferometer is the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. In quantum optics, some devices which take advantage of correlation and anti-correlation effects in beams of photons might be said to be intensity interferometers, although the term is usually reserved for observatories.\n\nAn intensity interferometer is built from two light detectors, typically either radio antenna or optical telescopes with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), separated by some distance, called the baseline. Both detectors are pointed at the same astronomical source, and intensity measurements are then transmitted to a central correlator facility. A major advantage of intensity interferometers is that only the measured intensity observed by each detector must be sent to the central correlator facility, rather than the amplitude and phase of the signal. The intensity interferometer measures interferometric visibilities like all other astronomical interferometers. These measurements can be used to calculate the diameter and limb darkening coefficients of stars, but with intensity interferometers aperture synthesis images cannot be produced as the visibility phase information is not preserved by an intensity interferometer.\n"}

He hailed from a long line of English instrument makers and transformed the family business from one dealing in nautical instruments to one specialising in scientific instruments. Browning was particularly well known for his advances in the fields of spectroscopy, astronomy, and optometry.\n\nJohn Browning was born around 1831 in Kent, England, the city recorded variously as Bexley or Welling. His father, William Spencer Browning, was a maker of nautical instruments. It has been speculated that his shop inspired that of the character Solomon Gills, the ship's instrument maker, in the 1848 novel \"Dombey and Son\" by Charles Dickens. John Browning hailed from a long line of English instrument makers. His great-grandfather was instrument maker John Browning, brother of Samuel Browning, of the firms Spencer & Browning and Spencer, Browning & Rust, manufacturers of navigational instruments. The latter firm was in operation in London from 1784 to 1840, and was succeeded by the firm of Spencer, Browning & Co. Several sources indicate that John Browning's great-grandson John Browning resided in Sevenoaks, Kent.\n\nJohn Browning initially intended to follow the medical profession, and entered Guy's Hospital, a teaching hospital and the location of a school of medicine. Despite having passed the required examinations, however, he abandoned his plans due to ill health. Instead, he apprenticed with his father, William Spencer Browning. At the same time, in the late 1840s, he was also a student at the Royal College of Chemistry. When John Browning came of age, he joined his father in the family business. However, he decided to change the nature of the business, due to increasing competition in the making of nautical instruments. Instead, he elected to pursue the design and manufacture of scientific instruments. In 1856, he assumed sole ownership of the enterprise. The factory was at 111 Minories, London for decades; it moved to 63 Strand, London in 1872. There was an additional London workshop at 6 Vine Street. John Browning's choice of profession was somewhat unusual for a graduate of the Royal College of Chemistry. Those who were inclined to become entrepreneurs tended to enter more chemically-oriented businesses, or have been associated with them before matriculating.\n\nBetween 1856 and 1872, Browning acquired provisional patents for designs of numerous scientific instruments. He was also the recipient of an award at the 1862 International Exhibition held in London. He was recognised for his temperature-compensated aneroid barometer. Browning's scientific instruments were used in physics, chemistry, and biology. The products he designed and manufactured included spectroscopes, telescopes, microscopes, barometers, photometers, cameras, ophthalmoscopes, and electrical equipment such as electric lamps. \nJohn Browning installed the first electric light in London, the occasion being a banquet to honour the Shah of Persia during his visit to Queen Victoria. The location was the Guildhall, which has been used as a town hall in the City of London for hundreds of years and continues to be the home of the City of London Corporation. One light, run with Bunsen cells, was positioned outside each window, due to the fumes. The operating cost of each light was £3 per hour. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar was the Shah of Persia during the second half of the nineteenth century. During his reign, he toured Europe three times, in 1873, 1878, and 1889. It was during the 1873 trip that the mayor and the Corporation of the City of London gave a banquet in the Shah's honour. Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone arranged for the queen to entertain the Shah during the 1873 visit. Queen Victoria did not attend the banquet of 20 June 1873, which was primarily a business occasion. The elaborate preparations for the banquet included not only the costly lighting scheme, but also a gilded, illustrated menu \"(pictured)\".\n\nJohn Browning was perhaps best known as the leading manufacturer of spectroscopes. His were considered to be of the highest quality in England. In 1865, he supplied photographer William Henry Fox Talbot (1800–1877) with a custom-made spectroscope. His crafting of fine spectroscopes strengthened his connection to the field of chemistry. In April 1872, Browning exhibited one of his spectroscopes at the Royal Society, more formally known as the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge. In his 1878 book \"How to Work With the Spectroscope: A Manual of Practical Manipulation With Spectroscopes of All Kinds\", John Browning provided an overview of the field of spectroscopy, and the book became well known among spectroscopists. It has been published in a number of editions, most recently on 3 June 2010 by Cambridge University Press. \nWhile the first edition of 1878 contained only black and white images, the second edition of \"How to Work With the Spectroscope\" included one notable colour illustration \"(pictured)\". It was of the rainband spectrum by lawyer and scientist John Rand Capron. It first appeared as a black and while image in \"Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine\". However, the second, 1882 edition of John Browning's handbook reproduced the plate in colour. It demonstrated Joseph von Fraunhofer's solar lines A-F, with the rainband adjacent to the D lines. In the late 19th century, scientists were interested in the rainband for its potential in the detection of atmospheric water vapour and, therefore, the prediction of rain. Evaluation of the rainband represented the first attempt to use spectroscopy in the field of meteorology. Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth supported the contention that water vapour bands could be used to predict rainfall in the 22 July 1875 issue of \"Nature\". While the topic of the rainband and its use in meteorology was controversial, John Browning (and his competitors) manufactured pocket spectroscopes designed to show the rainband and marketed them as meteorological tools.\n\nAn astronomer, Browning was also Optical and Physical Instrument Maker to Her Majesty's Government. As such, he supplied telescopes to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Browning also attached spectroscopes to telescopic equipment, garnering the attention of astronomical physicists J. Norman Lockyer and William Huggins. He was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1865. Browning was a pioneer in the manufacture of reflecting telescopes and bringing them to the attention of astronomers. As the popularity of astronomy grew during the 19th century, his business in telescopes flourished. An advocate of the Newtonian reflector, he was the author of \"A Plea for Reflectors, Being a Description of the New Astronomical Telescopes With Silvered-glass Specula\", first published in 1867. By 1876, the book was in its sixth printing. Browning wrote many articles for the \"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\", including a series on Jupiter's equatorial belt about 1870. Browning was a perfectionist, a trait that in at least one instance had unfortunate consequences. When he delayed in providing Lockyer with a spectroscope until it performed to his high standards, Lockyer missed the opportunity of being the first astronomer to observe a prominence on the uneclipsed sun. While the delay was only partially responsible for Lockyer's missed opportunity, there is evidence that Browning long regretted his reluctance to part with the spectroscope in question. Browning made a number of instruments for Lockyer, among them an 8-inch reflecting telescope that was delivered to Lockyer in 1871 and now greets visitors near the main door of the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth, Devon. Toward the late 1860s, in his quest to produce telescopes for a growing market, Browning collaborated with George Henry With (1827–1904), former schoolmaster at the Blue Coat School in Hereford. With was talented at producing high quality, large reflecting mirrors.\n\nBy the early 1870s, practical optics had become John Browning's primary interest, and he listed his occupation as optician on the census records from 1871 to 1901. He was well known among London's ophthalmic surgeons for his various ophthalmic instruments. Browning had a large part in reforming the art of crafting spectacles. Employees of his company tested people's eyesight and made eyeglasses for them. John Browning was the author of the book, \"How to Use Our Eyes and How to Preserve them by the Aid of Spectacles\". Published in 1883, the book included thirty-seven illustrations, including a diagram demonstrating the anatomy of the eye \"(pictured)\". In 1895, he was one of the founders of the British Optical Association, the first professional and examining organisation for optometry. He was not only its first president, but also registered as its first member, so that many consider him to be the first professional optometrist.\n\nBrowning was also a member of The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain. In 1871, he constructed the first wind tunnel, located in Greenwich at Penn's Marine Engineering Works. It had been designed by another member of the Aeronautical Society, British engineer Francis Herbert Wenham. He was also a member of other scientific organisations, such as the Microscopical Society of London, the Meteorological Society, and the Royal Institution.\n\nBased on census and marriage records, John Browning married at least three times. In 1871, Browning lived in Richmond, Surrey with three unmarried sisters. Browning is identified as married, but no wife or child is recorded. His occupation is identified as \"optician, master (employing 61 workpeople).\" On 18 February 1874, a widowed Browning married widow Charlotte Hotten, née Stringer, at St Mary's Church in Lewisham, Kent. His wife Charlotte, a resident of Lewisham, was the daughter of William Stringer. Browning's father was recorded as William Browning (deceased). Both his occupation and that of his father were listed as optician. In 1881, John Browning was in residence at Croydon in Surrey. He lived with his wife Charlotte, sister Emma, and daughter Maria Browning, as well as stepdaughters Florence and Gertrude Hotten. John Browning's profession was listed as \"master optician employing 20 men.\" He was widowed in 1888, his wife Charlotte dying on 13 March 1888 in Croydon.\n\nWidower John Browning remarried on 24 July 1890 at the Church of Holy Trinity, Clapham on Clapham Common in Clapham, London, at the time recorded as Surrey. He married Annie Woolley, a spinster whose place of birth and residence at the time of their marriage was Chapel Hill in Monmouthshire, Wales. She was the daughter of Josiah Woolley, a licensed victualler, and his wife Harriet Woolley. Her age was listed as 25 years old, thirty years younger than that recorded for her husband. Their marriage record and John Browning's death record are most probably responsible for the difference in dates of birth cited for John Browning in a variety of publications. The marriage record suggests that he was born around 1835, with a given age of 55 at marriage, while his death record suggests that his birth occurred about 1831. Browning's father was listed as William Browning (deceased), with his profession that of optician. John Browning's occupation was also listed as optician. In 1891, the year following their marriage, John and Annie Browning resided in Clapham, with his profession again recorded as optician. The Church of Holy Trinity, Clapham was added to the National Heritage List for England on 14 July 1955 as a Grade II* listed building.\n\nThe company of W. Watson & Son, opticians and camera makers, was founded in London in 1837. In 1900, that company took over John Browning & Co. From 1908, the latter company was known as Watson & Sons Ltd. By 1901, John Browning and his wife had moved to Bournemouth in Hampshire, and a one-year-old daughter Minnie was now part of the family. John Browning's occupation was listed as \"refractionist and optician (retired)\". John Browning retired from his profession by 1905, and moved to Chislehurst on the outskirts of London, by some accounts. However, his obituary by the Royal Astronomical Society indicates that he retired to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He died in the registration district of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1925, with his death registered in the fourth quarter of the year. He was survived by his wife and his daughter, who was chief librarian at Bradford Library. Browning's widow Annie died on 18 February 1932 in Cheltenham.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45255953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45255953", "title": "Morphological symptoms of plant diseases", "text": "Morphological symptoms of plant diseases\n\nThousands of plant diseases have been recorded throughout the world, many of these causing heavy crop losses. Early detection and accurate diagnosis is essential for the effective management of plant disease. Thus the first step in studying any disease is its timely detection of the diseased plant. Quick initial detection is largely based on the signs and symptoms of disease.\n\nSigns are the visible physical presence of either the pathogen itself or the structures formed by the pathogen. Common examples of easily detected signs are those such as the fungal mycelia and spore masses of downy mildews observed on infected leaves and the bacterial ooze of \"Xanthomonas\" leaf streak disease on rice.\n\nSymptoms are the visible changes that occur in the host plant in response to infection by pathogens. For any disease in a given plant, there is the characteristic expression of symptoms, usually occurring in a sequential series during the course of the disease. This series of symptoms depicting the disease picture is referred to as the disease syndrome.\n\nMorphological symptoms may be exhibited by the entire plant or by any organ of the plant. These have been categorized into different groups for easy of study. Primarily, morphological symptoms of plant diseases can be categorized into 6 different types.\n\nNecroses are caused due to necrosis or death of plant cells. The affected plant tissue usually turns brown to black in color. Necrotic symptoms could appear in any part of the plant such as in storage organs, in green tissues, or in woody tissues.\n\nDeath of cells in storage organs terminates in decomposition or decay referred to as a rot. Two types of rots are identified as Dry rot and Wet rot on storage tissues.\n\nSoft rots are those where the pathogen breaks down the host cell walls, resulting in the exudation of juices from the infected tissue. The organ becomes mushy or pulpy and a foul smell often develops due to colonization by secondary invaders. Many fungi and bacteria cause soft rots on several fruits and vegetables. Species of the fungus, \"Rhizopus\" and bacterium \"Erwinia\" are two such commonly found pathogens causing soft rots.\n\nIn a dry rot, the storage organ becomes hard and dry, and in some diseases, there is rapid loss of water and the infected organs become shriveled, wrinkled, and leathery. Dry rots showing such symptoms are referred to as mummifications.\n\nNecroses on green tissue are termed differently based on the nature of symptoms and the type of green tissue. The term, damping off refers to the sudden wilting and topping over of seedlings as a result of extensive necrosis of tender tissue of the roots and stem near the soil line, due to the attack of soil-borne pathogens such as fungus, \"Pythium\". This fungus is known to cause damping off in an assortment of seedlings such as that of brinjal, chilli, mung beans, tobacco, tomato, and \"Cucurbita\".\n\nA spot refers to a well-defined area of gray or brown necrotic tissue. Spots are very common on leaves and fruits and are probably the most familiar necrotic symptom. Sometimes the necrotic tissue within a leaf spot may crack and fall off from the surrounding green tissue leaving an empty space. Such a symptom is known as a shot hole.\n\nMinute or very small spots are sometimes referred to as flecks or specks.\n\nWhen dark mycelia of a fungal pathogen appear on the surface of necrotic spot, blotting the leaves, shoots, an stems as large and irregular spots, the symptom is referred to as a blotch.\n\nBoth streaks and stripes occur in grasses and are elongated areas having dead cells. Streaks occur along the stem and veins, while stripes are in the laminar tissues between veins.\n\nNet necrosis is a symptom resulting from an irregular pattern of anastomoses between streaks or stripes.\n\nBlights are characterized by the rapid death of entire leaves including the veins or parts of the leaves. Blights also could occur on flowers and stems.\n\nScorches resemble blights, but there necrosis occurs in irregular patterns between veins and along leaf margins.\n\nFiring is sudden drying, collapse and death of entire leaves. Firing occurs in response to the activity of root rot and vascular wilt pathogens.\n\nScald is the term used to describe the blanching of epidermal and adjacent tissues of fruits and occasionally of leaves.\n\nThe sudden death of unopened buds or inflorescence is referred to as blast.\n\nExtensive necrosis of fruits that resemble in premature dropping is called shelling.\n\nNecrosis of woody tissue often brings about various types of die-back symptoms. Dieback is the extensive necrosis of a shoot from its tip downwards.\n\nRestricted necrosis of the bark and cortical tissue of stems and roots is termed as a canker. In cankers, necrotic tissue in the sunken lesions is sharply limited, usually by a callus from adjacent healthy tissue.\n\nWhen woody tissues are diseased, they may exude different kinds of substances. When the exudate is gummy, the symptom is called gummosis, while it is resinosis when it is resinous. If the exudate is neither gummy nor resinous, it is described as bleeding.\n\nMany disease symptoms are associated with growth changes in diseased plants. These could be caused by either reduced growth due to hypoplasia and atrophy or excessive growth due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy.\n\nHypoplasia is the failure of plants or plant organs to develop fully due to a decreased production of the number of cells. Hypoplasia results in plants or plant parts of sub-normal size.\n\nAtrophy is the reduction in the size of plant cells produced. This also results in stunted plants or plant parts.\n\nDwarfing is the failure of a plant or a plant part to attain its full size.\n\nRosetting is a condition where the internode of a plant do not elongate, and hence, the leaves appear close together in a cluster.\n\nHyperplasia is the enlargement of a plant tissue due to excessive increase in the number of plant cells produced. Hyperplasia results in overdevelopment in size of plants or plant organs.\n\nHypertrophy is excessive growth due to the enlargement of individual cells. This condition also results in the overdevelopment in size of plants or plant organs.\n\nHyperplasia and hypertrophy could result in the enlargement of leaves and fruits, and the enlargement of stems and roots.\n\nSeveral symptoms expressing enlargement of leaves and fruits are commonly observed among diseased plants.\n\nCurling which is the bending of the shoot or the rolling of the leaf, is a result of over-growth on one side of an organ. Often viral diseases cause such leaf distortions due to irregular growth of the lamina. Extreme reduction of the leaf lamina brings about the symptom known as the Shoe-string effect.\n\nThe puckering or crinkling of leaves due to different growth rates in adjacent tissue is known as savoying.\n\nOvergrowth of epidermal and underlying tissues of leaves, stems, fruits and tubers may result scab formation. Scab consists of raised, rough, and discrete lesions. These are often sunken and cracked, giving a typical scabby appearance.\n\nLocalized swellings or enlargement of epidermal cells due to excessive accumulation of water is termed intermuscence and the diagnostic symptom is the appearance of a blister.\n\nSymptoms causing enlargement of stems and roots are termed differently based on their nature. Excessive accumulation of food material in stems, above a constricted area produces a swelling termed sarcody.\n\nLocalized swellings that involve entire organs are termed tumefaction.\nCommonly exhibited tumefactions are galls, clubs, and knots.\n\nExcessive development of adventitious organs results in fasciculation, that is the clustering of organs around a focal point. Such examples include witch's broom and hairy root. Witch's broom is a broom-like mass proliferation due to the dense clustering of branches of woody plants while hairy root results due to excessive development of roots.\n\nFasciation is the broadening or flattening of cylindrical organs such as stems. The continued development of any organ after it has reached a stage beyond which it normally does not grow is known as proliferation.\n\nThe outgrowth of tissue in response to wounding is known as a callus. Callus formation is found to form around most cankers.\n\nMetaplastic symptoms are those which form when tissues change from one form to another. Such symptoms include phyllody, the development of floral organs into leaf-like structures, juvenillody, the development of juvenile seedlings on mature plants and russeting, a superficial browning of surfaces of fruits and tubers due to suberization.\n\nProleptic symptoms result from the development of tissues earlier than usual. Examples include prolepsis, the premature development of a shoot from a bud, proleptic abscission, the premature formation of abscission layers and restoration, the unexpected development of organs that are normally rudimentary.\n\nChanges in the color of plant tissue are a common symptom of plant disease. Often these color changes are brought about by the yellowing of normal green tissue due to the destruction of chlorophyll or a failure to form chlorophyll. Such repression of leaf color may be complete or partial.\n\nWhen color repression is complete, it is known as albication. However, the more common, partial repression is referred to as chlorosis.\n\nPatches of green tissue alternating with chlorotic areas are described as a mosaic. Mosaic is a symptom caused by many viruses. Based on the intensity and the pattern of discoloration, mosaics are termed differently. Irregular patches of distinct light and dark areas are known as mottling. Streaking and ring spots are still other distinct types of discolorations. Ring spots are circular masses of chlorosis with a green center. Vein clearing and vein banding are yet other common color changes on leaves.\n\nChlorophyll may also develop in tissues normally devoid of it. Thus usually white or colored tissue becomes green in color. This is called as virescence.\n\nAnthocyanescence is due to the overdevelopment of anthocyanin and result in the development of a purplish coloration. Color changes can also take place in flowers. Such an example is the color break virus-affected tulips.\n\nWilting is due to loss of turgor in plant tissue resulting in the dropping of plant parts. They are common symptom in diseases where the pathogen or the toxic metabolites it produces affects the vascular tissue of the host plant. Interference in water transport brought about by the infection of these vascular pathogens leads to wilting. Unlike wilting due to low soil moisture, wilting due to the activity of these pathogens cannot be overcome by watering the plants. Infected plants eventually die.\n\n"}

Muller believes that gasoline is one of the best weapons for a terrorist due to its availability and high energy density. \"Physics for Future Presidents\" is interspersed with policy recommendations, such as that future presidents should not worry about terrorists building nuclear weapons and instead focus on stopping them from flying planes. It criticizes those who distort the facts, especially with regards to climate change. “Global warming is real,\" Muller writes. \"It is very likely caused by humans.”\n\n\"Physics for Future Presidents\" received mostly favorable reviews from critics. It received the 2009 Northern California Book Award for General Nonfiction. Heather Benjamin of Science News recommended it to people who are interested in political policies based on science.\n\nLisa Jardine-Wright disliked the book's first section on terrorism, which she thought focused too much on the personalities of terrorists as opposed to the actual physics. She also took issue with how the book \"lacked insight into how physics and science really work - the importance of observation and experimentation that provide evidence from which we are able to draw a series of conclusions.\" However, she writes, \"as I read beyond the emotional subject of terrorism in Muller's first section, I became much more engaged with his writing. The later parts of his book, covering issues of energy, nuclear power and global warming, were informative, easy to follow and, in my opinion, contained a lot more physics. Indeed, beginning the book with part two would have changed my first impressions significantly.\" Jardine believes \"Physics for Future Presidents\"'s biggest strength is how \"Muller reinforces the point that there are no immediate solutions to our 21st-century problems and that ultimately one must make a judgment call.\"\n"}

{"id": "8151064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8151064", "title": "Rational planning model", "text": "Rational planning model\n\nThe rational planning model is a model of the planning process involving a number of rational actions or steps. Taylor (1998) outlines five steps, as follows:\nThe rational planning model is used in planning and designing neighborhoods, cities, and regions. It has been central in the development of modern urban planning and transportation planning. The model has many limitations, particularly the lack of guidance on involving stakeholders and the community affected by planning, and other models of planning, such as collaborative planning, are now also widely used.\n\nThe very similar rational decision-making model, as it is called in organizational behavior, is a process for making logically sound decisions. This multi-step model and aims to be logical and follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution. Rational decision making is a multi-step process for making logically sound decisions that aims to follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution.\n\nRational decision-making or planning follows a series of steps detailed below:\n\nVerifying, defining & detailing the problem (problem definition, goal definition, information gathering). This step includes recognizing the problem, defining an initial solution, and starting primary analysis. Examples of this are creative devising, creative ideas, inspirations, breakthroughs, and brainstorms.\n\nThe very first step which is normally overlooked by the top level management is defining the exact problem. Though we think that the problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem.\n\nThis step encloses two to three final solutions to the problem and preliminary implementation to the site. In planning, examples of this are Planned Units of Development and downtown revitalizations.\n\nThis activity is best done in groups, as different people may contribute different ideas or alternative solutions to the problem. Without alternative solutions, there is a chance of arriving at a non-optimal or a rational decision. For exploring the alternatives it is necessary to gather information. Technology may help with gathering this information.\n\nEvaluative criteria are measurements to determine success and failure of alternatives. This step contains secondary and final analysis along with secondary solutions to the problem. Examples of this are site suitability and site sensitivity analysis. After going thoroughly through the process of defining the problem, exploring for all the possible alternatives for that problem and gathering information this step says evaluate the information and the possible options to anticipate the consequences of each and every possible alternative that is thought of. At this point optional criteria for measuring the success or failure of the decision taken needs to be considered.\nThe rational model of planning rest largely on objective assessment.\n\nThis step comprises a final solution and secondary implementation to the site. At this point the process has developed into different strategies of how to apply the solutions to the site.\n\nBased on the criteria of assessment and the analysis done in previous steps, choose the best solution generated. These four steps form the core of the Rational Decision Making Model.\n\nThis step includes final implementation to the site and preliminary monitoring of the outcome and results of the site. This step is the building/renovations part of the process.\n\nThis step contains the secondary and final monitoring of the outcomes and results of the site. This step takes place over a long period of time.\n\nModify future decisions and actions taken based on the above evaluation of outcomes.\n\nThe rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”. It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions in order for it to work, such as:\n\n\nIndeed, some of the assumptions identified above are also pin pointed out in a study written by the historian H.A. Drake, as he states:\n\n\"In its purest form, the Rational Actor approach presumes that such a figure [as Constantine] has complete freedom of action to achieve goals that he or she has articulated through a careful process of rational analysis involving full and objective study of all pertinent information and alternatives. At the same time, it presumes that this central actor is so fully in control of the apparatus of government that a decision once made is as good as implemented. There are no staffs on which to rely, no constituencies to placate, no generals or governors to cajole. By attributing all decision making to one central figure who is always fully in control and who acts only after carefully weighing all options, the Rational Actor method allows scholars to filter out extraneous details and focus attention on central issues\".\n\nFurthermore, as we have seen, in the context of policy rational models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. For this purpose, Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:\n\n\nIn similar lines, Wiktorowicz and Deber describe through their study on ‘Regulating biotechnology: a rational-political model of policy development’ the rational approach to policy development. The main steps involved in making a rational decision for these authors are the following:\n\n\nThe approach of Wiktorowicz and Deber is similar to Simon and they assert that the rational model tends to deal with “the facts” (data, probabilities) in steps 1 to 3, leaving the issue of assessing values to the final step. According to Wiktorowicz and Deber values are introduced in the final step of the rational model, where the utility of each policy option is assessed.\n\nMany authors have attempted to interpret the above-mentioned steps, amongst others, Patton and Sawicki who summarize the model as presented in the following figure (missing):\n\n\nThe model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, many criticisms of the model arise due to claim of the model being impractical and lying on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extra ordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings. This latter argument can be best illustrated by the words of Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, who wrote in his book `Understanding Public Policy´ the following passage:\n\n\"There is no better illustration of the dilemmas of rational policy making in America than in the field of health…the first obstacle to rationalism is defining the problem. Is our goal to have good health — that is, whether we live at all (infant mortality), how well we live (days lost to sickness), and how long we live (life spans and adult mortality)? Or is our goal to have good medical care — frequent visits to the doctor, wellequipped and accessible hospitals, and equal access to medical care by rich and poor alike?\"\n\nThe problems faced when using the rational model arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around. Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.\n\nHowever, as Thomas states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, rational policy analysis can be broken into 6 distinct stages of analysis. Step 2 highlights the need to understand which factors should be considered as part of the decision making process. At this part of the process, all the economic, social, and environmental factors that are important to the policy decision need to be identified and then expressed as policy decision criteria. For example, the decision criteria used in the analysis of environmental policy is often a mix of —\n\n\nSome criteria, such as economic benefit, will be more easily measurable or definable, while others such as environmental quality will be harder to measure or express quantitatively. Ultimately though, the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the policy goals, and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria, will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards a subset of the policy goals.\n\nThe process of identifying a suitably comprehensive decision criteria set is also vulnerable to being skewed by pressures arising at the political interface. For example, decision makers may tend to give \"\"more weight to policy impacts that are concentrated, tangible, certain, and immediate than to impacts that are diffuse, intangible, uncertain, and delayed\".\"^8. For example, with a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions the net financial cost in the first five years of policy implementation is a far easier impact to conceptualise than the more diffuse and uncertain impact of a country's improved position to influence global negotiations on climate change action.\n\nDisplaying the impacts of policy alternatives can be done using a policy analysis matrix (PAM) such that shown in Table 1. As shown, a PAM provides a summary of the policy impacts for the various alternatives and examination of the matrix can reveal the tradeoffs associated with the different alternatives.\n\nTable 1. Policy analysis matrix (PAM) for SO2 emissions control.\n\nOnce policy alternatives have been evaluated, the next step is to decide which policy alternative should be implemented. This is shown as step 5 in Figure 1. At one extreme, comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple if all the policy goals can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting. In this case, the decision method is an exercise in benefit cost analysis (BCA).\nAt the other extreme, the numerous goals will require the policy impacts to be expressed using a variety of metrics that are not readily comparable. In such cases, the policy analyst may draw on the concept of utility to aggregate the various goals into a single score. With the utility concept, each impact is given a weighting such that 1 unit of each weighted impact is considered to be equally valuable (or desirable) with regards to the collective well-being.\n\nWeimer and Vining also suggest that the \"\"go, no go\" rule can be a useful method for deciding amongst policy alternatives^8. Under this decision making regime, some or all policy impacts can be assigned thresholds which are used to eliminate at least some of the policy alternatives. In their example, one criterion \"is to minimize SO2 emissions\"\" and so a threshold might be a reduction SO2 emissions \"of at least 8.0 million tons per year\". As such, any policy alternative that does not meet this threshold can be removed from consideration. If only a single policy alternative satisfies all the impact thresholds then it is the one that is considered a \"go\" for each impact. Otherwise it might be that all but a few policy alternatives are eliminated and those that remain need to be more closely examined in terms of their trade-offs so that a decision can be made.\n\nTo demonstrate the rational analysis process as described above, let’s examine the policy paper “Stimulating the use of biofuels in the European Union: Implications for climate change policy” by Lisa Ryan where the substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels has been proposed in the European Union (EU) between 2005–2010 as part of a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from road transport, increase security of energy supply and support development of rural communities.\n\nConsidering the steps of Patton and Sawicki model as in Figure 1 above, this paper only follows components 1 to 5 of the rationalist policy analysis model:\n\n\nHowever, there are a lot of assumptions, requirements without which the rational decision model is a failure. Therefore, they all have to be considered. \nThe model assumes that we have or should or can obtain adequate information, both in terms of quality, quantity and accuracy. This applies to the situation as well as the alternative technical situations. It further assumes that you have or should or can obtain substantive knowledge of the cause and effect relationships relevant to the evaluation of the alternatives. In other words, it assumes that you have a thorough knowledge of all the alternatives and the consequences of the alternatives chosen. It further assumes that you can rank the alternatives and choose the best of it. \nThe following are the limitations for the Rational Decision Making Model:\n\n\nWhile the rational planning model was innovative at its conception, the concepts are controversial and questionable processes today. The rational planning model has fallen out of mass use as of the last decade. Rather than conceptualising human agents as rational planners, Lucy Suchman argues, agents can better be understood as engaging in situated action. Going further, Guy Benveniste argued that the rational model could not be implemented without taking the political context into account.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "653735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=653735", "title": "Richard Meinertzhagen", "text": "Richard Meinertzhagen\n\nColonel Richard Meinertzhagen, CBE, DSO (3 March 1878 – 17 June 1967) was a British soldier, intelligence officer and ornithologist. He had a decorated military career spanning Africa, where he was credited with creating and executing the infamous Haversack Ruse. While early biographies lionized Meinertzhagen as a master of military strategy and espionage, later works such as \"The Meinertzhagen Mystery\" present him as a fraud for fabricating stories of his feats and speculated he was also a murderer. The discovery of stolen museum bird specimens resubmitted as original discoveries had raised serious doubts on a number of scores as to the veracity of ornithological records he claimed as well.\n\nMeinertzhagen was born into a wealthy, socially connected British family. His father, Daniel Meinertzhagen, was head of the Frederick Huth & Co. merchant-banking dynasty, which had an international reputation, that one biographer claimed in the introduction to his book was second in importance only to the Rothschilds. His mother was Georgina Potter, sister of Beatrice Webb, a co-founder of the London School of Economics. Meinertzhagen's surname derives from Meinerzhagen in Germany, the home of an ancestor. On his mother's side (the wealthy Potter family), he was of English descent. Among his relations were \"many of Britain's titled, rich and influential personages.\" Although he had his doubts, he also claimed to be a distant descendant of Philip III of Spain. His nephew, Daniel Meinertzhagen (1915-1991), was a chairman of Lazard. His niece, Teresa Georgina Mayor (1915-1996), married Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild.\n\nYoung Richard was sent as a boarding student to Aysgarth School in the north of England, then was enrolled at Fonthill in Sussex, and finally at Harrow School, where his stay overlapped with that of Winston Churchill. In 1895, at the age of eighteen, he reluctantly obeyed his father's wishes to join the family bank as a clerk. He was assigned to offices in Cologne and Bremen. There he picked up the German language but remained uninterested in banking. After he returned to the bank’s home office in England in 1897, he received his father’s approval to join a territorial militia of weekend soldiers called the Hampshire Yeomanry. In 1911 he would marry Armorel, the daughter of Colonel Herman Le Roy-Lewis, who commanded the Hampshire Yeomanry.\n\nMeinertzhagen's passion for bird-watching began as a child. He and his brother Daniel were encouraged by a family friend, the philosopher Herbert Spencer, who, like another family friend, Charles Darwin, was an ardent empiricist. Spencer would take young Richard and Daniel on walks around the family home of Mottisfont Abbey, urging them to observe and enquire on the habits of birds. Around 1887 they kept a pet sparrowhawk, which was taken to Hyde Park to let it prey on sparrows. The first serious ornithologist that Richard met was Brian Hodgson. Daniel took an interest in bird illustration which brought them in contact with Archibald Thorburn and led to an introduction to Joseph Wolf and G.E. Lodge. They had first met Richard Bowdler Sharpe at the Natural History Museum in 1886 and noted that he was very fond of encouraging children, showing them around the bird collections.\n\nLacking the desire to make a career in merchant banking, Meinertzhagen took examinations for a commission in the British Army, and after training at Aldershot was commissioned as a Second lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers on 18 January 1899. He was sent to India to join a battalion of his regiment. Other than routine regimental soldiering, he participated in big-game hunting, was promoted, sent on sick leave to England, and after recovery posted to the relocated battalion at Mandalay in Burma. He was promoted Lieutenant on 8 February 1900. He then started his “zealous campaign” for a transfer to Africa, and in April 1902 was seconded for service with the Foreign Office, who attached him to the 3rd (East African) Battalion of the King's African Rifles. The following month he finally arrived at Mombasa in British East Africa.\n\nMeinertzhagen was assigned as a staff officer with the King's African Rifles (KAR). Again he participated in big-game hunting, but “regarded himself as scientist-explorer first, and only incidentally as a soldier.” His maps, landscape and wildlife drawings proved him an artist of exceptional talent. In 1903 he was delegated to conduct a wild animal census in the Serengeti and Athi plains.\n\nDuring Meinertzhagen's assignment to Africa, frequent native \"risings and rebellions\" occurred. By 1903 KAR's retaliatory ventures focused on confiscation of livestock, a highly effective form of punishment, and \"the KAR had become accomplished cattle-rustlers.\" One such punitive expedition was commanded by a Captain F.A. Dickinson of the 3rd KAR with participation by Meinertzhagen, where more than 11,000 stock were captured at the cost of 3 men killed and 33 wounded. The body count on the African side was estimated at 1,500 from the Kikuyu and Embu tribes.\n\nIn the Kenya Highlands in 1905, Meinertzhagen crushed a major revolt, the Nandi Resistance, by killing its leader, the Nandi Orkoiyot (spiritual leader) Koitalel Arap Samoei. He arranged a meeting to negotiate by Koitalel's home on 19 October 1905, at which he planned to assassinate him. Meinertzhagen shot Koitalel, while shaking his hand and his men machine-gunned two dozen Nandi tribesmen, including most of Koitalel's advisors. Initially he had been able to orchestrate a cover-up and was to be commended for the incident. He claimed self-defense and eventually, after a third court of inquiry, he was cleared by the presiding officer, Brig. William Manning. Meinertzhagen collected tribal artifacts after this revolt. Some of these items, including a walking stick and baton belonging to Koitalel, were returned to Kenya in 2006. Pressure from the Colonial Department on the War Office eventually brought about Meinertzhagen's removal from Africa, as \"he had become a negative symbol\" and on 28 May 1906 \"he found himself on a ship being trundled back to England in disgrace and in disgust.\"\n\nCaptain Meinertzhagen then spent the latter part of 1906 at \"dreary administrative War Office desk jobs pushing papers.\" However, \"... by making full use of his wide network of contacts in high places\" he was able to rehabilitate himself and was assigned to the Fusiliers' Third Battalion in South Africa, arriving at Cape Town on 3 February 1907. He served there in 1908 and 1909, then on Mauritius. By 1913, he was again in India.\n\nAt the beginning of the First World War, he was posted to the intelligence staff of the British Indian Expeditionary Force. His map-making skills were much valued and recognized, though his assessments of the German Schutztruppe strength and other contributions to the conduct of the Battle of Tanga and the Battle of Kilimanjaro were a complete miss. From January 1915 through August 1916 Meinertzhagen served as chief of British military intelligence for the East Africa theater at Nairobi. His diaried records of this campaign contain harsh assessments of senior officers, of the role played by the Royal Navy and of the quality of the Indian units sent to East Africa. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in February 1916. In November of that year General J.C. Smuts ordered him invalided to England.\n\nDuring 1917, Meinertzhagen was transferred from East Africa to be put in place at Deir-el-Belah. He made contact with Nili, a Jewish spy network headed by the agronomist Aaron Aaronsohn. Meinertzhagen later asserted that he respected Aaronsohn more than anyone else he ever met. They were instrumental in contacting Jewish officers in the Ottoman army, amongst many other sources, for information, and attempted their defection to the allies. A German Jewish doctor stationed at el-Afulah railway junction gave valuable reconnaissance reports on troop movements south. Meinertzhagen's department produced regular maps from the data showing the dispositions of enemy forces in the desert. In October 1917, the Turks broke up the network by intercepting a carrier pigeon and subjecting the Jews to hideous torture. Sarah Aaronsohn, age 27, a key figure, committed suicide in her home after torture. Meinertzhagen's sources of information dwindled to the occasional prisoner caught out by patrols, and deserters. He is frequently credited with a surprise attack known as the \"Haversack Ruse\" in October 1917: during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War, according to his diary, he let a haversack containing false British battle plans fall into Ottoman military hands, thereby bringing about the British victory in the Battle of Beersheba and Gaza.\n\nThe evidence was wrapped in paper used for sandwiches, and taken to General Kress von Kressenstein, who examined the pocket book and mused on its authenticity. According to an account by Turkish Colonel Hussein Husni, Chief of Staff of 7th Army, Meinertzhagen's German-sounding name added to its genuine feel. Von Kressenstein wanted to believe it, which threw the staff into some confused arguments. The ideas of Allenby's general leave-time played on Turk preconceptions about the way British and Australians were thought to behave. The main consequence was a swap in the German High Command, and Mustafa Kemal's resignation. At a time when the British were planning their third attempt to capture Gaza the timing proved critical.\n\nAlthough Meinertzhagen's participation in this ruse has been discounted (he may have neither planned nor executed it), his stories of the ruse themselves would have a major impact on events in the Second World War. It inspired Winston Churchill to create the London Controlling Section, which planned countless Allied deception campaigns during the war, and such operations as Mincemeat and diversions covering D-Day were influenced by the Haversack Ruse.\n\nAnother story from 1917 refers to a number of Arab spies suspected of wandering through British lines in disguise. He caught a couple of Arabs and extracted their Ottoman paymaster, a merchant who lived in Beersheba. Meinertzhagen sent him money with an Arab he knew would talk. The merchant was executed by the Turks. \"Near the end of 1917, having participated in no battles, he was ordered back to England for reassignment [and] found office duty as dreary as ever.\"\n\nMeinertzhagen was outraged by the continual sorties to bomb the enemy camp, given the bombs always missed their target, and invaluable reconnaissance planes were shot down, and with lives lost. One such raid as many as eight planes went down. From an intelligence viewpoint it was pointless as the Germans gave as good as they got in return to no overall gain. He hated the notion that the Holy City of Jerusalem would be bombed from the air, and expressed outrage when this occurred. For example, the bombing of the enemy's HQ at Mount of Olives. But Allenby told him that the Turks had to be induced to escape Jerusalem, northwards if possible, and so a boundary was set at 6 miles no-fighting zone to facilitate their flight.\n\nFrom the spring of 1918 until August he commuted between England and France, delivering lectures on intelligence to groups of officers – then was assigned full-time to France at GHQ. After the armistice he attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and was Edmund Allenby's Chief Political Officer, involved in the creation of the Palestine Mandate, which eventually led to the creation of the state of Israel. In the film \"\" (1990), which depicted the Paris Peace Conference, Meinertzhagen was a major character and was played by Jim Carter. His unpublished diaries hint, among other exploits, at a successful rescue attempt of one of the Czarist-Russian Grand Duchesses, possibly Tatiana (see \"The Romanov Conspiracies\" by Michael Occleshaw).\n\nIn the August 1920 Report of the Palin Commission, Meinertzhagen was attacked for an alleged bias:\nIsraeli historian Tom Segev considers Meinertzhagen both a \"great anti-semite and a great Zionist,\" quoting from his \"Middle East Diary\": \"I am imbued with antisemitic feelings. It was indeed an accursed day that allowed Jews and not Christians to introduce to the world the principles of Zionism and that allowed Jewish brains and Jewish money to carry them out, almost unhelped by Christians save a handful of enthusiasts in England.\"\n\nMeinertzhagen was and is considered however a true and valued friend of Zionism. \"On 3 December 1947, four days after the UN voted in favour of partition in Palestine, Dr Chaim Weizmann, the modern State of Israel's first president, cabled Col. Richard Meinertzhagen to say, “To you dear friend we owe so much that I can only express it in simple words – May God Bless You”.\n\nIn Weizmann's biography he wrote of Meinertzhagen,“At our first meeting, he told me the following story of himself: he had been an anti-Semite, though all he had known about Jews had been what he picked up in a few casual, anti-Semitic books. But he had also met some of the rich Jews, who had not been particularly attractive. But then, in the Near East, he had come across Aaron Aaronsohn, a Palestinian Jew, also a man of great courage and superior intelligence, devoted to Palestine. Aaronson was a botanist, and the discoverer of wild wheat. With Aaronson, Meinertzhagen had many talks about Palestine, and was so impressed by him that he completely changed his mind and became an ardent Zionist – which he has remained till this day. And that not merely in words. Whenever he can perform a service for the Jews or Palestine he will go out of his way to do so.\n\nMeinertzhagen wrote in his book, \"Middle East Diary\", “But thank God I have lived to see the birth of Israel. It is one of the greatest historical events of the last 2,000 years and thank God I have been privileged to assist in a small way this great event which, I am convinced, will bring benefit to mankind”.\n\nIn 1973 \"Middle East Diary\" was published in Hebrew, translated by Aharon Amir. \n\nMeinertzhagen was a prolific diarist and published four books based on these diaries. However, his \"Middle East Diary\" contains entries that are in all probability fictional, including those on T. E. Lawrence and a bit of absurd slapstick concerning Adolf Hitler. In October 1934, Meinertzhagen claimed to have mocked Hitler in response to being \"baffled when Hitler raised his arm in the Nazi salute and said, 'Heil Hitler.' After a moment's thought, Meinertzhagen says he raised his own arm in an identical salute and proclaimed, 'Heil Meinertzhagen'.\" He claimed to have carried a loaded pistol in his coat pocket at a meeting with Hitler and Ribbentrop in July 1939 and was \"seriously troubled\" about not shooting when he had the chance, adding \"... [I]f this war breaks out, as I feel sure it will, then I shall feel very much to blame for not killing these two.\"\n\nAuthors Lockman and Garfield show that Meinertzhagen later falsified his entries. The original diaries are kept at Rhodes House (the Bodleian Library), Oxford, and contain differences in the paper used for certain entries as well as in the typewriter ribbon used, and there are oddities in the page numbering.\n\n\nHe was reinstated as a lieutenant colonel in 1939 in Military Intelligence, G.S.O.-3 (General Staff Officer, 3rd grade); the nature of his duties was confined mainly to public relations work.\n\nMeinertzhagen has inspired three biographies since his death in 1967. Early biographers largely lionized him as a grand elder statesman of espionage and ornithology.\n\nT. E. Lawrence, a sometime colleague in 1919 and again 1921, described him more ambiguously and with due attention to his violence:\n\nMeinertzhagen himself traced the \"evil\" side of his personality to a period during his childhood when he was subjected to severe physical abuse at the hands of a sadistic schoolmaster when he was at Fonthill boarding school in Sussex:\n\nGavin Maxwell wrote about how his parents would scare him and other children to behave themselves when Meinertzhagen visited with \"... remember ... he has killed people with his bare hands...\" Salim Ali noted Meinertzhagen's special hatred for Mahatma Gandhi and his refusal to believe that Indians could govern themselves.\n\nIn \"The Meinertzhagen Mystery\", Garfield presents a fuller perspective of Meinertzhagen as not only a fraud but also a murderer. The book argues many of Meinertzhagen's accomplishments were myths including the famous haversack incident, which Garfield claims Meinertzhagen neither came up with nor carried out. In another example Garfield researched Meinertzhagen diary records noting three meetings on separate dates with Adolf Hitler. Although Meinertzhagen was in Berlin on these dates in 1934, 1935 and 1939, Garfield found no record of any of these alleged meetings in surviving German chancellory records, British embassy files, British intelligence reports or newspapers of the day.\n\nGarfield's research leads him to speculate that Richard also killed his second wife, Annie (born Anne Constance Jackson daughter of Major Randle Jackson of Swordale, married Meinertzhagen in 1921), an ornithologist, and that her death was not an accident as claimed and ruled in court. She died in 1928 at age 40 in a remote Scottish village in an incident that was officially ruled a shooting accident. The finding was that she accidentally shot herself in the head with a revolver during target practice alone with Richard, but Garfield argues Meinertzhagen shot her out of fear that she would expose him and his fraudulent activities. Storrs L. Olson has pointed out some errors in Garfield's research, while confirming the validity of its overall negative tone.\n\nAs Garfield writes, \"From boyhood on [Meinertzhagen] had been in tune with nature; he took photographs, made drawings and provided armchair tourists with keen descriptions of rain forests and snowy mountains ... and discovered new (previously unrecorded) species of bats, birds, and \"mallophaga\" (\"bird lice\")\". He became a chairman of the British Ornithologists' Club and a recipient in 1951 of the Godman-Salvin Medal; the British Museum (Natural History) named a room after him.\n\nMeinertzhagen \"first achieved a sliver of international fame when he discovered, killed, stuffed, and shipped back to London the first known to Europeans Giant African Forest Hog, soon dubbed \"Hylochoerus meinertzhageni\", and attributed to Richard Meinertzhagen\". At that time, while on active duty in 1903, he was \"fearlessly exploring and mapping areas no European had seen before.\" He later also discovered the Afghan snowfinch or \"Montifringilla theresae\", and the Moroccan \"Riparia rupestris theresae\" and named them, and ten others, after Theresa Clay.\n\nHe edited \"Nicoll's Birds of Egypt\" in 1930. Michael J. Nicoll was a friend and Assistant Director of the Zoological Gardens at Giza; Nicoll attempted to write a comprehensive guide to the ornithology of Egypt, but died in 1925 before it could be published. The work was finished by Meinertzhagen with contributions of his own independent research and illustrations. It was printed with the title \"that seems appropriate,\" \"\"Nicoll's Birds of Egypt\" by Col. R. Meinertzhagen.\"\n\nIn 1948–49, he was accompanied by Dr. Phillip Clancey on an ornithological expedition to Arabia, Yemen, Aden, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa. As the author of numerous taxonomic and other works on birds, and possessing a vast collection of bird and bird lice specimens, he was long considered one of Britain's greatest ornithologists. Garfield, however, claims Meinhertzhagen's \"magnum opus\", \"Birds of Arabia\" (1954), was based on the unpublished manuscript of another naturalist, George Bates, who has been insufficiently credited in the work.\n\nIn the 1990s, an analysis of Meinertzhagen's bird collection at the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum in Tring, Hertfordshire, revealed large-scale fraud involving theft and falsification. The birds claimed as specimens collected by Meinhertzhagen matched with the ones that had been reported missing and the examination of the style of specimen preparation and the DNA sequences of the cotton used inside them matched the cotton used in other specimens prepared by the collectors of the stolen specimens. This also corroborated hear-say and other evidence on the specimen fraud. Many of the specimens that he submitted as his own were found to be missing samples belonging to the Natural History Museum and collected by others, such as Hugh Whistler. A species of owl, the forest owlet thought to have gone extinct was rediscovered in 1997 based on searches made in the locality where the original specimens were collected. Searches for the bird had failed before as these were made in a locality falsely claimed by Meinertzhagen. More research by Rasmussen and Robert Prŷs-Jones indicates the fraud was even more extensive than first thought.\n\nIn 1911, Meinertzhagen married Armorel, the daughter of Colonel Herman Le Roy-Lewis, who commanded the Hampshire Yeomanry. This marriage was dissolved in 1919.\n\nIn 1921 Meinertzhagen married Anne Constance Jackson, a fellow ornithologist and the daughter of Major Randle Jackson of Swordale, Ross-shire in Scotland. They had three children: Anne (born 1921), Daniel (born 1925) and Randle (born 1928). From about 1926 Meinertzhagen started to have a cold relationship with his wife and became increasingly close with his cousin Tess Clay, then aged fifteen - spending much time with her and her sisters. \n\nIn 1928, three months after the birth of Randle, Anne was killed, aged 40, at her birth village of Swordale. The finding, ruled in court, was that she accidentally shot herself in the head with a revolver during target practice alone with Richard. As noted above, Brian Garfield's research led him to speculate that in fact she was murdered by Meinertzhagen, out of fear that she would expose him and his fraudulent activities.. This idea was never conclusively proved or disproved. \n\nAnnie Constance Meinertzhagen left ₤113,466 (net personalty ₤18,733) in her will to her husband if he remained her widower, while if he remarried he was to get an annuity of ₤1200 and interest in their London home for life.. \n\nIn fact, Meinertzhagen never married again, but had a lasting relationship with Tess Clay, more than three decades his junior. The unmarried couple lived in adjacent buildings originally constructed with an internal passage connecting the foyers of the two houses. Clay was his housekeeper, secretary, \"confidante\" and later scientific partner who studied and eventually documented the vast collections of bird lice that Meinertzhagen had gathered. When they traveled they sometimes took separate rooms. He introduced her as his housekeeper or cousin or sometimes, inaccurately, as his niece. It is unknown if Meinertzhagen and Clay's relationship was \"physical\": Meinertzhagen's friend Victor Rothschild asked Meinertzhagen this outright, but was told \"in no uncertain terms to shut up\"; and a 1951 article in \"TIME\" referred to their relationship with \"wink-wink, nudge-nudge innuendo\".\n\nMeinertzhagen wrote numerous papers for scientific journals such as the \"Ibis\", as well as reports on intelligence work while in the army. Books authored or edited by him include:\n\n\n\n"}

The STCU was established and continues to receive its funding from Canada, Sweden (later the European Union) and the United States to provide grants and funding for projects which employ these scientists and engineers.\n\nBy 1984 close to a quarter of the Soviet Unions Gross National Product had been allocated for defense spending. The former Soviet Union conducted research, development and deployed nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry and had employed several thousand scientists, physicists and engineers with expertise in these areas. The collapse of the Soviet Union lead to the unemployment of many of these scientists and engineers while others had not received payments for their employment. The West believed that the dissemination of expert knowledge in these areas or the employment of these researchers and developers of these military assets by unfriendly nations or terror networks would lead to the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry. The West providing funding grants to keep these researchers and developers employed on civilian oriented projects thus preventing them from selling their services or expertise to enemy nation states or organizations.

His pivotal insights were that each local sequence of rock strata was a subsequence of a single universal sequence of strata and that these rock strata could be distinguished and traced for great distances by means of embedded fossilized organisms.\n\nWinchester's book narrates the intellectual context of the time, the development of Smith's ideas and how they contributed to the theory of evolution and more generally to a dawning realisation of the true age of the earth. The book describes the social, economic or industrial context for Smith's insights and work, such as the importance of coal mining and the transport of coal by means of canals, both of which were a stimulus to the study of geology and the means whereby Smith supported his research. Land owners wished to know if coal might be found on their holdings. Canal planning and construction depended on understanding the rock and soil along its route.\n\nRelated topics, such as the founding of the Geological Society of London, are included. Smith's map was published by John Cary, a leading map publisher. Winchester describes the practice of publishing at the time as well as the system of debtor's prisons through his account of the sojourn of Smith in the King's Bench Prison.\n\n\"The Map that Changed the World\" was published in 2001 by Harper Collins, while Winchester retains the copyright. The first edition is illustrated by Soun Vannithone. It includes an extensive index, glossary of geological terms, recommended reading and (lengthy) acknowledgements, as well as many stippled images (of consistent style). The last numbered page is page 329. There are 16 chapters, and single clay paper sheet in the middle containing colour plates of Smith's famous map and a modern geological map for comparison. (Smith's map is less complete, but essentially in agreement with the modern map). An image of Smith's first table of strata, and first (circular) geological map are also included. Just after the contents section, there is a 5-page section giving extensive details on the illustrations (such as the names of the chapter heading fossils). Each chapter begins with an inset image of a fossil, and a large first Capital. The dust-cover of the book can be removed and unfolded to reveal a larger print of the map in question.\n\nOne: Escape on the Northbound Stage\n\nTwo: A Land Awakening from Sleep\n\nThree: The Mystery of the Chedworth Bun\n\nFour: The Duke and the Baronet's Widow\n\nFive: A Light in the Underworld\n\nSix: The Slicing of Somerset\n\nSeven: The View from York Minster\n\nEight: Notes from the Swan\n\nNine: The Dictator in the Drawing Room\n\nTen: The Great Map Conceived\n\nEleven: A Jurassic Interlude\n\nTwelve: The Map That Changed the World\n\nThirteen: An Ungentlemanly Act\n\nFourteen: The Sale of the Century\n\nFifteen: The Wrath of Leviathan\n\nSixteen: The Lost and Found Man\n\nSeventeen: All Honor to the Doctor.\n\nA plausible but whimsical description of the day on which William Smith was let out of debtor's prison. It inducts the reader into the interpretation of the time and place to be held consistently throughout the book. Smith is described physically, as heavy-set balding and plain-looking, and emotionally as quitting London in disgust. He is leaving London with nothing other than his wife, nephew, and such possessions as they can carry. It is implied that these circumstances are the result of unjustified discrimination from the scientific elite. The chapter ends with a brief note that 12 years later the injustice was in some measure redressed.\n\nA description of the social circumstances of the time of the birth of Smith. It begins by emphasising that the date of 4004 bc, for the beginning of the world, computed from the genealogy tables of the bible, was firmly accepted by most; the idea that the world was any older was considered implausible. Explanations based on Noah's flood were acceptable in scientific circles. But, in the year 1769, as Smith was born, James Watt was patenting a steam engine, cloth manufacture was improving, the postal service was viable. New technology and information was rapidly becoming available or even common-place. \"William Smith appeared on the stage at a profoundly interesting moment: he was about to make it more so.\"\n\nThese claims by Winchester are inaccurate. Geologists had begun to recognize that the earth was old in the late 1600s. Ussher's 4004 BC age for the earth, along with similar estimates by Isaac Newton and other academics of the 17th century, was merely a historical footnote in academia by Smith's lifetime. In 1787, Scottish geologist James Hutton argued that the earth's age was immeasurable. Smith was in no way challenging the church or risking jail - American paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould refuted such claims in his review of The Map That Changed the World. In fact, Smith's single-minded focus on recognizing layers made him rather late to realize that the earth was old. Additionally, Smith's focus on recognizing layers based on the fossils in them was not unique. Though he was especially thorough, similar work (especially on the mainland of Europe) around the same time independently cemented the principle that fossils change over time and can be reliably used to identify layers. Martin Rudwick's \"Earth's Deep History: How It Was Discovered and Why It Matters\" is perhaps the most accessible account of the development of geology in this time interval. \n"}

Along the way, they learn about ancient civilization and also attempt to foil the plans of looters who steal the artifacts from the ancient sites. This series is a sequel to \"The Voyage of the Mimi\", produced in 1984, in which the Granvilles rented their boat and services to zoologists studying the humpback whale in the waters off Massachusetts.\n\nThe series aired on PBS and was created by the Bank Street College of Education in 1988 to teach middle-schoolers about science and social studies. \n\nIn each episode, viewers are taught something scientific relating to plot events in the previous episode of the show. For example, an episode's plot would be about deciphering Mayan writing, and the viewer also receives information about how the Maya wrote various words and numbers.\n\n\"The Second Voyage of the Mimi\" saw a young Ben Affleck return as C.T. Granville, and Peter G. Marston as his grandfather Captain Granville. Marston was a scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the production of the program and used to own the actual ship, the \"Mimi\".\n\nMain Cast Listing:\n\nEach episode consists of two fifteen-minute segments. \n\nThe first segment of each episode follows the serialized tale of scientists studying the ancient Maya and getting involved with thwarting site looters. The two scientists are Victor Cobos, a Mexican man of Maya descent, and Terry Gibbs, an American woman. Terry's husband is revealed to have been killed by site looters. Terry's daughter Quiché has grown up with archeology and can already read Maya writing. They hire the Granvilles in Quintana Roo, Mexico, near Tulum, to help them study the routes of ancient Maya ships. The Granvilles in turn hire Pepper Thornton, the daughter of one of Captain Granville's old sailing buddies, because she is an expert diver. Previously, Pepper worked for Harvey Westerman, a skinflint tour operator, guiding tourists on dives through then reefs. \n\nEach second segment is a standalone exploration of one of the scientific principles touched on in the serialized tale. In these second segments, one of the child actors (Ben Affleck or Carla Douglin) comes out of character and interviews real, in many cases well-known, scientists abouts their work. These scientists include archeologists Bill Fash, Peter Reynolds and David Stuart, and rain forest ecologist Nalini Nadkarni. In addition, Martha Hill, a silver medalist in the Winter Paralympics, comes out of character in an interview with Ben Affleck.\n\nSeries 1:\n\n\nThe \"Mimi\" was a French-built sailboat, originally constructed in 1931 as a small cargo and fishing vessel. It was purchased in the early 1980s by Peter Marston and was kept moored in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Besides its appearances on the TV show, it went from city to city and acted as a tourist attraction in places such as Salem, Massachusetts, Boston, and other cities. \nIn 1988, Peter Marston and some freelance musicians produced a cassette and songbook called \"Sea Songs from the Mimi Crew\" of old-time sea songs self-published under the name \"The Barn School\" based in Gloucester, Massachusetts. The cassette and songbook were available from the actual sailing vessel Mimi, as well as where music was sold, and in museum gift shops. The cassette and songbook are now out of print.\nAlso available from the sailing vessel Mimi were souvenirs such as T-shirts and buttons that said \"I was on board the Mimi.\" The souvenirs are no longer manufactured, and have hardly turned up on Internet marketers such as eBay or Amazon.\n\nMarston retained ownership of the vessel until 1999, when the boat was sold to new owners; Captain George G. Story of Gloucester, Massachusetts, his brother Captain Alan M. Story of Deltona, Florida and Spiro \"Steve\" Cocotas, also from Gloucester. They operated the vessel as Three Mates Inc. for several years, bringing the boat to as many as 28 cities along the east coast. The \"Mimi\" eventually fell into disrepair, and was scrapped in 2011.\n"}

Detonation of the associated nuclear weapon occurred 19 seconds after its deployment at 8:30am PDT (1530 UTC) on May 25, 1953, in Area 5 of the Nevada Test Site. The codename \"Grable\" was chosen because the letter \"Grable\" is phonetic for G, as in \"gun\", since the warhead was a gun-type fission weapon. As a shell, or artillery-fired atomic projectile (AFAP), the device was the first of its kind. The test remains the only nuclear artillery shell ever actually fired in the U.S. nuclear weapons test program.\n\n\"Grable\" was the second of only four gun-type warheads ever detonated (the first was Little Boy, the weapon used against Hiroshima, the last two were test firings of the W33; all other atomic weapons were implosion-type weapons). The shell, designated a Mark 9 nuclear weapon, had a diameter of 280 mm (11.02 in), was 1380 mm (54.4 in) long and weighed 364 kg (803 lb). The M65 Atomic Cannon from which it was fired had a muzzle velocity of 625 m/s (2,060 ft/s), for a nominal range of , and weighed 77 metric tons (85 t).\n\nThe detonation of \"Grable\" occurred 6 seconds after its firing. It detonated over 11,000 yards (over 10 km, 6.25 mi) away from the gun it was fired from, over a part of the Nevada Test Site known as Frenchman Flat. The explosion was an air burst of 160 m (524 ft) above the ground (7 m (24 ft) above its designated burst altitude), 26 m (87 ft) west and 41 m (136 ft) south of its target (slightly uprange). Its yield was estimated at 15 kilotons, around the same level as Little Boy. An anomalous feature of the blast was the formation of a precursor, a second shock front ahead of the incident wave. This precursor was formed when the shock wave reflected off the ground and surpassed the incident wave and Mach stem due to a heated ground air layer and the low burst height. It resulted in a lower overpressure, but higher overall dynamic pressure, which inflicted much more damage on drag sensitive targets such as jeeps and personnel carriers. This led strategists to rethink the importance of low air bursts in tactical nuclear warfare.\n\nSome images from Upshot–Knothole \"Grable\" were accidentally relabeled as belonging to the \"Priscilla\" shot from Operation Plumbbob in 1957. As a consequence many publications including official government documents have the photo mislabeled.\n\nAdmiral Arthur W. Radford, at the time the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson were present for the test.\n\n"}
