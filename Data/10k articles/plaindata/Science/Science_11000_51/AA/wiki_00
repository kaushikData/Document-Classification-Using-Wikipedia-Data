The task is named for two notable experiments published in the 1950s in which it was first documented, the first by John Brown and the second by husband and wife team Lloyd and Margaret Peterson.\n\nThe task aims to test the quantity of objects that can be held in working memory while preventing participants from using mnemonics or other memory techniques separate from the working memory to increase recall capacity. In the experiment, participants view a sequence of three-letter constructs called trigrams, and are asked to perform simple algebraic computations such as counting backwards by 3s from 999 between each trigram. A trigram consists of 3 non-morphemic letters, the importance of which is that each letter represents a different independent object to be stored in working memory; therefore, trigrams avoid letter combinations that depict words or common acronyms. The algebraic computations are administered between trigrams to assure the participant isn't using mnemonic strategies to chunk the letters into a single object. Variants of the Brown–Peterson task are still used today, all with the same fundamental concept of administering items for the participant to remember whilst preventing the usage of additional cognitive resources to augment working memory.\n\nThe Brown–Peterson task refers to two studies published in the late 1950s that used similar procedures, one in 1958 by John Brown and a second in 1959 by Lloyd and Margaret Peterson.\n\nThe first experiment involved 24 psychology students at Indiana University at the time. The examiner proceeded by spelling a random three-letter nonsense syllable and then enunciating immediately afterwards a random three-digit number. The subject would then count backwards by some assigned number, either three or four, from the enunciated number.\n\nAfter a set interval, a light signal was flashed to prompt the subject to cease verbally counting and to recall the random, three-letter nonsense syllable. The time interval between the enunciation by the examiner of the nonsense syllable (exposure to the syllable) and the signal prompt to the participant was known as the recall interval; the time interval between the signal prompt and the enunciation of the third letter by the participant was known as a latency.\nIn order to maintain reproducibility of results, each participant was tested eight times using each recall interval, which were 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 seconds. In addition, each nonsense syllable appeared an equal amount of times; the trials were split evenly in terms of counting by either three or four. No successive items contained the same letters, and the time between signal for recall and the next trial was always 15 seconds. In addition, the examiner and participant were instructed to enunciate in rhythm with a 120 BPM metronome, such that two letters or numbers were spoken per second.\n\nThe second experiment involved 48 psychology students from Indiana University. The exact procedure from the first experiment was followed for 24 of the students, but the other 24 were asked to repeat the stimulus (i.e., the nonsense syllable) aloud until the examiner stated the three-digit number. Therefore, the only difference between the two experiments was that there was a variable gap between the examiner's enunciation of the stimulus and the number, during which maintenance rehearsal took place. The inspiration behind this experiment was Brown's disbelief that repetition would strengthen the 'memory trace. The purpose of the second experiment was basically to prove or disprove this notion. However, the analysis of the study concluded that forgetting was found to progress at differential rates dependent upon the amount of rehearsal that took place'.\n\nThere are two types of interference:\n\nRetroactive interference: This type of interference occurs when new information disrupts the recall of old information.\n\nProactive interference: This type of interference occurs when old information disrupts the recall of new information.\n\nProactive interference affects participant performance in the Brown–Peterson task. The first time the students participate in the task, they show little loss of information. However, after multiple trials, the task becomes increasingly challenging when letters from the early trials are confused with letters in the current trial. \nFortunately, proactive interference can be hindered if the information to be remembered is changed to a different type of information. For example, in the Brown–Peterson task there appeared to be little proactive interference when the participants switched from recalling letters to recalling numbers.\n\nA key aspect of the Brown–Peterson task is the fact that it blocks rehearsal, which is used to better recall items in short-term memory. Rehearsal is the concept of directing attention to material that was just learned. This way, it can lengthen the duration of one's short-term memory capacity. In order to accurately calculate the duration of short-term memory using the Brown–Peterson task, such a method must be blocked so as not to falsely increase an unaltered duration. There are two different types of rehearsal:\n\nMaintenance rehearsal: This method of rehearsal uses repetition of the items in memory. It is essentially \"saying something repeatedly in order to keep it in mind\". An example could be attempting to memorize a shopping list while out shopping for groceries. Instead of remembering to take the list out to the store, the shopper could leave it at home and proceed to repeat each word. As useful as this type of rehearsal may seem, it does not guarantee the ability to recall what was memorized after it is no longer rehearsed\n\nElaborative rehearsal: This is type of rehearsal is also known as creative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal uses creativity to increase capacity of short-term memory and accurately recall items. Creating associations and connections between something significant to the person memorizing and the item(s) to be memorized is one example of elaborative rehearsal. Another example is the use of mnemonic devices, which are a creative way to mentally arrange the items to be memorized.\n\nThree key words in rehearsal are Association, Location, and Imagination. Association is an important factor in rehearsal, as it is the part of elaborative rehearsal where people make connections with the items and things significant to them. This helps increase capacity of short-term memory as they are recalling items with the help of something meaningful to them. Location is another factor, as incorporating location into what they are trying to memorize may be another association to a significant location in particular, thus making the item much easier to recall. Finally, imagination is essentially the creativity of elaborative rehearsal. It combines creativity with the items to recall in such a way that makes them easiest to recall.\n"}

However, it can be shown that a central force is conservative if and only if it is spherically symmetric.\n\nCentral forces that are conservative can always be expressed as the negative gradient of a potential energy:-\n(the upper bound of integration is arbitrary, as the potential is defined up to an additive constant).\n\nIn a conservative field, the total mechanical energy (kinetic and potential) is conserved:\n(where ṙ denotes the derivative of r with respect to time, that is the velocity), and in a central force field, so is the angular momentum:\nbecause the torque exerted by the force is zero. As a consequence, the body moves on the plane perpendicular to the angular momentum vector and containing the origin, and obeys Kepler's second law. (If the angular momentum is zero, the body moves along the line joining it with the origin.)\n\nIt can also be shown that an object that moves under the influence of \"any\" central force obeys Kepler's second law. However, the first and third laws depend on the inverse-square nature of Newton's law of universal gravitation and do not hold in general for other central forces.\n\nAs a consequence of being conservative, these specific central force fields are irrotational, that is, its curl is zero, \"except at the origin\":\n\nGravitational force and Coulomb force are two familiar examples with formula_8 being proportional to 1/\"r\" only. An object in such a force field with negative formula_8 (corresponding to an attractive force) obeys Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\n\nThe force field of a spatial harmonic oscillator is central with formula_8 proportional to \"r\" only and negative.\n\nBy Bertrand's theorem, these two, formula_11and \"formula_12\", are the only possible central force fields where all bounded orbits are stable closed orbits. However, there exist other force fields, which have some closed orbits.\n\nThis article uses the definition of central force given in Taylor. Another common definition (used in \"ScienceWorld\") adds the constraint that the force be spherically symmetric, i.e. formula_13.\n\n"}

This makes a CCP a population of plants with a lot of inherent genetic diversity, in contrast to monocultures where all plants are clones and homozygous at all loci (fully inbred). In recent years CCPs have been proposed as a way to create modern landraces of wheat, barley and oats. Research is done to explore whether they are better suited for organic farming than the modern cultivars. \nThey are suited for participatory breeding of crops, which is in contrast to cultivars owned by big breeding companies.\n\nThe idea of using CCPs in plant breeding was initially published in 1956. Yield data for 4 different populations for 8–28 years were presented in the article and after 8–15 years of repeated breeding under natural selection, the populations out-yielded the reference cultivar.\n\nCreating a CCP involves 3 steps: initiation, multiplication and mixture. The population then goes into the maintenance phase.\n\nA number of lines, generally 7-30, with interesting properties, such as yield or baking quality, are selected and all possible crosses of them are done. If many lines of different genetic background are used, a huge amount of genetic diversity will be present.\n\nSeeds from crosses are sown out and harvested separately for a growing season or two until enough seeds are available.\n\nAll seeds are mixed in equal portions to produce the first CCP generation.\n\nThe population is grown repeatedly and possibly changes due to natural selection. Each year seeds are saved after harvest, and used as seed for the next growing season. Plants that are successful under the prevailing growing conditions will give more seeds and contribute more to the next generation, compared to less successful plants. Disease will cull susceptible plants and the population will over time become resistant to the common diseases, but only if the initial population has resistance genes present.\n\nWhen genotypes grown together in a diverse population have different profiles of resource use they complement each other in the exploitation of the limiting resource and therefore are subject to smaller between-plant competition.\n\nIn case of disease or environmental change some plants will take over when others fail. Yield stability over years and environments can be better than pure lines due to compensation.\n\nParticipatory plant breeding (PPB) methods represent alternatives aimed to improve local adaptation breeding, to promote genetic diversity, to empower farmers and rural communities. In PPB farmers are actively participating in developing new cultivars or populations, e.g. by performing selection.\n\nDifferent genotypes may compete with each other in a way that is not beneficial for the population. A pure line optimized for a certain environment or usage outperforms the CCP under these specific conditions.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that the Darwinian selection will work in the desired direction for desired traits such as baking quality.\n\nCommon Bunt is a seed borne disease in wheat. In conventional farming it is controlled by fungicide treatment of seeds. In organic farming seeds can be cleaned by brushing before sowing, but it is also desirable that plants have genetic resistance. A CCP, including crosses of resistant cultivars, was grown with heavy common bunt infection for 5 years and it appeared to get more resistant, but the common bunt's virulence appeared to change at least as fast. The overall result was that infection levels went up.\n\nCCPs can be a valuable resource of genetic material. They can be used to preserve valuable genetic diversity for future use, or as base for new breading programs. Promising plants can be selected and multiplied, generating new varieties.\n\nIt is legal under EU law to sell and buy seeds from a composite cross population as an experiment in the period 1 March 2014 to 31 December 2018.\n\nThe ORC Wakelyn winter wheat CCP . has been approved for sale\n"}

It is applicable to both combinatorial and continuous problems, with either a static or noisy objective.\n\nThe method approximates the optimal importance sampling estimator by repeating two phases:\n\n\nReuven Rubinstein developed the method in the context of \"rare event simulation\", where tiny probabilities must be estimated, for example in network reliability analysis, queueing models, or performance analysis of telecommunication systems. The method has also been applied to the traveling salesman, quadratic assignment, DNA sequence alignment, max-cut and buffer allocation problems.\n\nConsider the general problem of estimating the quantity \n\nformula_1,\n\nwhere formula_2 is some \"performance function\" and formula_3 is a member of some parametric family of distributions.

It was published by Oxford University Press in 2008.\n\n\"Echoes of Life\" chronicles the history of the discipline of organic geochemistry. In early experiments, Alfred E. Treibs identified organic molecules, which he extracted from various samples, as chemically altered chlorophyll. He explained the chlorophyll as having come from plants that died millions of years ago. Since Treibs' discovery, thousands of biomarkers (a term coined 25 years after Treibs' discovery) have been identified.\n\nChapter one, entitled \"Molecular Informants: A Changing Perspective of Organic Chemistry\", gives a brief overview on the history of organic chemistry and explores the possibilities inherent in the science. It also describes how the authors first became interested in the subject and the work they have done within the field.\n\nChapter two entitled \"Looking to the Rocks: Molecular Clues to the Origin of Life\" looks at the findings of Sir Robert Robinson and Melvin Calvin discoveries of organic compounds in petrol and the conversion of CO to organic molecules during photosynthesis. Early experiments had shown that organic compounds can form spontaneously under conditions similar to the pre-biotic era of earth. These findings led to speculation on the possible discovery on the origins of life. The chapter ends with the authors saying as a precursor to the next chapter\n\nChapter three entitled \"From the Moon to Mars: The Search for Extraterrestrial Life.\" A Carbonaceous Meteorite which was found in Hungary in 1857, which was examined by Friedrich Wöhler was found to have organic compounds which he believed were Extraterrestrial in origin. The book moves on to Marcellin Berthelot who in 1864 claimed to have found \"petroleum-like hydrocarbons\" in a meteorite found near Orgueil. Louis Pasteur also ran experiments on this meteor and concluded it was sterile and not capable of generating life. The discovery of the Murchison meteorite also led to the finding of 70 amino acids most of which are not native to earth's biosphere. The authors look into the work done on samples brought back from the Apollo program missions. Geoffrey Eglinton one of the authors had been given a sample and although he knew there had never been life on the moon they had hoped to find organic compounds. None were found within those samples, which led to disappointment. These findings led the authors to speculate on the possibility of answering the question of whether there has ever been life on Mars and if future missions will bring back viable samples for testing.\n\nThe book has received positive reviews in specialist scientific journals such as Astrobiology and from the Astrobiology Society of Britain.\n\nBill Green, writing in \"Chemical & Engineering News\", called it \"a remarkable book\" and a \"highly readable introduction to the field of organic geochemistry and that it also manages to capture the deep sense of curiosity and wonder associated with scientific investigation.\".\n\nIn \"BioScience\", Karen Bushaw-Newton said that \"those who are looking to broaden their knowledge of the connections between chemical compounds and the diversity of life, will find Echoes of Life well worth reading.\"\n\nKatherine H.

Its full title was \"Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics, developed with especial reference to the rational foundation of thermodynamics\".\n\nIn this book, Gibbs carefully showed how the laws of thermodynamics would arise exactly from a generic classical mechanical system, if one allowed for a certain natural uncertainty about the state of that system.\n\nThe themes of thermodynamic connections to statistical mechanics had been explored in the preceding decades with Clausius, Maxwell, and Boltzmann together writing thousands of pages on this topic. One of Gibbs' aims in writing the book was to distill these results into a cohesive and simple picture (Gibbs wrote in 1892 to his colleague Lord Rayleigh, \"Just now I am trying to get ready for publication something on thermodynamics from the a priori point of view, or rather on 'statistical mechanics' [...] I do not know that I shall have anything particularly new in substance, but shall be contented if I can so choose my standpoint (as seems to me possible) as to get a simpler view of the subject.\"). He had been working on this topic for some time, at least as early as 1884 when he produced a paper (now lost except for its abstract) on the topic of statistical mechanics.\n\nGibbs' book simplified statistical mechanics into a treatise of 207 pages. At the same time, Gibbs fully generalized and expanded statistical mechanics into the form in which it is known today. Gibbs showed how statistical mechanics could be used even to \"extend\" thermodynamics beyond classical thermodynamics, to systems of any number of degrees of freedom (including microscopic systems) and non-extensive systems.\n\nAt the time of the book's writing, the prevailing understanding of nature was purely in classical terms as quantum mechanics had not yet been conceived; even basic facts taken for granted today (such as the existence of atoms) were still contested among scientists. Gibbs was careful in assuming the least about the nature of physical systems under study, and as a result the principles of statistical mechanics laid down by Gibbs have retained their accuracy (with some changes in detail but not in theme), in spite of the major upheavals of modern physics during the early 20th century.\n\nV.

Modus ponens and modus tollens are the most important rules of inference. A modus ponens rule is in the form\n\nIn crisp logic, the premise \"x is A\" can only be true or false. However, in a fuzzy rule, the premise \"x is A\" and the consequent \"y is B\" can be true to a degree, instead of entirely true or entirely false.

In a fuzzy rule, modus ponens is extended to \"generalised modus ponens:.\"\n\nThe key difference is that the premise \"x is A\" can be only partially true. As a result, the consequent \"y is B\" is also partially true.

Amtmann (1906 - 2007) was a German aircraft designer.\nHe is best known for his work at Blohm & Voss, where he worked as Head of New Projects under Chief Designer Richard Vogt during the World War II era. After the war, he moved the United States as part of Operation Paperclip, where he worked on a variety of projects.\n\nHans Amtmann was born in Sande, on the outskirts of Bergedorf, near Hamburg in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, in October 1906. He was the second of two brothers. From the age of nine he was educated at the Hansa School. During this time he learned to play the violin, before moving on to study naval architecture at the State Technical College in Hamburg. In his final term he took a course in aeronautics.\n\nAfter only one month working as a naval architect, Amtmann was offered a position as an aircraft designer at Junkers in Dessau. He worked on the wings of the G 38 and Ju 52 all-metal transports, and on in-flight refuelling, rocket-assisted take-off and preliminary design work. There he also met Hermann Pohlmann, who would go on to design the famous Ju 87 \"Stuka\" or dive-bomber before eventually becoming Amtmann's superior in another company.\n\nIn 1933 Amtmann moved to Heinkel at Warnemünde on the shores of the Baltic sea, where he worked on the fuselage of the He 70 transport before becoming involved once again on new project work.\n\nWanting to return to Hamburg, Amtmann obtained a position as an aircraft designer at the newly established Hamburger Flugzeugbau, under the design leadership of Richard Vogt. He started work there as one of Vogt's first recruits, early in 1934, and was soon appointed Head of Preliminary Design. He would remain there, working on Vogt's great range of unconventional and ingenious ideas, throughout its official renaming as a subsidiary of Blohm & Voss shipbuilders, until it was shut down at the end of World War II in 1945. Due to the workload on Vogt, Amtmann's old colleague Pohlmann would later also join B&V as Deputy Chief Designer, so becoming his immediate superior.\n\nHe married Margret, whom he had known since his days as a naval architect, on 10 October 1934. They had four children; three boys and a girl.\n\nIn 1941 he was awarded the War Merit Cross for his outstanding aircraft work.\n\nAmtmann was subsequently appointed project engineer for the proposed Blohm & Voss BV 237 \"stuka\" or dive-bomber attack aircraft, which had been personally approved by Hitler, but the order was obstructed by others and the work delayed until the war ended. He also took over and led the design of the P 200 transatlantic passenger flying boat project for Deutsche Luft Hansa, with the intention of building it when the war was over. The BV 40 interceptor glider, flown in prototype form, gave him experience of the prone pilot position, which would help his later career.\n\nImmediately after the factory was shut down at the end of hostilities, B&V kept a core design team together in rented rooms at a museum. But money soon ran out and Amtmann took a teaching job.\n\nin October 1946 Amtmann left his teaching job, having been recruited under the American Operation Paperclip to work in the US. Vogt would also be recruited, but Pohlmann would stay behind and later help to resurrect the Hamburger Flugzeugbau. Amtmann was sent to Wright Field, where he resumed work on a prone pilot bed, working for the biomedical facility under H. T. E. \"Ed\" Hertzberg. Amtmann developed a patent control system for the pilot and the bed was test flown in a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber and later in a Lockheed F-80E Shooting Star jet fighter. During this work he also developed a protective shield for the pilot's helmet during emergency ejection which was widely adopted. Another invention was a flying fuel tank system in which the fuel tank glider was attached to the wing tips in parasite configuration. By a coincidence his erstwhile Chief, Richard Vogt, was also at Wright Field and came up with the same idea, beating Amtmann to the patent office.\n\nHis family were eventually allowed to come over from Germany and join him early in 1948. But he did not become a legal immigrant until 1 January 1949. The paperwork had to be carried out at a border crossing, so the \"Operation Paperclip\" migrants were taken in batches, under military escort, across the Canadian border at Niagara Falls and then walked back over the bridge into the US, where they signed their immigration papers. He signed US citizenship papers in March. He escorted the rest of his family on the same exercise several months later and they received their papers in 1950.\n\nAmtmann left US Government employment in 1951, to work for Consolidated Vultee in San Diego, California, back in his old role of preliminary design. He worked on the Atlas ICBM system. Following a company separation or aero and missile divisions, under the new company name of Convair he developed the P6Y flying boat for the US Navy, but they withdrew the requirement. He was also involved in the Convair series of supersonic delta-winged jets, proposing his own design for a four-engined seaplane similar to, but larger than, the Convair F2Y Sea Dart.\n\nMade redundant in 1961, he joined General Atomic and worked on the Orion space propulsion system, which proposed using a controlled sequence of nuclear explosions to propel the spacecraft. He also worked on atomic-powered gas turbines.\n\nHe moved to a small company working on nuclear fusion power in 1980, until the company closed in 1984.\n\nAmtmann retired in 1984, following closure of the nuclear fusion company.\n\nDuring his time in California he had joined a small orchestra in which he once again played the violin.\n\nHe wrote up his memoirs which were published in 1988 as \"The Vanishing Paperclips: America's Aerospace Secret – a Personal Account\".\n\nHe appeared in the 1995 TV film documentary \"The Last Days of World War II\"\n\nHans Amtmann died at the age of 100, on 20 February 2007.\n\n"}

Popular throughout the United States and the United Kingdom, they are often areas of high-density, low-impact residences of single-family detached homes, and often allow for separate ownership of each housing unit, for example through subdivision. A housing development is \"often erected on a tract of land by one builder and controlled by one management.\"\n\nThere are several different housing types. All of which housing developers can choose to develop. They can range from Single Detached, Duplex, Triplex, Multiplex/Big House, Side Attached, Stacked Rowhouse, Small Apartment, Low-rise Apartment, Mid-rise Apartment, Apartment over Commercial, High-Rise Apartment. Each of the different housing types will have their distinctive characteristics, density ranges, number of units, and floors.\n\nThis type of housing will be detached from other housing types. This type of unit houses lower densities. Lawns are an option for this kind of design, with distinctive public and private spaces. A single detached can have up to three floors. Some of the common names for a singled detached housing type is \"House, Cottage, Villa, Bungalow\"\n\nThis type of housing can have two or three dwelling units in a detached building. The units could be together or separate depending on the location of the duplex. A duplex will also have an option for a yard in order to keep their private space. This type of housing will allow for higher density housing compared to the single detached units. Duplex, and Triplex can account for 2-3 units, and have up to 3 floors. Some of the common names for Duplex, Triplex are \"Semi-detached, Double House, Accessory unity, Ancillary unit, Carriage unit, Twin Home.\" \n\nBig house, Multiplex can come in many forms, it can have a single or muli-level unit. Just like the duplex, it can have multiple floors, up to 3 floors. It can account for up to 5 units as well. This type of housing will have a higher density than single detached housing.

An international conference on cold fusion was held in Santa Fe, New Mexico US in 1989. However, the first ICCF conference (ICCF1) took place in 1990 in Salt Lake City, Utah, under the title \"First Annual Conference on Cold Fusion\". Its location has since rotated between Russia, US, Europe, and Asia. It was held in India for the first time in 2011.\n\nThe conferences have been criticized as events which attract \"crackpots\" and \"pseudo-scientists\". However, preserving the conference documents has been said, in 2004, to be a task worth supporting, because the documents \"reflect evolution of a unique scientific controversy,\" especially for historians of science.\n\nThe First Annual Conference on Cold Fusion was held in March 1990 in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Robert L. Park of the American Physical Society derisively referred to it as a \"seance of true believers.\" The conference was attended by more than 200 researchers from the United States, Italy, Japan, India and Taiwan and dozens of reporters from all over the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Third International Conference on Cold Fusion was held in 1992 in Nagoya, Japan. It was described by \"The New York Times\", \"depending on one's point of view\" as \"either a turning point in which evidence was presented that will convince the skeptics that cold fusion exists or a religious revival where claims of miracles were lapped up by ardent believers.\" The conference was sponsored by seven Japanese scientific societies, it was attended by 200 Japanese scientists and more than 100 from abroad. Tomohiro Taniguchi, then director of the Electric Power Technology Division at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, reportedly said that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry was willing to finance research in the field in view of \"encouraging evidence, especially after the conference.\" The conference was also covered by the Associated Press.\n\nA journalist for the \"Wired\" magazine attended the 1998 conference in Vancouver—apparently the only mainstream journalist who attended—and reported that he found there \"about 200 extremely conventional-looking scientists, almost all of them male and over 50\" with some apparently over 70. He then inferred that \"[the] younger ones had bailed years ago, fearing career damage from the cold fusion stigma.\" He reported seeing \"highly technical presentations\" and \"was amazed by the quantity of the work, its quality, and the credentials of the people pursuing it\", whereas \"[a] few obvious pseudoscientists, promoting their ideas in an adjoining room used for poster sessions, were politely ignored.\"\n\nBy 1999, attendance by researchers at the ICCF meetings drew comment from the field of science studies. Although scientific debate over cold fusion had effectively ended in 1990, attendance at the ICCF meetings for the next 8 years had been relatively stable at between 100 and 300. Sociologist Bart Simon of Concordia University described the state of the field as \"undead\", and considered that the conference evidenced that \"as far as normal science is concerned, [cold fusion] is of interest to crackpots, pseudo-scientists, frauds and a few sociologists of science\".\n\nDavid Goodstein has written that although an ICCF event had \"all the trappings of a normal scientific meeting\", it was in fact \"no normal scientific conference\" since \"cold fusion was a pariah field, cast out by the scientific establishment\". It was an environment, he added, \"...in which crackpots flourished, and this made matters worse for those who were at least willing to entertain the notion that there might have been some serious science going on.\"\n\nThe conference is organized by The International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Science. Conference attendees include \"a mix of professional scientists, along with retired, semi-retired and amateur scientists, engineers and technicians, and a number of entrepreneurs, inventors, and interested lay people.\"\n\nThe conference proceedings have been said to be worth preserving because they \"reflect evolution of a unique scientific controversy,\" as \"[cold fusion] will be part of the history of physics, no matter what conclusions are reached about the validity of its claims.\"\n\nAs of 2004, the conference proceedings from 1990 to 2003 were said to be unavailable in most research libraries, \"probably because [cold fusion research] is not recognized as scientific.\" No library could be located that had the proceedings for all ten conferences, although \"many university libraries [had] proceedings for one or a few of the conferences.\"\n\n\n"}

It is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental in central Veracruz, Mexico, where it is known from between Cofre de Perote and Cerro Volcancillo, a satellite peak of Cofre de Perote. Despite thorough surveys, it has not been observed for a long period and is feared extinct. Its demise is attributed to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nThe specific name \"naucampatepetl\" is Nahuatl name for Cofre de Perote.\n\nAdult males measure and females up to in snout–vent length (SVL). The tail is slender and shorter than SVL; it tapers gradually but has a blunt tip. The body is moderately robust. The head is prominent and the eyes are large and relatively protuberant. The snout is large and broadly rounded. The limbs are long and robust. The digits are well developed, and there is no appreciable webbing. The coloration is striking, with solid black background color and with bright pink to pinkish-cream dorsal spots: there is a pair of rounded spots on the back of the head, about the size of the eyeball in diameter, a small mid-dorsal spot in the neck, and a pair of large spots at the level of the forelimbs. These larger spots are followed by 11 pairs of small spots. Finally,there is a conspicuous U-shaped mark behind the hips, pointing backward. The venter is pale gray to dark gray.\n\nIts natural habitat is pine-oak forest at elevations of above sea level, with plenty of bunch grass. All specimens in the type series were found on roadside banks, under a surface layer of moist soil with a somewhat dry outer crust.\n\nThis species is known from only six specimens. As of 2016, more than 30 years had passed since it was last seen, despite several surveys, the latest one in 2014. Extensive logging, farming, and expanding human settlements have led to loss of much of the original habitat, and what remains is very degraded.

Capers (April 16, 1834 – December 2, 1877) was an American physician, best known for his 1874 spurious case report of bullet-mediated impregnation of a young woman.\n\nLegrand Guerry Capers, Jr. was born on April 16, 1834 in Charleston, South Carolina, as the son of the merchant LeGrand G. Capers (1808–1868) and his first wife, Abigail Swift (1810–1846). LeGrand G. Capers, Sr. served on Gen. Worth's staff during the Mexican–American War.\n\nLeGrand G. Capers, Jr. studied medicine as the assistant to his brother-in-law, Ebenezer Swift, and graduated from Jefferson Medical College. Later he practised as ship physician on Vanderbilt's steamers.\n\nWhen the American Civil War broke out, Capers participated in the foundation of the Confederate Medical Department in Alabama. On July 19, 1861 he became assistant surgeon in the 4th Georgia Volunteer Infantry. On October 30, 1863 he was promoted to chief surgeon in Cutshaw's battalion.\n\nAfter armistice, Capers moved to New Orleans and became demonstrator of anatomy in New Orleans School of Medicine. He fell ill in October 1877 and died shortly after from tuberculosis on December 2. He is buried in Vicksburg. Obituaries appeared in the \"Transactions of the Mississippi State Medical Association\" and \"American Medical Weekly\".\n\nThe infamous case of \"bullet pregnancy\" was published in 1874 in The American Medical Weekly. Capers claimed that he witnessed this case eleven years before, while serving in the Confederate army:\nOn the 12th day of May, 1863, the battle of R. was fought. [...] Our men were fighting nobly, but pressed by superior numbers, had gradually fallen back to within one hundred and fifty yards of the house. My position being near my regiment, suddenly I beheld a noble, gallant young friend staggering closer, and then fall to the earth. In the same moment a piercing scream from the house reached my ear! I was soon by the side of the young man, and, upon examination, found a compound fracture, with extensive comminution of the left tibia; the ball having ricochetted from these parts, and, in its onward flight, passed through the scrotum, carrying away the left testicle. Scarcely had I finished dressing the wounds of this poor fellow, when the estimable matron came running to me in the greatest distress, begging me to go to one of her daughters, who, she informed me, had been badly wounded a few minutes before. Hastening to the house, I found that the eldest of the young ladies had indeed received a most serious wound. A minnie ball had penetrated the left abdominal parietes, about midway between the umbilicus and anterior spinal process of the ilium, and was lost in the abdominal cavity, leaving a ragged wound behind. Believing there was little or no hope of her recovery, I had only time to prescribe an anodyne, when our army fell back, leaving both field and village in the hands of the enemy. [...] About six months after her recovery, the movements of our army brought me again to the village of R., and I was again sent for to see the young lady. She appeared in excellent health and spirits, but her abdomen had become enormously enlarged, so much so as to resemble pregnancy at the seventh or eighth month. Indeed, had I not known the family and the facts of the abdominal wound, I should have so pronounced the case. Under the above circumstances, I failed to give a positive diagnosis, determining to keep the case under surveillance. [...] Just two hundred and seventy-eight days from the date of the receipt of the wound by the minnie ball, I delivered this same young lady of a fine boy, weighing eight pounds. [...] About three weeks from the date of this remarkable birth, I was called to see the child, the grandmother insisting there was \"something wrong about the genitals.\" Examination revealed an enlarged, swollen, sensitive scrotum, containing on the right side a hard, roughened substance, evidently foreign. I decided upon operating for its removal at once, and in so doing, extracted from the scrotum a minnie ball, mashed and battered as if it had met in its flight some hard, unyielding substance.\nAn editor's note in a subsequent issue of the journal revealed the case to be a joke:\nDR. L.G. CAPERS, of Vicksburg, Miss., disclaims responsibility for the truth of that remarkable case of impregnation by a minnie ball, as reported in No. 19 of this Journal. He tells the story as it was told to him. He does not say it is untrue, but is disposed to appositely remember the truth of the old adage, that \"accidents may happen in the best regulated families.\" The joke is, that the Doctor reported the case without any signature, but as the editor is indisposed to be made the victim of canards, and recognized the writing sent, he was unwilling to deprive the author of the contemplated fun, and allowed him to enjoy even more of this than was anticipated. The readers have enjoyed the story much, but not enough \"to cut capers\" after reading it.\n"}

It includes species from all 50 states.\n\nThe birds of the continental United States most closely resemble those of Eurasia, which was connected to the continent as part of the supercontinent Laurasia until around 60 million years ago. Many groups occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere and worldwide. However some groups unique to the New World have also arisen; those represented in this list are the hummingbirds, the New World vultures, the New World quail, the tyrant flycatchers, the vireos, the mimids, the New World warblers, the tanagers, the cardinals, and the icterids.\n\nSeveral common birds in the United States, such as the house sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European starling, and the mute swan are introduced species, meaning that they are not native to this continent but were brought here by humans. Introduced species are marked on this list as (I). In addition, many non-native species which have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America are not on this list. This is especially true of birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches.\n\nThe status of one bird on this list, the ivory-billed woodpecker, is controversial. Until 2005 this bird was widely considered to be extinct. In April of that year it was reported that at least one adult male bird had been sighted in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas. This report, however, has not been universally accepted and the American Birding Association still lists the ivory-billed woodpecker as extinct.\n\nThis list is derived from the \"Check-list of North American Birds\", 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). The list's geographic territory is the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and the adjacent islands under the jurisdiction of those states. It does not include the United States' other Pacific Ocean and Caribbean territories or possessions.\n\nThe taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) used in this list are those of the AOS, the recognized scientific authority on the taxonomy and nomenclature of North American birds. The AOS's Committee on Classification and Nomenclature, the body responsible for maintaining and updating the \"Check-list\", \"strongly and unanimously continues to endorse the biological species concept (BSC), in which species are considered to be genetically cohesive groups of populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups\".\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the species listed here are considered to occur regularly in the United States as permanent residents, summer or winter residents or visitors, or annual migrants. The following tags are used to designate some species:\n\n\nThe (A) and (C) tags correspond to the codes 5 and 4 respectively of the American Birding Association. The (E), (Ex), and (I) tags describe species' status according to the AOS. The (EH) tags follow the AOS list and the (EM) tags are based on the Clements taxonomy.\n\nThis list contains 1114 species. Of them, 140 are tagged as accidental, 101 as casual, and 57 as introduced. Thirty-three are known to be extinct and one, the thick-billed parrot, has been extirpated though a population remains in Mexico. Thirty-three living species are endemic to Hawaii; an additional 28 former Hawaiian endemics are known to be extinct and a few others are thought to be. Fifteen species are endemic to the 48 contiguous states.\n\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae\n\nAnatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.\n\n\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Cracidae\n\nThe chachalacas, guans, and curassows are birds in the family Cracidae. These are large birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas are found in more open scrubby habitats. They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colorful facial ornaments.\n\n\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Numididae\n\n\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae\n\nThe New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits.\n\n\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae\n\nPhasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans.\n\n\nOrder: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae\n\nFlamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.\n\n\nOrder: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae\n\nGrebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.\n\n\nOrder: PteroclidiformesFamily: Pteroclididae\n\nSandgrouse have small pigeon-like heads and necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and sometimes tails and a fast direct flight. Their legs are feathered down to the toes.\n\n\nOrder: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae\n\nPigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. They feed on seeds, fruit, and plants. Unlike most other birds, the doves and pigeons produce \"crop milk,\" which is secreted by a sloughing of fluid-filled cells from the lining of the crop. Both sexes produce this highly nutritious substance to feed to the young.\n\n\nOrder: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae\n\nThe family Cuculidae includes cuckoos, roadrunners, and anis. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs.\n\n\nOrder: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae\n\nNightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves.\n\n\nOrder: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae\n\nThe swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.\n\n\nOrder: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae\n\nHummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards.\n\n\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae\n\nRallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.\n\n\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Heliornithidae\n\nFinfoots resemble rails; they have long necks, slender bodies, broad tails, and sharp, pointed bills. Their legs and feet are brightly colored. The family has three species and only the sungrebe is found in the New World.\n\n\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Aramidae\n\nThe limpkin is an odd bird that looks like a large rail, but is skeletally closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes with some trees or scrub in the Caribbean, South America, and southern Florida.\n\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae\n\nCranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or \"dances\".\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Burhinidae\n\nThe thick-knees are a group of waders found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia.

They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short thick necks, and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Jacanidae\n\nThe jacanas are a family of waders found worldwide within the tropical zone. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae\n\nScolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Glareolidae\n\nThe pratincoles have short legs, very long pointed wings, and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding. Their flight is fast and graceful like that of a swallow or a tern, with many twists and turns to pursue their prey.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae\n\nSkuas are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the upper mandible.

Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. \n\n\nOrder: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae\n\nTropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their long wings have black markings, as does the head.\n\n\nOrder: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae\n\nLoons are aquatic birds, the size of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but are almost hopeless on land, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body.\n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae\n\nThe albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses of the genus \"Diomedea\" have the largest wingspans of any extant birds.\n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae\n\nThe storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, these three species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae.\n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae\n\nThough the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family.\n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae\n\nThe procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \"true petrels\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.\n\n\nOrder: CiconiiformesFamily: Ciconiidae\n\nStorks are large, heavy, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long stout bills and wide wingspans. They lack the powder down that other wading birds such as herons, spoonbills, and ibises use to clean off fish slime. Storks lack a pharynx and are mute.\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae\n\nFrigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black-and-white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.\n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae\n\nThe sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.\n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae\n\nCormorants are medium-to-large aquatic birds, usually with mainly dark plumage and areas of colored skin on the face.

They have long, broad wings. Their bodies tend to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved in the case of the ibises, straight and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills.\n\n\nOrder: CathartiformesFamily: Cathartidae\n\nThe New World vultures are not closely related to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. However, unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a good sense of smell with which they locate carcasses.\n\n\nOrder: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae\n\nPandionidae is a monotypic family of fish-eating birds of prey.

They feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons do not migrate. Trogons have soft, often colorful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. They nest in holes in trees or termite nests, laying white or pastel-colored eggs.\n\n\nOrder: UpupiformesFamily: Upupidae\n\nHoopoes spend much time on the ground hunting insects and worms. This black, white, and pink bird is quite unmistakable, especially in its erratic flight, which is like that of a giant butterfly. The crest is erectile, but is mostly kept closed. It walks on the ground like a starling. The song is a trisyllabic \"oop-oop-oop\", which gives rise to its English and scientific names.\n\n\nOrder: CoraciiformesFamily: Alcedinidae\n\nKingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails.\n\n\nOrder: PiciformesFamily: Picidae\n\nWoodpeckers are small to medium-sized birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails, and long tongues used for capturing insects.

Corvids are above average in size among the Passeriformes, and some of the larger species show high levels of intelligence.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Monarchidae\n\nThe Monarchinae are a relatively recent grouping of a number of seemingly very different birds, mostly from the Southern Hemisphere, which are more closely related than they at first appear. Many of the approximately 140 species making up the family were previously assigned to other groups, largely on the basis of general morphology or behavior. With the new insights generated by the DNA-DNA hybridisation studies of Sibley and his co-workers toward the end of the 20th century, however, it became clear that these apparently unrelated birds were all descended from a common ancestor. The Monarchinae are small to medium-sized insectivorous passerines, many of which hunt by flycatching. These three species endemic to Hawaii represent the group.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Alaudidae\n\nLarks are small terrestrial birds with often extravagant songs and display flights.

{"id": "279624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=279624", "title": "Magnetic flux quantum", "text": "Magnetic flux quantum\n\nThe magnetic flux, represented by the symbol , threading some contour or loop is defined as the magnetic field multiplied by the loop area , i.e. . Both and can be arbitrary and so is . However, if one deals with the superconducting loop or a hole in a bulk superconductor, it turns out that the magnetic flux threading such a hole/loop is quantized.\nThe (superconducting) magnetic flux quantum is a combination of fundamental physical constants: the Planck constant and the electron charge . Its value is, therefore, the same for any superconductor.\nThe phenomenon of flux quantization was discovered experimentally by B. S. Deaver and W. M. Fairbank and, independently, by R. Doll and M. Näbauer, in 1961. The quantization of magnetic flux is closely related to the Little–Parks effect, but was predicted earlier by Fritz London in 1948 using a phenomenological model.\n\nThe inverse of the flux quantum, , is called the Josephson constant, and is denoted . It is the constant of proportionality of the Josephson effect, relating the potential difference across a Josephson junction to the frequency of the irradiation. The Josephson effect is very widely used to provide a standard for high-precision measurements of potential difference, which (since 1990) have been related to a fixed, conventional value of the Josephson constant, denoted .\n\nThe superconducting properties in each point of the superconductor are described by the \"complex\" quantum mechanical wave function — the superconducting order parameter. As any complex function can be written as , where is the amplitude and is the phase. Changing the phase by will not change and, correspondingly, will not change any physical properties. However, in the superconductor of non-trivial topology, e.g. superconductor with the hole or superconducting loop/cylinder, the phase may continuously change from some value to the value as one goes around the hole/loop and comes to the same starting point. If this is so, then one has magnetic flux quanta trapped in the hole/loop.\n\nDue to Meissner effect, the magnetic induction inside the superconductor is zero. More exactly, magnetic field penetrates into a superconductor over a small distance called London's magnetic field penetration depth (denoted and usually ). The screening currents also flow in this -layer near the surface, creating magnetization inside the superconductor, which perfectly compensates the applied field , thus resulting in inside the superconductor.\n\nIt is important to note that the magnetic flux frozen in a loop/hole (plus its -layer) will always be quantized. However, the value of the flux quantum is equal to only when the path/trajectory around the hole described above can be chosen so that it lays in the superconducting region without screening currents, i.e. several away from the surface. There are geometries where this condition cannot be satisfied, e.g. a loop made of very thin () superconducting wire or the cylinder with the similar wall thickness. In the latter case, the flux has a quantum different from .\n\nThe flux quantization is a key idea behind a SQUID, which is one of the most sensitive magnetometers available.\n\nFlux quantization also plays an important role in the physics of type II superconductors. When such a superconductor (now without any holes) is placed in a magnetic field with the strength between the first critical field and the second critical field , the field partially penetrates into the superconductor in a form of Abrikosov vortices. The Abrikosov vortex consists of a normal core—a cylinder of the normal (non-superconducting) phase with a diameter on the order of the , the superconducting coherence length. The normal core plays a role of a hole in the superconducting phase. The magnetic field lines pass along this normal core through the whole sample. The screening currents circulate in the -vicinity of the core and screen the rest of the superconductor from the magnetic field in the core. In total, each such Abrikosov vortex carries one quantum of magnetic flux . Although theoretically, it is possible to have more than one flux quantum per hole, the Abrikosov vortices with are unstable and split into several vortices with . In a real hole the states with are stable as the real hole cannot split itself into several smaller holes.\n\nThe magnetic flux quantum may be measured with great precision by exploiting the Josephson effect. When coupled with the measurement of the von Klitzing constant , this provides the most precise values of Planck's constant obtained to date. This is remarkable since is generally associated with the behavior of microscopically small systems, whereas the quantization of magnetic flux in a superconductor and the quantum Hall effect are both collective phenomena associated with thermodynamically large numbers of particles.\n\n"}

They focus on the areas of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as ensuring quality services and prevention of risks to the patients, and members of the public in general. A medical physicist plays a fundamental role in applying physics to medicine, but particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The scientific and technological progress in medical physics has led to a variety of skills that must be integrated into the role of a medical physicist in order for them to perform their job. The \"medical services\" provided to patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic treatments must, therefore, be the result of different but complementary skills.\n\nThe Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM) is the professional body that oversees the education and certification of medical physicists in Australia and New Zealand and has a mission to advance services and professional standards in medical physics and biomedical engineering.\n\nThe presence of Medical Physicists at Expert level ('Medical Physics Experts') in healthcare in Europe is required by EC Directive 2013/59/EURATOM. The European Federation of Organizations for Medical Physics (EFOMP) has defined a detailed inventory of learning outcomes for Medical Physics Experts in terms of Knowledge, Skills and Competences (the latter in Europe means 'responsibilities'). In Europe the professional preparation for Medical Physicists consists of a first degree in Physics or equivalent (e.g., biophysics, electrical or mechanical engineering), a Masters in Medical Physics and a 2-year training Residency. For the latest EFOMP policy statement on the role and education and training requirements of the Medical Physicist and Medical Physics Expert go to. For the final version of the EC funded document 'European Guidelines on the Medical Physics Expert' download Report 174 and its annexes from.\n\nFrom October 2011 as part of the Modernising Scientific Careers scheme, the route to accreditation as a medical physicist in England and Wales is provided by the Scientist Training Programme (STP). This scheme is a three-year graduate program provided by the National School of Healthcare Science. Entrants are required to have an undergraduate degree (1:1 or 2:1) in an appropriate physical science prior to this three-year graduate program.\n\nThe STP involves a part-time MSc in Medical Physics (provided by either King's College London, University of Liverpool or University of Newcastle) in addition to practical training within the National Health Service. Assessment is provided by the completion of competencies and by a final assessment similar to the OSCE undertaken by other clinical staff. Completion of the STP leads to accreditation with the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) and registration as a Clinical Scientist.\n\nPrior to 2011 the training route in the United Kingdom was administered in two parts, and this scheme is still used in Scotland and Northern Ireland). Part I involved limited clinical experience and a full-time MSc in medical physics. Part II involved exclusively clinical experience in which the candidate would produce a portfolio of experience and submitted to the Academy for Healthcare Science which (in addition to a viva) would lead to professional accreditation with IPEM.\n\nIn North America, medical physics training is offered at the master's, doctorate, post-doctorate and/or residency levels. A professional doctorate has also been recently introduced as an option. Several universities offer these degrees in Canada and the United States as well.\n\nAs of October 2013, over 70 universities in North America have medical physics graduate programs or residencies that are accredited by \"The Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs\" (CAMPEP). The majority of residencies are therapy, but diagnostic and nuclear have also been on the rise in the past several years.\n\nIn the United States, professional certification is obtained from the American Board of Radiology (for all 4 areas) the American Board of Medical Physics (for MRI), the American Board of Science in Nuclear Medicine (for Nuc Med and PET). As of 2012, enrollment in a CAMPEP-accredited residency or graduate program is required to start the ABR certification process. As of 2013, completion of a CAMPEP-accredited residency is required to advance to part 2 of the ABR certification process.\n\nIn Canada, professional certification is obtained from the Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine. Since 2016, eligibility requirements for Radiation Oncology Physics certification includes graduation and post-graduate training from a CAMPEP accredited institution.\n\nThere are regular regional and international educational medical physics activities. The oldest of these is the International College on Medical Physics at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, Italy. This College has educated more than 1000 medical physicists from developing countries.\n\n\n"}

The six Inuit were studied by staff of the American Museum of Natural History, which had custody. The adults and one child died soon of tuberculosis (TB), and one young man was returned to Greenland. After deceiving Minik by a staged burial, the museum put the skeleton of his father on exhibit. Adopted by the museum's building superintendent, William Wallace, Minik did not return to Greenland until after 1910. A few years later, he came back to the United States, where he lived and worked until dying of influenza in the 1918 pandemic.\n\nMinik spent his early childhood in northern Greenland among his people, the Inughuit, the northernmost band of Greenlandic Inuit (Eskimos, as formerly called). He met Robert Peary when the explorer employed men of Minik's band during several Arctic expeditions.\n\nIn 1897, Robert Peary brought Qisuk, his son Minik, and four other members of the Northern Greenland band to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Although Peary had invited the adults on the trip, it is unlikely they were clearly informed as to its purpose. Some agreed to travel to see new places; others did not want to be parted from relatives. Peary had promised that they would be able to return to Greenland. Soon after their arrival, the group became the objects of study, together with the Cape York meteorite which Peary had brought. The museum staff had not made plans for their care, nor for their return.\n\nThe adult Inuit soon contracted tuberculosis (TB), a widespread infectious disease in those years, which also occurred among indigenous peoples. Three adults and one child died. (Another young adult, the sixth member of the group, survived and was returned to Greenland.) One of the first to die was Minik's father, and the boy suffered. William Wallace, chief curator and superintendent of buildings, adopted the boy and cared for him. Minik pleaded for a proper burial for his father, with the traditional rites which only he as an Inuk could give. The curatorial staff wanted to preserve Qisuk's body for study, research that would be impossible if his remains were buried. They staged a fake burial for Minik's benefit: filling a coffin with stones for weight, and placing a stuffed \"body\" covered with a cloth on top. They performed the burial by lantern light, with Minik attending.\n\nThe staff sent Qisuk's body to Wallace's estate, which had a workshop for processing the skeletons of specimens. Qisuk's remains were de-fleshed, and the skeleton was mounted on an armature and returned to the museum for display. Wallace did not tell Minik about this nor of his own part in it. But, about 1906, New York papers published a story that stated Qisuk's skeleton was displayed in the museum. Minik learned through classmates' comments as the story circulated.\n\nWallace supported Minik in requesting that Qisuk's remains be returned to the son for traditional burial. The museum director, Hermon Carey Bumpus, evaded their requests, as well as other questions about the Inuit exhibits. Bumpus refused to admit the museum had Qisuk's skeleton. In the past, he had accused Wallace of financial irregularities and impropriety, and the curator resigned in 1901. Wallace continued to ask the museum for aid in financially supporting Minik, which Bumpus refused. The director tried to avoid investigation of the Inuit case. Minik was never able to reclaim his father's bones.\n\nMinik tried to get Peary to return him to Greenland, and finally Peary and his supporters made the arrangements. Although they told the press they had sent Minik back \"laden with gifts\", the Canadian author Kenn Harper found documentation that the Inuit was returned to Greenland with little more than \"the clothes on his back.\"\n\nBy that time, Minik had forgotten Inuktun, his first language, and much of Inuit culture and skills; his life in Greenland was difficult. The Inuit took him back, and taught him the adult skills he needed. He became a fine hunter. He acted as a guide and translator for visitors, playing a key role in the Crocker Land Expedition of 1913-1917. At that time, Minik decided to return to the United States, and did so in 1916.\n\nAfter his return to the US, Minik worked at a variety of jobs; eventually he found work in a lumber camp in North Stratford, New Hampshire. His employer, Afton Hall, invited him to live with the Hall family, who treated him much like a son. Along with many of Hall's family and workers, Minik died during the 1918 flu pandemic, on 29 October 1918. He was buried in the Indian Stream Cemetery in Pittsburg, New Hampshire.\n\nIn 1986, Kenn Harper wrote a book about Minik, entitled \"Give Me My Father's Body\". Convinced that the remains of Qisuk and the three adult Inuit should be returned to Greenland, Harper tried to persuade the Museum of Natural History to do this, as well as working through the \"red tape\" of the US and Canadian governments. In 1993, Harper succeeded in having the Inuit remains returned. In Qaanaaq, he witnessed the Inuit funeral ceremony for the remains of Qisuk and the three tribesmen taken to New York so long ago.\n\n\n\n\n"}

One example is PANiCNQ, which is a combination of emeraldine-based polyaniline (PANi) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). When it was created by Pakistan born scientist Naveed A. Zaidi and colleagues at the University of Durham in 2004, it was the first magnetic polymer to function at room temperature.\n\nPANi is a conductive polymer that is stable in air. When combined with the free radical-forming TCNQ as an acceptor molecule, it can mimic the mechanism of metallic magnets. The magnetic properties arise from the fully pi-conjugated nitrogen-containing backbone combined with molecular charge transfer side groups. These properties cause the molecule to have a high density of localized spins that can give rise to coupling of their magnetic fields. When this polymer magnet is synthesized, the polymer chains need 3 months to line up before displaying any notable magnetism.\n\nPlastic magnets could have uses in computer hardware, for example as disc drives and in medical devices such as pacemakers and cochlear implants where the organic material is more likely to be biocompatible than its metallic counterpart.\n\nIn February 2002, researchers from Ohio State University & University of Utah developed the world's first light-tunable plastic magnet.\nThe plastic material became 1.5 times more magnetic when blue light shines on it. Green laser light reversed the effect somewhat, by decreasing the material's magnetism to 60 percent of its normal level. The plastic magnet was made from a polymer made of tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) combined with manganese (Mn) ions -- atoms of the metal manganese with electrons removed. The magnet functioned up to a temperature of 75 K (about -200ºC, or -325ºF).\n\n"}

The book strongly criticizes string theory and its prominence in contemporary theoretical physics, on the grounds that string theory has yet to come up with a single prediction that can be verified using any technology that is likely to be feasible within our lifetimes. Smolin also focuses on the difficulties faced by research in quantum gravity, and by current efforts to come up with a theory explaining all four fundamental interactions. The book is broadly concerned with the role of controversy and diversity of approaches in scientific processes and ethics.\n\nSmolin suggests both that there appear to be serious deficiencies in string theory and that string theory has an unhealthy near-monopoly on fundamental physics in the United States, and that a diversity of approaches is needed. He argues that more attention should instead be paid to background independent theories of quantum gravity.\n\nIn the book, Smolin controversially claims that string theory makes no new testable predictions; that it has no coherent mathematical formulation; and that it has not been mathematically proved finite. Some experts in the theoretical physics community disagree with these statements.\n\nSmolin states that to propose a string theory landscape having up to 10 string vacuum solutions is tantamount to abandoning accepted science:\n\nThe scenario of many unobserved universes plays the same logical role as the scenario of an intelligent designer. Each provides an untestable hypothesis that, if true, makes something improbable seem quite probable.\n\nThe book generated much controversy and debate about the merits of string theory, and was criticised by some prominent physicists including Sean Carroll and string theorists Joseph Polchinski and Luboš Motl. \n\nPolchinski's review states, \"In the end, these [Smolin and others'] books fail to capture much of the spirit and logic of string theory.\"\n\nMotl's review goes on to say \"the concentration of irrational statements and anti-scientific sentiments has exceeded my expectations,\" and,\n\nIn the context of string theory, he literally floods the pages of his book with undefendable speculations about some basic results of string theory. Because these statements are of mathematical nature, we are sure that Lee is wrong even in the absence of any experiments.\n\nSean Carroll's review expressed frustration because in his opinion, \"\"The Trouble with Physics\" is really two books, with intertwined but ultimately independent arguments.\" He suggested that the arguments in the book appear divided:\"[one argument is] big and abstract and likely to be ignored by most of the book's audience; the other is narrow and specific and part of a wide-ranging and heated discussion carried out between scientists, in the popular press, and on the internet.\"\n\nFurthermore,\n\nThe abstract argument — about academic culture and the need to nurture speculative ideas — is, in my opinion, important and largely correct, while the specific one — about the best way to set about quantizing gravity — is overstated and undersupported.\n\nCarroll fears that excessive attention paid to the specific dispute is likely to disadvantage the more general abstract argument.\n\nSabine Hossenfelder, in a review written a year later and titled \"The Trouble With Physics: Aftermath\" alludes to the book's polarising effect on the scientific community. She explores the author's views as a contrast in generations, while supporting his right to them. Hossenfelder believes that Smolin's book attempts to restore the relation physics once had with philosophy, quoting him as follows:\n\nPhilosophy used to be part of the natural sciences – for a long time. For long centuries during which our understanding of the world we live in has progressed tremendously. There is no doubt that times change, but not all changes are a priori good if left without further consideration. Here, change has resulted in a gap between the natural sciences where questioning the basis of our theories, and an embedding into the historical and sociological context used to be. Even though many new specifically designed interdisciplinary fields have been established, investigating the foundations of our current theories has basically been erased out of curricula and textbooks.\n\nA discussion in 2006 took place between UCSB physicists at KITP and science journalist George Johnson regarding the controversy caused by Smolin's and Peter Woit's books. The meeting was titled \"The String Wars\" to reflect the impression the media has given people regarding the controversy in string theory caused by Smolin's and Woit's books. A video of the proceedings is available at UCSB's website.\n\n\n\n"}

TTOs engage in a variety of commercial activities that are meant to facilitate the process of bringing research developments to market, often acting as a channel between academia and industry. Most major research universities have established TTOs in the past decades in an effort to increase the impact of university research and provide opportunities for financial gain. While TTOs are commonplace, many studies have questioned their financial benefit to the university.\n\nThe history of technology transfer is intimately linked with the history of the science policy of the United States. The foundation for modern American science policy laid way out in Vannevar Bush's letter in response to President Roosevelt's query about whether the US should maintain the high level of research funding it had been pouring into the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which had coordinated large private-public partnership research projects as part of the war effort, including the Manhattan Project. Bush's answer was \"Science - the Endless Frontier\". In that letter, Bush advocated that the US should continue to fund basic research at high levels, arguing that while the US no longer had a geographic frontier, extending the boundaries of science would allow the creation of new technologies, which in turn would spur new industries, create jobs, generate wealth, and maintain US power. As the US worked out its approach to funding science in the 1950s, Congress decided that the federal government should maintain ownership of patents on inventions funded by the federal government.\n\nFederal research funding drove the growth of the research university. Many universities in the early 20th century did not engage in patenting and licensing, since the government owned most inventions, and out of fear of interfering with their missions of supporting the growth of knowledge and objective inquiry. Prior to the postwar period, universities relied mostly on external patent management organizations such as the Research Corporation, while few set up their own research foundations that were independent from but affiliated to the university. Some universities, such as Stanford University and the University of Wisconsin, had active licensing programs of their own. There was a shift in universities' approaches to technology transfer between 1970-1980. During this period, universities began taking commercialization efforts into their own hands and setting up TTOs.\n\nThe Bayh–Dole Act of 1980 led many US universities to set up tech transfer offices. The Act was created to try to spur the stagnant US economy of the 1970s, harking back to Vannevar Bush's vision of the role of federal research funding in the US economy. The Act decentralized ownership of inventions funded with federal grants, allowing universities that received federal grant funding to maintain ownership of such inventions, obligating them to try to patent and license the inventions to US companies, and requiring universities to share license income with inventors.\n\nWhile the broad goal of TTOs is to commercialize university research, they engage in numerous activities that not only bring these developments to market but also encourage and support faculty and students in the entire technology transfer process. Such encouragement may increase the chances of faculty and students creating research developments that can be commercialized. Some of the major functions of TTOs include:\n\nAn important task of many TTOs is to create and maintain industry partnerships that may be crucial for collaboration and bringing technologies to market. Some universities such as MIT and Northwestern have separate offices for industry and corporate relations which typically work in conjunction with the TTO of the institution. In this case, TTOs often exploit the relationships developed by the corporate relations office, focusing more specifically on the technology transfer process itself. TTOs often employ two methods when engaging with industry partners: 1) the \"pull\" method, in which TTOs \"receive\" interest from industry partners in bringing specific technologies at the university to market, and 2) the \"push\" method, in which TTOs actively \"seek\" industry partners for this purpose.\n\nThe Bayh-Dole Act obligated universities to seek patent protection, when appropriate, for inventions to which they elect title; after passage of the Bayh-Dole Act many US universities created intellectual property policies that obligated faculty to assign inventions to the university. Universities typically license the patent to a company that will invest money in developing the invention into a product, which it will then be able to sell at a premium, recouping its investment and making profit before the patent expires.\n\nTTOs at many universities often provide general business and legal counseling to foster entrepreneurship among faculty and students. By providing resources, funding, and connections to university spin-off companies, TTOs attempt to increase the chances of startup success, which may result in financial gain if the university owns the intellectual property of the invention or has an equity stake in the company. Hence, many TTOs establish business incubators and programs for faculty and students in an attempt to enhance the entrepreneurial atmosphere among researchers at the university. Some examples of such incubators and programs include the Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator as well as the Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator at Harvard University, and Fab Lab MSI, affiliated with the University of Chicago. Research has suggested that incubators at TTOs have not had a high incidence of technology transfer, despite this being one of the reasons they were established, and may even negatively impact the success of TTOs and technology transfer at the university.\n\nThe structure and organization of TTOs can affect its overall performance and can vary among universities. Since TTOs deal with both academic research and industry, they consist of a diverse set of individuals, including scientists, lawyers, analysts, licensing experts, and business managers. By having individuals (particularly different scientists, engineers, and analysts) with varying sets of expertise in research, TTOs attempt to more effectively assess, protect, and profit from the research developments taking place in multiple disciplines throughout the university.\n\nTTOs can by classified into three different types: \nAs of 2012 the \"internal\" type was most common in the US.\n\nTTOs attempt to capitalize on the research developments made at the university by employing strategies focused on providing the university with opportunities for financial gain and increased research impact. A common strategy that TTOs engage in is licensing their inventions, either to an industry partner or back to the university inventor if the inventor started a company (i.e. a university spin-off). Through this approach, TTOs can bring university technologies to market without having to engage in production and distribution themselves. TTOs can also take an equity stake in the spin-off company rather than licensing the technology. Some research has suggested that equity in spin-off companies may provide higher returns than licensing, but this strategy seems to be more common with TTOs that are financially independent from the parent university (i.e. external TTO structure). While these strategies vary greatly among TTOs at different universities, a majority of them employ some combination of licensing and equity stakes, with licensing being a more standard practice.\n\nAs many major research universities across the US began to adopt TTOs, institutions outside the US became attracted to the idea of taking control of their commercialization activities as well. Prior to the 2000s, many German-speaking and Scandinavian countries had a policy of \"professor's privilege\", in which faculty retain the right to control the intellectual property of their inventions. In addition, in recent years many OECD and EU nations have created legislation that emulates Bayh-Dole, in an attempt to increase the commercialization activities and impact of their respective research universities. Denmark was among the first to abolish professor's privilege, followed by Germany, Austria, Norway and Finland between 2000-2007. Countries such as France and the UK, which already had policies in place that grant intellectual property rights to universities during this period, began heavily encouraging and enforcing these institutional ownership rights. As of 2011, most European countries grant universities the rights to the intellectual property of inventions developed by faculty researchers, yet a few countries such as Italy and Sweden still employ professor's privilege. Hence, there has been a marked increase in the commercialization activities of universities and creation of TTOs in Europe.\n\nSeveral Asian countries such as Japan, China, and India have also shifted towards a Bayh-Dole type legislation, although some countries such as Malaysia have a shared ownership model. Moreover, there has been a general shift towards increased commercialization and the establishment of TTOs across higher education institutions in Asian countries. \n\nAlthough universities created TTOs with hopes of financial gain, many TTOs have retained losses in their commercialization activities and have not generated significant local economic development. It has been argued that protecting intellectual property and patenting is a costly process, and of all the patents and licenses a university issues, there may be a limited number of inventions that actually yield enough revenue to cover or surpass these costs. Research has shown that larger, more established TTOs are sufficiently profitable, whereas many smaller, more recent TTOs are not, and that an estimated half of TTOs retain losses in their commercialization activities (of those that do not have losses, a majority do no better than to cover their costs). Even the most profitable TTOs only produce revenue that amounts to 1-3% of the total research expenditures at the university. Moreover, less than 1% of licensed technologies actually yield over $1M in revenue. Another criticism of TTOs is its role in the research atmosphere of the university, with many scholars arguing that its presence and purpose of engaging in commercialization activities conflicts with a university's mission of furthering knowledge and objective academic inquiry.\n\nRebecca Eisenberg and Michael Heller have argued that the Bayh-Dole Act spurred university tech transfer offices to become too aggressive in patenting, creating patent thickets and a tragedy of the anticommons especially in the field of biomedical research. As of 2012, evidence for such an anticommons effect in the practice of biomedical science was lacking.\n"}

He has been researching the music of antiquity and prehistory for more than thirty-five years. Always interested in the music of the Mediterranean, he has gone on journeys to discover the folkloristic Italian and Mediterranean traditions learning the Arabic, African, Oriental, and European music since the beginning of the seventies.\n\nIn 1972 he founded the pioneer world music group Aktuala group, dedicated to folkloristic African and Asian music.\n\nIn the eighties Walter Maioli's researches focused on the field of prehistoric instruments, his work was presented at the Archaeological Symposium of Amsterdam for the opening of the Den Haag Museum. In 1987 he prepared the Natural Art Laboratory of Morimondo in the Ticino Park, working on the Art of the Nature, publishing books on the subject for the Jaca Book: “Origins, sounds and music”, and for Giorgio Mondadori: “Orchestra of the Nature”.\n\nIn 1991 he displayed the collection called “The Origins of Musical Instruments” to the History of Nature Museum in Milan and presented \"Art of the Stars\" sounds for the planetarium, at Ulrico Hoelpi Civic Planetarium in Milan in collaboration with Fiorella Terenzi. Starting in 1994, for one and a half years he was coordinating the musical part of the Archeon Archaeological Theme Park in Alphen aan den Rijn in the Netherlands, producing the CD called \"200.000 years in music\".\n\nIn 1995 he founded Synaulia, a team of musicians, archeologists, paleorganologists, and choreographers dedicated to the application of their historical research to ancient music and dance, in particular to the ancient Etruscan and Roman periods, carrying out an intense activity of conferences, seminars, and concerts in Europe, in particular in the Netherlands and Germany. In Italy, some of his performances were presented on archaeological sites such as Mausoleo di Augusto, Mercati Traianei, Terme di Diocleziano, Ostia Antica, Villa Adriana, Preneste, Pompei and Stabia, with the scope of recreating the sound atmosphere and executive context of the Roman age.
