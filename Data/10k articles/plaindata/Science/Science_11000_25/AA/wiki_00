Béchamp developed the Béchamp reduction, an inexpensive method to produce aniline dye, permitting Perkin to launch the synthetic-dye industry. Béchamp also synthesized the first organic arsenical drug, arsanilic acid, from which Ehrlich later synthesized the first chemotherapeutic drug. Béchamp's rivalry with Pasteur was initially for priority in attributing fermentation to microorganisms, later for attributing the silkworm disease pebrine to microorganisms, and eventually over the validity of germ theory. Béchamp also disputed cell theory.\n\nClaiming discovery that the \"molecular granulations\" in biological fluids were actually the elementary units of life, Béchamp named them \"microzymas\"—that is, \"tiny enzymes\"—and credited them with producing both enzymes and cells while \"evolving\" amid favorable conditions into multicellular organisms. Denying that bacteria could invade a healthy animal and cause disease, Béchamp claimed instead that unfavorable host and environmental conditions destabilize the host's native microzymas, whereupon they decompose host tissue by producing pathogenic bacteria. While cell theory and germ theory gained widespread acceptance, granular theories became obscure. Béchamp's version, \"microzymian theory\", has been retained by small groups, especially in alternative medicine.\n\nBéchamp was born in Bassing, France in 1816, the son of a miller. He lived in Bucharest, Romania from the ages of 7 to 18 with an uncle who worked in the French ambassador's office. He was educated at the University of Strasbourg, receiving a doctor of science degree in 1853 and doctor of medicine in 1856, and ran a pharmacy in the city. In 1854 was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the University of Strasbourg, a post previously held by Louis Pasteur.\n\nIn 1856, after receiving his medical degree, Béchamp took a position at the University of Montpellier, where he remained until 1876 when he was appointed Dean of the Catholic Faculty of Medicine at Université Lille Nord de France. Béchamp's time in Lille was stormy, as his dispute with Pasteur led to efforts to have his work placed on the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" (the index of books prohibited by the Catholic Church). Béchamp retired under this cloud in 1886, briefly ran a pharmacy with his son, and ultimately moved to Paris, where he was given a small laboratory at the Sorbonne. One of his students was Victor Galippe, a physician who studied micro-organisms in plants and their role in human health. He died at the age of 91, his work having faded into scientific obscurity and Pasteur's version of germ theory dominant. A brief obituary in the \"British Medical Journal\" noted that Béchamp's name was \"associated with bygone controversies as to priority which it would be unprofitable to recall.\"\n\nIn the modern day, Béchamp's work continues to be promoted by a small group of alternative medicine proponents (also known as germ theory denialists), including advocates of alternative theories of cancer, who dismiss Pasteur's germ theory and argue that Béchamp's ideas were unjustly ignored. They accuse Pasteur of plagiarising and then suppressing Béchamp's work, citing work such as Ethel Douglas Hume's \"Béchamp or Pasteur: A Lost Chapter in the History of Biology\" from the 1920s.\n\n"}

It focuses on arguing for more research funding, promoting a high-tech and knowledge-based economy, highlighting the need for top-quality science and maths education at all levels, and scrutinising the mechanisms by which government uses science and evidence.\n\nThe Campaign for Science and Engineering was founded as Save British Science (SBS) in January 1986. The organisation started out when 1,500 scientists banded together to pay for an advert in The Times. It called on the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher to 'Save British Science'. The organisation changed its name to the Campaign for Science and Engineering in 2005. \n\nCaSE is based in Gordon Square, in Bloomsbury, London. It receives its funding from over 100 member organisations, which currently include companies such as Astra Zeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Google, and Rolls-Royce; universities such as the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge; learned and professional societies such as the Royal Society of Biology, Institute of Physics and Royal Society of Chemistry; trade unions such as Prospect; and charities including the Wellcome Trust and Cancer Research UK. CaSE also has a large number of individual members. \n\nCaSE employs a team of staff who are led by the Executive Director, currently Dr Sarah Main. It also has a Board of Directors who meet several times each year to discuss CaSE's strategy and set its campaigning priorities, as well as being responsible for governance and financial management of the organisation. Professor Graeme Reid is the current Chair of the Board.\n\nCaSE focuses its activity in three priority areas; Education and Skills, Investment and Evidence in Policymaking, delivering independent analysis and recommendations for action in reports in these areas. Following the 2016 Brexit referendum, it has been a strong voice in the areas of immigration, collaboration and regulation which are of particular concern to the science and engineering sector.\n\nIn 2010, CaSE played a key role in the Science is Vital campaign, which lobbied against cuts to the UK science budget in the Comprehensive Spending Review of October that year. The science budget was frozen in the final review. In 2017 CaSE called for increase in R&D investment and the government subsequently committed to increasing spending to 2.4% of GDP by 2027. Other successes include lobbying for amendments to the HE and Research Bill in 2016.\n\nCaSE holds regular meetings with representatives from its member organisations to inform its work, alongside sustained political engagement. This include meeting directly with MPs and Peers, submitting evidence to Select Committee Inquiries and being invited to speak at conference and panel events. \n\nCaSE also holds an annual lecture which is given by prominent scientific or political figures including Jo Johnson, then Universities and Science Minister, in 2016, Professor Ellen Stofan, then NASA Chief Scientist in 2014, and Professor Anne Glover CBE, then EU Chief Scientific Advisor in 2013.\n\n"}

This is often not the first viewing using the telescope; optical tests will probably have been performed in daylight to adjust the components. The first light image is normally of little scientific interest and is of poor quality, since the various telescope elements are yet to be adjusted for optimum efficiency. Despite this, a first light is always a moment of great excitement, both for the people who design and build the telescope and for the astronomical community, who may have anticipated the moment for many years while the telescope was under construction. A well-known and spectacular astronomical object is usually chosen as a subject.\n\nFor example, the Hale Telescope saw first light January 26, 1949, targeting NGC 2261 under the direction of American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble. The image was published in many magazines and is available on Caltech Archives.\n\nThe Isaac Newton Telescope had two first lights: one in England in 1965 with its original mirror, and another in 1984 at La Palma island. The second first light was done with a video camera that showed the Crab Pulsar flashing.\n\nThe Large Binocular Telescope had its first light with a single primary mirror on October 12, 2005, which was a view of NGC 891. The second primary mirror was installed in January 2006 and became fully operational in January 2008.\n\nThe 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias had a first light image of Tycho 1205081 on 14 July 2007.\n\nThe IRIS solar space observatory achieved first light on July 17, 2013.

However, the photons from decoupling only provided visible light for very few million years, since they were quickly redshifted to infrared and then radio/microwave frequencies, by the expansion of the universe. The first stars were therefore the first occasion when the kind of light now seen, appeared in the universe.\n"}

{"id": "799986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=799986", "title": "Fraunhofer diffraction", "text": "Fraunhofer diffraction\n\nIn optics, the Fraunhofer diffraction equation is used to model the diffraction of waves when the diffraction pattern is viewed at a long distance from the diffracting object, and also when it is viewed at the focal plane of an imaging lens. In contrast, the diffraction pattern created near the object, in the near field region, is given by the Fresnel diffraction equation.\n\nThe equation was named in honor of Joseph von Fraunhofer although he was not actually involved in the development of the theory.\n\nThis article explains where the Fraunhofer equation can be applied, and shows the form of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for various apertures. A detailed mathematical treatment of Fraunhofer diffraction is given in Fraunhofer diffraction equation.\n\nWhen a beam of light is partly blocked by an obstacle, some of the light is scattered around the object, and light and dark bands are often seen at the edge of the shadow – this effect is known as diffraction. These effects can be modelled using the Huygens–Fresnel principle. Huygens postulated that every point on a primary wavefront acts as a source of spherical secondary wavelets and the sum of these secondary wavelets determines the form of the wave at any subsequent time. Fresnel developed an equation using the Huygens wavelets together with the principle of superposition of waves, which models these diffraction effects quite well.\n\nIt is not a straightforward matter to calculate the displacement given by the sum of the secondary wavelets, each of which has its own amplitude and phase, since this involves addition of many waves of varying phase and amplitude. When two waves are added together, the total displacement depends on both the amplitude and the phase of the individual waves: two waves of equal amplitude which are in phase give a displacement whose amplitude is double the individual wave amplitudes, while two waves which are in opposite phases give a zero displacement. Generally, a two-dimensional integral over complex variables has to be solved and in many cases, an analytic solution is not available.\n\nThe Fraunhofer diffraction equation is a simplified version of the Kirchhoff's diffraction formula and it can be used to model the light diffracted when both the light source and the viewing plane are effectively at infinity with respect to the diffracting aperture. In this case, the incident light is a plane wave so that the phase of the light at each point in the aperture is the same. The phase of the contributions of the individual wavelets in the aperture varies linearly with position in the aperture, making the calculation of the sum of the contributions relatively straightforward in many cases.\n\nStrictly speaking, the Fraunhofer approximation only applies when the diffracted pattern is viewed at infinity, but in practice it can be applied in the far field, and also in the focal plane of a positive lens.\n\nWhen the distance between the aperture and the plane in which the pattern is observed is large enough that the difference in the optical path length between the light from the extremes of the aperture is much less than the wavelength, then individual contributions can be treated as though they are parallel. This is often known as the far field and is defined as being located at a distance which is significantly greater than , where is the wavelength and is the largest dimension in the aperture. The Fraunhofer equation can be used to model the diffraction in this case.\n\nFor example, if a 0.5mm diameter circular hole is illuminated by a laser with 0.6μm wavelength, the Fraunhofer diffraction equation can be employed if the viewing distance is greater than 1000mm.\n\nA plane wave incident on a positive lens is focused at a point by the lens; all the 'rays' have the same phase at the point of focus, so that this is equivalent to viewing the plane wave at infinity. Thus, if the diffracted light is focused with a lens, the observed diffraction pattern can be modelled using Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffracted light can be considered to be made up of a set of plane waves of varying orientation. When a lens is located in front of the diffracting aperture, each plane wave is brought to a focus at a different point in the focal plane with the point of focus being proportional to the x- and y-direction cosines, so that the variation in intensity as a function of direction is mapped into a positional variation in intensity. \n\nIn each of these examples, the aperture is illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave at normal incidence.\n\nThe width of the slit is . The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is shown in the image together with a plot of the intensity vs. angle . The pattern has maximum intensity at , and a series of peaks of decreasing intensity. Most of the diffracted light falls between the first minima. The angle, , subtended by these two minima is given by:\n\nThus, the smaller the aperture, the larger the angle subtended by the diffraction bands. The size of the central band at a distance is given by\n\nFor example, when a slit of width 0.5 mm is illuminated by light of wavelength 0.6 µm, and viewed at a distance of 1000 mm, the width of the central band in the diffraction pattern is 2.4 mm.\n\nThe fringes extend to infinity in the direction since the slit and illumination also extend to infinity.\n\nIf , the intensity of the diffracted light does not fall to zero, and if , the diffracted wave is cylindrical.\n\nWe can find the angle at which a first minimum is obtained in the diffracted light by the following reasoning. Consider the light diffracted at an angle where the distance is equal to the wavelength of the illuminating light. The component of the wavelet emitted from the point A which is travelling in the direction is in anti-phase with the wave from the point at middle of the slit, so that the net contribution at the angle from these two waves is zero. The same applies to the points just below and , and so on. Therefore, the amplitude of the total wave travelling in the direction is zero. We have:\n\nThe angle subtended by the first minima on either side of the centre is then, as above:\n\nThere is no such simple argument to enable us to find the maxima of the diffraction pattern.\n\nWe can develop an expression for the far field of a continuous array of point sources of uniform amplitude and of the same phase. Let the array of length \"a\" be parallel to the y axis with its center at the origin as indicated in the figure to the right. Then the differential field is:\n\nformula_5\n\nwhere formula_6. However formula_7and integrating from formula_8to formula_9,\n\nformula_10\n\nwhere formula_11.\n\nIntegrating we then get\n\nformula_12\n\nLetting formula_13where the array length in radformula_14, then,\n\nformula_15\n\nThe form of the diffraction pattern given by a rectangular aperture is shown in the figure on the right (or above, in tablet format). There is a central semi-rectangular peak, with a series of horizontal and vertical fringes. The dimensions of the central band are related to the dimensions of the slit by the same relationship as for a single slit so that the larger dimension in the diffracted image corresponds to the smaller dimension in the slit. The spacing of the fringes is also inversely proportional to the slit dimension.\n\nIf the illuminating beam does not illuminate the whole length of the slit, the spacing of the vertical fringes is determined by the dimensions of the illuminating beam. Close examination of the double-slit diffraction pattern below shows that there are very fine horizontal diffraction fringes above and below the main spot, as well as the more obvious horizontal fringes.\n\nThe diffraction pattern given by a circular aperture is shown in the figure on the right. This is known as the Airy diffraction pattern. It can be seen that most of the light is in the central disk. The angle subtended by this disk, known as the Airy disk, is\n\nwhere is the diameter of the aperture.\n\nThe Airy disk can be an important parameter in limiting the ability of an imaging system to resolve closely located objects.\n\n The diffraction pattern obtained given by an aperture with a Gaussian profile, for example, a photographic slide whose transmissivity has a Gaussian variation is also a Gaussian function. The form of the function is plotted on the right (above, for a tablet), and it can be seen that, unlike the diffraction patterns produced by rectangular or circular apertures, it has no secondary rings. This technique can be used in a process called apodization—the aperture is covered by a Gaussian filter, giving a diffraction pattern with no secondary rings.\n\nThe output profile of a single mode laser beam may have a Gaussian intensity profile and the diffraction equation can be used to show that it maintains that profile however far away it propagates from the source.\n\nIn the double-slit experiment, the two slits are illuminated by a single light beam. If the width of the slits is small enough (less than the wavelength of the light), the slits diffract the light into cylindrical waves. These two cylindrical wavefronts are superimposed, and the amplitude, and therefore the intensity, at any point in the combined wavefronts depends on both the magnitude and the phase of the two wavefronts. These fringes are often known as Young's fringes.\n\nThe angular spacing of the fringes is given by\n\nThe spacing of the fringes at a distance from the slits is given by\n\nwhere is the separation of the slits.\n\nThe fringes in the picture were obtained using the yellow light from a sodium light (wavelength = 589 nm), with slits separated by 0.25 mm, and projected directly onto the image plane of a digital camera.\n\nDouble-slit interference fringes can be observed by cutting two slits in a piece of card, illuminating with a laser pointer, and observing the diffracted light at a distance of 1 m. If the slit separation is 0.5 mm, and the wavelength of the laser is 600 nm, then the spacing of the fringes viewed at a distance of 1 m would be 1.2 mm.\n\nThe difference in phase between the two waves is determined by the difference in the distance travelled by the two waves.\n\nIf the viewing distance is large compared with the separation of the slits (the far field), the phase difference can be found using the geometry shown in the figure. The path difference between two waves travelling at an angle is given by\n\nWhen the two waves are in phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to an integral number of wavelengths, the summed amplitude, and therefore the summed intensity is maximal, and when they are in anti-phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, one and a half wavelengths, etc., then the two waves cancel, and the summed intensity is zero. This effect is known as interference.\n\nThe interference fringe maxima occur at angles\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the light. The angular spacing of the fringes is given by\n\nWhen the distance between the slits and the viewing plane is , the spacing of the fringes is equal to and is the same as above:\n\n A grating is defined in Born and Wolf as \"any arrangement which imposes on an incident wave a periodic variation of amplitude or phase, or both\".\n\nA grating whose elements are separated by diffracts a normally incident beam of light into a set of beams, at angles given by:\n\nThis is known as the grating equation. The finer the grating spacing, the greater the angular separation of the diffracted beams.\n\nIf the light is incident at an angle , the grating equation is:\n\nThe detailed structure of the repeating pattern determines the form of the individual diffracted beams, as well as their relative intensity while the grating spacing always determines the angles of the diffracted beams.\n\nThe image on the right shows a laser beam diffracted by a grating into = 0, and ±1 beams. The angles of the first order beams are about 20°; if we assume the wavelength of the laser beam is 600 nm, we can infer that the grating spacing is about 1.8 μm.\n\n A simple grating consists of a series of slits in a screen. If the light travelling at an angle from each slit has a path difference of one wavelength with respect to the adjacent slit, all these waves will add together, so that the maximum intensity of the diffracted light is obtained when:\n\nThis is the same relationship that is given above.\n\n\n\n"}

Barry Barish founded the GWIC in 1997 and served as the chair from 1997-2003.\n\nThe mission of GWIC is to facilitate international collaboration and cooperation in the construction, operation and use of the major gravitational wave detection facilities worldwide:\n\nGWIC is affiliated with the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) as its Working Group 11 (WG11). In 1999, GWIC was adopted by an earlier IUPAP Working Group, the Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics and Gravitation International Committee (PaNAGIC). PaNAGIC was created to support international exchange of ideas and to support the convergence of the international scientific community with respect to large-scale activities on particle and nuclear astrophysics, gravitation and cosmology. It adopted GWIC as a sub-panel specializing in gravitational waves. PaNAGIC was dissolved by IUPAP in 2011, but the important role of GWIC was recognized and it was promoted to full Working Group status.\n\nGWIC also works with the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation (ISGRG) in some areas. ISGRG is an Affiliated Commission of IUPAP (designated AC2). The main scientific meetings of GWIC (the Amaldi Meeting on Gravitational Waves) and ISGRG (the GRxx series of conferences) were held together in Sydney in 2007 and will be held together again in Warsaw in 2013. The ISGRG also administers the GWIC Thesis Prize funds. The membership of GWIC includes a representative from ISGRG to ensure communication between the two organizations.\n\nThe Edoardo Amaldi Conference series on Gravitational Waves is \ncoordinated by GWIC as the cornerstone conference for the \nGravitational Wave Detection community worldwide. These conferences \nare held every two years, and move around the world to locations \nwhere gravitational wave research is active.\n\nGWIC awards a prize for an outstanding PhD thesis on any aspect of gravitational waves science. First awarded as a biennial award open to LIGO Scientific Collaboration members, it is now an annual award open to the broader gravitational wave science field. A summary article of the research of past winners is found on the 2Physics blog .\n\nIn June 2010, GWIC released a document detailing a strategic roadmap for the gravitational wave astronomy field for the next 30 years . This roadmap sets out recommended priorities for developing current projects and initiating new detectors based on scientific opportunities. The goal of the roadmap is to\n\nIn order to aid funding agencies to see the significance of proposals (either continuing existing projects or initiating new projects), GWIC may issue statements to indicate international support and consensus among the gravitational wave detection field. Statements or letters are issued if GWIC reaches a strong consensus, and \"such statements carry the full backing of the leaders of the projects represented on GWIC .\"\n\nIn 2010, GWIC released statements supporting the expansion of the interferometric detector network through the IndIGO, LIGO-Australia, and LCGT projects.\n\nGWIC members are representatives from all established gravitational wave detector projects. Including ground- and space-based interferometric detectors, resonant mass detectors, spacecraft Doppler tracking and pulsar timing. As of October 2012, the committee consists of 23 members from 15 projects or communities.\n\n"}
{"id": "882333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=882333", "title": "Greatness", "text": "Greatness\n\nHistorically, in Europe, rulers were sometimes given the attribute \"the Great\", as in Alexander the Great, Frederick the Great, and Catherine the Great. Starting with the Roman consul and general Pompey, the Latin equivalent was also used, as in Pompeius Magnus, Albertus Magnus, and Carolus Magnus. The English language uses the Latin term , (literally \"great work\") to describe certain works of art and literature.\n\nSince the publication of Francis Galton's \"Hereditary Genius\" in 1869, and especially with the accelerated development of intelligence tests in the early 1900s, there has been a vast amount of social scientific research published relative to the question of greatness. Much of this research does not actually use the term \"great\" in describing itself, preferring terms such as \"eminence\", \"genius\", \"exceptional achievement\", etc. Historically the major intellectual battles over this topic have focused around the questions of nature versus nurture or person versus context. Today the importance of both dimensions is accepted by all, but disagreements over the relative importance of each are still reflected in variations in research emphases.\n\nThe early research had a strong genetic emphasis and focused on intelligence as the driving force behind greatness.\n\nThe earliest such research, \"Hereditary Genius\" by Francis Galton (1869), argued that people vary hugely in “natural ability” which is inherited biologically. Those at the very top end of the range, i.e., geniuses, become the leaders and great achievers of their generation. To prove this thesis Galton collected data showing that genius clusters in what he termed “Notable Family Lines”, such as those of Bernoulli, Cassini, Darwin, Herschel, and Jussieu in science, or Bach in music.\n\nGalton then calculated the odds of eminent people having eminent relations, taking into account the closeness of the biological connection (e.g., son vs grandson), and the magnitude of achievement of the eminent parent. His findings were as anticipated: the more famous the parent (i.e., the greater level of presumed “natural ability”), the greater likelihood there would be illustrious relatives; and the closer the blood tie, the greater those odds.\n\nCatharine Cox’s book on \"The Early Mental Traits of Three Hundred Geniuses\" (1926), was similar to Galton’s in its orientation. Using the method that her mentor, Stanford Psychology Professor Lewis Terman, had developed for differentiating children in terms of intelligence, Cox coded records of childhood and adolescent achievements of 301 historic eminent leaders and creators to estimate what their IQs would have been on the basis of intellectual level of such achievements relative to the age at which they were accomplished. For example, John Stuart Mill reportedly studied Greek at 3, read Plato at 7, and learned calculus at 11. As such, what he was doing at 5, the average person couldn’t do until 9 years, 6 months of age, giving Mill an estimated IQ of 190.\n\nCox found that the perceived eminence of those with the highest IQs was higher than that of those attaining lower IQ estimates, and that those with higher IQs also exhibited more versatility in their achievements. For example, da Vinci, Michelangelo, Descartes, Benjamin Franklin, Goethe, and others with IQs in the mid 160s or above were superior in their versatility to those attaining lower scores, such as George Washington, Palestrina, or Philip Sheridan.\n\nBoth Cox and Galton have been criticized for failing to take account of the role of nurture, or more specifically socio-economic and educational advantage, in the achievements of these historical greats.\n\nThere was one major anthropological study of genius, and it was triggered specifically by the author’s contentions with Galton’s work.\n\nAlfred Kroeber’s \"Configurations of Cultural Growth\" (1944) looked at many of the same historic greats as did Galton and Cox, but from a completely different orientation. As a cultural anthropologist, Kroeber maintained that, in Simonton's words, “culture takes primacy over the individual in any account of human (behavior), and that historic geniuses are no exception…” \n\nTo prove his thesis, Kroeber collected “long lists of notable figures from several nationalities and historic eras”, and then grouped them within a field and a shared cultural context, e.g., “Configuration for American Literature”. Then within these groupings he listed his notables in “strict chronological order”, identifying the most eminent figures by using capital letters for their surnames (e.g. EMERSON, LONGFELLOW, POE, WHITMAN, etc. in above configuration).\n\nKroeber found that genius never appeared in isolation, but rather, in Simonton's words, that “one genius cluster(ed) with others of greater and lesser fame in adjacent generations”. He also found that there were historical “crests” and “troughs” in every field. These fluctuations in the appearance of genius were much too rapid to be explained by the simple mechanism of genetic inheritance along family lines.\n\nKroeber argued, in Simonton's words, that his “configurations” were due to “emulations”: “Geniuses cluster in history because the key figures of one generation emulate those in the immediately preceding generations… (until) it attains a high point of perfection that stymies further growth”. At this point the “tradition degenerates into empty imitation, as most creative minds move on to greener pastures”.\n\nRecent research is consistent with these explanations; but many aspects of the developmental process from birth to the attainment of greatness remain unaccounted for by Kroeber’s anthropological approach.\n\nRetrospective studies, involving extensive interviews with individuals who have attained eminence, or at least exceptional levels of achievement, have added much to our understanding of the developmental process. Two studies in particular stand out.\n\nHarriet Zuckerman’s \"Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States\", is based on many sources of research evidence, including a series of forty-one extended interviews with American winners of the Nobel Prize for science.\n\nZuckerman reported her results around two main topics: How the Prize is Awarded, and Career Development of the Scientific Elite. Her findings on the first topic are briefly overviewed in the Wikipedia article regarding the Nobel Prize\n\nIn relation to the question of the career development of the scientific elite\nZuckerman uses the phrase \"accumulation of advantage\" to describe her findings. In her words: “Scientists who show promise early in their careers (are) given greater opportunities in the way of research training and facilities. To the extent that these scientists are as competent as the rest or more so, they ultimately will do far better in terms of both role performance and reward… rewards (which) can be transformed into resources for further work.. (and hence over time) scientists who are initially advantaged gain even greater opportunities for further achievement and rewards.”\n\nTo see if ‘accumulation of advantage’ was operating in the career development of the scientific elite, Zuckerman compared the careers of future laureates with those of “members of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the scientific rank and file” along a number of dimensions including socioeconomic origins, status of undergraduate and graduate education, the process of moving into the scientific elite, and first jobs and professorships.\n\nShe also interviewed forty-one Nobel laureates extensively about their \"apprenticeships\" to \"master\" scientists while they were doing their doctoral research, and other aspects of their career development related to the above topics.\n\nZuckerman concluded that evidence of \"accumulative of advantage\" was clearly present over the course of development, with result that her research “… cast(s) considerable doubt on the conclusion that marked differences in performance between the ultra-elite and other scientists reflect equally marked differences in their initial capacities to do scientific work”.\n\nBenjamin Bloom and five colleagues conducted extensive interviews with 120 “young men and women (as well as their parents and influential teachers)… who had reached the highest levels of accomplishment” in six fields – Olympic sprint swimmers, Top 10 rated professional tennis players, concert pianists, accomplished sculptors, exceptional mathematicians, and outstanding research neurologists.\n\nThey report many findings relevant to the “talent development process\", including:\n\n\nA 1995 book by Hans Eysenck argues that a “personality trait” called Psychoticism is central to becoming a creative genius; and a more recent book by Bill Dorris (2009) looks at the influence of “everything from genetics to cultural crises”, including chance, over the course of development of those who attain greatness.\n\nHans Eysenck's book, \"Genius: The Natural History of Creativity\" (1995), \"construct(s)... a model of genius and creativity\" whose \"novelty lies in (its) attempt to make personality differences central to the argument\".\n\nIn particular Eysenck is interested in a personality trait called “psychoticism … chief among (whose) cognitive features is a tendency to \"over-inclusiveness\", i.e., an inclination not to limit one's associations to \"relevant\" ideas, memories, images, etc.\"\n\nHe considers a massive range of experimental psychological research in order to establish the underlying genetic, neuro-chemical mechanisms which may be operating to influence levels of creativity associated with fluctuations in “the tendency towards over-inclusiveness indicative of psychoticism...\"\n\nEysenck's assessment of his overall argument is as follows: \"There is no hint that the theory is more than a suggestion of how many disparate facts and hypotheses can be pulled together into a causal chain, explaining… the apogee of human endeavour - genius. If the theory has one point in its favour it is that every step can be tested experimentally, and that many steps have already received positive support from such testing.\" \n\nBill Dorris's book, \"The Arrival of The Fittest: How The Great Become Great\" (2009), attempts to address a number of issues which remain unanswered on the subject. These include the role of chance over the course of development, the importance of the development of unique personal characteristics to achieving greatness, and the influence of changes in the wider worlds surrounding the person - from interpersonal to societal - on the course of an individual's development.\n\nDorris argues that those who attain ‘greatness’ are credited with solving a key generational problem in a field and/or society (e.g., Einstein resolving the conflict between Newton and Maxwell in physics at the outset of the 20th century; or Woody Guthrie providing a voice for the outcasts of the Great Depression of the 1930s).\n\nDorris’s core argument is that those who become ‘great’ start out with sufficient genetic potential and then are able, over two or more decades, to obtain matches/fits with “the right kind of problems” to extend the development of these genetic biases into what Dorris terms, “key characteristics”. These are the intellectual, personality, and self characteristics which eventually turn out to be required to solve a key generational problem in their field and/or society.\n\nDorris argues that there are four types of matching processes which occur over the course of such development. These refer to matches between the developmental needs of the person and the opportunities and resources essential to engaging in problem solving activities that stimulate further development of those aspects of intelligence, personality, and self which eventually become key characteristics.\n\nTwo of these matching processes are covered extensively in the existing research literature: continuous matching and cumulative matching.\n\nThe other two of the matching processes described by Dorris are completely new to this book: catalytic matching and chaotic matching.\n\nDorris’s argument in relation to catalytic matching is that anyone who eventually becomes a ‘great’ will have experienced one or more sustained periods of exceptionally accelerated development of their key characteristics, accelerations which serve massively to differentiate them from their former peers in terms of both development and visibility within the field.\n\nThis acceleration occurs because the person becomes the focal point (star) of a self-reinforcing system of expertise and resources (catalytic system) which thrives off this person’s accelerated development and visibility.\n\nDorris's argument in relation to chaotic matching is that access to the resources and learning opportunities essential to the development of key characteristics of an eventual ‘great’ often occurs not due to the efforts/planning of the individual, but simply due to chance events in the interpersonal, institutional or societal worlds around the person, who (unlike perhaps millions of equally capable peers) becomes the beneficiary of these chance events – events which Dorris argues can change a person’s entire future in much the same way as a lottery jackpot or a \"Titanic\" ticket.\n\nDorris documents his theoretical arguments with extensive case studies of a wide range of individuals, including Einstein, Elvis, Monet, Mozart, da Vinci, Abraham Lincoln, Watson and Crick, basketball great Bill Russell, Louis Armstrong, Bill Gates, Alfred Hitchcock, Woody Guthrie, and Norma Jeane/Marilyn Monroe.\n\n\n\n\n"}

For six years it operated several different volunteer computing projects that allowed members to donate their spare computer cycles to worthwhile causes. In 2007, it became a community for open source cluster and grid computing software. After around 2010 it redirected to other sites.\n\nFrom its establishment in April 2001 until April 27, 2007, grid.org was the website and organization that ran distributed computing projects such as the United Devices Cancer Research Project. It was sponsored philanthropically by United Devices (UD) and members participated in volunteer computing by running the UD Agent software (version 3.0).\n\nThe United Devices Cancer Research Project, which began in 2001, was seeking possible drugs for the treatment of cancer using distributed computing. There were around 150,000 users in the United States and 170,000 in Europe along with hundreds of thousands more in other parts of the world.\n\nThe project was an alliance of several companies and organisations:\n\nUnited Devices released the cancer research screensaver under the principle of using spare computing power. The program, which could be set to run continually, used \"virtual screening\" to find possible interactions between molecules and target proteins, i.e. a drug. These molecules (ligands) are sent to the host computer's UD Agent. When these molecules dock successfully with a target protein this interaction is scored for further investigation.\n\nThe research consisted of two phases:\n\n\nThe IBM-sponsored \"Human Proteome Folding Project\" (\"HPF\"), phase 1, was announced on November 16, 2004 and was completed July 3, 2006. The project operated simultaneously on both grid.org and the IBM's World Community Grid.\n\nIt made use of the \"Rosetta\" software to predict the structure of human proteins in order to help predict the function of proteins. This information may someday be used to help cure a variety of diseases and genetic defects.\n\nAccording to an announcement on the grid.org forums, after the HPF1 project was completed it was left to continue running on grid.org until August 9, 2006. During that time, members whose computers were configured to run this project got new work and spent computing resources calculating a result, but the result was returned to grid.org for points only—it was not used for scientific research.\n\nThe status of the Human Proteome Folding Project caused some discussion on the grid.org forums. Most members wanted to see all available computing power directed toward the still-active cancer project, but UD representative Robby Brewer asserted that \"some [users] like the screensaver\". As noted above, in the end the redundant HPF1 work on grid.org was halted.\n\nThe \"Smallpox Research Grid\" was a part of United Devices \"Patriot Grid\" initiative to fight biological terrorism. This project helped analyze potential drug candidates for a medical therapy in the fight against smallpox virus. It made use of the \"LigandFit\" software (that had already been used by phase 2 of the Cancer Research project), but with a specialized set of target molecules that targeted the smallpox virus.\n\nThe partners of the project included University of Oxford, the University of Western Ontario, Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, Essex University, Evotec OAI, Accelrys, and IBM.\n\nThe World Community Grid largely began because of the success of this project.\n\nThe \"Anthrax Research Project\" was a part of the United Devices \"Patriot Grid\" initiative to fight biological terrorism. It made use of the \"LigandFit\" software (that had already been used by phase 2 of the Cancer Research project), but with a specialized set of target molecules that targeted the advanced stages of anthrax bacterial infection.\n\nThe project was operated from January 22, 2002 until February 14, 2002 and ended after a total of 3.57 billion molecules had finished screening. The results of the research project were transmitted to biological scientists in order to finish the screening of the computational simulations.\n\nThe partners of the project included Oxford University.\n\nThe HMMER Genetic Research project made use of the Hidden Markov model to search for patterns in genetic DNA sequences.\n\nThe \"Web Performance Testing\" project was operated as a commercial opportunity with select web hosting providers in order to help them test the scalability of their server infrastructures under periods of high-demand.\n\nIn November 2007, grid.org was repositioned by Univa as a community to allow users to interact and discuss open source cluster and grid related topics. It allowed users to download, get support for, contribute to, and report issues about the open source Globus Toolkit based products offered by Univa.\nOver 100,000 unique visitors were reported in 2008.\nAround mid 2010 it redirected to Unicluster.org (a Univa product) and by 2012 it redirected to Univa's main site.\n\n"}

It was one of several curricula funded by the National Science Foundation and designed around the 1989 National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards. The IMP books were authored by Dan Fendel and Diane Resek, professors of mathematics at San Francisco State University, and by Lynne Alper and Sherry Fraser. IMP was published by Key Curriculum Press in 1997 and sold in 2012 to It's About Time. \n\nDesigned in response to national reports pointing to the need for a major overhaul in mathematics education, the IMP curriculum is markedly different in structure, content, and pedagogy from courses more typically found in the high school sequence.\n\n\nNearly every one of these distinctive characteristics has generated controversy and placed the IMP curriculum right in the middle of the “math wars,” the conflict between those that favor more traditional curricula in mathematics education and the supporters of the reform curricula that were largely an outgrowth of the 1989 NCTM standards. \n\nIMP is among the reform curricula that have been heavily criticized by organizations such as Mathematically Correct. That organization’s Internet site begins with a statement that “advocates of the new, fuzzy math” (focus) “on things like calculators, blocks, guesswork, and group activities and they shun things like algorithms and repeated practice. The new programs are shy on fundamentals and they also lack the mathematical depth and rigor that promotes greater achievement.” Former NCTM president Frank Allen states, “Trying to organize school mathematics around problem solving instead of using its own internal structure for that purpose … (is destroying) essential connections….”\n\nCriticism often includes anecdotal evidence including stories of school districts that have decided to discontinue or supplement use of the IMP curriculum and of students who did not feel they had been prepared adequately for college. \"Regular math is much better, it makes much more sense,\" says Aimee Lynn Stearns, a student at Taos High School in Taos, New Mexico.\n\nOn the other hand, some IMP students describe the program in positive terms. \"It's fun, but it makes you really think,\" according to Ziouck Gonzalez, a student at Wells High School in Chicago, Illinois. Looking beyond student response, IMP was one of five mathematics education programs designated \"exemplary\" by the US Education Department in 1999, for \"outstanding quality and demonstrated effectiveness.\" It's About Time, the publisher of IMP, points out “the IMP first edition was published after more than 10 years of research, pilot testing, evaluating, field testing, revising, and detailed reviewing.” \n\nSupporters point to statistical studies that compare the performance of students enrolled in IMP courses with their peers enrolled in traditional high school mathematics courses. Merlino and Wolff, two such researchers, report that in their several studies IMP students consistently outperformed traditionally taught students on both the math and verbal sections of the PSAT, as well as on the SAT-9. Kramer reported that grade 12 IMP students in his study performed better on all areas of mathematics tested by the NAEP test, and Webb and Dowling reported IMP students performed significantly better on statistics questions from the Second International Mathematics Study, on mathematical reasoning and problem solving tasks designed by the State of Wisconsin, and on a quantitative reasoning test developed by a university to administer to entering students.\n\nThe other four NSF funded high school curricula projects:\n"}

Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the Douglas Aircraft Company. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.\n\nMOL was cancelled in 1969, during the height of the Apollo program, when it was shown that unmanned reconnaissance satellites could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA Skylab (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Soviet Union launched three Almaz military space stations, similar in intent to the MOL, but cancelled the program in 1977 for the same reasons.\n\nThe MOL was planned to use a helium-oxygen atmosphere. It used a Gemini B spacecraft as a reentry vehicle.\n\nThe crew were to be launched using a Titan 3M with the stacked Gemini B and MOL, and returned to Earth in the Gemini B. They would conduct up to 40 days of military reconnaissance using large optics, cameras, and side-looking radar.\n\nThe USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU) was developed for the MOL project. NASA chief astronaut Deke Slayton later speculated in his autobiography that the AMU may have been developed for MOL because the Air Force \"thought they might have the chance to inspect somebody else's satellites.\"\n\nIn response to the announcement of the MOL, the Soviet Union commissioned the development of its own military space station, Almaz. Three Almaz space stations flew as Salyut space stations, and the program also developed a military add-on used on Salyut 6 and Salyut 7.\n\nThe Gemini capsule was redesigned for MOL and named Gemini B. Externally it was similar to Gemini, but featured a rear hatch for the crew to enter MOL and many specific systems.\n\nGemini B would be launched with the MOL space station. Once in orbit, the crew would power down the capsule and activate MOL. After about one month of space station operations, the crew would return to the Gemini B capsule, separate from the station and perform reentry. Gemini B had an autonomy of about 14 hours once detached from MOL.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperational MOLs were to be launched on Titan IIIM rockets from Vandenberg AFB SLC-6 and Cape Canaveral AFS LC-40.\n\nTest flight OPS 0855 for MOL was launched on 3 November 1966 at 13:50:42 UTC on a Titan IIIC-9 from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 40. The flight consisted of a MOL mockup built from a Titan II propellant tank, and the refurbished capsule from the Gemini 2 mission as a prototype spacecraft.\n\nAfter the Gemini B prototype separated for a sub-orbital reentry, the MOL mockup continued into orbit and released three satellites. A hatch installed in the Gemini's heat shield—intended to provide access to the MOL during manned operations—was tested during the capsule's reentry. The Gemini capsule was recovered near Ascension Island in the South Atlantic by the after a flight of 33 minutes.\n\nThe Gemini no.2 capsule used in the only flight of the MOL program is on display at the Air Force Space & Missile Museum at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A test article at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, is the Gemini B spacecraft (sometimes confused with Blue Gemini). It is recognized by its distinctive \"US Air Force\" written on the side, and the circular hatch cut through the heat shield.\n\nStarting in 1965 a large optical system was added to the spacecraft for military reconnaissance. This camera system was codenamed \"Dorian\" and given the designation KH-10. The project was canceled on 10 June 1969 before any operational flights occurred.\n\nThe KH-10 intended for the MOL program was succeeded by the unmanned KH-11 Kennan, which launched in 1976 as the Soviet Union was winding down its manned space reconnaissance program. The KH-11 is said to have achieved the goal of imaging resolution and introduced video transmission of images back to Earth.\n\nThe program was canceled on 10 June 1969 with the first projected flight three years away. Between 1965 and 1969, MOL's projected cost rose from $1.5 billion to $3 billion while the Vietnam War took larger portions of the defense budget. While Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird and the Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly supported the station, Central Intelligence Agency head Richard Helms did not support the project because he feared that the death of a MOL astronaut might ground launches and thus damage the nation's satellite reconnaissance program. President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger agreed to the Bureau of the Budget's proposal to cancel MOL, as it was determined the capabilities of unmanned spy satellites met or exceeded the capabilities of manned MOL missions.\n\nNASA offered those under 35 years of age the opportunity to transfer to its astronaut program. Seven of the 14 MOL astronauts were younger than 35 and took the offer, becoming NASA Astronaut Group 7: future NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly, Karol J. Bobko, Robert Crippen, C. Gordon Fullerton, Henry W. Hartsfield, Robert F. Overmyer, and Donald H. Peterson. All flew on the Space Shuttle.\n\nIn 2005, two MH-7 training space suits from the MOL program were discovered in a locked room in the Launch Complex 5/6 museum on Cape Canaveral. In July 2015, the National Reconnaissance Office declassified over 800 files and photos related to the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program.\n\nIn the 2016 novel \"Blue Darker Than Black\" by Mike Jenne, the MOL program is secretly transferred from the Air Force to the United States Navy after its official cancellation in 1969. The Navy launches an ocean surveillance MOL in July 1972. Two Air Force Blue Gemini astronauts fly a rescue mission to the MOL after its crew is incapacitated by the August 4, 1972 solar storm.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44216", "title": "Miniature effect", "text": "Miniature effect\n\nA miniature effect is a special effect created for motion pictures and television programs using scale models. Scale models are often combined with high speed photography or matte shots to make gravitational and other effects appear convincing to the viewer. The use of miniatures has largely been superseded by computer-generated imagery in the contemporary cinema.\n\nWhere a miniature appears in the foreground of a shot, this is often very close to the camera lens — for example when matte painted backgrounds are used. Since the exposure is set to the object being filmed so the actors appear well lit, the miniature must be over-lit in order to balance the exposure and eliminate any depth of field differences that would otherwise be visible. This foreground miniature usage is referred to as forced perspective. Another form of miniature effect uses stop motion animation.\n\nUse of scale models in the creation of visual effects by the entertainment industry dates back to the earliest days of cinema. Models and miniatures are copies of people, animals, buildings, settings and objects. Miniatures or models are used to represent things that do not really exist, or that are too expensive or difficult to film in reality, such as explosions, floods or fires.\n\nFrench director Georges Méliès incorporated special effects in his 1902 film \"Le Voyage dans la Lune\" (\"A Trip to the Moon\") — including double-exposure, split screens, miniatures and stop-action.\n\nSome of the most influential visual effects films of these early years such as \"Metropolis\" (1927), \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), \"Godzilla\" (1954) \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956). The 1933 film \"King Kong\" made extensive use of miniature effects including scale models and stop-motion animation of miniature elements.\n\nThe use of miniatures in \"\" was a major development. In production for three years, the film was a significant advancement in creating convincing models.\n\nIn the early 1970s, miniatures were often used to depict disasters in such films as \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (1972), \"Earthquake\" (1974) and \"The Towering Inferno\" (1975).\n\nThe resurgence of the science fiction genre in film in the late 1970s saw miniature fabrication rise to new heights in such films as \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", (1977), \"Star Wars\" (also 1977), \"Alien\" (1979), \"\" (1979) and \"Blade Runner\" (1982). Iconic film sequences such as the tanker truck explosion from \"The Terminator\" (1984) and the bridge destruction in \"True Lies\" (1994) were achieved through the use of large-scale miniatures.\n\nThe release of \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) was a turning point in the use of computers to create effects for which physical miniatures would have previously been employed.\n\nWhile the use of computer generated imagery (CGI) has largely overtaken their use since then, they are still often employed, especially for projects requiring physical interaction with fire, explosions or water.\n\"Independence Day\" (1996), \"Titanic\" (1997), \"Godzilla\" (1998), The \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy (1999-2005), \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy (2001-3), \"Casino Royale\" (2006), \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), \"Inception\" (2010), and \"Interstellar\" (2014) are examples of highly successful films that have utilized miniatures for a significant component of their visual effects work.\n\n\n\"Slurpasaur\" is a nickname given to optically enlarged reptiles (and occasionally other animals) that are presented as dinosaurs in motion pictures.\n\nConcurrently with Willis O'Brien and others in making stop-motion animated dinosaurs since the early days of cinema, producers have used optically enlarged lizards, often with horns and fins glued on, to represent dinosaurs, to cut costs, and to present a living analog to dinosaurs, despite huge morphological differences between dinosaurs and reptiles. The first film that used reptiles dressed as dinosaurs was D.W. Griffith's \"Brute Force\". Various slurpasaurs appeared in the 1929 film version of \"The Mysterious Island\", the 1933 British film \"Secret of the Loch\", and the 1936 \"Flash Gordon\" serial. The first major use of the slurpasaur was in \"One Million B.C.\" (1940), which included a pig dressed as a triceratops, with the special effects in this film re-used often, such as in the 1955 movie \"King Dinosaur\".\n\nOther notable films with slurpasaurs include \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" (1959) and \"The Lost World\" (1960). The former featured reptiles with attached tall spinal fans, simulating Dimetrodons and looked superficially similar to those creatures, as Dimetrodons had a low slung body structure more reminiscent of lizards. The latter is notable for a dinosaur battle wherein a monitor lizard and a young alligator engage in an unsimulated, fierce battle. On the 1960 \"Lost World\", O'Brien, who did the stop-motion dinosaurs for the original, was hired as the effects technician, but was disappointed that producer Irwin Allen opted for live animals.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11813260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11813260", "title": "Morea expedition", "text": "Morea expedition\n\nThe Morea expedition () is the name given in France to the land intervention of the French Army in the Peloponnese (at the time often still known by its medieval name, Morea) between 1828 and 1833, at the time of the Greek War of Independence.\n\nAfter the fall of Messolonghi, Western Europe decided to intervene in favour of revolutionary Greece. Their attitude toward the Ottoman Empire's Egyptian ally, Ibrahim Pasha, was especially critical; their primary objective was to elicit the evacuation of the occupied regions, the Peloponnese in particular. The intervention began when a Franco-Russo-British fleet was sent to the region, winning the Battle of Navarino in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps disembarked at Koroni in the southern Peloponnese. The soldiers were stationed on the peninsula until the evacuation of Egyptian troops in October, then taking control of the principal strongholds still held by Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France from the end of 1828, there was a French presence in the area until 1833.\n\nAs during Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, when a Commission of Sciences and Arts had accompanied the military campaign, a \"Morea scientific expedition\" (\"Expédition scientifique de Morée.\") accompanied the troops. Seventeen learned men representing different specialties (natural history and antiquities – archaeology, architecture and sculpture) made the voyage. Their work was of major importance in increasing knowledge about the country. As an example, the topographic maps they produced were excellent. More significantly, the measurements, drawings, profiles, plans and proposals for the theoretical restoration of Peloponnesian monuments, of Attica and of the Cyclades were, following James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's \"Antiquities of Athens\", a new attempt to systematically and exhaustively catalogue ancient Greek ruins. The Morea expedition and its publications offered a near-complete description of the regions visited. They formed a scientific, aesthetic and human inventory that remained one of the best means, short of visiting them in person, to get to know the regions.\n\nIn 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won numerous victories early on and declared independence. However, the declaration contradicted the principles of the Congress of Vienna and of the Holy Alliance, which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the liberal Greek insurgents.\n\nThe liberal and national uprising displeased the Austria of Metternich, the principal political architect of the Holy Alliance. However, Russia, another reactionary gendarme of Europe, looked favorably on the insurrection due to its Orthodox religious solidarity and its geostrategic interest (control of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus). France, another active member of the Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at Trocadero (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade. Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the regional situation primarily because it lay on the route to India and London wished to exercise a form of control there. For all of Europe, Greece represented the cradle of Western civilisation and of art since antiquity.\n\nThe Greek victories had been short-lived. The Sultan had called to his aid his Egyptian vassal Muhammad Ali, who had dispatched his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with a fleet and 8,000 men, later adding a further 25,000 troops. Ibrahim's intervention proved decisive: much of the Peloponnese had been reconquered in 1825; the gateway town of Messolonghi had fallen in 1826; Athens had been taken in 1827. All that Greek nationalists still held was Nafplion, Hydra, Mani and Aegina.\n\nA strong current of philhellenism developed in Western Europe. Thus it was decided to intervene in favour of Greece, the cradle of civilisation and a Christian vanguard in the Orient whose strategic location was clear. By the Treaty of London of July 1827,\nFrance, Russia and the United Kingdom recognised the autonomy of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a show of force was proposed and adopted. A joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exercise diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. The Battle of Navarino (October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.\n\nIn 1828, Ibrahim Pasha thus found himself in a difficult situation: he had just suffered a defeat at Navarino; the joint fleet exercised a blockade which prevented him from receiving reinforcements and supplies; his Albanian troops, whom he could no longer pay, had returned to their country under the protection of Theodoros Kolokotronis’ Greek troops. On August 6, 1828, a convention had been signed at Alexandria between the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, and the British admiral Edward Codrington. Ibrahim Pasha had to evacuate his Egyptian troops and leave the Peloponnese to the few Turkish troops (estimated at 1200 men) remaining there. However, Ibrahim Pasha refused to honor the agreement that had been reached, continuing to control various Greek regions: Messenia, Navarino, Patras and several other strongholds. He had also ordered the systematic destruction of Tripoli.\n\nIn addition, the French government of Charles X was beginning to have doubts about its Greek policy. Ibrahim Pasha himself noted this ambiguity when he met General Maison in September: “Why was France, after enslaving men in Spain in 1823, now coming to Greece to make men free?”\nEventually a liberal agitation, pro-Greek and inspired by what was then happening in that country, began to develop in France. The longer France waited, the more delicate her position vis-à-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A land expedition was proposed to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had declared war against the Ottoman Empire and its military victories were unsettling for London, which did not wish to see the Tsarist empire extend too far south. Thus Great Britain did not oppose an intervention by France alone.\n\nEnlightenment philosophy had developed Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, the linchpin of Antiquity, as it was perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works such as those of Abbé Barthélemy, \"Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis\" (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean.\n\nThe theories and system of interpreting ancient art devised by Johann Joachim Winckelmann influenced European tastes for decades. His major work, \"History of Ancient Art\", was published in 1764 and translated into French in 1766 (the English translation came later, in 1881). In this major work Winckelmann initiated the tradition of dividing ancient art into periods, classifying the works chronologically and stylistically.\n\nThe views of Winckelmann on art encompassed the entirety of civilisation. He drew a parallel between a civilisation's general level of development and the evolution of its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation, in terms of progress, apogee and then decline. For him, Greek art had been the pinnacle of artistic achievement, culminating with Phidias. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek art had been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful (Praxiteles) and Decadent (Roman period).\n\nWinckelmann's theories on the evolution of art culminated in the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of complete political and religious liberty. The theories idealised Ancient Greece and increased people's desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He convinced 18th-century Europe that life in Ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of “noble simplicity and calm grandeur”. Greece became the “motherland of the arts” and “the teacher of taste”.\n\nThe French government had planned the Morea expedition in the same spirit as those of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, whose work it wished to complete. The semi-scientific expeditions commissioned and financed by the Society of Dilettanti remained a benchmark: these represented the first attempts to rediscover Ancient Greece. The first, that of Stuart and Revett to Athens and the islands, took place in 1751–1753, and resulted in \"The Antiquities of Athens\", mined by architects and designers for a refined \"Grecian\" neoclassicism. The expedition of Revett, Richard Chandler and William Pars to Asia Minor took place between 1764 and 1766. Finally, the “work” of Lord Elgin on the Parthenon at the beginning of the 19th century had sparked further longing for Greece: it now seemed possible to build vast collections of ancient art in Western Europe.\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies authorised a loan of 80 million gold francs to allow the government to meet its obligations. An expeditionary corps of 13,000–15,000 men commanded by Lieutenant-General Nicolas Joseph Maison was formed. It was composed of three brigades commanded by the \"maréchaux de camp\" Tiburce Sébastiani (brother of the Corsican soldier-diplomat Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta), Philippe Higonet, and Virgile Schneider. The Chief of the General Staff was General Antoine Simon Durrieu.<br>\n\nThe expeditionary corps was made up of nine infantry regiments:\nAlso departing were the 3rd Chasseur Regiment (commanded by Colonel Paul-Eugène de Faudoas-Barbazan), four companies of artillery (with equipment for campaigns, sieges, and mountains) of the 3rd and 8th Artillery Regiments, and two companies of military engineers (sappers and miners).\n\nA transport fleet protected by warships was organised; sixty ships sailed in all. Equipment, victuals, munitions and 1,300 horses had to be brought over, as well as arms, munitions and money for the Greek provisional government of John Capodistria. France wished to support free Greece as it came into being by helping it activate its army, with the aim of gaining influence in the region.\n\nThe first brigade left Toulon on August 17; the second, two days later; and the third on September 1. The general in command, Nicolas Joseph Maison, was with the first brigade, aboard the ship of the line \"Ville de Marseille\". The first convoy was composed of merchant ships and apart from the \"Ville de Marseille\", it included the frigates \"Amphitrite\", \"Bellone\" and \"Cybèle\". The second convoy was escorted by ship of the line \"Duquesne\" and the frigates \"Iphigénie\" and \"Armide\".\n\nOn August 29, the fleet transporting the two first brigades arrived in Navarino bay, where the joint Franco-Russo-British squadron was berthed. The Egyptian army was concentrated between Navarino and Methoni. Thus, the landing was risky. The fleet sailed toward the Gulf of Koroni protected by a fortress held by the Ottomans. The expeditionary corps began to disembark without meeting any opposition on the evening of August 29, finishing on the morning of August 30. A proclamation by governor Capodistria had informed the Greek population of the imminent arrival of a French expedition. The locals rushed up before the troops as soon as they set foot on Greek soil and offered them food.\n\nThe French pitched camp in the plain of Koroni, near Petalidi, on the site of the ancient Coronea. The third brigade, which had borne up against a storm and lost three ships, managed to land at Koroni on September 16.\n\nIbrahim Pasha used a number of pretexts to delay the evacuation: problems with food supply or transport, or unforeseen difficulties in the strongholds’ handover. The French officers had difficulties in maintaining the fighting zeal of their soldiers, who for example had become excited at the (false) news that an imminent march on Athens would take place. This impatience on the part of the French troops was perhaps decisive in convincing the Egyptian commander to respect his obligations. Moreover, French soldiers were beginning to suffer from autumn rains which drenched their tent camp, increasing the likelihood of fever and especially of dysentery. On September 24, Louis-Eugène Cavaignac wrote that thirty men of 400 in his company of military engineers were affected by fever. General Maison wished to be able to set up his men in the fortresses’ barracks. On September 7, Ibrahim Pasha accepted to evacuate his troops as of September 9. The agreement reached with General Maison provided that the Egyptians would leave with their arms, baggage and horses, but without any Greek slave or prisoner. As the Egyptian fleet could not evacuate the entire army in one go, supplies were authorised for the troops who remained on land; these men had just undergone a lengthy blockade. A first Egyptian division, 5,500 men and 27 ships, set sail on September 16, escorted by three ships from the joint fleet (two English ones and the French frigate \"Sirène\").\n\nThe last Egyptian transport sailed away on October 5, taking Ibrahim Pasha. Of the 40,000 men he had brought from Egypt, he was taking back barely 20,000. A few Ottoman soldiers remained in order to hold the different strongholds of the Peloponnese. The next mission of the French troops was to “give security” to these and hand them back to independent Greece.\n\nOn October 6, General Maison ordered General Higonet to march on Navarino. He left with the 16th Infantry Regiment, which included artillery and military engineers. Thus, Navarino's seacoast was put under siege by Admiral Henri de Rigny’s fleet and the land siege was undertaken by General Higonet's soldiers. The Turkish commander of the fort refused to surrender:\n\n“The Porte is at war with neither the French nor the English; we will commit no hostile act, but we will not surrender the fort.”\n\nHence, the sappers received an order to open a breach in the walls. General Higonet entered the fortress, held by 250 men who surrendered with sixty cannons and 800,000 rounds of ammunition. The French troops moved in intending to remain for some time, building up Navarino's fortifications, rebuilding its houses and setting up a hospital and various features of local administration.\n\nOn October 7, the 35th Line Infantry Regiment, commanded by General Durrieu, accompanied by artillery and by military engineers, appeared before Methoni, defended by 1,078 men and a hundred cannons, and which had food supplies for six months. Two ships of the line, the \"Breslaw\" (Captain Maillard) and (Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland) blocked the port and threatened the fortress with their cannons. The fort's commanders, the Turk Hassan Pasha and the Egyptian Ahmed Bey, made the same reply as had the commander of Navarino. Methoni's fortifications were in a better state than those of Navarino. Thus the sappers focused on opening the city gate. The city's garrison did not defend it. The commanders of the fort explained that they could not surrender it without disobeying the Sultan's orders, but also recognised that it was impossible for them to resist. Thus the fort had to be taken, at least symbolically, by force.\n\nIt was more difficult to take Koroni. General Sébastiani showed up there on October 7 with a party from his brigade. The fort commander's response was similar to those given at Navarino and Methoni. Sébastiani sent his sappers, who were pushed back by rocks thrown from atop the walls. A dozen men were wounded, among them Cavaignac and, more seriously, a captain, a sergeant and three sappers. The other French soldiers felt insulted and their general had great difficulty in preventing them from opening fire and taking the stronghold by force. The \"Amphitrite\", the \"Breslaw\" and the \"Wellesley\" came to the assistance of the ground troops. The threat they posed led the Ottoman commander to surrender. On October 9, the French entered Koroni and seized 80 cannons and guns, along with numerous victuals and munitions.\n\nPatras had been controlled by Ibrahim Pasha since the evacuation of the Peloponnese. The third brigade had been sent by sea to take the city, located in the north-western part of the peninsula. It landed on October 4. General Schneider gave Hadji Abdullah, Pasha of Patras and of the “Castle of the Morea”, twenty-four hours to hand over the fort. On October 5, when the ultimatum expired, three columns marched on the city and the artillery was deployed. The Pasha immediately signed the capitulation of Patras and of the “Castle of the Morea”. However, the aghas who commanded the latter refused to obey their pasha, whom they considered a traitor, and announced that they would rather die in the ruins of their fortress than surrender.\n\nThe \"Castle of the Morea\" guarded the entry to the Gulf of Corinth, near Rion. Bayezid II had built it in 1499.\n\nGeneral Schneider negotiated with the aghas, who persisted in their refusal to surrender. A siege was begun from in front of the fortress and fourteen marine and field guns, placed a little over 400 meters away, reduced the artillery of those under siege to silence. Admiral de Rigny had General Maison put all his artillery and sappers on board. By land Maison sent two infantry regiments and the 3rd Light Cavalry Regiment. Reinforcements arrived on October 23. New batteries nicknamed “for breaching” (\"de brèche\") were installed. These received the names of Charles X, George IV, the Duke of Angoulême, the Duke of Bordeaux and “Marine”. A party from the British fleet and under Captain Edmund Lyons came to add their cannons.\n\nOn October 30, the batteries opened fire. In four hours, a breach was largely opened in the ramparts. Then, an emissary came out with a white flag to negotiate the terms of the fort's surrender. General Maison replied that the terms had been negotiated at the beginning of the month at Patras. He added that he did not trust a group of besieged men who had not respected a first agreement to respect a second one. He gave the garrison half an hour to evacuate the fort, without arms or baggage. The aghas submitted. However, the fortress’ resistance had cost 25 men, killed or wounded in the French expedition.\n\nOn November 5, 1828, the last “non-Greeks” (Turks, Egyptians or Muslims generally) left the Morea. 2,500 Turks and their families were placed aboard French vessels headed for Smyrna.\n\nThe French and British ambassadors had set themselves up at Poros and invited Constantinople to send a diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus it was left to the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.\n\nGradually, the Morea was evacuated of troops. The Schneider brigade, of which Cavaignac was a member, boarded ship in the first days of April 1829. General Maison left on May 22, 1829. Only one brigade remained in the Peloponnese. Fresh troops came from France to relieve the soldiers present in Greece: thus the 57th Line Infantry Regiment landed at Navarino on July 25, 1830. France did not withdraw its troops for good until after King Otto arrived in Greece in January 1833, accompanied by the Bavarian Auxiliary Corps.\n\nThe French troops, commanded by General Charles Louis Joseph Olivier Guéhéneuc, did not remain idle during these nearly five years. Fortifications were raised, like those at Navarino. Bridges were constructed, such as those over the Pamissos River between Kalamata and Methoni. The Methoni–Navarino road was built, and improvements were made to Peloponnesian towns (barracks, bridges, gardens, etc.).\n\nThe Ottoman Empire could no longer depend on Egyptian troops to hold Greece. The strategic situation now resembled that existing before 1825 and the landing of Ibrahim Pasha. Then, the Greek insurgents had triumphed on all fronts.\n\nAfter the Morea military expedition, the Greeks only had to face the Turkish troops in Central Greece. Livadeia, gateway to Boeotia, was conquered at the beginning of November 1828. A counterattack by Mahmud Pasha from Euboea was repulsed in January 1829. In April, Naupaktos was restored to the Greeks; in May, Augustinos Kapodistrias recaptured the symbolic town of Messolonghi. However, it took the military victory of Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 and the Treaty of Adrianople before the independence of Greece was recognised.\n\nThe Greek territories that had been liberated by September 1829, a year after the Morea military expedition—the Peloponnese and central Greece—were those which would form independent Greece after 1832.\n\nThe Morea expedition was the second of the great military-scientific expeditions led by France in the first half of the 19th century. The first, used as a benchmark, had been the Egyptian one, starting in 1798; the last took place in Algeria from 1839. All three took place at the initiative of the French government and were placed under the guidance of a particular ministry (Foreign relations for Egypt, Interior for the Morea and War for Algeria). The great scientific institutions recruited learned men (both civilians and from the military) and specified their missions, but \"in situ\" work took place in close co-operation with the army.\n\nThe Commission of Sciences and Arts from Napoleon’s Egyptian expedition, and especially the publications that followed, had become a model. As Greece was the other important “ancient” region considered as lying at the origin of Western civilisation (one of the philhellenes’ principal arguments), it was decided to “take advantage of the presence of our soldiers who were occupying the Morea to send a learned commission. It did not have to equal that attached to the glory of Napoleon […] It did however need to render eminent services to the arts and sciences.”\n\nIn Egypt and Algeria, scientific work took place under the army's protection. In the Morea, most troops were departing when exploration had barely begun. The army was content to provide logistical support: “tents, stakes, tools, liquid containers, large pots and sacks; in a word, everything that could be found for us to use in the army’s storehouses.”\n\nThe members of the scientific expedition landed at Navarino on March 3, 1829, after 21 days at sea.\n\nThis section included several sciences: botany (Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent, Louis Despreaux Saint-Sauveur and Antoine Vincent Pector), geography, geology (Pierre Théodore Virlet d’Aoust and Émile Puillon Boblaye) and zoology. The government insisted that a landscape artist also be sent, as Minister of the Interior Martignac had asked for one so as not to restrict the observations “to flies and herbs, but to extend them to places and people.”\n\nOne of the first objectives fixed by the French government had been to draw precise maps of the Peloponnese, with a scientific purpose, but also for economic and military reasons. The Minister of War, the Vicomte de Caux, had written to General Maison on January 6, 1829:\n\n“All the maps of Greece are very imperfect and were drawn up based on more or less inaccurate templates; it is thus essential to fix them. Not only will geography be enriched by this research, but we will in the process support France’s commercial interests by making her relations easier, and it will above all be useful for our ground and naval forces, who may find themselves involved in this part of Europe.”\n\nIn two years, a very precise map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, a base of 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins in the village of Aria. This was intended to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula's mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20 km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.\n\nThe geographers suffered from fever—Bory de Saint-Vincent's team as much as that of Puillon-Boblaye:\n\n“The horrible heat that beset us in July placed, for the rest, the entire topographic brigade in disarray. These gentlemen, having worked in the sun, have nearly all taken ill and eight days ago, we grieved to see M. Dechièvre die at Napoli eight days ago.” (Bory de Saint-Vincent)\n\n“Of twelve officers employed in the geodesic service, two are dead and all have been sick. Besides them, we have lost two sappers and a household servant.” (Puillon-Boblaye)\n\nJean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent led the scientific expedition. Additionally, he made detailed botanical studies. He gathered a multitude of specimens: \"Flore de Morée\" (1832) lists 1,550 plants, of which 33 were orchids and 91 were grasses (just 42 species had not yet been described); \"Nouvelle Flore du Péloponnèse et des Cyclades\" (1838) described 1,821 species. In Morea, Bory de Saint-Vincent was content to collect plants. He proceeded to classify, identify and describe them upon his return to France. Then he was aided, not by his collaborators from Greece, but by Louis Athanase Chaubard, Jean-Baptiste Fauché and Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart. Similarly, the naturalists Étienne and Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire helped edit the expedition's scientific works.\n\nAs the gathering process went along, they sent the plants, as well as birds and fish, to France.\n\nThe Morea expedition confirmed that the golden jackal existed in Greece. Although earlier travel narratives had mentioned its presence, these were not considered trustworthy. Moreover, the subspecies seen and described by the French (named \"Canis aureus moreotica\") was endemic to the region. Bory de Saint-Vincent brought back pelts and a skull.\n\nThis section was formed by the Institut de France, which designated the architect Guillaume-Abel Blouet as its head. The Institut sent Amable Ravoisié, Pierre Achille Poirot, Frédéric de Gournay and Pierre Félix Trezel as his assistants.\n\nThe architect Jean-Nicolas Huyot gave very precise instructions to this section. Of wide-ranging experience formed in Asia Minor and Egypt and under the influence of engineers, he asked them to keep an authentic diary of their excavations where precision measurements read off watches and compasses should be written down, to draw a map of the region they travelled, and to describe the layout of the terrain.\n\nThe publication of works on archaeology and art followed the same pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of \"Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts\" describes Navarino (pp. 1–7) with six pages of plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four pages of plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that the scene is not so far from Arcadia); and finally three pages on Methoni and four pages of plates. The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.\n\nThe presence of troops from the expeditionary corps was important, alternating with that of Greek shepherds:\n\n“(…) their generous hospitality and simple and innocent mores reminded us of the beautiful period of pastoral life which fiction calls the Golden age, and seemed to present to us as real people the characters of Theocritus’ and Virgil’s eclogues.”\n\nThe archaeological expedition travelled through Navarino (Pylos), Methoni, Koroni, Messene and Olympia (described in the publication's first volume); Bassae, Megalopolis, Sparta, Mantineia, Argos, Mycenae, Tiryns and Nafplion (subjects of the second volume); the Cyclades (Syros, Kea, Mykonos, Delos, Naxos and Milos), Sounion, Aegina, Epidaurus, Troezen, Nemea, Corinth, Sicyon, Patras, Elis, Kalamata, the Mani Peninsula, Cape Matapan, Monemvasia, Athens, Salamis Island and Eleusina (covered in volume III).\n\nEdgar Quinet had left with the rest of the expedition. However, from the time he arrived in Greece, he kept apart from his companions, as did another member of his section, the Lyon sculptor Jean-Baptiste Vietty. The two travelled through the Peloponnese separately and Quinet visited Piraeus on April 21, 1829, thence reaching Athens. He saw the Cyclades in May, starting with Syros. Having taken ill, he returned to France on June 5, and his \"Grèce moderne et ses rapports avec l’Antiquité\" appeared in September 1831. Vietty pursued his research in Greece until August 1831, long after the expedition had returned to France at the end of 1829.\n\nThe artistic and archaeological exploration of the Peloponnese unfolded in the manner in which archaeological research was then conducted in Greece. The first step always involved an attempt to make an on-site check (a form of autopsy in the manner of Herodotus) against the texts of ancient authors like Homer, Pausanias or Strabo. Thus, at Navarino, the location of Nestor's palace was determined from Homer and the adjectives “inaccessible” and “sandy”. At Methoni, “the ancient remains of the port of which the description matches perfectly with that of Pausanias are enough to determine with certainty the location of the ancient town.”\n\nHaving explored Navarino, Methoni and Koroni, the members of the expedition returned to Messene, where they spent a month starting on April 10.\n\nThe expedition spent six weeks, starting on May 10, 1829, in Olympia. Abel Blouet and Dubois undertook the first excavations there. They were accompanied by the painters Poirot, Trezel and Duval. The archaeological advice of Huyot was followed:\n\n“Following the instructions which had been given to him by the commission of the Institute, this antiquarian (Dubois) had begun the excavations of which the result had been the discovery of the first bases of the two columns of the pronaos and several fragments of sculpture.”\n\nThe site was divided into squares and excavations were undertaken in straight lines: archaeology was becoming rationalised, and it was in this way that the location of the temple of Zeus was determined. The simple chase after treasure was beginning to be abandoned.\n\nThe fundamental contribution of the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its attitude towards pillage and treasure hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues with the intent of taking a piece separated from the rest of the statue without regard. It is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments undoubtedly represented an epistemological progress.\n\nThe French did not limit their interest to Antiquity; they also described and drew Byzantine monuments. Quite often, and until then for the travellers as well, only Ancient Greece mattered; medieval and modern Greece were ignored. Blouet, in his \"Expédition de Morée\", gave very precise descriptions of the churches he saw. For instance, plate 9 (I, II and III) of volume I deals with:\n\n“Layout, section and perspective view of one of the two small churches of the village of Osphino, situated on the slope of the mountain to the left of the Navarino-Methoni road; (…); its interior, decorated with paintings and frescoes, is divided into two parts by a wall that forms a small closed sanctuary in the back in which the priest stands to officiate.”\n\nThe results obtained by the Morea scientific expedition underscored the need to create a permanent, stable structure that would allow its work to continue. From 1846, it was possible to “systematically and permanently continue the work so gloriously and so happily begun by the Morea scientific expedition” due to the creation on rue Didot, at the foot of Mount Lycabettus, of a French scientific institution, in the form of the French School at Athens.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16927210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16927210", "title": "Paywall", "text": "Paywall\n\nA paywall is a method of restricting access to content via a paid subscription. Beginning in the mid-2010s, newspapers started implementing paywalls on their websites as a way to increase revenue after years of decline in paid print readership and advertising revenue. In academics, research papers are often subject to a paywall and are available via academic libraries that subscribe.\n\nPaywalls have also been used as a way of increasing the number of print subscribers; for example, some newspapers offer access to online content plus delivery of a Sunday print edition at a lower price than online access alone. Newspaper websites such as that of \"The Boston Globe\" and \"The New York Times\" use this tactic because it increases both their online revenue and their print circulation (which in turn provides more ad revenue).\n\nIn 1996, \"The Wall Street Journal\" set up and has continued to maintain a \"hard\" paywall. It continued to be widely read, acquiring over one million users by mid-2007, and 15 million visitors in March 2008.\n\nIn 2010, following in the footsteps of \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Times\" (London) implemented a \"hard\" paywall; a decision which was controversial because, unlike \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Times\" is a general news site, and it was said that rather than paying, users would seek the information without charge elsewhere. The paywall was deemed in practice to be neither a success nor a failure, having recruited 105,000 paying visitors. In contrast \"The Guardian\" resisted the use of a paywall, citing \"a belief in an open Internet\" and \"care in the community\" as its reasoning – an explanation found in its welcome article to online news readers who, blocked from \"The Times’s\" site following the implementation of their paywall, came to \"The Guardian\" for online news. \"The Guardian\" since experimented with other revenue-increasing ventures such as open API. Other papers, prominently \"The New York Times\", have oscillated between the implementation and removal of various paywalls. Because online news remains a relatively new medium, it has been suggested that experimentation is key to maintaining revenue while keeping online news consumers satisfied.\n\nSome implementations of paywalls proved unsuccessful, and have been removed. Experts who are skeptical of the paywall model include Arianna Huffington, who declared \"the paywall is history\" in a 2009 article in \"The Guardian\". In 2010, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales reportedly called \"The Times's\" paywall \"a foolish experiment.\" One major concern was that, with content so widely available, potential subscribers would turn to free sources for their news. The adverse effects of earlier implementations included decline in traffic and poor search engine optimization.\n\nPaywalls have become controversial, with partisans arguing over the effectiveness of paywalls in generating revenue and their effect on media in general. Critics of paywalls include many businesspeople, academics such as media professor Jay Rosen, and journalists such as Howard Owens and media analyst Matthew Ingram of GigaOm. Those who see potential in paywalls include investor Warren Buffett, former \"Wall Street Journal\" publisher Gordon Crovitz, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Some have changed their opinions of paywalls. Felix Salmon of Reuters was initially an outspoken skeptic of paywalls, but later expressed the opinion that they could be effective. A NYU media theorist, Clay Shirky, was initially a skeptic of paywalls, but in May 2012 wrote, \"[Newspapers] should turn to their most loyal readers for income, via a digital subscription service of the sort the [New York Times]\" Paywalls are rapidly changing journalism, with an impact on its practice and business model, and on freedom of information on the Internet, that is yet unclear.\n\nThree high level models of paywall have emerged: \"hard paywalls\" that allow no free content and prompt the user straight away to pay in order to read, listen or watch the content, \"soft paywalls\" that allow some free content, such as an abstract or summary, and \"metered paywalls\" that allow a set number of free articles that a reader can access over a specific period of time, allow more flexibility in what users can view without subscribing.\n\nThe \"hard\" paywall, as used by \"The Times\", requires paid subscription before any of their online content can be accessed. A paywall of this design is considered the riskiest option for the content provider. It is estimated that a website will lose 90% of its online audience and ad revenue only to gain it back through its ability to produce online content appealing enough to attract subscribers. News sites with \"hard\" paywalls can succeed if they:\nMany experts denounce the \"hard\" paywall because of its inflexibility, believing it acts as a major deterrent for users. Financial blogger Felix Salmon wrote that when one encounters a \"paywall and can’t get past it, you simply go away and feel disappointed in your experience.\" Jimmy Wales, founder of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, argued that the use of a \"hard\" paywall diminishes a site's influence. Wales stated that, by implementing a \"hard\" paywall, \"The Times\" \"made itself irrelevant.\" Though the \"Times\" had potentially increased its revenue, it decreased its traffic by 60%.\n\nThe \"soft\" paywall is best embodied by the metered model. The metered paywall allows users to view a specific number of articles before requiring paid subscription. In contrast to sites allowing access to select content outside the paywall, the metered paywall allows access to any article as long as the user has not surpassed the set limit. The \"Financial Times\" allows users to access 10 articles before becoming paid subscribers. \"The New York Times\" controversially implemented a metered paywall in March 2011 which let users view 20 free articles a month before paid subscription. In April 2012 \"New York Times\" reduced the number of free articles per month to 10. Their metered paywall has been defined as not only soft, but \"porous,\" because it also allows access to any link posted on a social media site, and up to 25 free articles a day if accessed through a search engine. The model is designed to allow the paper to \"retain traffic from light users\", which in turn allows the paper to keep their number of visitors high, while receiving circulation revenue from the site's heavy users. Using this model \"The New York Times\" garnered 224,000 subscribers in the first three months. While many proclaimed \"The New York Times\" paywall a success after it reported a profit in the third quarter of 2011, the profit increase is said to be \"ephemeral\" and \"largely based on a combination of cutbacks and the sale of assets.\" Though the success of a metered paywall would create revenue for the newspaper and increased freedom for the public, the profitability of the metered model has yet to be sufficiently proven.\n\nA \"softer\" paywall strategy includes allowing free access to select content, while keeping premium content behind a paywall. Such a strategy has been said to lead to \"the creation of two categories: cheap fodder available for free (often created by junior staffers), and more 'noble' content.\" This type of separation brings into question the egalitarianism of the online news medium. According to political and media theorist Robert A Hackett, \"the commercial press of the 1800s, the modern world’s first mass medium, was born with a profound democratic promise: to present information without fear or favour, to make it accessible to everyone, and to foster public rationality based on equal access to relevant facts.\".\n\n\"The Boston Globe\" implemented a version of this strategy in September 2011 by launching a second website, BostonGlobe.com, to solely offer content from the paper behind a hard paywall, aside from most sports content, which was kept open to compete against other local sports websites. BostonGlobe.com operates alongside a second, pre-existing news website Boston.com, which now only contains a limited amount of content from the subscription website on a delay, but carries a larger focus on community-oriented news. \"The Boston Globe\" editor Martin Baron described them as \"two different sites for two different kinds of reader – some understand [that] journalism needs to be funded and paid for. Other people just won't pay. We have a site for them.\" By March 2014 the site had over 60,000 digital subscribers; at that time, the \"Globe\" announced that it would replace the hard paywall with a metered system allowing users to read 10 articles without charge in any 30-day period. \"The Boston Globe\" editor Brian McGrory believed that an ability to sample the site's premium content would encourage more people to subscribe to the service. At the same time, McGrory also announced plans to give Boston.com a more distinct editorial focus, with a \"sharper voice that better captures the sensibilities of Boston\", while migrating other content by \"Globe\" writers, such as blogs from Boston.com to the paper's website, but keeping them freely available.\n\nProfessional reception to the implementation of paywalls has been mixed. Most discussion of paywalls centers on their success or failure as business ventures, and overlooks their ethical implications for maintaining an informed public. In the paywall debate there are those who see the implementation of a paywall as a \"sandbag strategy\" – a strategy which may help increase revenue in the short term, but not a strategy that will foster future growth for the newspaper industry. For the \"hard\" paywall specifically, however, there seems to be an industry consensus that the negative effects (loss of readership) outweigh the potential revenue, unless the newspaper targets a niche audience.\n\nThere are also those who remain optimistic about the use of paywalls to help revitalize floundering newspaper revenues. Those who believe implementing paywalls will succeed, however, continually buffer their opinion with contingencies. Bill Mitchell states that for a paywall to bring new revenue and not deter current readers, newspapers must: \"invest in flexible systems, exploit their journalists' expertise in niche areas, and, crucially, offer readers their money's worth in terms of new value.\" The State of the News Media's 2011 annual report on American journalism makes the sweeping claim that: \"[t]o survive financially, the consensus on the business side of news operations is that news sites not only need to make their advertising smarter, but they also need to find some way to charge for content and to invent new revenue streams other than display advertising and subscriptions.\" Even those who do not believe in the general success of paywalls recognize that, for a profitable future, newspapers must start generating more attractive content with added value, or investigate new sources of earning revenue.\n\nProponents of the paywall believe that it may be crucial for smaller publications to stay afloat. They argue that since 90 percent of advertising revenues are concentrated in the top 50 publishers, smaller operations can't necessarily depend on the traditional ad-supported free content model the way that larger sites can. Many paywall advocates also contend that people are more than willing to pay a small price for quality content. In a March 2013 guest post for VentureBeat, Malcolm CasSelle of MediaPass stated his belief that monetization would become \"something of a self-fulfilling prophecy: people [will] pay for content, and that money goes back into making the overall content even better.\"\n\nIn April 2013 the Newspaper Association of America released its industry revenue profile for 2012, which reported that circulation revenue grew by 5 percent for dailies, making it the first year of circulation growth in ten years. Digital-only circulation revenue reportedly grew 275%; print and digital bundled circulation revenue grew 499%. Along with the shift towards bundling print and online into combined access subscriptions, print-only circulation revenue declined 14%. This news corroborates a growing belief that digital subscriptions will be the key to securing the long-term survival of newspapers.\n\nGeneral user response to the implementation of paywalls has been measured through a number of recent studies which analyze readers' online news-reading habits. A study completed by the Canadian Media Research Consortium entitled \"Canadian Consumers Unwilling to Pay for News Online\", directly identifies the Canadian response to paywalls. Surveying 1,700 Canadians, the study found that 92% of participants who read the news online would rather find a free alternative than pay for their preferred site (in comparison to 82% of Americans), while 81% stated that they would absolutely not pay for their preferred online news site. Based on the poor reception of paid content by the participants, the study concludes with a statement similar to those of the media experts, stating, with the exception of prominent papers such as \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The Times\", that given the \"current public attitudes, most publishers had better start looking elsewhere for revenue solutions.\"\n\nHackett argues that a \"forum on the internet [...] can function as a specialized or smaller-scale public sphere.\" In the past, the internet has been an ideal location for the general public to gather and discuss relevant news issues – an activity made accessible first through free access to online news content, and subsequently the ability to comment on the content, creating a forum. Erecting a paywall restricts the public’s open communication with one another by restricting the ability to both read and share online news.\n\nThe obvious way in which a paywall restricts equal access to the online public sphere is through requiring payment, deterring those who do not want to pay, and barring those who cannot from joining the online discussion. The restriction of equal access was taken to a new extreme when the UK's \"The Independent\" in October 2011 placed a paywall on foreign readers only. Online news media have the proven ability to create global connection beyond the typical reach of a public sphere. In \"Democratizing Global Media,\" Hackett and global communications theorist Yuezhi Zhao describe how a new \"wave of media democratization arises in the era of the internet which has facilitated transnational civil society networks of and for democratic communication.\" By placing a paywall on their international readers, \"The Independent\" hinders the growth and democratic quality of the public sphere created by the internet.\n\nThe use of paywalls has also received many complaints from online news readers regarding an online subscriptions' inability to be shared like a traditional printed paper. While a printed paper can be shared among friends and family, the ethics behind sharing an online subscription are less clear because there is no physical object involved. \"The New York Times\"' \"ethicist\" columnist, Ariel Kaminer, addressing the question of sharing online subscription, states that \"sharing with your spouse or young child is one thing; sharing with friends or family who live elsewhere is another.\" The reader comments following Kaminer's response focus on the dichotomy between paying for a printed paper and paying for an online subscription. A printed paper's ease of access meant that more individuals could read a single copy, and that everyone who read the paper had the ability to send a letter to the editor without the hassle of registering or paying for the subscription. As such, the use of a paywall closes off the communication in both the personal realm and online. This opinion is not just held by online news readers, but also by opinion writers. Jimmy Wales comments that he \"would rather write [an opinion piece] where it is going to be read\", declaring that \"putting opinion pieces behind paywalls [makes] no sense.\" Without easy access to both read and share insights and opinions, the online news platform loses an essential characteristic of democratic exchange.\n\nThe use of a paywall to bar individuals from accessing news content online without payment, brings up numerous ethical questions. According to Hackett, media are already \"failing to furnish citizens with ready access to relevant civic information.\" The implementation of paywalls on previously free news content heightens this failure through intentional withholding. Hackett cites \"general cultural and economic mechanisms, such as the commodification of information and the dependence of commercial media on advertising revenue\" as two of the greatest influences on media performance. According to Hackett, these cultural and economic mechanisms \"generate violations of the democratic norm of equality.\" Implementation of a paywall addresses and intimately ties the two mechanisms cited by Hackett, as the paywall commodifies news content to bring in revenue from both readers and from increased circulation of printed paper’s ads. The result of these mechanisms, as stated by Hackett, is an impediment to \"equal access to relevant [news] facts.\"\nThe commodification of information–making news into a product that must be purchased–restricts the egalitarian founding principal of the newspaper. Editor’s Weblog reporter Katherine Travers, addressing this issue in a post discussing the future of \"The Washington Post\", asks, \"is digital subscription as permissible as charging a couple of dollars now and then for a paper copy?\" While subscription fees have long been attached to print newspapers, all other forms of news have traditionally been free. The UK's \"Daily Mail\" argues that print revenue is unique because \"people pay for the convenience of print in recognition of the special cost of production and delivery of a tangible product and because they purchase it whole.\" Online news, in comparison has existed as a medium of free dissemination. Poynter digital media fellow Jeff Sonderman outlines the ethical tension created by a paywall. Sonderman explains that \"[t]he underlying tension is that newspapers act simultaneously as businesses and as servants of the public’s interest. As for-profit enterprises, they have the right (the duty, even) to make money for shareholders or private owners. But most also claim to have a social compact, in which they safeguard the entire public interest and help their entire community shape and understand its shared values.\" By implementing a paywall before experimenting with other revenue-increasing initiatives, a newspaper arguably puts profit before the public.\n\nWhile there has been little coverage and discussion of the ethical implications of the paywall regarding newspapers' obligation to maintain a generally informed public, there are two prominent instances where companies have addressed the restriction of online news coverage. First is the removal of paywalls in the face of breaking news (news covering national or local emergencies). Second is Google’s \"First Click Free\" application, which news providers can implement if they wish to make news stories of interest accessible to readers regardless of a paywall.\n\nSome newspapers have removed their paywall from blocking content covering emergencies. When Hurricane Irene hit the United States' east coast in late August 2011, \"The New York Times\" declared that all storm related coverage, accessed both online and through mobile devices, would be free to readers. \"The New York Times\"‌' assistant managing editor, Jeff Roberts, discusses the paper's decision, stating: \"[w]e are aware of our obligations to our audience and to the public at large when there is a big story that directly impacts such a large portion of people.\" In his article discussing the removal of paywalls, Soderman commends \"The New York Times\"' action, stating that, while a publisher \"commits to a paywall as the best business strategy for his news company, there may be some stories or subjects which carry such importance and urgency that it is irresponsible to withhold them from nonsubscribers.\"\n\nGiven the overwhelming opinion that, regardless of paywall success, new revenue sources must be sought out for newspapers' financial success, it is important to highlight new business initiatives. According to Poynter media expert Bill Mitchell, in order for a paywall to generate sustainable revenue, newspapers must create \"new value\"—higher quality, innovation, etc.—in their online content that merits payment which previously free content did not. In addition to erecting paywalls, newspapers have been increasingly exploiting tablet and mobile news products, the profitability of which remains inconclusive. Some newspapers have also embraced targeting niche audiences, such as the Daily Mail's Mail Online in the UK. Another strategy, pioneered by \"The New York Times\", involves creating new revenue by packaging old content in e-books and special feature offerings, to create an appealing product for readers. The draw of these packages is not just the topic but the authors and the breadth of coverage. According to reporter Mathew Ingram, newspapers can benefit from these special offerings in two ways, first by taking advantage of old content when new interest arises, such as an anniversary or an important event, and second, through the creation of packages of general interest. \"The New York Times\", for example, has created packages on baseball, golf and the digital revolution.(ebooks)\n\nAn open API (application programming interface) makes the online news site \"a platform for data and information that [the newspaper company] can generate value from in other ways.\" Opening their API makes a newspaper's data available to outside sources, allowing developers and other services to make use of a paper's content for a fee. \"The Guardian\", in keeping with its \"belief in an open internet\", has been experimenting with the use of API. \"The Guardian\" has created an \"open platform\" which works on a three level system:\n\n\nWhile an open API is regarded as a gamble just like a paywall, journalist Matthew Ingram ethically notes that the use of an open API aims at \"profiting from the open exchange of information and other aspects of an online-media world, while the [paywall] is an attempt to create the kind of artificial information scarcity that newspapers used to enjoy.\" An open API keeps news content free to the public while the newspaper makes a profit from the quality and usefulness of its data to other businesses. The open API strategy can be commended because it takes the pressure off of the news room to continually investigate and explore new means of revenue. Instead, the open API strategy relies on the interest and ideas of those outside the newsroom, to whom the site's content and data are attractive.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It encompasses the neurological processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal. Various studies utilizing a combination of neuropsychological, neuropharmacological and functional neuroimaging approaches have suggested there is a positive relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the frontal lobe.\n\nA specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both cognitive planning and associated executive traits such as working memory.\n\nDisruption of the neural pathways, via various mechanisms such as traumatic brain injury, or the effects of neurodegenerative diseases between this area of the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia specifically the striatum (cortico-striatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning function.\n\nIndividuals who were born with very low birth weight (VLBW - <1500 grams) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) are at greater risk of various cognitive deficits including planning ability.\n\nThere are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure variance of planning ability between the subject and controls.\n\n\nIn test, participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right posterior areas of the frontal lobes showed no impairment.

In the 1930s, he made several optical compound microscopes and using a movie camera, took time-lapse microscopy movies of microbes. He also built microscopes that included polarizers.\n\nRife also reported that a 'beam ray' device of his invention could destroy the pathogens. Rife claimed to have documented a \"Mortal Oscillatory Rate\" for various pathogenic organisms, and to be able to destroy the organisms by vibrating them at this particular rate. According to the \"San Diego Evening Tribune\" in 1938, Rife stopped short of claiming that he could cure cancer, but did argue that he could \"devitalize disease organisms\" in living tissue, \"with certain exceptions\". \nRife's claims about his beam ray could not be independently replicated, and were discredited by independent researchers during the 1950s. An obituary in the \"Daily Californian\" described his death at the age of 83 on August 5, 1971, stating that he died penniless and embittered by the failure of his devices to garner scientific acceptance. Rife blamed the scientific rejection of his claims on a conspiracy involving the American Medical Association (AMA), the Department of Public Health, and other elements of \"organized medicine\", which had \"brainwashed and intimidated\" his colleagues.\n\nInterest in Rife's claims was revived in some alternative medical circles by the 1987 book by Barry Lynes, \"The Cancer Cure That Worked\", which claimed that Rife had succeeded in curing cancer, but that his work was suppressed by a powerful conspiracy headed by the American Medical Association. After this book's publication, a variety of devices bearing Rife's name were marketed as cures for diverse diseases such as cancer and AIDS. An analysis by \"Electronics Australia\" found that a typical 'Rife device' consisted of a nine-volt battery, wiring, a switch, a timer and two short lengths of copper tubing, which delivered an \"almost undetectable\" current unlikely to penetrate the skin. \n\nSuch 'Rife devices' have figured prominently in several cases of health fraud in the U.S., typically centered around the uselessness of the devices and the grandiose claims with which they are marketed. In a 1996 case, the marketers of a 'Rife device' claiming to cure numerous diseases including cancer and AIDS were convicted of felony health fraud. The sentencing judge described them as \"target[ing] the most vulnerable people, including those suffering from terminal disease\" and providing false hope. In some cases cancer patients who ceased chemotherapy and instead used these devices have died. Rife devices are currently classified as a subset of radionics devices, which are generally viewed as pseudomedicine by mainstream experts. In Australia, the use of Rife machines has been blamed for the deaths of cancer patients who might have been cured with conventional therapy. In 2002 John Bryon Krueger, who operated the Royal Rife Research Society, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in a murder and also received a concurrent 30-month sentence for illegally selling Rife devices. In 2009 a U.S. court convicted James Folsom of 26 felony counts for sale of the Rife devices sold as 'NatureTronics', 'AstroPulse', 'BioSolutions', 'Energy Wellness', and 'Global Wellness'.\n\nIn 1994, the American Cancer Society reported that Rife machines were being sold in a \"pyramid-like, multilevel marketing scheme\". A key component in the marketing of Rife devices has been the claim, initially put forward by Rife himself, that the devices were being suppressed by an establishment conspiracy against cancer \"cures\". The ACS describes Lynes' claims as implausible, noting that the book was written \"in a style typical of conspiratorial theorists\" and defied any independent verification. Although 'Rife devices' are not registered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and have been linked to deaths among cancer sufferers, the \"Seattle Times\" reported that over 300 people attended the 2006 Rife International Health Conference in Seattle, where dozens of unregistered devices were sold.\n\n\n"}

They were produced by Newall & Yohe, the same advertising agency which produced ABC's \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" series, and first aired on the NBC television network in September 1978. Voices for the Metric Marvels shorts included Lynn Ahrens, Bob Dorough, Bob Kaliban, and Paul Winchell.\n\nOn December 23, 1975, President Gerald Ford signed the Metric Conversion Act into law; this act gave official sanction for the United States to convert to the metric system of measurement. (The United States uses the U.S. Customary system, and not metric measurements.) Ford's presidential successor, Jimmy Carter, began to implement this law in earnest, helping to set up the U.S. Metric Board as a task force to determine when and how the U.S. would convert to metric. The USMB suggested that the transition ought to be voluntary and gradual, taking place over at least a ten-year period.\n\nAs part of this gradual transition, the USMB sponsored a number of public service announcements on radio and television. \"The Metric Marvels\" was one such television PSA, aired during NBC's Saturday morning cartoons. The shorts featured four animated metric superheroes: Meter Man, Liter Leader, Super Celsius and Wonder Gram. Each superhero performed songs designed to teach children the difference between the old English system and the new metric system.\n\n\nAlthough it shared the animation style, song quality and voice actors of the more popular \"Schoolhouse Rock!\", the series had far fewer episodes and was relatively short-lived. (Being shown on another network from \"Schoolhouse Rock!\", and not having the benefit of airing within the context of that series in rotation, also hurt the series. Short-form animated clips such as these were typically ABC's specialty, and NBC did not air such programs other than \"The Metric Marvels\".)\n\nUltimately, \"The Metric Marvels\" (along with all other U.S. efforts) failed to convince Americans to convert to the metric system. Americans largely ignored governmental attempts to push them in the direction of metrication and the USMB was eventually disbanded in 1982.\n\n"}

Once attached, the island is then known as a tied island. A tombolo is a sandy isthmus.\n\nSeveral islands tied together by bars which rise above the water level are called a tombolo cluster. Two or more tombolos may form an enclosure (called a lagoon) that can eventually fill with sediment.\n\nThe shoreline moves toward the island (or detached breakwater) due to accretion of sand in the lee of the island where wave energy and longshore drift are reduced and therefore deposition of sand occurs.\nTrue tombolos are formed by wave refraction and diffraction. As waves near an island, they are slowed by the shallow water surrounding it. These waves then bend around the island to the opposite side as they approach. The wave pattern created by this water movement causes a convergence of longshore drift on the opposite side of the island. The beach sediments that are moving by lateral transport on the lee side of the island will accumulate there, conforming to the shape of the wave pattern. In other words, the waves sweep sediment together from both sides. Eventually, when enough sediment has built up, the beach shoreline, known as a spit, will connect with an island and form a tombolo.\n\nIn the case of longshore drift from one single or a dominant direction, like at Chesil Beach or Spurn Head, the flow of material is along the coast in a movement which is not determined by the now tied island, such as Portland, which it has reached. In this and similar cases, while the strip of beach material connected to the Island may be technically called a tombolo because it links the island to the land, it is better thought of in terms of its formation – as a spit or otherwise.\n\nTombolos are more prone to natural fluctuations of profile and area as a result of tidal and weather events than a normal beach is. Because of this susceptibility to weathering, tombolos are sometimes made more sturdy through the construction of roads or parking lots. The sediments that make up a tombolo are coarser towards the bottom and finer towards the surface. It is easy to see this pattern when the waves are destructive and wash away finer grained material at the top, revealing coarser sands and cobbles as the base. \n\nSea level rise may also contribute to accretion, as material is pushed up with rising sea levels. This is the case with Chesil Beach (which connects the Isle of Portland to Dorset in England), notable because the shingle ridge is parallel rather than at right angles to the coast.\n\nTombolos demonstrate the sensitivity of shorelines. A small piece of land, such as an island, can change the way that waves move, leading to different deposition of sediments.\n\n\n"}

Since its conception, the station contributed immensely to the understanding of the bounties of Laguna de Bay and helped establish the duck farming industry on Los Baňos foreshores and pioneered in aquarium fish production in the country. It serves as the base for studies on limnology and biology of aquatic organisms aimed at developing strategies for the optimum utilization and sustained production of aquatic resources; developing, adapting or improving conventional technologies used to increase fish production; and promoting environment friendly approaches for effective water management.\n\nThe idea of institutionalizing a Limnological Station began as a result of collaboration between Dr. Leopoldo B. Uichanco, professor and head of the Department of Entomology of the then UP College of Agriculture and Albert William Herre, then Chief of Fisheries Division, Bureau of Science, Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources on ‘Dolong’, a species of goby that can be found in Laguna de Bay (Ref: Letter of Albert W. Herre to Dr. L.B. Uichangco dated January 19, 1926, UPLB LRS archive # 1). On August 17, 1928, the UP College of Agriculture Limnological Research and Aquatic Resources Management Center was established with Proclamation No. 176 signed by Governor General Henry L. Stimson (Gov. Gen from Dec. 27, 1927 to February 23, 1929) as its backbone and maintained as a facility under the Department of Entomology.\n\nUnder Dr. L.B. Uichangco’s diligent efforts, more researches on aquatic animals and more courses in Zoology were instituted. Dr. Deogracias V. Villadolid, upon his return after getting his Ph.D. in Aquatic Biology from Stanford University in 1927, Zoology was no longer a mere background to entomology. Dr. Villadolid, who became head of the station more than any other, was responsible for the enhanced development of fisheries in the Philippines. Dr. Villadolid together with Messrs. Andres M. Mane and F. Alonte eventually left the department in 1934 and transferred to the Bureau of Fisheries now known as the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) and served as its Director, and later became an aquatic biologist of the Fish and Game Administration (Gabriel, 1979), operations of the station naturally ceased.\n\nSince then, work has not been resumed primarily due to lack of funds and low priority assigned to the activity in addition to the onset of World War II in 1941.\n\nWorld War II brought the Department back to almost where it was in 1909. Cendana (1959) narrated that during the Japanese occupation, it was impossible to do any kind of research work. But instruction went on throughout the war years, although only two courses, Zoology 1 and Entomology 1, could be offered. During the end of war, retreating Japanese soldiers burned the Entomology Building on February 23, 1945. With it was burned everything that took the Department 32 years to accumulate including extensive insect and zoological collections, irreplaceable biological notes, valuable books and all the equipment.\n\nThe UP College of Agriculture was re-opened in June 1945, with Dean L.B. Uichanco as the concurrent head of the Department of Entomology. Upon the establishment of the College of Arts and Humanities (renamed on October 28, 1977 College of Arts and Sciences) on December 21, 1972, Zoology became one of its seven initial departments. When the programs in Hydrozoology and Wildlife Zoology were instituted, the need to reactivate and bring the Station back to its real potentials consequently started. In 1975, an ad hoc committee for the reactivation of the Station was formed with Dr. Cesar P. Madamba of the Department of Zoology, CAS as Chairman. Members of the committee were Dr. W.P. David, Dr. B.L. Cariaso, Dr. B.P. Gabriel, Dr. V.J. Calilung and Dr. C.R. Barril. They initiated plans and activities for the research station at the University level. After the construction of the new Station, an ad hoc committee was formed to conceptualize research plans and other developments regarding aquatic resources management, also with Dr. Madamba as Chairman with the original five members of the reactivation committee and Mr. Batoon from ACCI as an addition. The Station was renamed UPLB Limnological Research Station.\n\nAt the time it was reserved, the Station ground directly bordered Laguna de Bay. However, there has been built up - as a result in part of the accumulation of sand and shell by constant wave action and in part of the recession of the lake's water - a foreshore accretion between the original reservation and the Lake. Since the Station's research activities in the waters of the Lake cannot very well be carried out without direct access to it, the Station's premises were extended, as the waters of the Lake receded, to this accretion area. Aware of the need for a Freshwater Research Center, then Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos proclaimed the Reservation Area under Proclamation No. 1678, thereby amending Proclamation No. 176, signed at UPLB on October 10, 1977 making the Station's total land area at 4.077 hectares.\n\nThe UPLB Limnological Research Station (popularly called Limno Station or just Limno) is being managed by the Animal Biology Division, Institute of Biological Sciences, College of Arts and Sciences. The Station has a total land area of 4.78 ha. situated at the foreshore of Laguna de Bay in Barangay Mayondon, Los Baňos Laguna.\n\nOn January 28, 1994, the Station was identified and established as the National Center for Inland Waters Research and Development by the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development-Department of Science and Technology (PCAMRD-DOST). The Station is also the seat of PCAMRD-DOST's Southern Luzon Zonal Center for Aquatic and Marine R&D (Zonal Center 2).\n\nThe UPLB Limnological Research Station once again plays an important role in the fisheries sector through the leadership of their Station Manager, Dr. Pablo P. Ocampo, paving the way towards achieving its goals to: (1) develop optimum utilization and sustained production of aquatic resources; (2) conduct limnological studies; (3) conduct training and extension activities on different aspects of aquarium fish production; (4) develop culture technique for live feeds; (5) develop new aquarium varieties from indigenous fish species; and, (6) conduct captive breeding on some selected endemic/endangered freshwater fish species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Leader: Dr. Pablo P. Ocampo\n\nFish Ark Philippines: Direction for the Conservation of Native and Endemic Philippine Freshwater Fishes, a program funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) through the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD), with an overall objectives in line with the Philippine Strategy for Biological Conservation, the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and the Provisions No. 24 of Republic Act 9147 (otherwise known as the Philippine Conservation and Protection Act). The program will also address gaps in our knowledge of the species richness of freshwater aquatic fauna and inland ecosystems, particularly from inland waters.\n\nThe main goals of the program are the following: (1) to develop an equip aqua laboratory where threatened and endangered native or endemic freshwater fishes can be provided with safe refuge until such time that adequate and protected natural habitat can be established; (2) to establish a self-sustaining captive breeding program and produce adequate breeding stock as backup populations, and attempt to develop techniques to prepare animals for re-introduction; (3) to document the status of different freshwater species in the wild, and set priorities for species to be conserved or re-introduced; and, (4) to develop information delivery systems that would underscore conservation education and public awareness that can create local support necessary in sustaining re-introduction efforts.\n\nThe program has four component projects:\n(Project Leader: Dr. Vachel Gay V.

Before the 1950s, there had been a practice to eliminate water breaks in order \"to toughen up boys\" (see \"Junction Boys\" for an example).\n\nWater stops are used to combat interrelated dangers: hyperthermia, dehydration and hyponatremia (low blood level of sodium). Drinking water combats dehydration, while intake of electrolyte solutions (often provided by various sports drinks) combats hyponatremia and its severe form, water intoxication.\n\nIn a marathon, waters stops are usually at every 5K or at every 2 miles, resulting in 8-12 stops. Stopping for 10 seconds per station results in 1-2 minutes of added time, but the loss of stamina due to dehydration would add much more.\n\nCompared to dehydration, hyponatremia is a relatively recently recognized danger, and there are different opinions about how much water to drink at each water stop. Some texts say that thirst is not a reliable indicator of the need in water, while other say that obligatory drinking at every opportunity without real need increases the danger of hyponatremia. \"If you hear sloshing in your stomach... you can by-pass that water stop\".
