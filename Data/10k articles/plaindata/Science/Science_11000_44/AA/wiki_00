{"id": "10257708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10257708", "title": "Chemical library", "text": "Chemical library\n\nA chemical library or compound library is a collection of stored chemicals usually used ultimately in high-throughput screening or industrial manufacture. The chemical library can consist in simple terms of a series of stored chemicals. Each chemical has associated information stored in some kind of database with information such as the chemical structure, purity, quantity, and physiochemical characteristics of the compound.\n\nIn drug discovery high-throughput screening, it is desirable to screen a drug target against a selection of chemicals that try to take advantage of as much of the appropriate chemical space as possible. The chemical space of all possible chemical structures is extraordinarily large. Most stored chemical libraries do not typically have a fully represented or sampled chemical space mostly because of storage and cost concerns. However, since many molecular interactions cannot be predicted, the wider the chemical space that is sampled by the chemical library, the better the chance that high-throughput screening will find a \"hit\"—a chemical with an appropriate interaction in a biological model that might be developed into a drug.\n\nAn example of a chemical library in drug discovery would be a series of chemicals known to inhibit kinases, or in industrial processes, a series of catalysts known to polymerize resins.\n\nChemical libraries are usually generated for a specific goal and larger chemical libraries could be made of several groups of smaller libraries stored in the same location. In the drug discovery process for instance, a wide range of organic chemicals are needed to test against models of disease in high-throughput screening. Therefore, most of the chemical synthesis needed to generate chemical libraries in drug discovery is based on organic chemistry. A company that is interested in screening for kinase inhibitors in cancer may limit their chemical libraries and synthesis to just those types of chemicals known to have affinity for ATP binding sites or allosteric sites.\n\nGenerally, however, most chemical libraries focus on large groups of varied organic chemical series where an organic chemist can make many variations on the same molecular scaffold or molecular backbone. Sometimes chemicals can be purchased from outside vendors as well and included into an internal chemical library.\n\nDepending upon their scope and design, chemical libraries can also be classified as diverse oriented, Drug-like, Lead-like, peptide-mimetic, Natural Product-like, Targeted against a specific family of biological targets such Kinases, GPCRs, Proteases, PPI etc. Among the compound libraries should be annotated the Fragment Compound Libraries, which are mainly used for Fragment Based Drug Discovery FBDD.\n\nChemical libraries are usually designed by chemists and chemoinformatics scientists and synthesized by organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry. The method of chemical library generation usually depends on the project and there are many factors to consider when using rational methods to select screening compounds. Typically, a range of chemicals is screened against a particular drug target or disease model, and the preliminary \"hits\", or chemicals that show the desired activity, are re-screened to verify their activity. Once they are qualified as a \"hit\" by their repeatability and activity, these particular chemicals are registered and analysed. Commonalities among the different chemical groups are studied as they are often reflective of a particular chemical subspace. Additional chemistry work may be needed to further optimize the chemical library in the active portion of the subspace. When it is needed, more synthesis is completed to extend out the chemical library in that particular subspace by generating more compounds that are very similar to the original hits. This new selection of compounds within this narrow range are further screened and then taken on to more sophisticated models for further validation in the Drug Discovery Hit to Lead process.\n\nThe \"chemical space\" of all possible organic chemicals is large and increases exponentially with the size of the molecule. Most chemical libraries do not typically have a fully represented chemical space mostly because of storage and cost concerns.\n\nBecause of the expense and effort involved in chemical synthesis, the chemicals must be correctly stored and banked away for later use to prevent early degradation. Each chemical has a particular shelf life and storage requirement and in a good-sized chemical library, there is a timetable by which library chemicals are disposed of and replaced on a regular basis. Some chemicals are fairly unstable, radioactive, volatile or flammable and must be stored under careful conditions in accordance with safety standards such as OSHA.\n\nMost chemical libraries are managed with information technologies such as barcoding and relational databases. Additionally, robotics are necessary to fetch compounds in larger chemical libraries.\n\nBecause a chemical library's individual entries can easily reach up into the millions of compounds, the management of even modest-sized chemical libraries can be a full-time endeavor. Compound management is one such field that attempts to manage and upkeep these chemical libraries as well as maximizing safety and effectiveness in their management.\n\n\n"}

The smallest portion of DNA that can be isolated using this method comprises 10 million base pairs - hundreds or thousands of individual genes.\n\nScientists who study chromosomes are known as cytogeneticists. They are able to identify each chromosome based on its unique pattern of dark and light bands. Certain abnormalities, however, cause chromosomes to have unusual banding patterns. For example, one chromosome may have a piece of another chromosome inserted within it, creating extra bands. Or, a portion of a chromosome may be repeated over and over again, resulting in an unusually wide, dark band (known as a homogeneously staining region). Some chromosomal aberrations have been linked to cancer and inherited genetic disorders, and the chromosomes of many tumor cells exhibit irregular bands. To understand more about what causes these conditions, scientists hope to determine which genes and DNA sequences are located near these unusual bands. Chromosome microdissection is a specialized way of isolating these regions by removing the DNA from the band and making that DNA available for further study.\n\nTo prepare cells for chromosome microdissection, a scientist first treats them with a chemical that forces them into metaphase: a phase of the cell's life-cycle where the chromosomes are tightly coiled and highly visible. Next, the cells are dropped onto a microscope slide so that the nucleus, which holds all of the genetic material together, breaks apart and releases the chromosomes onto the slide. Then, under a microscope, the scientist locates the specific band of interest, and, using a very fine needle, tears that band away from the rest of the chromosome. The researcher next produces multiple copies of the isolated DNA using a procedure called PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The scientist uses these copies to study the DNA from the unusual region of the chromosome in question.\n\n\n"}

Puerto Rico, whose economy depended heavily on its agriculture, felt the effects of some of the crop diseases. Scientists such as Dr. Agustín Stahl, Fermín Tangüis and Fernando López Tuero conducted investigations and experiments in the fields of agriculture, botany, ethnology and zoology. The findings of their investigations helped Puerto Rico's agricultural industry.\n\nWith the advances in medical technologies and the coming of the Space Age of the 20th century, Puerto Ricans have expanded their horizons and have made many contributions in various scientific fields, among them the fields of aerospace and medicine.\n\nThere are many Puerto Rican scientists involved in the American space program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). According to an article written by Margarita Santori Lopez for the official newspaper of the University of Puerto Rico's Mayagüez Campus, \"Prensa RUM\", as of 2003, of the 115 Hispanics working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, 70 were Puerto Ricans or of Puerto Rican descent. According to a research conducted during the period of 1990 to 1998 by Puerto Rican scientists in science and technology, Puerto Rican scientific production was greater than in any other Caribbean country and the sixth largest in all of Latin America.\n\nThe following is a list of some of Puerto Rico's notable scientists and inventors with short profiles that include the scientific contributions, inventions and achievements in their respective fields. The list is not limited to people born in Puerto Rico, it also includes people who are of full or partial Puerto Rican ancestry, and many long-term residents and who have made Puerto Rico their home, and who are recognized for their life and/or work.\n\nAerospace comprises the atmosphere of Earth and surrounding space. Typically the term is used to refer to the industry that researches, designs, manufactures, operates, and maintains vehicles moving through air and space.\n\nAerospace physiology refers to effects on the human body caused by characteristics of the aerospace environment.\n\nIn the 19th Century, Puerto Rico's economy depended on its agricultural industry. Among the products which Puerto Rico exported were tobacco, cotton, ginger, pineapples and citrus fruits. The two main agricultural products whose production dominated the island's economy were sugar and coffee.\n\n\n\n\nArchaeology is the science that studies human cultures through the recovery, documentation, analysis, and interpretation of material remains and environmental data, including architecture, artifacts, features, biofacts, and landscapes.\n\nAstronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects (such as stars, planets, comets, and galaxies) and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere (such as the cosmic background radiation). It is concerned with the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and motion of celestial objects, as well as the formation and development of the universe.\n\nAstrophysics is the branch of astronomy that deals with the physics of the universe, including the physical properties (luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition) of celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, and the interstellar medium, as well as their interactions.\n\nBiochemistry is the study of the chemical processes in living organisms. It deals with the structure and function of cellular components, such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules.\n\nBotany is a branch of biology and is the scientific study of plant life and development.\n\nEarth system science (ESS) is the application of systems science to the Earth sciences. In particular, it considers interactions between the Earth's \"spheres\"—atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, pedosphere, biosphere, and, even, the magnetosphere — as well as the impact of human societies on these components.\n\nEcology is the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of life and the interactions between organisms and their natural environment.\n\nHydrometeorology is a branch of meteorology and hydrology that studies the transfer of water and energy between the land surface and the lower atmosphere.\n\nMarine biology is the scientific study of living organisms in the ocean or other marine or brackish bodies of water.\n\nAnatomy\n\nAnatomy is a branch of biology and medicine that is the consideration of the structure of living things.\nBiotechnology\n\nBiotechnology is a field of applied biology that involves the use of living organisms and bioprocesses in engineering, technology, medicine and other fields requiring bioproducts.\nCardiology\n\nCardiology is the branch of internal medicine dealing with disorders of the heart and blood vessels.\n\nEmbryology\n\nEmbryology is the study of the development of an embryo. An embryo is defined as any organism in a stage before birth or hatching, or in plants, before germination occurs.\nEndocrinology\n\nEndocrinology is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the endocrine system and its specific secretions called hormones.\nImmunology\n\nImmunology is the branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the immunological system that helps the body protect itself from foreign substances and illnesses.\nNephrology\n\nNephrology is a branch of internal medicine and pediatrics dealing with the study of the function and diseases of the kidney.\nOdontology\n\nOdontology is the scientific study of the structure, development, and abnormalities of the teeth.\n\nOncology\n\nOncology is the branch of medicine that studies tumors (cancer) and seeks to understand their development, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.\nOrgan transplantation\n\nAn organ transplant is the moving of a whole or partial organ from one body to another (or from a donor site on the patient's own body), for the purpose of replacing the recipient's damaged or failing organ with a working one from the donor site. Organ donors can be \"living\" or \"deceased\" (previously referred to as cadaveric). In Puerto Rico, the first Kidney organ transplants were realized in the city of Ponce between 1968 and 1972.\nPediatrics\n\nPediatrics is the branch of medicine that deals with the medical care of infants, children, and adolescents.\n\nPublic health\n\nTeratology\n\nTeratology refers to disfiguring birth defects or malformations. Another term for this is dysmorphology, meaning \"the study of abnormal form.\"\n\nMicrobiology is the study of \"microorganisms\", which are unicellular or cell-cluster microscopic organisms. This includes eukaryotes such as fungi and protists, and prokaryotes, which are bacteria and archaea. Viruses, though not strictly classed as living organisms, are also studied.\n\nMycology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy and their use to humans as a source for tinder, medicinals (e.g., penicillin) as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. Published in Florence, this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic classification of grasses, mosses and fungi. The term \"mycology\" and the complimentary \"mycologist\" were first used in 1836 by M.J. Berkeley.\n\nNanotechnology (sometimes shortened to \"nanotech\") is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. \n\nPhysics is the study of the laws and constituents of the material world and encompasses a wide variety of fields, including condensed matter physics, biological physics, astrophysics, particle physics, and others.\n\nPsychology is an academic and applied discipline involving the scientific study of mental processes and behavior.\n\nA Rocket scientist is an aerospace engineer who specialty are the rockets which launch spacecraft into or operate in outer space.\n\nSpace physics is also known as space plasma physics.\n\nZoology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of animals.\n\nPuerto Rican inventors earned an average of sixteen patents per year in the late seventies, twenty patents per year in the eighties, and twenty-seven patents per year in the nineties. The total number of patents issued by the U.S. Patent Office has seen similar increases.\n\nIn the field of Aerospace (see \"Aerospace\" section) Olga D. González-Sanabria contributed to the development of the \"Long Cycle-Life Nickel-Hydrogen Batteries\" which helps enable the International Space Station power system; Mercedes Reaves contributed to the design of a viable full-scale solar sail and the development and testing of a scale model solar sail; Dr. Pedro Rodriguez invented a portable, battery-operated lift seat for people suffering from knee arthritis; Dr. Felix Soto Toro developed the Advanced Payload Transfer Measurement System (ASPTMS) (Electronic 3D measuring system) and Dr. Juan R. Cruz contributed in the development of entry, descent, and landing (EDL) systems for robotic and human exploration missions. Puerto Ricans have also invented products for commercial use.\n\nHydroelectric Wave-Energy Conversion System\nSemiconductors\n\nThe cuatro is the national instrument of Puerto Rico.

Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun.\n\nThis list is incomplete, currently containing 34 exoplanets, 11 of which probably lie inside their star's habitable zone.\n\nThere are roughly 2,000 stars at a distance of up to 50 light-years from the Solar System (64 of them are yellow-orange \"G\" stars like our Sun). As many as 15% of them can have Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones.\n\nOn November 4, 2013, astronomers reported, based on \"Kepler\" space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way Galaxy. 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars. The nearest such planet may be as close as 12 light-years away.\n\nOn August 24, 2016, astronomers announced the discovery of a rocky planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth. Called Proxima b, the planet is 1.3 times the mass of Earth and has an orbital period of roughly 11.2 Earth days. However Proxima Centauri’s classification as a red dwarf casts doubts on the habitability of any exoplanets in its orbit due to low stellar flux, high probability of tidal locking, small circumstellar habitable zones and high stellar variation. Another likely candidate is Alpha Centauri, Earth’s nearest Sun-like star system 4.37 light years away. Estimates place the probability of finding a habitable planet around Alpha Centauri A or B at roughly 85%. Alpha Centauri is the target of several exoplanet-finding missions, including Breakthrough Starshot and Mission Centaur, the latter of which is chronicled in the 2016 documentary film, \"The Search for Earth Proxima.\"\n\nNote: There is no scientific consensus about terrestrial composition of most of the planets in the list. Sources in the \"Main source\" column confirm the \"possibility\" of terrestrial composition.\n\nIn September 2012, the discovery of two planets orbiting Gliese 163 was announced. One of the planets, Gliese 163 c, about 6.9 times the mass of Earth and somewhat hotter, was considered to be within the habitable zone, but is probably not terrestrial. In May 2016, the finding of three earth-like planets of ultracool dwarf TRAPPIST-1 has been released.\n\nNote: in most cases the composition of the atmosphere and atmosphere pressure of exoplanets are unknown, so surface temperatures are estimates based on computer models and expert opinions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52973193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52973193", "title": "Nano-FTIR", "text": "Nano-FTIR\n\nNano-FTIR (nanoscale Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) is a scanning probe technique that can be considered as a combination of two techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). As s-SNOM, nano-FTIR is based on atomic-force microscopy (AFM), where a sharp tip is illuminated by an external light source and the tip-scattered light (typically back-scattered) is detected as a function of tip position. A typical nano-FTIR setup thus consists of an atomic force microscope, a broadband infrared light source used for tip illumination, and a Michelson interferometer acting as Fourier transform spectrometer. In nano-FTIR, the sample stage is placed in one of the interferometer arms, which allows for recording both amplitude and phase of the detected light (unlike conventional FTIR that normally does not yield phase information). Scanning the tip allows for performing hyperspectral imaging (i.e. complete spectrum at every pixel of the scanned area) with nanoscale spatial resolution determined by the tip apex size. The use of broadband infrared sources enables the acquisition of continuous spectra, which is a distinctive feature of nano-FTIR compared to s-SNOM.\nNano-FTIR is capable of performing infrared (IR) spectroscopy of materials in ultrasmall quantities and with nanoscale spatial resolution. The detection of a single molecular complex and the sensitivity to a single monolayer has been shown. Recording infrared spectra as a function of position can be used for nanoscale mapping of the sample chemical composition, performing a local ultrafast IR spectroscopy and analyzing the nanoscale intermolecular coupling, among others. A spatial resolution of 10 nm to 20 nm is routinely achieved\nFor organic compounds, polymers, biological and other soft matter, nano-FTIR spectra can be directly compared to the standard FTIR databases, which allows for a straightforward chemical identification and characterization.\n\nNano-FTIR does not require special sample preparation and is typically performed under ambient conditions. It uses an AFM operated in noncontact mode that is intrinsically nondestructive and sufficiently gentle to be suitable for soft-matter and biological sample investigations. Nano-FTIR can be utilized from THz to visible spectral range (and not only in infrared as its name suggests) depending on the application requirements and availability of broadband sources. Nano-FTIR is complementary to Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), SNOM, AFM-IR and other scanning probe methods that are capable of performing vibrational analysis.\n\nNano-FTIR is based on s-SNOM, where the infrared beam from a light source is focused onto a sharp, typically metalized AFM tip and the backscattering is detected. The tip greatly enhances the illuminating IR light in the nanoscopic volume around its apex, creating a strong near field. A sample, brought into this near field, interacts with the tip electromagnetically and modifies the tip (back)scattering in the process. Thus by detecting tip scattering, one can obtain information about the sample.\n\nNano-FTIR detects the tip-scattered light interferometrically. The sample stage is placed into one arm of a conventional Michelson interferometer, while a mirror on a piezo stage is placed into another, reference arm. Recording the backscattered signal while translating the reference mirror yields an interferogram. The subsequent Fourier transform of this interferogram returns the near-field spectra of the sample. \n\nPlacement of the sample stage into one of the interferometer's arms (instead of outside of the interferometer as typically implemented in conventional FTIR) is a key element of nano-FTIR. It boosts the weak near-field signal due to interference with the strong reference field, helps to eliminate completely the background caused by parasitic scattering off everything that falls into large diffraction-limited beam focus, and most importantly, allows for recording of both amplitude \"s\" and phase \"φ\" spectra of the tip-scattered radiation. With the detection of phase, nano-FTIR provides complete information about near fields, which is essential for quantitative studies and many other applications. For example, for soft matter samples (organics, polymers, biomaterials, etc.), \"φ\" directly relates to the absorption in the sample material. This permits a direct comparison of nano-FTIR spectra with conventional absorption spectra of the sample material, thus allowing for simple spectroscopic identification according to standard FTIR databases.\n\nNano-FTIR was first described in 2005 in a patent by Ocelic and Hillenbrand as Fourier transform spectroscopy of tip-scattered light with an asymmetric spectrometer (i.e. the tip/sample placed inside one of the interferometer arms). The first realization of s-SNOM with FTIR was demonstrated in 2006 in the laboratory of F. Keilmann using a mid-infrared source based on a simple version of nonlinear difference-frequency generation (DFG). However, the mid-IR spectra in this realization were recorded using dual comb spectroscopy principles, yielding a discrete set of frequencies and thus demonstrating a multiheterodyne imaging technique rather than nano-FTIR. The first continuous spectra were recorded only in 2009 in the same laboratory using a supercontinuum IR beam also obtained by DFG in GaSe upon superimposing two pulsed trains emitted from Er-doped fiber laser. This source further allowed in 2011 for the first assessment of nanoscale-resolved spectra of SiC with excellent quality and spectral resolution. At the same time, Huth et al. in the laboratory of R. Hillenbrand used IR radiation from a simple glowbar source in combination with the principles of Fourier transform spectroscopy, to record IR spectra of p-doped Si and its oxides in a semiconductor device. In the same work the term nano-FTIR was first introduced. However, an insufficient spectral irradiance of glowbar sources limited the applicability of the technique to the detection of strongly-resonant excitations such phonons; and the early supercontinuum IR laser sources, while providing more power, had very narrow bandwidth (<300 cm). Further attempt to improve the spectral power, while retaining the large bandwidth of a glowbar source was made by utilizing the IR radiation from a high temperature argon arc source (also known as plasma source). However, due to lack of commercial availability and rapid development of the IR supercontinium laser sources, plasma sources are not widely utilized in nano-FTIR.\n\nThe breakthrough in nano-FTIR came upon the development of high-power broadband mid-IR laser sources, which provided large spectral irradiance in a sufficiently large bandwidth (mW-level power in ~1000 cm-1 bandwidth) and enabled truly broadband nanoscale-resolved material spectroscopy capable of detecting even the weakest vibrational resonances. Particularly, it has been shown that nano-FTIR is capable of measuring molecular fingerprints which match well with far-field FTIR spectra, owing to the asymmetry of the nano-FTIR spectrometer that provides phase and thus gives access to the molecular absorption. Recently, the first nanoscale-resolved infrared hyperspectral imaging of a co-polymer blend was demonstrated, which allowed for the application of statistical techniques such as multivariate analysis – a widely used tool for heterogeneous sample analysis.\n\nAdditional boost to the development of nano-FTIR came from the utilization of the synchrotron radiation that provide extreme bandwidth, yet at the expense of weaker IR spectral irradiance compared to broadband laser sources.\n\nThe nano-FTIR technology has been commercialized by neaspec – a Germany-based spin-off company of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry founded by Ocelic, Hillenbrand and Keilmann in 2007 and based on the original patent by Ocelic and Hillenbrand. The detection module optimized for broadband illumination sources was first made available in 2010 as a part of the standard neaSNOM microscope system. At this time, broadband IR-lasers have not been yet commercially available, however experimental broadband IR-lasers prove that the technology works perfect and that it has a huge application potential across many disciplines. The first nano-FTIR was commercially available in 2012 (supplied with still experimental broadband IR-laser sources), becoming the first commercial system for broadband infrared nano-spectroscopy. In 2015 neaspec develops and introduces Ultrafast nano-FTIR, the commercial version of ultrafast nano-spectroscopy. Ultrafast nano-FTIR is a ready-to-use upgrade for nano-FTIR to enable pump-probe nano-spectroscopy at best-in-class spatial resolution. The same year the development of a cryo-neaSNOM – the first system of its kind to enable nanoscale near-field imaging & spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures – was announced.\n\nNano-FTIR systems can be easily integrated into synchrotron radiation beamlines. The use of synchrotron radiation allows for acquisition of an entire mid-infrared spectrum at once. Synchrotrons radiation has already been utilized in synchrotron infrared microscopectroscopy - the technique most widely used in biosciences, providing information on chemistry on microscales of virtually all biological specimens, like bone, plants, and other biological tissues. Nano-FTIR brings the spatial resolution to 10-20 nm scale (vs. ~2-5 μm in microspectroscopy), which has been utilized for broadband spatially-resolved spectroscopy of crystalline and phase-change materials, semiconductors, minerals, biominerals and proteins.\n\nNano-FTIR is highly suitable for performing local ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy due to intereferometric detection and an intrinsic ability to vary the probe delay time. It has been applied for studies of ultrafast nanoscale plasmonic phenomena in Graphene, for performing nanospectroscopy of InAs nanowires with subcycle resolution and for probing the coherent vibrational dynamics of nanoscopic ensembles.\n\nThe availability of both amplitude and phase of the scattered field measured in nano-FTIR allows for the recovery of both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, i.e. finding the index of refraction and the extinction coefficient of the sample. While such recovery for arbitrarily-shaped samples or samples exhibiting collective excitations, such as phonons, requires a resource-demanding numerical optimization, for soft matter samples (polymers, biological matter and other organic materials) the recovery of the dielectric function could often be performed in real time using fast semi-analytical approaches. One of such approaches is based on the Taylor expansion of the scattered field with respect to a small parameter that isolates the dielectric properties of the sample and allows for a polynomial representation of measured near-field contrast. With an adequate tip-sample interaction model and with known measurement parameters (e.g. tapping amplitude, demodulation order, reference material, etc.), the sample permittivity formula_1 can be determined as a solution of a simple polynomial equation\n\nNear-field methods, including nano-FTIR, are typically viewed as a technique for surface studies due to short probing ranges of about couple tip radii (~20-50 nm). However it has been demonstrated that within such probing ranges, s-SNOM is capable of detecting subsurface features and sample extents, which could be used for the investigations of samples capped by thin protective layers, among others.\n\nThe detection of both near-field amplitude and phase also provides means for the quantitative studies of the sample interior (within the probing range of the tip near field, of course). This could been utilized for the recovery of thickness and permittivity of layered films and nanostructures, for the nanoscale profiling of multiphase materials and other subsurface analysis of samples. In other words, nano-FTIR has a unique capability of recovering the same information about thin-film samples that is typically returned by ellipsometry or impedance spectroscopy, yet with nanoscale spatial resolution.\n\nNano-FTIR uses scattered IR light to obtain information about the sample and therefore, has the potential of investigating biological (or other) samples in their natural environment, such as water. The feasibility of such investigation has already been shown via imaging through a capping Graphene layer (using the same s-SNOM platform that nano-FTIR utilizes).\n\nReveling the fundamentals of phase transitions in superconductors, correlated oxides, Bose-Einstein condensates of surface polaritons, etc. require spectroscopic studies at the characteristically nanometer length scales and in cryogenic environment. Nano-FTIR is compatible with cryogenic s-SNOM that has already been utilized for reveling a nanotextured coexistence of metal and correlated Mott insulator phases in Vanadium oxide near the metal-insulator transition.\n\nNano-FTIR can be operated is different atmospheric environments by enclosing the system into an isolated chamber or a glove box. Such operation has already been used for the investigation of highly reactive Lithium-ion battery components.\n\nNano-FTIR has a plenitude of applications, including polymers and polymer composites, organic films, semiconductors, biological research (cell membranes, proteins structure, studies of single viruses), chemistry and catalysis, photochemistry, minerals and biominerals, geochemistry, corrosion and materials sciences, low-dimensional materials, photonics, energy storage, cosmetics, pharmacology and environmental sciences\n\nNano-FTIR has been used for the nanoscale spectroscopic chemical identification of polymers and nanocomposites, for \"in situ\" investigation of structure and crystallinity of organic thin films, for strain characterization and relaxation in crystalline materials and for high-resolution spatial mapping of catalytic reactions, among others.\n\nNano-FTIR has been used for investigation of protein secondary structure, bacterial membrane, detection and studies of single viruses and protein complexes. It has been applied to the detection of biominerals in bone tissue.\n\nNano-FTIR has been used for nanoscale free carrier profiling and quantification of free carrier concentration in semiconductor devices., for evaluation of ion beam damage in nanoconstriction devices, and general spectroscopic characterization of semiconductor materials\n\nThe nano-FTIR interferometrically detects light scattered from the tip-sample system, formula_2. The power at the detector can be written as\n\nformula_3\n\nwhere formula_4is the reference field. The scattered field can be written as\n\nformula_5\n\nand is dominated by parasitic background scattering, formula_6, from the tip shaft, cantilever sample roughness and everything else which falls into the diffraction-limited beam focus. To extract the near-field signal, formula_7, originating from the \"hot-spot\" below the tip apex (which carries the nanoscale-resolved information about the sample properties) a small harmonic modulation of the tip height \"H\" (i.e. oscillating the tip) with frequency \"Ω\" is provided and the detector signal is demodulated at higher harmonics of this frequency n\"Ω\" with n=1,2,3,4... The background is nearly insensitive to small variations of the tip height and is nearly completely eliminated for sufficiently high demodulation orders (typically formula_8). Mathematically this can be shown by expanding formula_6 and formula_7 into a Fourier series, which yields the following (approximated) expression for the demodulated detector signal:\n\nformula_11\n\nwhere <math>I_{n}=s_n {\\rm e}^\n"}

The free variable \"x\" corresponds to a source vertex \"v\", thus having no defining equation. Each equation corresponds to a fragment of a directed graph \"G\"=(\"V\",\"E\") as show in the figure.\n\nThe edge weights define a function \"f\" from \"E\" to \"R\". Finally fix an output vertex \"v\". A signal-flow graph is the collection of this data \"S\" = (\"G\"=(\"V\",\"E\"), \"v\",\"v\" formula_2 \"V\", \"f\" : \"E\" → \"R\"). The equations may not have a solution, but when they do,\n\nwith \"T\" an element of \"R\" called the gain.\n\nThere exist several noncommutative generalizations of Mason's rule. The most common is the return loop method (sometimes called the forward return loop method (FRL), having a dual backward return loop method (BRL)). The first rigorous proof is attributed to Riegle, so it is sometimes called Riegle's rule.\n\nAs with Mason's rule, these gain expressions combine terms in a graph-theoretic manner (loop-gains, path products, etc.). They are known to hold over an arbitrary noncommutative ring and over the semiring of regular expressions.\n\nThe method starts by enumerating all paths from input to output, indexed by \"j\" formula_2 \"J\". We use the following definitions:\n\n\n\nThe contribution of the \"j\"-th path to the gain is the product along the path, alternating between the path product weights \nand the node factors:\n\nso the total gain is\n\nConsider the signal-flow graph shown. From \"x\" to \"z\", there are two path products: (\"d\") and (\"e,a\"). Along (\"d\"), the FRL and BRL contributions coincide as both share same loop gain (whose split reappears in the upper right of the table below):\n\nMultiplying its node factor and path weight, its gain contribution is\n\nAlong path (\"e,a\"), FRL and BRL differ slightly, each having distinct splits of vertices \"y\" and \"z\" as shown in the following table.\n\nAdding to \"T\", the alternating product of node factors and path weights, we obtain two gain expressions:\n\nand\n\nThese values are easily seen to be the same using identities (\"ab\") = \"b\"\"a\" and \"a\"(1-\"ba\")=(1-\"ab\")\"a\".\n\nConsider equations\n\nand\n\nThis system could be modeled as scalar signal-flow graph with multiple inputs and outputs. But, the variables naturally fall into layers, which can be collected into vectors \n\"x\"=(\"x\",\"x\")\n\"y\"=(\"y\",\"y\") and\n\"z\"=(\"z\",\"z\").\nThis results in much simpler matrix signal-flow graph as shown in the figure at the top of the article.\n\nApplying the forward return loop method is trivial as there's a single path product (\"C\",\"A\") with a single loop-gain \"B\" at \"y\". Thus as a matrix, this system has a very compact representation of its input-output map\n\nAn important kind of noncommutative signal-flow graph is a finite state automaton over an alphabet formula_15.\n\nSerial connections correspond to the concatenation of words, which can be extended to subsets of the free monoid formula_16. For \"A\", \"B\" formula_17\n\nParallel connections correspond to set union, which in this context is often written \"A\"+\"B\".\n\nFinally, self-loops naturally correspond to the Kleene closure\n\nwhere formula_20 is the empty word. The similarity to the infinite geometric series\n\nis more than superficial, as expressions of this form serve as 'inversion' in this semiring.\n\nIn this way, the subsets of formula_16 built of from finitely many of these three operations can be identified with the semiring of regular expressions. Similarly, finite graphs whose edges are weighted by subsets of formula_16 can be identified with finite automata, though generally that theory starts with singleton sets as in the figure.\n\nThis automaton is deterministic so we can unambiguously enumerate paths via words. Using the return loop method, path contributions are:\n\n\n\n\nThus the language accepted by this automaton (the gain of its signal-flow graph) is the sum of these terms\n\n\n"}

Many software research groups consider auto-tuning the proper nomenclature.\n\nSelf-tuning systems typically exhibit non-linear adaptive control. Self-tuning systems have been a hallmark of the aerospace industry for decades, as this sort of feedback is necessary to generate optimal multi-variable control for non-linear processes. In the telecommunications industry, adaptive communications are often used to dynamically modify operational system parameters to maximize efficiency and robustness.\n\nExamples of self-tuning systems in computing include:\n\nPerformance benefits can be substantial. Professor Jack Dongarra, an American computer scientist, claims self-tuning boosts performance, often on the order of 300%.\n\nDigital self-tuning controllers are an example of self-tuning systems at the hardware level.\n\nSelf-tuning systems are typically composed of four components: expectations, measurement, analysis, and actions. The expectations describe how the system should behave given exogenous conditions.\n\nMeasurements gather data about the conditions and behaviour. Analysis helps determine whether the expectations are being met- and which subsequent actions should be performed. Common actions are gathering more data and performing dynamic reconfiguration of the system.\n\nSelf-tuning (self-adapting) systems of automatic control are systems whereby adaptation to randomly changing conditions is performed by means of automatically changing parameters or via automatically determining their optimum configuration \n. In any non-self-tuning automatic control system there are parameters which have an influence on system stability and control quality and which can be tuned. If these parameters remain constant whilst operating conditions (such as input signals or different characteristics of controlled objects) are substantially varying, control can degrade or even become unstable. Manual tuning is often cumbersome and sometimes impossible. In such cases, not only is using self-tuning systems technically and economically worthwhile, but it could be the only means of robust control. Self-tuning systems can be with or without parameter determination.\n\nIn systems with parameter determination the required level of control quality is achieved by automatically searching for an optimum (in some sense) set of parameter values. Control quality is described by a generalised characteristic which is usually a complex and not completely known or stable function of the primary parameters. This characteristic is either measured directly or computed based on the primary parameter values. The parameters are then tentatively varied. An analysis of the control quality characteristic oscillations caused by the varying of the parameters makes it possible to figure out if the parameters have optimum values, i.e.. if those values deliver extreme (minimum or maximum) values of the control quality characteristic. If the characteristic values deviate from an extremum, the parameters need to be varied until optimum values are found. Self-tuning systems with parameter determination can reliably operate in environments characterised by wide variations of exogenous conditions.\n\nIn practice systems with parameter determination require considerable time to find an optimum tuning, i.e. time necessary for self-tuning in such systems is bounded from below. Self-tuning systems without parameter determination do not have this disadvantage. In such systems, some characteristic of control quality is used (e.g., the first time derivative of a controlled parameter). Automatic tuning makes sure that this characteristic is kept within given bounds. Different self-tuning systems without parameter determination exist that are based on controlling transitional processes, frequency characteristics, etc. All of those are examples of closed-circuit self-tuning systems, whereby parameters are automatically corrected every time the quality characteristic value falls outside the allowable bounds. In contrast, open-circuit self-tuning systems are systems with para-metrical compensation, whereby input signal itself is controlled and system parameters are changed according to a specified procedure. This type of self-tuning can be close to instantaneous. However, in order to realise such self-tuning one needs to control the environment in which the system operates and a good enough understanding of how the environment influences the controlled system is required.\n\nIn practice self-tuning is done through the use of specialised hardware or adaptive software algorithms. Giving software the ability to self-tune (adapt):\n\n\n"}

Animals who are sham fed in this manner eat and swallow almost continually without becoming satiated. Chewing gum can also be considered sham feeding, as whilst very-little or no nutrients are being absorbed into the body, the process of chewing still stimulates digestive system nerves which trigger the release of gastrointestinal hormones, and also increase the production of both saliva and pancreatic secretions.

The separation, second rendezvous, and docking occurred on November 14 and was aimed to test accuracy and reliability of equipment and sensors in a bright environment. On November 17, the capsule was autonomously de-orbited.\n\nThe mission also featured a biological sample supplied by Germany and the European Space Agency, which was cited as an example of \"international cooperation in the field of manned space\" by Zhang Jianqi, deputy chief commander of China's manned space programme.\n\nAccording to Zhang Bainan, the chief designer of China's spacecraft systems, Shenzhou 8 was the last to see significant modifications from previous models. Future flights will use the same spacecraft design, which is intended for production of multiple units of the same design.\n\n"}

Voice itself could be 'packaged' and sent through the IP backbone so that it reaches its marked 'address'. In a technical sense, the process of sending 'voice packets' is a semi passive way of communication. However, given the speed at which it could be delivered can make the communication sound seamless.\n\n"}

WFME’s main objective is to \"enhance the quality of medical education worldwide, with promotion of the highest scientific and ethical standards in medical education\". The organisation develops standards for medical education and promotes accreditation of medical schools. It also co-manages the World Directory of Medical Schools.\n\nWFME works in partnership with its six Regional Associations for Medical Education and other international organisations including the World Health Organization and the World Medical Association, with WFME’s associate members, and with medical schools worldwide.\n\nWFME was founded on the 30 September 1972 in Copenhagen. The founding organisations included the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Medical Association (WMA).\n\nIn 1988 the Edinburgh declaration was approved at the World Conference on Medical Education, calling for greater co-operation between the health system and the education system, reflecting national needs in medical education and continuing lifelong education of medical staff to achieve quality in practice. The Declaration was adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1989.\n\nThe aspect of medical education responding to the national needs was also stressed at the World Summit on Medical Education 1993.\n\nWFME participated in the Global Consensus Project for Social Accountability of Medical Schools initiated in 2010, which further focused on the co-operation and link between medical education and the society, highlighting the necessity to meet the health care needs of patients and societies.\n\nIn the years 2008-2014 WFME maintained the Avicenna directory, a public database of worldwide medical schools, schools of pharmacy, schools of public health and educational institutions of other academic health professions, which was later merged with IMED to create the World Directory of Medical Schools.\n\nWFME previously had offices in Bethesda, Maryland (USA) and Edinburgh (UK), and most recently in Copenhagen (Denmark) and Ferney-Voltaire (France). The organisation is currently registered in the UK and France.\n\nThe three major projects WFME currently prioritises are the creation of global standards for quality improvement of medical education, managing the World Directory of Medical Schools and the Recognition of Accreditation.\n\nIn developing Global Standards, the WFME appointed three International Task Forces, one for each of the three phases of medical education:\nBuilding on the standards, WFME provides guidance on establishing medical schools in the context of global standards but also with respect to the national need.\n\nTogether with FAIMER, WFME co-manages the World Directory of Medical School, a public database of medical schools worldwide.\n\nWFME Recognition Programme aims to ensure that accreditation of medical schools in the world, is at an internationally accepted standard. WFME awards Recognition Status to the accrediting agencies that apply and are assessed to be up to the agreed standard.\n\nECFMG published a press release stating that students applying for ECFMG Certification after 2023 will be required to have graduated from a medical school that has been \"appropriately accredited by an agency that uses criteria comparable to those established for U.S. medical schools by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) or that uses other globally accepted criteria, such as WFME’s\".\n\nWFME also develops a project on the Role of the Doctor in the modern society, reflecting the changing position of the medical professions in the world.\n\nWFME strategy is developed and agreed at the yearly Executive Council meeting. The Executive Council includes  the directors of the six regional organisations, representatives of the founding organisations (WHO, WMA) and collaborating organisations (ECFMG, IFMSA) The Junior Doctors Network of WMA also attends by invitation.\n\nAMEE: The Association for Medical Education in Europe\n\nAMEEMR: Association for Medical Education in the Eastern Mediterranean\n\nAMEWPR: Association for Medical Education in Western Pacific Region\n\nAMSA: Association of Medical Schools in Africa\n\nPAFAMS: The Panamerican Federation of Associations of Medical Schools\n\nSEARAME: South-East Asian Regional Association for Medical Education\n\nWFME has been in official relationship with WHO since 1974 aiming to improve medical education worldwide. In 2004 the two organisations formed a strategic partnership and established the international Task Force on Accreditation in Medical Education. The role of WFME in this partnership is to \"update global standards, review regional and national standards, collect and disseminate information, encourage institutional self-evaluation and establish an adviser function\".\n\nWFME has a formal relationship with the World Medical Association (WMA), and since 1997 with the International Federation of Medical Students´ Associations (IFMSA).\n\nThe Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) became a coopted member in 2007.\n\n"}
