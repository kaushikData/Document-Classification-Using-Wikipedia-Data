Taylor (1893) and Stefan Drzewiecki to determine the behavior of propellers. It involves breaking a blade down into several small parts then determining the forces on each of these small blade elements. These forces are then integrated along the entire blade and over one rotor revolution in order to obtain the forces and moments produced by the entire propeller or rotor. One of the key difficulties lies in modelling the induced velocity on the rotor disk. Because of this the blade element theory is often combined with the momentum theory to provide additional relationships necessary to describe the induced velocity on the rotor disk (for further details see Blade Element Momentum Theory). At the most basic level of approximation a uniform induced velocity on the disk is assumed:\n\nAlternatively the variation of the induced velocity along the radius can be modeled by breaking the blade down into small annuli and applying the conservation of mass, momentum and energy to every annulus. This approach is sometimes called the Froude-Finsterwalder equation.\n\nIf the blade element method is applied to helicopter rotors in forward flight it is necessary to consider the flapping motion of the blades as well as the longitudinal and lateral distribution of the induced velocity on the rotor disk. The most simple forward flight inflow models are first harmonic models.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42437083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42437083", "title": "Class conflict", "text": "Class conflict\n\nClass conflict, frequently referred to as class warfare or class struggle, is the tension or antagonism which exists in society due to competing socioeconomic interests and desires between people of different classes. The view that the class struggle provides the lever for radical social change for the majority is central to the work of Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin.\n\nClass conflict can take many different forms: direct violence, such as wars fought for resources and cheap labor; indirect violence, such as deaths from poverty, starvation, illness or unsafe working conditions; coercion, such as the threat of losing a job or the pulling of an important investment; or ideologically, such as with books and articles. Additionally, political forms of class conflict exist; legally or illegally lobbying or bribing government leaders for passage of desirable partisan legislation including labor laws, tax codes, consumer laws, acts of congress or other sanction, injunction or tariff. The conflict can be direct, as with a lockout aimed at destroying a labor union, or indirect, as with an informal slowdown in production protesting low wages by workers or unfair labor practices by capital.\n\nIn the past the term \"Class conflict\" was a term used mostly by socialists and Marxists, who define a class by its relationship to the means of production—such as factories, land and machinery. From this point of view, the social control of production and labor is a contest between classes, and the division of these resources necessarily involves conflict and inflicts harm. It can involve ongoing low-level clashes, escalate into massive confrontations, and in some cases, lead to the overall defeat of one of the contending classes. However, in more contemporary times this term is striking chords and finding new definition amongst capitalistic societies in the United States and other Westernized countries.\n\nThe anarchist Mikhail Bakunin argued that the class struggle of the working class, peasantry and poor had the potential to lead to a social revolution involving the overthrow of ruling elites, and the creation of libertarian socialism. This was only a potential, and class struggle was, he argued, not always the only or decisive factor in society, but it was central. By contrast, Marxists argue that class conflict always plays the decisive and pivotal role in the history of class-based hierarchical systems such as capitalism and feudalism. Marxists refer to its overt manifestations as class war, a struggle whose resolution in favor of the working class is viewed by them as inevitable under plutocratic capitalism.\n\nWhere societies are socially divided based on status, wealth, or control of social production and distribution, class structures arise and are thus coeval with civilization itself. It is well documented since at least European Classical Antiquity (Conflict of the Orders, Spartacus, etc.) and the various popular uprisings in late medieval Europe and elsewhere.\n\nOne of the earliest analysis of these conflicts is Friedrich Engels' The Peasant War in Germany. One of the earliest analyses of the development of class as the development of conflicts between emergent classes is available in Peter Kropotkin's \"\". In this work, Kropotkin analyzes the disposal of goods after death in pre-class or hunter-gatherer societies, and how inheritance produces early class divisions and conflict.\n\nBill Moyers, for example, gave a speech at Brennan Center for Justice in December 2013 which was titled \"The Great American Class War,\" referring to the current struggle between democracy and plutocracy in the U.S. Chris Hedges wrote a column for \"Truthdig\" called \"Let's Get This Class War Started,\" which was a play on Pink's song \"Let's Get This Party Started.\"\n\nHistorian Steve Fraser, author of \"The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power\", asserts that class conflict is an inevitability if current political and economic conditions continue, noting that “people are increasingly fed up… their voices are not being heard. And I think that can only go on for so long without there being more and more outbreaks of what used to be called class struggle, class warfare.”\n\nThe typical example of class conflict described is class conflict within capitalism. This class conflict is seen to occur primarily between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and takes the form of conflict over hours of work, value of wages, division of profits, cost of consumer goods, the culture at work, control over parliament or bureaucracy, and economic inequality. The particular implementation of government programs which may seem purely humanitarian, such as disaster relief, can actually be a form of class conflict. In the USA class conflict is often noted in labor/management disputes. As far back as 1933 representative Edward Hamilton of ALPA, the Airline Pilot's Association, used the term \"class warfare\" to describe airline management's opposition at the National Labor Board hearings in October of that year. Apart from these day-to-day forms of class conflict, during periods of crisis or revolution class conflict takes on a violent nature and involves repression, assault, restriction of civil liberties, and murderous violence such as assassinations or death squads. (Zinn, \"People's History\")\n\nAlthough Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) led the United States as president from 1801–1809 and is considered one of the founding fathers, he died with immense amounts of debt. Regarding the interaction between social classes, he wrote,\n\nThe investor, and billionaire , and philanthropist Warren Buffett, one of the 10 wealthiest persons in the world, voiced in 2005 and once more in 2006 his view that his class – the \"rich class\" – is waging class warfare on the rest of society. In 2005 Buffet said to CNN: \"\"It's class warfare, my class is winning, but they shouldn't be.\" In a November 2006 interview in \"The New York Times\", Buffett stated that \"[t]here’s class warfare all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.\"\" Later Warren gave away more than half of his fortune to charitable causes through a program developed by himself and computer software tycoon Bill Gates. In 2011 Buffett called on government legislators to, \"...stop coddling the super rich.\"\n\nNoam Chomsky, American linguist, philosopher, and political activist has criticized class war in the United States:\n\nMax Weber (1864–1920) agrees with the fundamental ideas of Karl Marx about the economy causing class conflict, but claims that class conflict can also stem from prestige and power. Weber argues that classes come from the different property locations. Different locations can largely affect one's class by their education and the people they associate with. He also states that prestige results in different status groupings. This prestige is based upon the social status of one's parents. Prestige is an attributed value and many times cannot be changed. Weber states that power differences led to the formation of political parties. Weber disagrees with Marx about the formation of classes. While Marx believes that groups are similar due to their economic status, Weber argues that classes are largely formed by social status. Weber does not believe that communities are formed by economic standing, but by similar social prestige. Weber does recognize that there is a relationship between social status, social prestige and classes.\n\nNumerous factors have culminated in what's known as the Arab Spring. Agenda behind the civil unrest, and the ultimate overthrow of authoritarian governments throughout the Middle-East included issues such as dictatorship or absolute monarchy, human rights violations, government corruption (demonstrated by Wikileaks diplomatic cables), economic decline, unemployment, extreme poverty, and a number of demographic structural factors, such as a large percentage of educated but dissatisfied youth within the population. Also, some, like Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek attribute the 2009 Iranian protests as one of the reasons behind the Arab Spring. The catalysts for the revolts in all Northern African and Persian Gulf countries have been the concentration of wealth in the hands of autocrats in power for decades, insufficient transparency of its redistribution, corruption, and especially the refusal of the youth to accept the status quo. as they involve threats to food security worldwide and prices that approach levels of the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. Amnesty International singled out WikiLeaks' release of US diplomatic cables as a catalyst for the revolts.\n\nKarl Marx (1818–1883) was a German born philosopher who lived the majority of his adult life in London, England. In \"The Communist Manifesto\", Karl Marx argued that a class is formed when its members achieve class consciousness and solidarity. This largely happens when the members of a class become aware of their exploitation and the conflict with another class. A class will then realize their shared interests and a common identity. According to Marx, a class will then take action against those that are exploiting the lower classes.\n\nWhat Marx points out is that members of each of the two main classes have interests in common. These class or collective interests are in conflict with those of the other class as a whole. This in turn leads to conflict between individual members of different classes.\n\nMarxist analysis of society identifies two main social groups: \n\nNot all class struggle is violent or necessarily radical, as with strikes and lockouts. Class antagonism may instead be expressed as low worker morale, minor sabotage and pilferage, and individual workers' abuse of petty authority and hoarding of information. It may also be expressed on a larger scale by support for socialist or populist parties. On the employers' side, the use of union busting legal firms and the lobbying for anti-union laws are forms of class struggle.\n\nNot all class struggle is a threat to capitalism, or even to the authority of an individual capitalist. A narrow struggle for higher wages by a small sector of the working-class, what is often called \"economism\", hardly threatens the status quo. In fact, by applying the craft-union tactics of excluding other workers from skilled trades, an economistic struggle may even weaken the working class as a whole by dividing it. Class struggle becomes more important in the historical process as it becomes more general, as industries are organized rather than crafts, as workers' class consciousness rises, and as they self-organize away from political parties. Marx referred to this as the progress of the proletariat from being a class \"in itself\", a position in the social structure, to being one \"for itself\",an active and conscious force that could change the world.\n\nMarx largely focuses on the capital industrialist society as the source of social stratification, which ultimately results in class conflict. He states that capitalism creates a division between classes which can largely be seen in manufacturing factories. The proletariat, is separated from the bourgeoisie because production becomes a social enterprise. Contributing to their separation is the technology that is in factories. Technology de-skills and alienates workers as they are no longer viewed as having a specialized skill. Another effect of technology is a homogenous workforce that can be easily replaceable. Marx believed that this class conflict would result in the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and that the private property would be communally owned. The mode of production would remain, but communal ownership would eliminate class conflict.\n\nEven after a revolution, the two classes would struggle, but eventually the struggle would recede and the classes dissolve. As class boundaries broke down, the state apparatus would wither away. According to Marx, the main task of any state apparatus is to uphold the power of the ruling class; but without any classes there would be no need for a state. That would lead to the classless, stateless communist society.\n\nA variety of predominantly trotskyist and anarchist thinkers argue that class conflict existed in Soviet-style societies. Their arguments describe as a class the bureaucratic stratum formed by the ruling political party (known as the Nomenklatura in the Soviet Union)—sometimes termed a \"new class\".—that controls and guides the means of production. This ruling class is viewed to be in opposition to the remainder of society, generally considered the proletariat. This type of system is referred by them as state socialism, state capitalism, bureaucratic collectivism or new class societies. (Cliff; Ðilas 1957) Marxism was such a predominate ideological power in what became the Soviet Union since a Marxist group known as the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was formed in the country, prior to 1917. This party soon divided into two main factions; the Bolsheviks, who were led by Vladimir Lenin, and the Mensheviks, who were led by Julius Martov.\n\nHowever many Marxist argue that unlike in Capitalism, the Soviet elites didn't own the Means of production, or generated surplus value for their personal wealth like in capitalism, as the generated profit from the economy was equally distributed into Soviet society. Even some trotskyist like Ernest Mandel criticized the concept of a new ruling class as an oxymoron. He said: \"The hypothesis of the bureaucracy’s being a new ruling class leads to the conclusion that, for the first time in history, we are confronted with a “ruling class” which does not exist as a class before it actually rules.\"\n\nSocial commentators, historians and socialist theorists had commented on class struggle for some time before Marx, as well as the connection between class struggle, property, and law: Augustin Thierry, François Guizot, François-Auguste Mignet and Adolphe Thiers. The Physiocrats, David Ricardo, and after Marx, Henry George noted the inelastic supply of land and argued that this created certain privileges (economic rent) for landowners. According to the historian Arnold Toynbee, stratification along lines of class appears only within civilizations, and furthermore only appears during the process of a civilization's decline while not characterizing the growth phase of a civilization.\n\nProudhon, in \"What is Property?\" (1840) states that \"certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles to property, and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history.\" While Proudhon saw the solution as the lower classes forming an alternative, solidarity economy centered on cooperatives and self-managed workplaces, which would slowly undermine and replace capitalist class society, the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, while influenced by Proudhon, insisted that a massive class struggle by the working class, peasantry and poor was essential to the creation of libertarian socialism. This would require a (final) showdown in the form of a social revolution.\n\nFascists have often opposed class struggle and instead have attempted to appeal to the working class while promising to preserve the existing social classes and have proposed an alternative concept known as class collaboration.\n\nSome historical tendencies of Orthodox Marxism reject racism, sexism, etc. as struggles that essentially distract from class struggle, the real conflict. These divisions within the class prevent the purported antagonists from acting in their common class interest. However, many Marxist internationalists and anti-colonial revolutionaries understand sex, race and class to be bound up together. There is an ongoing debate within Marxist scholarship about these topics.\n\nAccording to Michel Foucault, in the 19th century the essentialist notion of the \"race\" was incorporated by racists, biologists, and eugenicists, who gave it the modern sense of \"biological race\" which was then integrated to \"state racism\". On the other hand, Foucault claims that when Marxists developed their concept of \"class struggle\", they were partly inspired by the older, non-biological notions of the \"race\" and the \"race struggle\". In a letter to Friedrich Engels in 1882 Karl Marx wrote: \"You know very well where we found our idea of class struggle; we found it in the work of the French historians who talked about the race struggle.\" For Foucault, the theme of social war provides the overriding principle that connects class and race struggle.\n\nMoses Hess, an important theoretician and labor zionist of the early socialist movement, in his \"Epilogue\" to \"Rome and Jerusalem\" argued that \"the race struggle is primary, the class struggle secondary... With the cessation of race antagonism, the class struggle will also come to a standstill. The equalization of all classes of society will necessarily follow the emancipation of all the races, for it will ultimately become a scientific question of social economics.\"\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois theorized that the intersectional paradigms of race, class, and nation might explain certain aspects of black political economy. Patricia Hill Collins writes: \"Du Bois saw race, class, and nation not primarily as personal identity categories but as social hierarchies that shaped African-American access to status, poverty, and power.\"\n\nIn modern times, emerging schools of thought in the U.S. and other countries hold the opposite to be true. They argue that the race struggle is less important, because the primary struggle is that of class since labor of all races face the same problems and injustices.\n\nRiots with a basically nationalist background are not included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It can occur where one group pays a smaller share of costs than before, resulting in another group paying a larger share of costs than before (shifting compared to previous arrangement). Some commentators on health policy in the United States believe the former currently happens in Medicare and Medicaid as they underpay for services resulting in private insurers overpaying. In 1995, Health Affairs started a study testing the “cost-shifting” theory using a unique new data set that combines MarketScan private claims data with Medicare hospital cost reports, the study ran from 1995-2009. In May 2013 when the findings were released, the study found that a 10 percent reduction in Medicare payment rates led to an estimated reduction in private payment rates of 3 percent or 8 percent, depending on the statistical model used.

It was developed in collaboration with John Joseph Merlin (with whom Cox also worked on developing automata). Cox claimed that his design was a true perpetual motion machine, but as the device is powered from changes in atmospheric pressure via a mercury barometer, this is not the case. The clock still exists today but was deactivated at the time of the clock's relocation to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nThe clock is similar to other mechanical clocks, except that it does not need winding. The change of pressure in the Earth's atmosphere acts as an external energy source and causes sufficient movement of the winding mechanism. This keeps the mainspring coiled inside the barrel. The clock is designed to enable the timepiece to run indefinitely and overwinding is prevented by a safety mechanism. The , encased in a finely detailed clock body, is a Fortin mercury barometer. The barometer contained 68 kilograms (150 pounds) of mercury (approximately 5 litres).\n\nRelated to this is Cornelis Drebbel's device of 1610 (though it is unknown whether Cox knew of it). It was a machine that told the time, date, and season. The gold machine was mounted in a globe on pillars and was powered by changes in air pressure (a sealed glass tub with liquid varied in volume through atmospheric pressure changes, rewinding constantly). \n\nThe Atmos, manufactured by Jaeger LeCoultre is a modern clock which is similar to Cox's clock although the main driving force is generated from temperature differential, instead of pressure differential.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7989", "title": "Dianetics", "text": "Dianetics\n\nDianetics (from Greek \"dia\", meaning \"through\", and \"nous\", meaning \"mind\") is a set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body created by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. Dianetics is practiced by followers of Scientology, the Nation of Islam (as of 2010), and independent Dianeticist groups.\n\nDianetics divides the mind into three parts: the conscious \"analytical mind\", the subconscious \"reactive mind\", and the somatic mind. The goal of Dianetics is to erase the content of the \"reactive mind\", which Scientologists believe interferes with a person's ethics, awareness, happiness, and sanity. The Dianetics procedure to achieve this erasure is called \"auditing\". In auditing, the Dianetic auditor asks a series of questions (or commands) and elicits answers to help a person locate and deal with painful experiences of the past, which Scientologists believe to be the content of the \"reactive mind\".\n\nPractitioners of Dianetics believe that \"the basic principle of existence is to survive\" and that the basic personality of humans is sincere, intelligent, and good. The drive for goodness and survival is distorted and inhibited by aberrations \"ranging from simple neuroses to different psychotic states to various kinds of sociopathic behavior patterns.\" Hubbard developed Dianetics, claiming that it could eradicate these aberrations.\n\nWhen Hubbard formulated Dianetics, he described it as \"a mix of Western technology and Oriental philosophy\". He said that Dianetics \"forms a bridge between\" cybernetics and general semantics (a set of ideas about education originated by Alfred Korzybski, which received much attention in the science fiction world in the 1940s)—a claim denied by scholars of General Semantics, including S. I. Hayakawa, who expressed strong criticism of Dianetics as early as 1951. Hubbard claimed that Dianetics could increase intelligence, eliminate unwanted emotions and alleviate a wide range of illnesses he believed to be psychosomatic. Among the conditions purportedly treated were arthritis, allergies, asthma, some coronary difficulties, eye trouble, ulcers, migraine headaches, \"sexual deviation\" (which for Hubbard included homosexuality), and even death. Hubbard asserted that \"memories of painful physical and emotional experiences accumulate in a specific region of the mind, causing illness and mental problems.\" He taught that \"once these experiences have been purged through cathartic procedures he developed, a person can achieve superior health and intelligence.\" Hubbard also variously defined Dianetics as \"a spiritual healing technology\" and \"an organized science of thought.\"\n\nDianetics predates Hubbard's classification of Scientology as an \"applied religious philosophy\". Early in 1951, he expanded his writings to include teachings related to the soul, or \"thetan\". Dianetics is practiced by several independent Dianetics-only groups not connected with Scientology, and also Free Zone or Independent Scientologists. The Church of Scientology has prosecuted a number of people in court for unauthorized publication of Scientology and Dianetics copyrighted material.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard published Dianetics on May 9, 1950, as a \"branch of self-help psychology\". In Dianetics, Hubbard introduced the \"phenomena known as 'engrams'\" as the source of \"all psychological pain, which in turn harmed mental and physical health.\" He also claimed that individuals could reach the state of \"clear\", or a state of \"exquisite clarity and mental liberation, by exorcising their engrams to an 'auditor,' or listener acting as therapist.\"\nWhile not accepted by the medical and scientific establishment, in the first two years of its publication, over 100,000 copies of the book were sold. Many enthusiasts emerged to form groups to study and practice Dianetics. The atmosphere from which Dianetics was written about in this period was one of \"excited experimentation\". Roy Wallis writes that Hubbard's work was regarded as an \"initial exploration\" for further development. Hubbard wrote an additional six books in 1951, drawing the attention of a significant fan base.\n\nHubbard always claimed that his ideas of Dianetics originated in the 1920s and 1930s. By his own account, LRH had been injured by the premature detonation of a primer mechanism on a small depth charge that had become stuck in the launch rack aboard the navy ship he was assigned to in 1941. His injuries were mainly flash burns to his eyes and so was despatched ashore and he spent a great deal of his recovery time in the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital's library, (despite claiming in his authorised biography that he was blinded). LRH encountered the work of Thompson, Korzybski, Jung, Freud, Perls and other psychoanalysts.\n\nIn his 1955 Phoenix Lectures Series, Hubbard himself, explains that he took the opportunity to enter an office where research papers on the US Naval Medical Research Division's work on PTSD were kept in a filing cabinet and he spent the lunch hour free to read the notes left lying on the desk of the Naval Medical Officer involved. Much of what he learned then, along with his recent mastery of hypnotherapy technique by mail order, was influential in his later development of ideas and concepts for Dianetics Therapy from 1947 onwards. All he needed was medical and scientific testing and approval from any source. However, his several attempts were blocked by several luminaries of the (AMA) American Medical Association in the years 1948–1958, such as Professors Duncan Cameron and Allan Whyte (White), who both were senior authorities within the AMA-funded Psychiatric Research Department, then conducting their own research into drug therapies and controversial psycho-surgical techniques on severely traumatised war veterans.\n\nHubbard claimed in his several public lectures during the 1950s to have \"undertaken clinical research at several of the institutions\" they, Cameron and Whyte, had directed. Historical AMA records show that LRH was never officially involved in any approved clinical trials or research into PTSD. It is thought that Hubbard simply privately visited patients and conducted unauthorised interviews with several war veterans suffering from Trauma, Psychosomatic illness and practiced some of the newly identified PTSD techniques being clinically tested by several AMA medical institutions after WW2. (from personal Interviews with Joseph A. Winter, in Peoria,1959).\n\nIn April 1950, Hubbard, and several others, (Marjorie Cameron, De Mille, Art Ceppos, AE Van Vogt, Joseph A. Winter, MD.), established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth, New Jersey to coordinate work related to the forthcoming publication of DMSMH by Random House in May 1950 in NYC. Through the marketing efforts of Hubbard's friend and mentor John W. Campbell Jnr., (editor of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" of Street and Smith fame), Hubbard's articles on Dianetics hit the newsstands in NYC and became an overnight sensation among the usual readers with almost 350,000 copies sold of the May 1950 issue. (See interviews with John Campbell in his published 1978 biography.)\n\nHubbard first introduced Dianetics to the public in the article \"\" published in the May 1950 issue of the magazine \"Astounding Science Fiction\". Hubbard wrote \"\" at that time, allegedly completing the 180,000-word book in six weeks. The introduction of the book was the subject of an Associated Press article on 29 March 1950, with the lead \"Discovery of a sub-mind is claimed in a new book entitled \"Dianetics\"\".\n\nWhen \"Dianetics\" was published in 1950, Hubbard announced in the opening pages, \"The first contribution of Dianetics is the discovery that the problems of thought and mental function can be resolved within the bounds of the finite universe, which is to say that all data needful to the solution of mental action and Man's endeavor can be measured, sensed and experienced as scientific truths independent of mysticism or metaphysics.\" This was in line with Hubbard's initial presentation of Dianetics as a science, almost four years before he founded Scientology.\n\nPublication of \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" brought in a flood of money, which Hubbard used to establish Dianetics foundations in six major American cities. Dianetics shared The New York Times best-seller list with other self-help writings, including Norman Vincent Peale's \"The Art of Happiness\" and Henry Overstreet's \"The Mature Mind\". Scholar Hugh B. Urban asserted that the initial success of Dianetics was reflective of Hubbard's \"remarkable entrepreneurial skills.\" Posthumously, Publisher's Weekly awarded Hubbard a plaque to acknowledge Dianetics appearing on its bestseller list for one hundred weeks, consecutively.\n\nSome of the initial strongest supporters of Dianetics in the 1950s were John W. Campbell, editor of Astounding Science Fiction and Joseph Augustus Winter, a writer and medical physician. Campbell published some of Hubbard's short stories and Winter hoped that his colleagues would likewise be attracted to Hubbard's Dianetics system.\n\nIn January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for 'teaching medicine without a licence', which was quickly resolved when the courts were made aware that the HDRF deputy director Winter was registered as an MD in the state of Michigan and New York. . The Foundation closed its doors when Hubbard ditched the Foundation, causing the proceedings to be vacated, but its creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts. Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from Wichita, Kansas, offered a brief respite from bankruptcy, but the Wichita Foundation's finances soon failed again in 1952 when Hubbard ran off to Phoenix with all his Dianetics materials to avoid the court bailiffs sent in by Don Purcell, who had paid a considerable amount of money to Hubbard for the copyrights to Dianetics in an effort to keep Hubbard from bankruptcy again.\n\nIn 1954, Hubbard defined Scientology as a religion focused on the spirit, differentiating it from Dianetics, and subsequently Dianetics Auditing Therapy, which he defined as a counseling based science that addressed the physical being. He stated, \"Dianetics is a science which applies to man, a living organism; and Scientology is a religion.\" When Hubbard morphed Dianetics therapy into the religion of Scientology, Jesper Aagaard Petersen of Oxford University surmises that it could have been for the benefits from establishing it is a religion as much as it could have been from the result of Hubbard's \"discovery of past life experiences and his exploration of the thetan.\" The reason being to avoid copyright infringement issues with use of the name Dianetics then held by Don Purcell. Purcell later donated the copyright ownership back (to Hubbard) after Winter and Van Vogt had independently negotiated charitable debt relief with the disenchanted oil millionaire Purcell.\n\nWith the temporary sale of assets resulting from the HDRF's bankruptcy, Hubbard no longer owned the rights to the name \"Dianetics\", but its philosophical framework still provided the seed for Scientology to grow. Scientologists refer to the book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" as \"Book One.\" In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as \"Scientology, a religious philosophy.\" Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas: Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his reactive mind engrams, the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual's spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential.\n\nIn 1963 and again in May 1969, Hubbard reorganized the material in Dianetics, the auditing commands, and original Volney Mathieson invented E-meter use, naming the package \"Standard Dianetics.\" In a 1969 bulletin, \"This bulletin combines HCOB 27 April 1969 'R-3-R Restated' with those parts of HCOB 24 June 1963 'Routine 3-R' used in the new Standard Dianetic Course and its application. This gives the complete steps of Routine 3-R Revised.\"\n\nIn 1978, Hubbard released \"New Era Dianetics\" (NED), a revised version supposed to produce better results in a shorter period of time. The course consists of 11 rundowns and requires a specifically trained auditor. It is similar to Standard Dianetics, but the person being audited is encouraged to find the decision or \"postulate\" he made during or as a result of the incident. (\"Postulate\" in Dianetics and Scientology has the meaning of \"a conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself; to conclude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for the future or to nullify a pattern of the past\" in contrast to its conventional meanings.)\n\nIn the Church of Scientology, OTs study several levels of before reaching the highest level.\n\nIn the book, \"\", Hubbard describes techniques that he suggests can rid individuals of fears and psychosomatic illnesses. A basic idea in Dianetics is that the mind consists of two parts: the \"analytical mind\" and the \"reactive mind.\" The \"reactive mind\", the mind which operates when a person is physically unconscious, acts as a record of shock, trauma, pain, and otherwise harmful memories. Experiences such as these, stored in the \"reactive mind\" are dubbed \"engrams\". Dianetics is proposed as a method to erase these engrams in the reactive mind to achieve a state of clear.\n\nHubbard described Dianetics as \"an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of natural laws on the order of those of the physical sciences\". In April 1950, before the public release of Dianetics, he wrote: \"To date, over two hundred patients have been treated; of those two hundred, two hundred cures have been obtained.\"\n\nIn Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of \"mental image pictures,\" which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unconsciousness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from pre-natal experiences, infancy and childhood, to even the traumatic feelings associated with events from past lives and extraterrestrial cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of unconsciousness involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an engram, and defined it as \"a complete recording of a moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions.\"\n\nHubbard said that in Dianetics, it was the analytical mind and not the reactive mind that was the most important because the analytical mind \"computes decisions\" even when these are dictated by the reactive mind. The damage and aberration caused by the reactive mind would not be possible without the analytic mind. Hubbard stated, \"the analytical is so important to the intelligent being and the somatic mind so important to the athlete that Dianetics processing can be said to consist of deintensifying the reactive mind so that the analytical and somatic minds can be free to function properly.\"\n\nHubbard proposed that painful physical or emotional traumas caused \"aberrations\" (deviations from rational thinking) in the mind, which produced lasting adverse physical and emotional effects, similar to conversion disorders. When the analytical (conscious) mind shut down during these moments, events and perceptions of this period were stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind. (In Hubbard's earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as \"Norns\", \"Impediments,\" and \"comanomes\" before \"engram\" was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of Joseph Augustus Winter, MD.) Some commentators noted Dianetics's blend of science fiction and occult orientations at the time.\n\nHubbard claimed that these engrams are the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to physical pain, engrams could include words or phrases spoken in the vicinity while the patient was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying, \"Take him now,\" during the patient's birth. Hubbard similarly claimed that leukemia is traceable to \"an engram containing the phrase 'It turns my blood to water.'\" While it is sometimes claimed that the Church of Scientology no longer stands by Hubbard's claims that Dianetics can treat physical conditions, it still publishes them: \"... when the knee injuries of the past are located and discharged, the arthritis ceases, no other injury takes its place and the person is finished with arthritis of the knee.\" \"[The reactive mind] can give a man arthritis, bursitis, asthma, allergies, sinusitis, coronary trouble, high blood pressure ... And it is the only thing in the human being which can produce these effects ... Discharge the content of [the reactive mind] and the arthritis vanishes, myopia gets better, heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly and the whole catalog of ills goes away and stays away.\"\n\nHubbard defined the third mind, or the somatic mind, as \"that mind which, directed by the analytical or reactive mind, places solution into effect on the physical level.\" If an individual is not suffering from aberration or engrams are not restimulated, thus causing the person to relive pain, the analytical mind controls the somatic mind, in turn controlling blood flow, the heartbeat and endocrines. When a person is \"aberrated,\" the reactive mind controls the somatic mind.\n\nSome of the psychometric ideas in Dianetics, in particular the E-meter, can be traced to Carl Jung. Basic concepts, including conversion disorder, are derived from Sigmund Freud, whom Hubbard credited as an inspiration and source. Freud had speculated 40 years previously that traumas with similar content join together in \"chains,\" embedded in the unconscious mind, to cause irrational responses in the individual. Such a chain would be relieved by inducing the patient to remember the earliest trauma, \"with an accompanying expression of emotion.\"\n\nAccording to Bent Corydon, Hubbard created the illusion that Dianetics was the first psychotherapy to address traumatic experiences in their own time, but others had done so as standard procedure.\n\nOne treatment method Hubbard drew from in developing Dianetics was abreaction therapy. Abreaction is a psychoanalytical term that means bringing to consciousness, and thus adequate expression, material that has been unconscious. \"It includes not only the recollection of forgotten memories and experience, but also their reliving with appropriate emotional display and discharge of effect. This process is usually facilitated by the patient's gaining awareness of the causal relationship between the previously undischarged emotion and his symptoms.\"\n\nAccording to Hubbard, before Dianetics psychotherapists had dealt with very light and superficial incidents (e.g. an incident that reminds the patient of a moment of loss), but with Dianetic therapy, the patient could actually erase moments of pain and unconsciousness. He emphasized: \"The discovery of the engram is entirely the property of Dianetics. Methods of its erasure are also owned entirely by Dianetics...\"\n\nWhile 1950 style Dianetics was in some respects similar to older therapies, with the development of New Era Dianetics in 1978, the similarity vanished. New Era Dianetics uses an E-Meter and a rote procedure for running \"chains\" of related traumatic incidents.\n\nDianetics clarifies the understanding of psychosomatic illness in terms of \"predisposition\", \"precipitation\", and \"prolongation\".\n\nWith the use of Dianetics techniques, Hubbard claimed, the reactive mind could be processed and all stored engrams could be refiled as experience. The central technique was \"auditing,\" a two-person question-and-answer therapy designed to isolate and dissipate engrams (or \"mental masses\"). An auditor addresses questions to a subject, observes and records the subject's responses, and returns repeatedly to experiences or areas under discussion that appear painful until the troubling experience has been identified and confronted. Through repeated applications of this method, the reactive mind could be \"cleared\" of its content having outlived its usefulness in the process of evolution; a person who has completed this process would be \"Clear\".\n\nThe benefits of going Clear, according to Hubbard, were dramatic. A Clear would have no compulsions, repressions, psychoses or neuroses, and would enjoy a near-perfect memory as well as a rise in IQ of as much as 50 points. He also claimed that \"the atheist is activated by engrams as thoroughly as the zealot\". He further claimed that widespread application of Dianetics would result in \"A world without insanity, without criminals and without war.\"\n\nOne of the key ideas of Dianetics, according to Hubbard, is the fundamental existential command to survive. According to Hugh B. Urban, this would serve as the foundation of a big part of later Scientology.\n\nAccording to the Scientology journal \"The Auditor\", the total number of \"Clears\" as of May 2006 stands at 50,311.\n\nWhen Hubbard presented Dianetics, he did so in terms of \"terra incognita,\" or to Scientologists the human mind. Hubbard wrote, “Dianetics is an adventure. It is an exploration of terra incognita, the human mind, the vast and hitherto unknown realm half an inch back of our foreheads.\" According to \"Scientology in Popular Culture,\" Hubbard set out to colonize terra incognita, where in the “practice of empire was auditing, the new technology of empire was the E-meter. This exploration of the human mind “would become a defining feature of Scientology because it provided the portal through which he could conquer many enemy thetans.”\n\nThe procedure of Dianetics therapy (known as \"auditing\") is a two-person activity. One person, the \"auditor\", guides the other person, the \"pre-clear\". The pre-Clear's job is to look at the mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the pre-Clear says and controls the process so the pre-Clear may put his full attention on his work.\n\nThe auditor and pre-Clear sit down in chairs facing each other. The process then follows in eleven distinct steps:\n\n\nAuditing sessions are supposedly kept confidential. A few transcripts of auditing sessions with confidential information removed have been published as demonstration examples. Some extracts can be found in J.A. Winter's book \"\". Other, more comprehensive, transcripts of auditing sessions carried out by Hubbard himself can be found in volume 1 of the \"Research & Discovery Series\" (Bridge Publications, 1980). Examples of public group processing sessions can be found throughout the \"Congresses\" lecture series.\n\nAccording to Hubbard, auditing enables the pre-Clear to \"contact\" and \"release\" engrams stored in the reactive mind, relieving him of the physical and mental aberrations connected with them. The pre-Clear is asked to inspect and familiarize himself with the exact details of his own experience; the auditor may not tell him anything about his case or evaluate any of the information the pre-Clear finds.\n\nHubbard's original book on Dianetics attracted highly critical reviews from science and medical writers and organizations. The American Psychological Association passed a resolution in 1950 calling \"attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by empirical evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations.\" Subsequently, Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a scientific theory, and scientists cite Dianetics as an example of a pseudoscience.\n\nIn August 1950, amidst the success of \"\", Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as 'the world's first Clear.\" Despite Hubbard's claim that she had \"full and perfect recall of every moment of her life\", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie. Hubbard explained Bianca's failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word \"now\" in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently froze her in \"present time,\" which blocked her abilities. Later, in the late 1950s, Hubbard would claim that several people had reached the state of Clear by the time he presented Bianca as the world's first; these others, Hubbard said, he had successfully cleared in the late 1940s while working \"incognito\" in Hollywood posing as a swami. In 1966, Hubbard declared South African Scientologist John McMaster to be the first true Clear.\n\nFew scientific investigations into the effectiveness of Dianetics have been published. Professor John A. Lee states in his 1970 evaluation of Dianetics:\n\nThe MEDLINE database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of New York University. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetics therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not effect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts; Jack Fox tested Hubbard's thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it.\n\nHubbard claimed, in an interview with \"The New York Times\" in November 1950, that \"he had already submitted proof of claims made in the book to a number of scientists and associations.\" He added that the public as well as proper organizations were entitled to such proof and that he was ready and willing to give such proof in detail. In January 1951, the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of Elizabeth, NJ published \"Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results\", a booklet providing the results of psychometric tests conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of X-ray plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured \"aberrations\" including manic depression, asthma, arthritis, colitis and \"overt homosexuality,\" and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized IQ test. The report's subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself (\"Case 1080A, R. L.\").\n\nThe authors provide no qualifications, although they are described in Hubbard's book \"Science of Survival\" (where some results of the same study were reprinted) as psychotherapists. Critics of Dianetics are skeptical of this study, both because of the bias of the source and because the researchers appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without considering possible outside factors; in other words, the report lacks any scientific controls. J.A. Winter, M.D., originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, had by the end of 1950 cut his ties with Hubbard and written an account of his personal experiences with Dianetics. He described Hubbard as \"absolutistic and authoritarian\", and criticized the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake \"precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind\". He also recommended that auditing be done by experts only and that it was dangerous for laymen to audit each other. Hubbard writes: \"Again, Dianetics is not being released to a profession, for no profession could encompass it.\"\n\nCommentators from a variety of backgrounds have described Dianetics as an example of pseudoscience. For example, philosophy professor Robert Carroll points to Dianetics' lack of empirical evidence:\n\nW. Sumner Davis similarly comments that\n\nThe validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer Martin Gardner asserts that \"nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it.\"\n\nOther critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of hypnosis, although the Church of Scientology has strongly denied that hypnosis forms any part of Dianetics. To the contrary, L. Ron Hubbard expressly warns not to use any hypnosis or hypnosis-like methods, because a person under hypnosis would be receptive to suggestions. This would decrease his self-determinism instead of increasing it, which is one of the prime goals of Dianetics. Winter [1950] comments that the leading nature of the questions asked of a pre-Clear \"encourage fantasy\", a common issue also encountered with hypnosis, which can be used to form false memories. The auditor is instructed not to make any assessment of a recalled memory's reality or accuracy, but instead to treat it as if it were objectively real. Professor Richard J. Ofshe, a leading expert on false memories, suggests that the feeling of well-being reported by pre-Clear at the end of an auditing session may be induced by post-hypnotic suggestion. Other researchers have identified quotations in Hubbard's work suggesting evidence that false memories were created in \"Dianetics,\" specifically in the form of birth and pre-birth memories.\n\nAccording to an article by Martin Gumpert, “Hubbard’s concept of psychosomatic disease is definitely wrong. Psychosomatic ailments are not simply caused by emotional disturbances: they are diseases in which the emotional and the organic factor are closely involved and interdependent.”\n\nAccording to Hubbard, the majority of the people interested in the subject believed they could accomplish therapy alone. \"It cannot be done\" and he adds: \"If a patient places himself in autohypnosis and regresses himself in an effort to reach illness or birth or prenatals, the only thing he will get is ill\".\n\n\n\n"}

Scott Kurowski wrote the PrimeNet Internet server that supports the research to demonstrate Entropia-distributed computing software, a company he founded in 1997. GIMPS is registered as Mersenne Research, Inc. Kurowski is Executive Vice President and board director of Mersenne Research Inc. GIMPS is said to be one of the first large scale distributed computing projects over the Internet for research purposes.\n\n, the project has found a total of sixteen Mersenne primes, fourteen of which were the largest known prime number at their respective times of discovery. The largest known prime is 2 − 1 (or M in short). This prime was discovered on December 26, 2017 by Jonathan Pace.\n\nTo perform its testing, the project relies primarily on Lucas–Lehmer primality test, an algorithm that is both specialized to testing Mersenne primes and particularly efficient on binary computer architectures. They also have a trial division phase, used to rapidly eliminate Mersenne numbers with small factors which make up a large proportion of candidates. Pollard's p - 1 algorithm is also used to search for larger factors.\n\nThe project began in early January 1996, with a program that ran on i386 computers.\nThe name for the project was coined by Luther Welsh, one of its earlier searchers and the co-discoverer of the 29th Mersenne prime.\nWithin a few months, several dozen people had joined, and over a thousand by the end of the first year.\nJoel Armengaud, a participant, discovered the primality of M on November 13, 1996.\n\n, GIMPS has a sustained aggregate throughput of approximately 324 TeraFLOPS (or TFLOPS). In November 2012, GIMPS maintained 95 TFLOPS, theoretically earning the GIMPS virtual computer a rank of 330 among the TOP500 most powerful known computer systems in the world. The preceding place was then held by an 'HP Cluster Platform 3000 BL460c G7' of Hewlett-Packard. As of November 2014 TOP500 results, these old GIMPS numbers would no longer make the list.\n\nPreviously, this was approximately 50 TFLOPS in early 2010, 30 TFLOPS in mid-2008, 20 TFLOPS in mid-2006, and 14 TFLOPS in early 2004.\n\nAlthough the GIMPS software's source code is publicly available, technically it is not free software, since it has a restriction that users must abide by the project's distribution terms.\nSpecifically, if the software is used to discover a prime number with at least 100,000,000 decimal digits, the user will only win $50,000 of the $150,000 prize offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nThird-party programs for testing Mersenne numbers, such as Mlucas and Glucas (for non-x86 systems), do not have this restriction.\n\nGIMPS also \"reserves the right to change this EULA without notice and with reasonable retroactive effect\".\"\"\n\nAll Mersenne primes are of the form M=2 − 1, where \"p\" is a prime number itself. So the smallest Mersenne prime in this table is \n\nThe first column is the rank of the Mersenne prime in the (ordered) sequence of all Mersenne primes; GIMPS has found all known Mersenne primes beginning with the 35th.\n\nWhenever a possible prime is reported to the server, it is verified first before it is announced. The importance of this was illustrated in 2003, when a false positive was reported to possibly be the 40th Mersenne prime but verification failed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33930663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33930663", "title": "InSight", "text": "InSight\n\nThe Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission is a robotic lander designed to study the deep interior of the planet Mars. It was manufactured by Lockheed Martin, is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and most payload instruments it carries were built by European agencies. The mission launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05 UTC aboard an Atlas V-401 rocket and successfully landed at Elysium Planitia on Mars on 26 November 2018 at 19:52:59 UTC. \"InSight\" traveled during its journey. \n\n\"InSight\" objectives are to place a seismometer, called SEIS, on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate 3D models of the planet's interior; and measure internal heat flow using a heat probe called HP to study Mars' early geological evolution. This could bring a new understanding of the Solar System's terrestrial planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars – and Earth's Moon. \n\nThe lander was originally planned for launch in March 2016. Following a persistent vacuum failure in the SEIS instrument prior to launch, with the 2016 launch window missed, \"InSight\" was returned to Lockheed Martin's facility in Denver, Colorado, for storage. NASA officials decided in March 2016 to delay launching \"InSight\" to May 2018. This allowed time for the seismometer issue to be fixed, although it increased the cost from the previous to a total of . By reusing technology from the Mars \"Phoenix\" lander, which successfully landed on Mars in 2008, mission costs and risks were reduced.\n\n\"InSight\" was initially known as GEMS (Geophysical Monitoring Station), but its name was changed in early 2012 following a request by NASA. Out of 28 proposals from 2010, it was one of the three Discovery Program finalists receiving in May 2011 to develop a detailed concept study. In August 2012, \"InSight\" was selected for development and launch. Managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with participation from scientists from several countries, the mission was cost-capped at , not including launch vehicle funding.\n\nLockheed Martin began construction of the lander on 19 May 2014, with general testing starting in 27 May 2015.\n\nA persistent vacuum leak in the CNES-supplied seismometer known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) led NASA to postpone the planned launch in March 2016 to May 2018. When \"InSight\" was delayed, the rest of the spacecraft was returned to Lockheed Martin's factory in Colorado for storage, and the Atlas V rocket intended to launch the spacecraft was reassigned to the \"WorldView-4\" mission.\n\nOn 9 March 2016, NASA officials announced that \"InSight\" would be delayed until the 2018 launch window at an estimated cost of . The spacecraft was rescheduled to launch on 5 May 2018 for a Mars landing on 26 November at 3 p.m. The flight plan remained unchanged with launch using an Atlas V rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was tasked with redesigning and building a new vacuum enclosure for the SEIS instrument, while CNES conducted instrument integration and testing.\n\nOn 22 November 2017 \"InSight\" completed testing in a thermal vacuum, also known as TVAC testing, where the spacecraft is put in simulated space conditions with reduced pressure and various thermal loads. On 23 January 2018, after a long storage, its solar panels were once again deployed and tested, and a second silicon chip containing 1.6 million names from the public was added to the lander.\n\nOn 28 February 2018, \"InSight\" was shipped via C-17 cargo aircraft from the Lockheed Martin Space Systems building in Denver to the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in order to be integrated to the launch vehicle. The lander was launched on 5 May 2018 and arrived on Mars at approximately 19:54 UTC on 26 November 2018.\n\nNASA noted the difficulty of building an interplanetary seismometer when the \"Viking 1\" lander's seismometer did not deploy properly in 1976. The seismometer on both \"Viking\" spacecraft were mounted on the lander, which meant that it also picked up vibrations from various operations of the lander and from the wind. The seismometer readings were used to estimate a Martian geological crust thickness between at the \"Viking 2\" lander site. The \"Viking 2\" seismometer detected pressure from the Mars winds complementing the meteorology results. There was one candidate for a possible marsquake, although it was not confirmed due to the limitations of the design, especially due to interference from other sources like wind. The wind data did prove useful in its own right, and despite the limitations of the data, widespread and large marsquakes were not detected.\n\nRadio Doppler measurements were taken with \"Viking\" and twenty years later with \"Mars Pathfinder\", and in each case the axis of rotation of Mars was estimated. By combining this data the core size was constrained, because the change in axis of rotation over 20 years allowed a precession rate and from that the planet's moment of inertia to be estimated. \"InSight\" measurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity should result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to current data.\n\nSeismometers were also left on the Moon from the Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16 missions and provided many insights into lunar seismology, including the discovery of moonquakes. The Apollo seismic network, which was operated until 1977, detected at least 28 moonquakes up to 5.5 on the Richter scale.\n\nOn 26 November 2018, NASA reported that the \"InSight\" lander had landed successfully on Mars. A touchdown image was received, taken through a transparent lens cover. NASA reported that the cover, along with the cover on another camera, would be removed within the next few days. \n\nA few hours later, at about 1:30 UTC (8:30 p.m. EST), NASA's \"2001 Mars Odyssey\" orbiter relayed signals indicating that \"InSight\" solar panels had successfully unfurled and are generating electrical power. Enough power is being generated to recharge its batteries daily. \"Odyssey\" also relayed a pair of images showing \"InSight\" landing site. More images will be taken in stereo pairs to create 3D images, allowing \"InSight\" to find the best places to put the heat probe and seismometer. Over the next few weeks, \"InSight\" will check health indicators and monitor both weather and temperature conditions at the landing site.\n\nThe meteorological suite (TWINS) and magnetometer are operational, and the mission will take up to three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments.\n\nThe \"InSight\" mission placed a single stationary lander on Mars to study its deep interior and address a fundamental issue of planetary and Solar System science: understanding the processes that shaped the rocky planets of the inner Solar System (including Earth) more than four billion years ago.\n\n\"InSight\" primary objective is to study the earliest evolutionary history of the processes that shaped Mars. By studying the size, thickness, density and overall structure of Mars' core, mantle and crust, as well as the rate at which heat escapes from the planet's interior, \"InSight\" will provide a glimpse into the evolutionary processes of all of the rocky planets in the inner Solar System. The rocky inner planets share a common ancestry that begins with a process called accretion. As the body increases in size, its interior heats up and evolves to become a terrestrial planet, containing a core, mantle and crust. Despite this common ancestry, each of the terrestrial planets is later shaped and molded through a poorly understood process called differentiation. \"InSight\" mission's goal is to improve the understanding of this process and, by extension, terrestrial evolution, by measuring the planetary building blocks shaped by this differentiation: a terrestrial planet's core, mantle and crust.\n\nThe mission will determine if there is any seismic activity, measure the rate of heat flow from the interior, estimate the size of Mars' core and whether the core is liquid or solid. This data would be the first of its kind for Mars. It is also expected that frequent meteor airbursts (10–200 detectable events per year for \"InSight\") will provide additional seismo-acoustic signals to probe the interior of Mars. The mission's secondary objective is to conduct an in-depth study of geophysics, tectonic activity and the effect of meteorite impacts on Mars, which could provide knowledge about such processes on Earth. Measurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity should result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to current data.\n\nIn terms of fundamental processes shaping planetary formation, it is thought that Mars contains the most in-depth and accurate historical record, because it is big enough to have undergone the earliest accretion and internal heating processes that shaped the terrestrial planets, but is small enough to have retained signs of those processes.\n\nThe lander will then begin its mission of observing Mars, which is expected to last for two years.\n\nThe mission further develops a design inherited from the 2008 \"Phoenix\" Mars lander. Because \"InSight\" is powered by solar panels, it landed near the equator to enable maximum power for a projected lifetime of two years (1 Martian year). The mission includes two relay microsatellites called Mars Cube One (MarCO) that launched with \"InSight\" but were flying in formation with \"InSight\" to Mars.\n\n\n\n\"InSight\" payload has a total mass of 50 kg, including science instruments and support systems such as the Auxiliary Payload Sensor Suite, cameras, the instrument deployment system, and a laser retroreflector. The science payload consists of two main instruments, SEIS and HP:\n\nThe spacecraft was launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05 UTC on an Atlas V 401 launch vehicle (AV-078) from Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3-East. This was the first American interplanetary mission to launch from California.\n\nThe launch was managed by NASA's Launch Services Program. \"InSight\" was originally scheduled for launch on 4 March 2016 on an Atlas V 401 (4 meter fairing/zero (0) solid rocket boosters/single (1) engine Centaur) from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, U.S., but was called off in December 2015 due to a vacuum leak on the SEIS instrument. The rescheduled launch window ran from 5 May to 8 June 2018.\n\nThe journey to Mars took 6.5 months across for a touchdown on 26 November. After a successful landing, a three-month-long deployment phase commenced as part of its two-year (about one Martian year) prime mission.\n\nAs \"InSight\" science goals are not related to any particular surface feature of Mars, potential landing sites were chosen on the basis of practicality. Candidate sites needed to be near the equator of Mars to provide sufficient sunlight for the solar panels year round, have a low elevation to allow for sufficient atmospheric braking during EDL, flat, relatively rock-free to reduce the probability of complications during landing, and soft enough terrain to allow the heat flow probe to penetrate well into the ground.\n\nAn optimal area that meets all these requirements is Elysium Planitia, so all 22 initial potential landing sites were located in this area. The only two other areas on the equator and at low elevation, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris, are too rocky. In addition, Valles Marineris has too steep a gradient to allow safe landing.\nIn September 2013, the initial 22 potential landing sites were narrowed down to 4, and the \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\" was then used to gain more information on each of the 4 potential sites before a final decision was made. Each site consists of a landing ellipse that measures about .\n\nIn March 2017, scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that the landing site had been selected. It is located in western Elysium Planitia at . The landing site is about north from where the \"Curiosity\" rover is operating in Gale Crater.\n\nOn 26 November 2018, at approximately 19:53 UTC, mission controllers received a signal via the Mars Cube One (MarCO) satellites that the spacecraft had successfully touched down at Elysium Planitia. After landing, the mission will take three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments. It will then begin its mission of observing Mars, which is planned to last for two years.\n\nThe Mars Cube One (MarCO) spacecraft are a pair of 6U CubeSats that piggybacked with the \"InSight\" mission to test CubeSat navigation and endurance in deep space, and to help relay real-time communications (eight minute delay) during the probe's entry, descent and landing (EDL) phase. The two 6U CubeSats, named MarCO A and B, are identical. They measure and flew as a pair for redundancy. The Atlas V rocket launched the MarCO CubeSats together with the \"InSight\" cruise stage: the two CubeSats separated from the cruise stage after launch, and flew their own trajectory to Mars while flanking the lander. They did not enter orbit, but flew past Mars during the EDL phase of the mission and relayed \"InSight\" telemetry in real time.\n\nThe \"InSight\" science and engineering team includes scientists and engineers from many disciplines, countries and organizations. The science team assigned to \"InSight\" includes scientists from institutions in the U.S., France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Spain, Poland and the United Kingdom.\n\nMars Exploration Rover project scientist W. Bruce Banerdt is the principal investigator for the \"InSight\" mission and the lead scientist for the SEIS instrument. Suzanne Smrekar, whose research focuses on the thermal evolution of planets and who has done extensive testing and development on instruments designed to measure the thermal properties and heat flow on other planets, is the lead for \"InSight\" HP instrument. The Principal Investigator for RISE is William Folkner at JPL. The \"InSight\" mission team also includes project manager Tom Hoffman and deputy project manager Henry Stone.\n\nMajor contributing agencies and institutions:\n\nNational agencies:\n\nContributing institutions:\n\nAs part of its public outreach, NASA organized a program where members of the public were able to have their names sent to Mars aboard \"InSight\". Due to its launch delay, two rounds of sign-ups were conducted totaling 2.4 million names: 826,923 names were registered in 2015 and a further 1.6 million names were added in 2017. An electron beam was used to etch letters only the width of a human hair onto silicon wafers. The first chip was installed on the lander in November 2015 and the second on 23 January 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7536073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7536073", "title": "Informational listening", "text": "Informational listening\n\nThe process of informational listening focuses on the ability of an individual to understand a speaker's message. It is a huge part of everyday life, and failing to understand the concept of informational listening can be very detrimental to one's quality of life and to their contribution to society. Much of the listening people engage in on a regular basis falls under the blanket of listening for information. In the office, people listen to their superiors for instructions about what they are to do. At school, students listen to teachers for information that they are expected to understand for quizzes and tests. In all areas of life, informational listening plays a huge role in human communication.\n\nWhen listening to a person's message, it is common to overlook aspects of the conversation or make judgments before all of the information is presented. This lack of effective comprehension is detrimental to communication and is illustrated effectively by several specific obstacles. Chief among these obstacles are confirmation bias and the vividness effect, both of which distort the speaker's message by severely affecting the perception of a particular topic.\n\nConfirmation bias is the tendency to pick out aspects of a conversation that support one's own beliefs and values. This psychological process proves to have a detrimental effect on communication for several reasons. \n\nFirst, confirmation bias tends to become involved in conversation before the speaker finishes his/her message. As a result, an opinion is formed without first obtaining all pertinent information. This, in turn, leads to uneducated thinking and fallacious judgments that could later affect others. \n\nSecond, confirmation bias detracts from a person's ability to be open-minded. For example, when listening to a statement, an individual may hear something at the beginning of the conversation that arouses a specific emotion. Whether this is anger or frustration or anything else, it could have a profound impact on that person's perception of the rest of the conversation. If they were to become angry about a statement the speaker made early in the conversation, they would likely be averse to accepting arguments presented later in the discourse. \n\nTo combat this bias and its consequences, an individual must be aware of it and its effects. With this knowledge, an individual can learn to critically judge both sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.\n\nThe vividness effect explains how vivid or highly graphic and dramatic events affect an individual's perception of a situation. This phenomenon has been amplified by the media in recent decades. With the use of media technology, graphic images can be used to portray an event. While this makes the process of receiving news easier and more enjoyable, it can also blow a situation out of proportion. One year after the Columbine High School massacre, about 60 percent of the people who responded to a survey by \"USA Weekend\" said that they felt a shooting was likely at their own school. The reality was much different; in fact, the likelihood of a school shooting is negligible across America.\n\nThe vividness effect was only amplified by the media. It existed long before the advent of television or radio. When observing an event in person, an individual is automatically drawn toward the sensational or vivid aspects. Thus, a person becomes quick to believe that all aspects of an event are bad if they only remember the vivid parts that offended them. To counter this, an individual must be aware of and deal with the inclination to the dramatic and offensive, act accordingly. One must resist the temptation to jump to conclusions and instead weigh all facts before judging.\n\nIn addition to avoiding the two major mistakes listed above, there are things one must do to be a competent informational listener.\n\nTo understand what is said in the present, one must remember what has been said before; and for the message to have impact, one must remember at least parts of it at some point in the future. The most obvious memory aid is simply taking notes, but it is also helpful to create a mental outline of the message as it is being heard.\n\nIdentify the main point that the speaker is trying to bring across. When the main point has been deduced, one can begin to sort out the rest of the information and decide where it belongs in the mental outline. Before getting the big picture of a message, it can be difficult to focus on what the speaker is saying, because it is impossible to know where any particular piece of information fits.\n\nIt is usually helpful to ask oneself questions about the speaker's message. If the listener is mentally asking questions about what is being said, it is a good sign that he/she is actively involved in effective informational listening.\n\n"}

In 1925 he was named general manager and president of Oldsmobile after rising through the ranks at Remy Electric and then General Motors after the two companies merged in 1918.\n\nHe was from Indianapolis, Indiana, where he met and married Janet (or Jeannette) Reuter née Graham on Feb. 24, 1909.,\n\nIrving Reuter graduated with an engineering degree in 1907 from Purdue University College of Engineering. His knowledge of the automobile industry was reflected both in managerial duties, and by the six patents he obtained. They include inventions related to such developments as an electric generator, an ignition apparatus, a system for supplying electricity, an ignition coil, a roadster rear seat, and an engine starting device.\n\nIn 1922 he was one of ten original investors in General Motors Investment Corporation. That corporation was said to have rejuvenated the finances of the automobile industry.\n\nReuter retired from General Motors in 1935 at the age of 50 and after retirement, he and his wife lived in various locations in Florida and Asheville, North Carolina, where they moved in 1937.\n\nIn 1927 at Eaton Rapids, Michigan, Reuter and his wife, Janet (née Graham) Reuter (1886–1984), built a lavish country home they called Medovue. From 1928 to 1936, prominent members of American business and automotive companies were their guests at social functions. They were listed both in Who's Who in America and Who's Who in Michigan during their Medovue residency. In 1936 he abruptly left his position at Oldsmobile and retired to Florida, although they evidently moved on to North Carolina.\n\nThe home was built by the Reniger Construction Co. of Lansing in about a year from a \"countryhouse\" plan created by architect Harold Childs of East Lansing. The home includes large expanses of Pewabic Pottery, and the grand (and for the time technologically advanced) main bathroom is a festive work of decorative arts. Also credited is architect, Kenneth Black, who in 1930 added a rear wing and bedroom space for family member Pearl Graham (Janet's sister) of whom Janet was very close to.\n\nThereafter, the home was owned by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing from 1940 to 1962, and Joseph H. Albers, first Bishop of the diocese, used the home as his private residence. In 1989, the house was renovated and converted into a conference center, and in 1991 was declared a Michigan State Historical Object (Registered Site L1824, erected 1992 at 677 S. Michigan Road, Eaton Rapids, Michigan.)\n\nMeadovue's building and grounds are now devoted to a bed and breakfast and a restaurant for fine dining. Many of the furnishing are original antiques, and the site is an important tourist destination in Eaton Rapids. The estate includes the original pergola, nature trails, artesian well, annual and perennial gardens.\n\nIrving Reuter died at his home in Asheville in 1972 at the age of 87. He is interred at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. Janet Reuter died at the age of 98 in 1984.\n\nIrving Reuter established the Janirve Foundation in 1954. The name \"Janirve\" is a neonym/portmmanteau derived from the names of Jeanette and Irving. Much of his estate was transferred to the Janirve Foundation following the death of his wife Jeanett in 1984 The foundation was to have a limited life, and thus has been the source of a protracted legal wrangle.\n\nOne source noted that from 1984 to 2002, the Janirve Foundation distributed $59,863,536 in 1388 grants. Another source reported that: \"In 1984, the foundation became involved in grant making, and since that time has issued 1,612 grants totaling $78,897,103. In 2005, there were 78 organizations that received grants in nine different categories that include Arts and Culture, Children and Youth, Community Projects, Education, Environment, Healthcare and Shelter, Social Services, and Miscellaneous. The total amount of funds issued in 2005 equal $5,521,800.\"\n\nThrough the foundation, the Reuters made large philanthropic gifts to the University of North Carolina at Asheville.' The Reuter Center is part of the Center for Creative Retirement, and they funded much of the building. The Reuters also donated large sums to Habitat for Humanity. A $2 million matching grant to the west North Carolina Young Men's Christian Association was the largest donation in the organization's history (the building is named in their honor). They also donated to many other Asheville, North Carolina charitable and civic organizations, such as the Asheville Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe Janirve Foundation Advisory Committee Members: Richard B.

Historically crystal shape was defined by measuring the angles between crystal faces with a goniometer. In modern usage isomorphous crystals belong to the same space group.\n\nDouble sulfates, such as Tutton's salt, with the generic formula MM(SO).6HO, where M is an alkali metal and M is a divalent ion of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn, form a series of isomorphous compounds which were important in the nineteenth century in establishing the correct atomic weights of the transition elements. Alums, such as KAl(SO).12HO, are another series of isomorphous compounds, though there are three series of alums with similar external structures, but slightly different internal structures. Many spinels are also isomorphous.\n\nIn order to form isomorphous crystals two substances must have the same chemical formulation, they must contain atoms which have corresponding chemical properties and the sizes of corresponding atoms should be similar. These requirements ensure that the forces within and between molecules and ions are approximately similar and result in crystals that have the same internal structure. Even though the space group is the same, the unit cell dimensions will be slightly different because of the different sizes of the atoms involved.\n\n"}
{"id": "741575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=741575", "title": "Joseph A. Walker", "text": "Joseph A. Walker\n\nJoseph Albert Walker (February 20, 1921 – June 8, 1966) flew the world's first two spaceplane flights in 1963, thereby becoming the United States' seventh man in space. Walker was a Captain in the United States Air Force, an American World War II pilot, an experimental physicist, a NASA test pilot, and a member of the U.S. Air Force Man In Space Soonest spaceflight program. His two X-15 experimental rocket aircraft flights in 1963 that exceeded the Kármán line – the altitude of , generally considered to mark the threshold of outer space – qualified him as an astronaut under the rules of the U.S. Air Force and the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).\n\nBorn in Washington, Pennsylvania, Walker graduated from Trinity High School in 1938. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in physics from Washington and Jefferson College in 1942, before entering the United States Army Air Forces. He was married and had four children.\n\nDuring World War II, Walker flew the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter and F-5A Lightning photo aircraft (a modified P-38) on weather reconnaissance flights. Walker earned the Distinguished Flying Cross once, awarded by General Nathan Twining in July 1944, and the Air Medal with seven oak leaf clusters.\n\nAfter World War II, Walker separated from the Army Air Force and joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio, as an experimental physicist. While in Cleveland, Walker became a test pilot, and he conducted icing research in flight, as well as in the NACA icing wind tunnel. He transferred to the High-Speed Flight Research Station in Edwards, California, in 1951.\n\nWalker served for 15 years at the Edwards Flight Research Facility - now called the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center. By the mid-1950s, he was a Chief Research Pilot. Walker worked on several pioneering research projects. He flew in three versions of the Bell X-1: the X-1#2 (two flights, first on 27 August 1951), X-1A (one flight), X-1E (21 flights). When Walker attempted a second flight in the X-1A on 8 August 1955, the rocket aircraft was damaged in an explosion just before being launched from the JTB-29A mothership. Walker was unhurt, though, and he climbed back into the mothership with the X-1A subsequently jettisoned.\n\nOther research aircraft that he flew were the Douglas D-558-I Skystreak #3 (14 flights), Douglas D-558-II Skyrocket #2 (three flights), D-558-II #3 (two flights), Douglas X-3 Stiletto (20 flights), Northrop X-4 Bantam (two flights), and Bell X-5 (78 flights).\n\nWalker was the chief project pilot for the X-3 program. Walker reportedly considered the X-3 to be the worst airplane that he ever flew. In addition to research aircraft, Walker flew many chase planes during test flights of other aircraft, and he also flew in programs that involved the North American F-100 Super Sabre, McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Boeing B-47 Stratojet.\n\nIn 1958, Walker was one of the pilots selected for the U.S. Air Force's Man In Space Soonest (MISS) project, but that project never came to fruition. That same year, NACA became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and in 1960, Walker became the first NASA pilot to fly the X-15, and the second X-15 pilot, following Scott Crossfield, the manufacturer's test pilot. On his first X-15 flight, Walker did not realize how much power its rocket engines had, and he was crushed backward into the pilot's seat, screaming, \"Oh, my God!\". Then, a flight controller jokingly replied \"Yes? You called?\" Walker would go on to fly the X-15 24 times, including the only two flights that exceeded in altitude, Flight 90 (on 19 July 1963: ) and Flight 91 (on 22 August 1963: ).\n\nWalker was the first American civilian to make any spaceflight, and the second civilian overall, preceded only by the Soviet Union's cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova one month earlier. Flights 90 and 91 made Walker the first human to make multiple spaceflights.\n\nWalker flew at the fastest speed in the X-15A-1: (Mach 5.92) during a flight on 27 June 1962 (the fastest flight in any of the three X-15s was about (Mach 6.7) flown by William J. Knight in 1967).\n\nWalker also became the first test pilot of the Bell Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV), which was used to develop piloting and operational techniques for lunar landings. On 30 October 1964, Walker took the LLRV on its maiden flight, reaching an altitude of about 10 ft and a total flight time of just under one minute. He piloted 35 LLRV flights in total. Neil Armstrong later flew this craft many times in preparation for the spaceflight of Apollo 11 - the first manned landing on the Moon - including crashing it once and barely escaping from it with his ejection seat.\n\nWalker was killed on June 8, 1966, when his F-104 Starfighter chase aircraft collided with a North American XB-70 Valkyrie. At an altitude of about Walker's Starfighter was one of five aircraft in a tight group formation for a General Electric publicity photo when his F-104 drifted into contact with the XB-70's right wingtip. The F-104 flipped over, and, rolling inverted, passed over the top of the XB-70, striking both its vertical stabilizers and its left wing in the process, and exploded, killing Walker. The Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow, California, killing co-pilot Carl Cross. Its pilot, Alvin White, one of Walker's colleagues from the Man In Space Soonest program, ejected and was a sole survivor.\n\nThe USAF summary report of the accident investigation stated that, given the position of the F-104 relative to the XB-70, the F-104 pilot would not have been able to see the XB-70's wing, except by uncomfortably looking back over his left shoulder. The report stated that it was likely that Walker, piloting the F-104, maintained his position by looking at the fuselage of the XB-70, forward of his position.\n\nThe F-104 was estimated to be to the side of, and below, the fuselage of the XB-70. The report concluded that from that position, without appropriate sight cues, Walker was unable to properly perceive his motion relative to the Valkyrie, leading to his aircraft drifting into contact with the XB-70's wing.\n\nThe accident investigation also pointed to the wake vortex off the XB-70's right wingtip as the reason for the F-104's sudden roll over and into the bomber. A sixth plane in the incident was a civilian Learjet 23 that held the photographer. Because the formation flight and photo were unauthorized, the careers of several Air Force colonels ended as a result of this aviation accident.\n\nWalker was a charter member and one of the first Fellows of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He received the Robert J. Collier Trophy, the Harmon International Trophy for Aviators, the Iven C. Kincheloe Award, the John J. Montgomery Award, and the Octave Chanute Award. His alma mater awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Aeronautical Sciences degree in 1961. He received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1962. The National Pilots Association named him Pilot of the Year in 1963.\n\nWalker was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor in 1991, and the International Space Hall of Fame in 1995. Joe Walker Middle School in Quartz Hill, California, is named in his honor as well as the Joe Walker Elementary School in Washington, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn 23 August 2005, NASA officially conferred on Walker his Astronaut Wings, posthumously..\n\n\"Star Trek\" starship designer John Eaves created the Walker-class starships named for Joseph Walker that first appeared in the 2017 TV series \"\", including \"USS Shenzhou\".\n\n\n"}

The unique institution that had contributed to avoid a catastrophic situation for the common knowledge in Tunisia is the Zitouna University that had developed during successive Ottoman periods and that gives courses which are specialized in Social sciences and Humanities like Theology, Fiqh, Hadith, Arabic language, Arabic literature, Law and a few Arithmetics and calculus. This situation explains why all important scientists of that period were lawyers, poets, authors and theologists.\n\nDuring the crisis of the 19th century that had occurred in Tunisia, some notable intellectual people who had deeper training and education had appeared like General Hussein and Kheireddine Pacha thanks to their specialized studies in the Military school of Bardo that had been created in order to solve the matter of the lack of experts in applied sciences caused by the deficiency of the system of Zitouna University. Those people had tried to do some reforms in order to save the country. Even the alumni of Zitouna University had tried to do some works in order to better the scientific consciousness in Tunisia. In fact, some main scientific works of that period that were led by the Bayram, Ben Achour, Ennaifar and Djait families had been done. These works were important and were considered as promoters of an Arab Renaissance.

These microcomputers were often sold as \"DIY\" kits or pre-built machines in relatively small numbers in the mid-1970s. These systems were primarily used for teaching the use of microprocessors and supporting peripheral devices, and unlike home computers were rarely used with pre-written application software. Most early micros came without alphanumeric keyboards or displays, which had to be provided by the user. RAM was quite small in the unexpanded systems (a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes). By 1976 the number of pre-assembled machines was growing, and the 1977 introduction of the \"Trinity\" of Commodore PET, TRS-80 and Apple II generally marks the end of the \"early\" microcomputer era, and the advent of the consumer home computer era that followed.\n\nBefore the advent of microprocessors, it was possible to build small computers using small-scale integrated circuits (ICs), where each IC contained only a few logic gates or flip-flops.\n\nAs microprocessors were developed, companies often released simple development systems to bootstrap the use of the processor. These systems were often converted by hobbyists into complete computer systems.\n\nIntel's Intellec computers were a series of early microcomputers Intel produced starting in the 1970s as a development platform for their processors.\n\nFor some time the microcomputer world was dominated by systems delivered in kit form. As most machines of the era were sold in small numbers, there was no reason to invest in automated manufacturing systems, leaving the final assembly to manual labor. Kits took advantage of this by offering the system at a low price point, and relying on the user to complete the expensive part, the final assembly. Kits were popular between 1975, with the introduction of the famous Altair 8800, but as sales volumes increased, kits became less common. The introduction of useful fully assembled machines in 1977 led to the rapid disappearance of kit systems for most users. The famed ZX81 is among the last of the large sellers in the kit market.\n\nSome magazines published plans and printed circuit board layouts from which a reader could in principle duplicate the project, although usually commercially made boards could be ordered to expedite assembly. Other kits varied from etched, drilled, printed circuit boards and a parts list to packages containing cases, power supplies, and all interconnections. All kits required significant assembly by the user.\n\nA number of complete microcomputers were offered even before kits became popular, dating to as far back as 1973. For some time there was a major market for assembled versions of the Altair 8800, a market that grew significantly through the late 1970s and into the early 1980s. The introduction of three computers aimed at personal users in 1977, the Radio Shack TRS-80, Apple II, and Commodore PET, significantly changed the market and led to the home computer revolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "206965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206965", "title": "M4 motorway", "text": "M4 motorway\n\nThe M4 is a motorway in the United Kingdom running from West London to South Wales. Towns and cities along the route include Slough, Reading, Swindon, Bristol, Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. Originally referred to as the London-South Wales Motorway, the English section to the Severn Bridge over the River Severn was constructed between 1961 and 1971; the Welsh element was completed in 1993. Another Severn bridge, known as the Second Severn Crossing, was opened in 1996 and the M4 was rerouted.\n\nFrom London to Bristol, the M4 runs close to the A4, and after crossing the River Severn, following the A48 through South Wales, using the Brynglas Tunnels in Newport, it terminates north of Pontarddulais. The M4 is one of only three motorways in Wales; the others being the A48(M) and M48 spurs. Although not signed, European route E30 includes most of the M4.\n\nA new road from London to South Wales was first proposed in the 1930s, and the Ministry of Transport announced plans for the M4 as one of the first major post-war trunk road improvement projects in 1956.\n\nThe Chiswick flyover, a short section of elevated dual-carriageway built to reduce the impact of traffic travelling between central London and the west, opened in 1959; it was not originally classed as a motorway.\nThe Maidenhead bypass opened in 1961 whilst J1-J5 opened in 1965. The stretch from J18 to the west of Newport was opened in 1966, including the Severn Bridge (now part of the M48). The Port Talbot by-pass, also built in the 1960s and now part of the M4, was originally the A48(M) motorway, a number now allocated to a short section of motorway near Cardiff. The Ministry of Transport originally intended that the M4 would terminate at Tredegar Park west of Newport, and it was only following the creation of the Welsh Office that the Government became committed to a high-standard dual carriageway to Pont Abraham in Carmarthenshire.\n\nThe English section of the motorway was completed on 22 December 1971 when the stretch between Junctions 9 and 15 (Maidenhead and Swindon) was opened to traffic. The Welsh section was completed in 1993, when the Briton Ferry motorway bridge opened. The Second Severn Crossing opened in 1996, together with new link motorways on either side of the estuary to divert the M4 over the new crossing. The existing route over the Severn Bridge was redesignated the M48, and the new M49 was opened to connect the new crossing to the M5.\nIn June 1999 the section of the third lane (the lane nearest the central reservation) between Junctions 2 and 3 was converted to a bus lane, first as a pilot scheme and then permanently in 2001. A lower speed limit was introduced along the bus lane section at the same time (the lane was however reverted to general traffic use by the incoming coalition government in late 2010).\n\nIn April 2005 speed checks carried out by police camera vans between Junction 14 and Junction 18 led to a public protest, involving a \"go-slow\" of several hundred vehicles along the affected sections of the motorway.\n\nBetween 2007 and January 2010 the section from Castleton (Junction 29) to Coryton (Junction 32) was widened to six lanes. The scheme was formally opened on 25 January 2010 by Ieuan Wyn Jones the Deputy First Minister for Wales.\n\nDuring 2009 the Newport section of the motorway between Junctions 23a and 29 was upgraded with a new concrete central barrier. In February 2010 it was proposed that the M4 in South Wales would become the first hydrogen highway with hydrogen stations provided along the route, with an aspiration for further stations to be provided along the M4 into South West England over time. A similar claim was made for a section of road in Scotland close to Aberdeen in September 2009 with refuelling points at Bridge of Don, Ellon and Peterhead.\n\nIn October 2010 the new Secretary of State for Transport, Philip Hammond, announced that the bus lane in the London section would be suspended for 18 months from 24 December 2010, be brought back into use temporarily for the 2012 Summer Olympics, and then be removed.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, Junction 11, near Reading, was extensively remodelled with a new four-lane motorway junction, two new road bridges and other works. The £65m scheme included work on the Mereoak roundabout and part of the A33 Swallowfield Bypass near Shinfield, and also the conversion of the two existing bridges, one of which is available only to pedestrians and cyclists and the other to buses. It also involved the movement of the local Highways Agency and Fire Service offices, and the construction of a long footbridge network, a new bus-lane and a new gyratory. Sound barriers for nearby residential areas were also installed. In April 2008, the decision to preserve a rare Vickers machine gun pillbox and turn it into a bat roost was announced by the developers.\n\nThe table below shows the timeline for the construction of the motorway on a section by section basis.\n\nThe M4 crosses the River Severn on a toll bridge, the last of two on the UK motorway network. The other being the Severn Bridge carrying the M48. Tolls are charged travelling only westbound. Drivers therefore have to pay to enter Wales, but not to enter England.\n\nFor the majority of its length, the national speed limit applies. Exceptions include the following:\n\nBetween 1999 and 2010 there was a controversial bus lane on the eastbound (London-bound) carriageway from Junction 3 (A312) to the western end of the Chiswick Flyover near Brentford, covering part of the journey between Heathrow Airport and central London. The lane which had no intermediate exits was for use by buses, coaches, motorcycles, emergency vehicles and licensed taxis but not mini-cabs. It was used by 7% of vehicles which carried 21% of the people.\n\nThe lane was restored for normal motorway running at the end of 2010 for 18 months using an Experimental Traffic Order and was re-established for the duration of the 2012 Summer Olympics with the intention that it would then be removed permanently.\n\nNear Junction 35 of the M4, there is a stretch of the motorway that has a surfacing of porous asphalt that improves drainage and reduces noise. When driving in heavy rain drivers notice a reduction in road spray from other vehicles and improved visibility. This special surface was publicised in an episode of the BBC's \"Tomorrow's World\" programme. This was the site of the first trial of the new road surface when it was laid down in 1993.\n\nThe elevated section of the M4 in West London, built in the 1960s, is mostly directly above the A4 and extends over parts of Brentford's Golden Mile. This section was designed to have a heated road surface to reduce icing in winter.\n\nThe M4 has two of the three four-level stack interchanges in the UK, including the first UK example at junction 20, the \"Almondsbury Interchange\" with the M5, The other is junction 4b with the M25. Junction 4b has to make provision for the railway line passing beneath the M4. Due to the nature of these junctions, it is impossible to make a u-turn at either junction.\n\nThe M4 passes through the Brynglas Tunnels at Junction 25a, Newport. These are the only twin–bored tunnels on the United Kingdom motorway network.\n\nJunction 8/9 near Maidenhead, Berkshire, and High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire is the only one in the UK with dual numbers. This a relic from when the M4 used to turn north after junction 8, where it met the A308, and head for the original Junction 9, where it ended on a roundabout interchange with the A4. When the westward extension was opened junction 8 was closed and a new junction built a little to the west, taking both numbers. The road to the A4 became A423(M) and later A404(M) and the junction with the A4 became 9B. Junction 9A is the exit for Cox Green and White Waltham. West of Junction 13 on the eastbound carriageway there are a set of sliproads signposted \"Works Unit Only\". The signs have red borders, implying a military exit. It is a back entrance to RAF Welford, a Second World War airfield and now an RAF/USAF military installation mainly used for storing munitions. The M4 entrance allows easier access for the large vehicles used to carry the munitions.\n\nThe section of the M4 in South Wales has to thread its way through mountainous terrain and built-up areas, so there are some unusual junction layouts. Junction 27 (High Cross) is a normal grade-separated roundabout junction, but subject to severe space constraints: traffic joining the motorway must initially travel in the opposite direction to the intended direction of travel, before making a sharp left-hand turn from the slip road onto the motorway. At the time of construction, junctions 30 and 31 were set aside for intermediate additional interchanges. Junction 30 (Cardiff Gate) has since been added but there are no current plans to construct junction 31 (A469 road). Junction 39 can only be used to access the motorway from a single slip road onto the westbound carriageway from the A48 at junction 38. There is no exit from the motorway at this junction.\n\nJunction 41 comprises two different junctions; one for local traffic to and from the west and one from the east. The former leads to and from a spur leading to the roundabout in Briton Ferry, formerly known as junction 41a, and the original bridge over the River Neath, which would allow access onto the stretch of the M4 from Junction 43 westward. The second, eastern junction leads to and from the A48 towards Port Talbot. As a result, it is possible to travel in both directions for almost on the motorway, both joining and then leaving the motorway at junction 41. Junction 44 is unusual in that the eastbound entrance dives under the inside of the junction, effectively a creating a \"right-turn\" on a roundabout. Similarly, slip roads pass under or over the main motorway at Junctions 41 and 42.\n\nMaintenance of the section of the motorway in England is the responsibility of the Highways Agency. The section in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Government.\n\nThe M4 motorway has two sections of smart motorway. The one between junctions 19 (M32) and 20 (M5) north of Bristol has variable speed limits and a part-time hard-shoulder. Completion was in summer 2014. The section between junctions 24 and 29 in Newport has variable speed limits.\n\nIn 2010 it was announced that a smart motorway would be constructed between junctions 3 and 12, with work starting in Autumn 2018. This will be the longest smart motorway scheme in the United Kingdom, with a length of 51km (32 miles). Work is expected to be completed in March 2022 at a cost of £848 million.\n\nA new Junction 15a is being considered by Wiltshire Council, which would give access to South and Central Swindon as well as to Wroughton, Marlborough and Devizes via the existing A4361. In South Gloucestershire, a possible Junction 18a would connect with the A432 and A4174 giving better access to Bristol, via Mangotsfield, and also a direct link with Yate.\n\nPlans for the \"missing\" Junction 31, also known as the Thornhill interchange, for which planning permission was originally granted in September 1991 (but subsequently expired), were rekindled after proposals for a new business park on a site north of the M4 were submitted in 2007 to Cardiff Council. The developers of the business park, St Modwen Developments, would likely fund the new junction, which would be on the A469.\n\nA freedom of information request in 2010 to Cardiff Council shows that whilst the land that would enable this junction should continue to be strategically protected, the decision to formally abandon the proposed Junction 31 Thornhill was made in October 2007 and there had been no subsequent mention of it in Cardiff Council\nStrategic or Planning meetings since.\n\nPlans for an 'M4 Relief Road' around Newport were first announced by the Welsh Office in 1991, but made little progress. The Welsh Assembly Government revived the scheme as the M4 relief road tolled bypass in 2007 but later abandoned it for financial reasons. An extension to the Newport Southern Distributor Road through the old Corus steel works is being considered. This road is already a dual carriageway but not open to the public. A public consultation exercise on options for improving the capacity of the M4 corridor around Newport opened on 5 March 2012. Its website states that: \"the motorway around Newport does not conform to today’s motorway standards. It lacks continuous hard shoulders, has closely spaced junctions with sub-standard slip road visibility and narrows to a restricted two lane section through the Brynglas Tunnels. Heavy congestion occurs along this stretch and either side of it at peak hours.\"\n\nThere have been calls to close the slip roads at Junction 40 and 41 (at Port Talbot) to improve traffic flow. The motorway has only two lanes on this stretch and is a major traffic congestion blackspot. Junctions 40 and 41 (at Port Talbot) have very short slip roads which have not been modernised. A small-scale trial of closing the westbound on-slip of Junction 41 between 7 am and 9 am and from 4 pm to 6 pm on weekdays started on 4 August 2014 but following heavy criticism from local businesses and residents, was stopped on 29 May 2015.\n!scope=col|mile\n!scope=col|km\n!scope=col abbr=\"Eastbound\"|Eastbound exits (B carriageway)\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col abbr=\"Westbound\"|Westbound exits (A carriageway)\n\n\n\n"}

The book has 172 folios and a page size of 29.7 x 14 cm (11 11/16 x 5 1/2 inches) and the text is a redaction of \"De Materia Medica\" by the 1st century Greek military physician Dioscorides, with descriptions of plants and their medicinal uses. Unlike \"De Materia Medica\", the text is arranged alphabetically by plant. The codex derives independently from the same model as the Vienna Dioscurides, which was created ca. 512 for a Byzantine princess, but differs from it significantly: though the illustrations follow the same inferred model, they are rendered more naturalistically in the Naples Dioscurides. Additionally, in the Naples manuscript, the illustrations occupy the top half of each folio, rather than being full page miniatures as in the Vienna Dioscurides. The plant descriptions are recorded below the illustration in two or three rather narrow columns, recalling the arrangement the earliest scroll version of the work would have had, before the codex form became near-universal. The script is somewhat rough and uneven, and the painting style of the miniatures less precise and naturalistic than the Vienna manuscript, indicating a certain falling-off in standards. The style of Greek script used in the manuscript indicates that it was probably written in Byzantine-ruled southern Italy, where ancient Greek cultural traditions remained strong, although it is not known exactly where it was produced. \n\nMarginal notes indicate that the manuscript had contact with the medical school at Salerno in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. \n\nA luxurious facsimile has been published by Salerno Editrice, Rome, in collaboration with Akademische Druck of Graz, Austria, publishers of a comparable facsimile of the Vienna Dioscurides.\n\n\n"}

However, as amateurs sought to build larger and thinner mirrors, they found such designs inadequate.\n\nMany amateur telescope makers use cells which are designed via equal area rule calculation, using programs such as David Chandler's public domain program, \"Cell\". However, such calculation does not account for mechanical stresses introduced in one part of a telescope mirror by another part, whereas finite element analysis can be used to reduce such stress. Although general finite element analysis programs such as Nastran will work for mirror cells, an advantage of PLOP is that it can be set to ignore deformation that merely results in refocus of a mirror's parabola. PLOP can be used to calculate floating support points for a mirror's axial (rear) support; however, additional tools are needed to calculate potential error from a mirror's lateral (edge) support.\n\nMirror cell calculations, whether using PLOP or another program, do not overcome errors introduced by gluing the mirror to its cell, excessive tightening of edge supports, nor impingement of the cell structure onto the mirror as result of differential cooling shrinkage. The significantly more complex calculations arising from the support needs of large honeycomb mirrors and those using active optics systems are outside the design parameters of such programs.\n\n\n"}

It is displayed in the \"Salon de la pendule\" in the petit appartement du roi on the first floor of Versailles, France. The clock set the official time in France for the first time in the kingdom's history.\n\nThe clock is an exceptional rococo work over in height, crowned with a moving celestial sphere. It shows the date, time, real time average phases of the moon and Copernican planetary motion. The large astronomical dials mark the rising and setting of the sun and moon every day. Earth is represented by a bronze globe on which all countries are engraved with the main cities. This globe is placed among the rocks and waterfalls, which serve as a universal horizon.\n\nThe mechanism is designed to be able to display the date until the end of the year 9999.\n\nThe clock mechanism was designed by engineer Claude-Siméon Passemant (1702–1769) and executed by the clockmaker Louis Dauthiau (1730–1809). The rococo-style gilt-bronze box protecting the mechanism was made in 1753 by sculptor Jean-Jacques Caffieri (1735–1792) and bronze-founder Philippe Caffieri.\n\nAfter being reviewed and approved by the French Academy of Sciences in August 1749, the clock was presented to Louis XV in Choisy by the duc de Chaulnes on 7 September 1750. The King acquired it the same year. In January 1754, the clock took its place among the astronomical clocks of Versailles. The fact that it was placed in the \"Salon de la pendule\" demonstrates the interest that Louis XV had in the mechanical arts through clockmaking. Indeed, the room was so named because the dials of clocks were set into the wall panelling.\n\n\n"}

Its effects include forgetfulness, cognitive impairment and mood disturbances. It can exhibit itself in a fugue state known as the \"Antarctic stare\".It is regarded as one of the contributory causes of winter-over syndrome.\n\nThe exact cause of Polar T3 syndrome is unknown, but there are certain characteristics of this syndrome that are shared with patients that have subclinical hypothyroidism. One common bio-marker that is known is the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is a hormone that leads to a cascade of other hormones being released that affect the pituitary gland. This hormone in particular is found in large quantities in people with Polar T3 syndrome. Additionally, other hormonal changes include a significant decrease in triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). All of these biochemical alterations are thought to be due to the extreme cold and dark winter months. Other attributing factors are changes in the circadian rhythm patterns and lack of social interaction.\n\nPeople diagnosed with Polar T3 syndrome are known to have a variety of symptoms including sleep disruptions, mental impairment, and mood changes. Sleep disruptions include inability to fall asleep or stay asleep and are more prominent in the winter months, according to a study done by Palinkas. Most of these sleep disruptions are characterized by a decrease in short wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM). The Palinkas survey concluded that on average 64% of people living in the Antarctic polar region are affected by some sort of sleep disruption. In addition to problems with sleep, 51.5% of people suffer from cognitive impairment. This type of deficiency includes a decline in proficient memorization and the inability to concentrate. Other areas of mental impairment are mood changes (negative affect). These include depression, anxiety, and irritability throughout the winter months.\n\nWhen determining if a person has Polar T3 syndrome multiple aspects are taken into consideration. Biochemical tests can be carried out which test for differences in serum thyroid and plasma lipid levels. The main purpose of these tests are to gain insight on the thyroid function. Other assessments include analysis of changes in mood and memory function. If a person is diagnosed with Polar T3 syndrome using the assessments mentioned above, then hormonal therapy is commonly prescribed including thyroxine supplements.\n"}

The scanners are regularly used for passive remote sensing from space, and in spectral analysis on production lines, for example with near-infrared spectroscopy used to identify contaminated food and feed. The moving scanner line in a traditional photocopier (or a scanner or facsimile machine) is also a familiar, everyday example of a push broom scanner. Push broom scanners and the whisk broom scanners variant (also known as across-track scanners) are often contrasted with staring arrays (such as in a digital camera), which image objects without scanning, and are more familiar to most people.\n\nIn orbital push broom sensors, a line of sensors arranged perpendicular to the flight direction of the spacecraft is used. Different areas of the surface are imaged as the spacecraft flies forward. A push broom scanner can gather more light than a whisk broom scanner because it looks at a particular area for a longer time, like a long exposure on a camera. One drawback of pushbroom sensors is the varying sensitivity of the individual detectors. These sensors are also known as \"survey\" or \"wide field\" devices, comparable to wide angle lenses on conventional cameras.\n\nExamples of spacecraft cameras using push broom imagers include Mars Express's High Resolution Stereo Camera, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera NAC, Mars Global Surveyor's Mars Orbiter Camera WAC, and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer on board the Terra satellite.\n\n"}
{"id": "8811781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8811781", "title": "Remontoire", "text": "Remontoire\n\nIn mechanical horology, a remontoire (from the French \"remonter\", meaning 'to wind') is a small secondary source of power, a weight or spring, which runs the timekeeping mechanism and is itself periodically rewound by the timepiece's main power source, such as a mainspring. It was used in precision clocks and watches to place the source of power closer to the escapement, thereby increasing the accuracy by evening out variations in drive force caused by unevenness of the friction in the geartrain. In spring-driven precision clocks, a gravity remontoire is often used to replace the uneven force delivered by the mainspring running down by the more constant force of gravity acting on a weight. In turret clocks, it serves to separate the large forces needed to drive the hands from the modest forces needed to drive the escapement which keeps the pendulum swinging. A remontoire should not be confused with a \"maintaining power spring\", which is used only to keep the timepiece going while it is being wound.\n\nRemontoires are used because the timekeeping mechanism in clocks and watches, the pendulum or balance wheel, is never isochronous; its rate is affected by changes in the drive force applied to it. In spring-driven timepieces, the drive force declines as the mainspring runs down. In weight-driven clocks the drive force, provided by a weight suspended by a cord, is more constant, but imperfections in the gear train and variations in lubrication also cause small variations. In turret clocks, the large hands, which are attached to the clock's wheel train, are exposed to the weather on the outside of the tower, so winds and accumulations of ice and snow apply disturbing forces to the hands, which are passed on to the wheel train.\n\nWith a remontoire, the only force applied to the clock's escapement is that of the remontoire's spring or weight, so that it is isolated from any variations in the main power source or wheel train, which is just used to rewind the remontoire. Remontoires are designed to rewind frequently, at intervals between fifteen seconds and an hour. The rewinding process is triggered automatically when the remontoire's weight or spring reaches the end of its power. This frequent rewinding is another source of accuracy, because it averages out any variations in the clock's rate due to changes in the force of the remontoire itself. If the rate of the clock varies as the remontoire spring runs down, this variation will be repeated again and again, each time the remontoire goes through its cycle, so it will have no effect on the long term rate of the clock.\n\nThe gravity remontoire was invented by Swiss clockmaker Jost Burgi around 1595. Usually the \"Kalenderuhr\" (three month running, springdriven, calendar-desk-clock) Burgi made for William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) (now Inventory No. U 47 at the Naturwissenschaftlich-Technische Sammlung in Kassel) is considered the oldest surviving clock with a remontoire, even if it does not provide power to the escapement during the few seconds of the daily cycle where the remontoire weight gets wound up by the spring. Today remontoire mechanisms are all designed to deliver power to the escapement during the remontoire reset cycle.\n\nThe spring remontoire was invented by English clockmaker John Harrison during development of his H2 marine chronometer in 1739. Harrison's working drawing of the device is preserved in the Library of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in London, England.\n\nMany French and Swiss pocketwatches after 1860 were stamped on the back with the word \"Remontoire\". This merely meant that they didn't have to be wound with a key (i.e. they were wound by the then-novel winding crown inside the pendant). Etymologically the term is correct, the mainspring is \"rewound\" by some other force than a key, but these watches usually do not contain a remontoire as the word is used today.\n\nRemontoires are distinguished by their power source:\nThey can also be classified by where in the wheel train the remontoire is located:\n\nBefore the common use of electronic clocks in automobiles, automobile clocks had mechanical movements, powered by an electric remontoire. A low power drive spring would be wound every few minutes by a plunger in a solenoid, powered by the vehicle's service battery and activated by a switch when the spring tension got too low. Such clocks were, however, notoriously inaccurate, typically being made as cheaply as possible.\n\n"}

It is sometimes considered synonymous for pseudoplastic behaviour, and is usually defined as excluding time-dependent effects, such as thixotropy. Shear-thinning behaviour is generally not seen in pure liquids with low molecular mass, or ideal solutions of small molecules like sucrose or sodium chloride, but is often seen in polymer solutions and molten polymers, and complex fluids and suspensions like ketchup, whipped cream, blood, paint, and nail polish.\n\nSome authors consider shear-thinning to be a special case of thixotropic behaviour, because the recovery of the microstructure of the liquid to its initial state will always require a non-zero time. When the recovery of viscosity after disturbance is very rapid however, the observed behaviour is classic shear-thinning or pseudoplasticity, because as soon as the shear is removed, the viscosity returns to normal. When it takes a measurable time for the viscosity to recover, thixotropic behaviour is observed. When describing the viscosity of liquids, however, it is therefore useful to distinguish shear-thinning (pseudoplastic) behaviour from thixotropic behaviour, where the viscosity at all shear rates is decreased for some duration after agitation: both of these effects can often be seen separately in the same liquid.\n\nModern paints are examples of pseudoplastic materials. When modern paints are applied, the shear created by the brush or roller will allow them to thin and wet out the surface evenly. Once applied, the paints regain their higher viscosity, which avoids drips and runs. Ketchup is a shear-thinning fluid.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n"}

{"id": "46455334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46455334", "title": "Trochoidal wave", "text": "Trochoidal wave\n\nIn fluid dynamics, a trochoidal wave or Gerstner wave is an exact solution of the Euler equations for periodic surface gravity waves. It describes a progressive wave of permanent form on the surface of an incompressible fluid of infinite depth. The free surface of this wave solution is an inverted (upside-down) trochoid – with sharper crests and flat troughs. This wave solution was discovered by Gerstner in 1802, and rediscovered independently by Rankine in 1863.\n\nThe flow field associated with the trochoidal wave is not irrotational: it has vorticity. The vorticity is of such a specific strength and vertical distribution that the trajectories of the fluid parcels are closed circles. This is in contrast with the usual experimental observation of Stokes drift associated with the wave motion. Also the phase speed is independent of the trochoidal wave's amplitude, unlike other nonlinear wave-theories (like those of the Stokes wave and cnoidal wave) and observations. For these reasons – as well as for the fact that solutions for finite fluid depth are lacking – trochoidal waves are of limited use for engineering applications.\n\nIn computer graphics, the rendering of realistic-looking ocean waves can be done by use of so-called Gerstner waves. This is a multi-component and multi-directional extension of the traditional Gerstner wave, often using fast Fourier transforms to make (real-time) animation feasible.\n\nUsing a Lagrangian specification of the flow field, the motion of fluid parcels is – for a periodic wave on the surface of a fluid layer of infinite depth:\nwhere formula_2 and formula_3 are the positions of the fluid parcels in the formula_4 plane at time formula_5, with formula_6 the horizontal coordinate and formula_7 the vertical coordinate (positive upward, in the direction opposing gravity). The Lagrangian coordinates formula_8 label the fluid parcels, with formula_9 the centres of the circular orbits – around which the corresponding fluid parcel moves with constant speed formula_10 Further formula_11 is the wavenumber (and formula_12 the wavelength), while formula_13 is the phase speed with which the wave propagates in the formula_6-direction. The phase speed satisfies the dispersion relation:\n\nwhich is independent of the wave nonlinearity (i.e. does not depend on the wave height formula_16), and this phase speed formula_13 the same as for Airy's linear waves in deep water.\n\nThe free surface is a line of constant pressure, and is found to correspond with a line formula_18, where formula_19 is a (nonpositive) constant. For formula_20 the highest waves occur, with a cusp-shaped crest. Note that the highest (irrotational) Stokes wave has a crest angle of 120°, instead of the 0° for the rotational trochoidal wave.\n\nThe wave height of the trochoidal wave is formula_21 The wave is periodic in the formula_6-direction, with wavelength formula_23 and also periodic in time with period formula_24\n\nThe vorticity formula_25 under the trochoidal wave is:\n\nvarying with Lagrangian elevation formula_27 and diminishing rapidly with depth below the free surface.\n\nA multi-component and multi-directional extension of the Lagrangian description of the free-surface motion – as used in Gerstner's trochoidal wave – is used in computer graphics for the simulation of ocean waves. For the classical Gerstner wave the fluid motion exactly satisfies the nonlinear, incompressible and inviscid flow equations below the free surface. However, the extended Gerstner waves do in general not satisfy these flow equations exactly (although they satisfy them approximately, i.e. for the linearised Lagrangian description by potential flow). This description of the ocean can be programmed very efficiently by use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Moreover, the resulting ocean waves from this process look realistic, as a result of the nonlinear deformation of the free surface (due to the Lagrangian specification of the motion): sharper crests and flatter troughs.\n\nThe mathematical description of the free-surface in these Gerstner waves can be as follows: the horizontal coordinates are denoted as formula_6 and formula_29, and the vertical coordinate is formula_7. The mean level of the free surface is at formula_31 and the positive formula_7-direction is upward, opposing the Earth's gravity of strength formula_33 The free surface is described parametrically as a function of the parameters formula_34 and formula_35 as well as of time formula_36 The parameters are connected to the mean-surface points formula_37 around which the fluid parcels at the wavy surface orbit. The free surface is specified through formula_38 formula_39 and formula_40 with:\n\nwhere formula_42 is the hyperbolic tangent function, formula_43 is the number of wave components considered, formula_44 is the amplitude of component formula_45 and formula_46 its phase. Further formula_47 is its wavenumber and formula_48 its angular frequency. The latter two, formula_49 and formula_50 can not be chosen independently but are related through the dispersion relation:\n\nwith formula_52 the mean water depth. In deep water (formula_53) the hyperbolic tangent goes to one: formula_54 The components formula_55 and formula_56 of the horizontal wavenumber vector formula_57 determine the wave propagation direction of component formula_58\n\nThe choice of the various parameters formula_59 and formula_46 for formula_61 and a certain mean depth formula_52 determines the form of the ocean surface. A clever choice is needed in order to exploit the possibility of fast computation by means of the FFT. See e.g. for a description how to do this. Most often, the wavenumbers are chosen on a regular grid in formula_63-space. Thereafter, the amplitudes formula_44 and phases formula_46 are chosen randomly in accord with the variance-density spectrum of a certain desired sea state. Finally, by FFT, the ocean surface can be constructed in such a way that it is periodic both in space and time, enabling tiling – creating periodicity in time by slightly shifting the frequencies formula_48 such that formula_67 for formula_68\n\nIn rendering, also the normal vector formula_69 to the surface is often needed. These can be computed using the cross product (formula_70) as:\n\nThe unit normal vector then is formula_72 with formula_73 the norm of formula_74\n\n"}

Construction started in August 1942. She was originally named but was renamed in honor of the prior , which was lost in October 1942, becoming the eighth ship to bear the name.\n\n\"Hornet\" was commissioned 29 November 1943, and after three months of training joined the U.S. forces in the Pacific War. She played a major part in the Pacific battles of World War II, and also took part in Operation Magic Carpet, returning troops to the U.S. Following World War II, she served in the Vietnam War, and also played a part in the Apollo program, recovering the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 astronauts as they returned from the Moon.\n\n\"Hornet\" was finally decommissioned in 1970. She was eventually designated as both a National Historic Landmark and a California Historical Landmark, and in 1998 she opened to the public as the USS \"Hornet\" Museum in Alameda, California.\n\nThe contract to build \"Kearsarge\" had been given to Newport News Shipbuilding on 9 September 1940, and her keel was laid down on 3 August 1942. The seventh was sunk in the Battle of Santa Cruz on 26 October 1942, and the CV-12 hull was renamed \"Hornet\" (the name \"Kearsarge\" is still stamped into her keel plate). Larger and more advanced than her Yorktown-class namesake, she was launched on 30 August 1943 and commissioned on 29 November 1943. Her first commander was Captain (later Rear Admiral) Miles R. Browning.\n\nThe \"Hornet\" conducted shakedown training off Bermuda before departing Norfolk on 14 February 1944 to join the Fast Carrier Task Force on 20 March at Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands. After lending air support to protect the invasion beaches in New Guinea, she conducted massive aerial raids against Japanese bases in the Caroline Islands and prepared to support the amphibious assault for the occupation of the Marianas Islands.\n\nOn 11 June, \"Hornet\" launched raids on Tinian and Saipan. The following day she conducted heavy bombing attacks on Guam and Rota. On 15–16 June, she blasted Japanese air fields at Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima to prevent air attacks on troops invading Saipan in the Marianas. The afternoon of 18 June, \"Hornet\" formed with the Fast Carrier Task Force to intercept the Japanese First Mobile Fleet, headed through the Philippine Sea for Saipan. The Battle of the Philippine Sea began on 19 June, when \"Hornet\" launched strikes to destroy as many land-based Japanese planes as possible before the carrier-based Japanese aircraft came in effectively.\n\nThe Japanese approached the American carriers in four massive waves, full of young and inexperienced pilots. Fighter aircraft from \"Hornet\" and other U.S. carriers, whose veteran pilots' skills were honed to perfection, broke up and savaged all the attacks before the Japanese aerial raiders reached the task force. Nearly every Japanese aircraft was shot down in the great air battles of 19 June that became commonly known as \"The Marianas Turkey Shoot\". As the Japanese Mobile Fleet fled in defeat on 20 June, the carriers launched long-range airstrikes that sank the and so damaged two tankers that they were abandoned and scuttled. Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa's own flag log for 20 June 1944 showed his surviving carrier air power as only 35 operational aircraft out of the 430 planes with which he had commenced the Battle of the Philippine Sea.\n\n\"Hornet\", based at Eniwetok in the Marshalls, raided Japanese installations ranging from Guam to the Bonins, then turned her attention to the Palaus, throughout the Philippine Sea, and to Japanese bases on Okinawa and Formosa. Her aircraft gave direct support to the troops invading Leyte on 20 October 1944. During the Battle for Leyte Gulf she launched damaging raids on the Japanese center force in the Battle off Samar, and hastened the retreat of the Japanese fleet through the Sibuyan Sea towards Borneo.\n\nIn the following months, \"Hornet\" attacked Japanese shipping and airfields throughout the Philippines. This included participation in a raid that destroyed an entire Japanese convoy in Ormoc Bay. On 30 December, she departed Ulithi in the Carolines for raids against Formosa, Indo-China, and the Pescadores Islands. En route back to Ulithi, \"Hornet\"s planes conducted photo reconnaissance of Okinawa on 22 January 1945 to aid the planned invasion of that \"last stepping-stone to Japan\".\n\n\"Hornet\" again departed Ulithi on 10 February for full-scale aerial assaults on Tokyo, then supported the amphibious landing assault on Iwo Jima on 19–20 February.\n\nRepeated raids were made against the Tokyo plains industrial complex, and Okinawa was hard hit. On 1 April, \"Hornet\" planes gave direct support to the amphibious assault landings on Okinawa. On 6 April, her aircraft joined in attacks which sank the and her task force as it closed on Okinawa. The \"Hornet\" launched 3 torpedoes and her aircraft dropped 4 bombs on the \"Yamato\"\".\" The following two months found \"Hornet\" alternating between close support to ground troops on Okinawa and hard-hitting raids to destroy the industrial capacity of Japan. She was caught in a howling typhoon 4–5 June which collapsed some 25 ft (8 m) of her forward flight deck.\n\nFor 16 continuous months, she was in action in the forward areas of the Pacific combat zone, sometimes within of the Japanese home islands. Under air attack 59 times, she was never hit. Her aircraft destroyed 1,410 Japanese aircraft; only exceeded this record. 10 of her pilots attained \"Ace in a Day\" status; 30 of her 42 VF-2 F6F Hellcat pilots were aces. In one day, her aircraft shot down 72 Japanese aircraft, and in one month, they shot down 255 aircraft. \"Hornet\" supported nearly every Pacific amphibious landing after March 1944. Her air groups destroyed or damaged 1,269,710 tons (1,151,860 tonnes) of Japanese shipping, and scored the critical first hits in sinking \"Yamato\".\n\n\"Hornet\" earned nine battle stars for her service in World War II. Seven battle stars were earned as the sole receiver in 1944. Two were earned together as Hornet and her air groups when the Navy changed their nomenclature in 1945. She was one of nine carriers to be awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nFollowing the typhoon that collapsed the forward edge of her flight deck, \"Hornet\" was routed back to the Philippines and from there to San Francisco, arriving on 7 July. Her overhaul was complete by 13 September when she departed as a part of Operation Magic Carpet that saw her return troops home from the Marianas and Hawaiian Islands. She returned to San Francisco on 9 February 1946. She decommissioned there on 15 January 1947, and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet.\n\n\"Hornet\" was recommissioned on 20 March 1951, then sailed from San Francisco for the New York Naval Shipyard where she was decommissioned on 12 May for conversion to an attack aircraft carrier CVA-12, under the SCB-27 upgrade program. On 11 September 1953, she was recommissioned as an attack carrier. The ship then trained in the Caribbean Sea before departure from Norfolk on 11 May 1954 on an eight-month global cruise.\n\nAfter operations in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, \"Hornet\" joined the mobile 7th Fleet in the South China Sea to search for survivors of a Cathay Pacific Airways passenger plane, shot down by Chinese aircraft near Hainan Island. On 25 July, \"Hornet\" aircraft supported planes from as they shot down two attacking Chinese fighters. After tensions eased, she returned to San Francisco on 12 December, trained out of San Diego, then sailed on 4 May 1955 to join the 7th Fleet in the Far East.\n\n\"Hornet\" helped to cover the evacuation of Vietnamese from the Communist-controlled north to South Vietnam, then ranged from Japan to Formosa, Okinawa, and the Philippines in readiness training with the 7th Fleet. She returned to San Diego on 10 December and entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard the following month for the SCB-125 upgrade, a conversion which included a hurricane bow and the installation of an angled flight deck, which permits the simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.\n\nFollowing her modernization overhaul, \"Hornet\" operated along the California coast. She departed San Diego on 21 January 1957 to bolster the strength of the 7th Fleet until her return from the troubled Far East on 25 July.\n\nFollowing a similar cruise, 6 January – 2 July 1958, the ship was redesignated CVS-12 (anti-submarine warfare support carrier). In August, she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for the conversion work to an ASW carrier. On 3 April 1959, she sailed from Long Beach to join the 7th Fleet in antisubmarine warfare tactics ranging from Japan to Okinawa and the Philippines. She returned home in October, for training along the western seaboard.\n\nIn the following years, \"Hornet\" was regularly deployed to the 7th Fleet for operations ranging from the coast of South Vietnam, to the shores of Japan, the Philippines and Okinawa; and she also played a key part in the Apollo program, as a recovery ship for unmanned and manned spaceflights.\n\nOn 25 August 1966, she was on recovery station for the flight of AS-202, the second unmanned flight of a production Apollo Command and Service Module. The moonship rocketed three-quarters of the way around the globe in 93 minutes before splashdown near Wake Island. Scorched from the heat of its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, the Apollo space capsule, designed to carry American astronauts to the moon, was brought aboard \"Hornet\" after its test; that command module is currently on display aboard \"Hornet\".\n\n\"Hornet\" returned to Long Beach on 8 September, but headed back to the Far East on 27 March 1967. She reached Japan exactly a month later and departed the Sasebo base on 19 May for the war zone. She operated in Vietnamese waters throughout the first half of 1967.\n\n\"Hornet\" recovered the astronauts from the first moon landing mission, Apollo 11, on 24 July 1969. President Nixon was on board to welcome the returning astronauts back to Earth, where they lived in quarantine aboard \"Hornet\" prior to transfer to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at Houston. The first steps on Earth of returning moonwalkers Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, with Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, are marked on her hangar deck, as part of her Apollo program exhibit.\n\n\"Hornet\" once again served in the space program with the recovery of Apollo 12 on 24 November. Returning astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Alan L. Bean, and Richard F. Gordon, Jr., were picked up from their splashdown point near American Samoa.\n\n\"Hornet\" was decommissioned 26 June 1970 and mothballed at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility. \"Hornet\" was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 July 1989. In 1991, she was designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe aircraft carrier was donated to the Aircraft Carrier Hornet Foundation on 26 May 1998. On 17 October 1998, she was opened to the public as USS \"Hornet\" Museum in Alameda, California. \"Hornet\" was designated a California State Historic Landmark in 1999. She is listed on the National Register of Historic places, #91002065.\n\nBuilding on her status as an authentically restored aircraft carrier, \"Hornet\" could be seen featuring in a number of film and television shows. Several TV shows, including a number of phantom-themed shows, have been recorded on board; and in 1997 she was the subject of of the TV series \"JAG\". In 2004 she was the set for scenes from the movie \"\", which starred Ice Cube, and portions of the 2007 film \"Rescue Dawn\", which starred Christian Bale, were shot on board. \"Hornet\" was both the subject and the setting of the independent film \"Carrier\" (2006).\n\n\"Hornet\" was the subject of the TV series \"JAG\" in its opening episode of Season 3 named \"Ghost Ship\". It was investigated by the TAPS team on the Syfy Channel show \"Ghost Hunters\". In 2011, the ship was featured on \"Ghost Adventures\", Season 4, Episode 8. The ship was also featured on \"\" due to footage submitted by a local paranormal research team, Alameda Paranormal Researchers.\n\n"}

He is best known for his service in the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1916.\n\nStephenson was born on 19 April 1889 in Kingston upon Hull, probably in the suburb of Sculcoates. He served from 1914 until 1915 as a stoker aboard the \"Endurance\", the exploration vessel built for the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition headed by of Sir Ernest Shackleton, After the vessel sank in late 1915, Stephenson joined the other members of the ship's crew as a castaway, and was rescued in August 1916.\n\nStephenson is one of the lesser-known explorers in Antarctic history. In the words of the \"Endurance\" crew's biographer, John F. Mann, \"very little is recorded or known about his life, and of the 28 members of the \"Endurance\", he is perhaps the most mysterious.\" By 1914, he is believed to have been a veteran of the Royal Marines, who had served as an officer's steward. Possibly before and certainly after his Antarctic service, Stephenson served for many years as a seaman on the fishing trawlers that put out from the Yorkshire coast to the fishing banks of the North Sea. Despite his sea experience, he occupied a humble space on the \"Endurance\", and few of the diaries and journals kept by his shipmates mention him or flesh out his character. One tiny fragment of information indicates that although William Stephenson's nickname in civilian life was \"Bill\", he was known on the \"Endurance\" as \"Steve\". Press coverage of Stephenson's dramatic rescue from the Antarctic in August 1916 appears to have been confined to the printing of his name on a manifest listing the passengers on a steamboat marking the final stage of their return to England in late 1916. Stephenson lived in obscurity until his death in hospital in Hull in August 1953. \n\nWith his fellow fireman-stoker Ernest Holness, William Stephenson was one of four members of the \"Endurance\" crew to be denied the Polar Medal. The reasons, if any, for expedition leader Shackleton's failure to recommend Stephenson for this honor are unknown.\n"}
