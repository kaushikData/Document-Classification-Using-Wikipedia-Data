As a member of a mission to fix trade routes in Central Africa he became the first person of European origin to circumnavigate Lake Chad by boat.\n\nIn 1849, he joined a 3-man expedition under the command of James Richardson and Heinrich Barth (who later took command after Richardson's death). They set to leave Tripoli in the Spring of 1850 in order to help the British government forge relations with central African kingdoms and explore unknown territory there. They crossed the Sahara carrying a boat on the backs of camels, splitting up in 1851 with Overweg trekking by route of Zinder to Kukawa, rejoining expedition scientist (now leader) Heinrich Barth. After 18 months of exploring the Adamawa Emirate, Benue River, and finally completing his most notable feat of circumnavigating Lake Chad, he died of an unknown illness in Maduari, Chad after swimming in cold waters.\n\nBarth and Overweg were close friends. Barth wrote of Overweg's great talents as a scientist and observer, but his lack of discipline in keeping orderly notes, and his youthful disregard for his own safety doomed him to obscurity and an early death in the prime of his youth.\n"}

Stagnation events strongly correlates with poor air quality. Due to light winds and lack of precipitation, pollutants cannot be cleared from the air, either gaseous (like ozone) or particulate (like soot or dust). Subsidence produced directly under the subtropical ridge can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge, leading to widespread haze. If the low level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight, fog can form. In the United States, the National Weather Service issues an \"Air Stagnation Advisory\" when these conditions are likely to occur.\n\nIn the U.S., the numbers of stagnation days during winter and spring tend to be much smaller than those during summer and fall. Spatial variations during winter and spring tend to be incoherent as well.\n"}
{"id": "174410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174410", "title": "Armillary sphere", "text": "Armillary sphere\n\nAn armillary sphere (variations are known as spherical astrolabe, armilla, or armil) is a model of objects in the sky (on the celestial sphere), consisting of a spherical framework of rings, centred on Earth or the Sun, that represent lines of celestial longitude and latitude and other astronomically important features, such as the ecliptic. As such, it differs from a celestial globe, which is a smooth sphere whose principal purpose is to map the constellations. It was invented separately in ancient Greece and ancient China, with later use in the Islamic world and Medieval Europe.\n\nWith the Earth as center, an armillary sphere is known as \"Ptolemaic\". With the Sun as center, it is known as \"Copernican\".\n\nThe flag of Portugal features an armillary sphere. The armillary sphere is also featured in Portuguese heraldry, associated with the Portuguese discoveries during the Age of Exploration. In the flag of Empire of Brazil, the armillary sphere is also featured.\n\n\"This section refers to labels in the diagram below.\"\nThe exterior parts of this machine are a compages [or framework] of brass rings, which represent the principal circles of the heavens.\n\n\nIn the north pole of the ecliptic is a nut \"b\", to which is fixed one end of the quadrantal wire, and to the other end a small sun \"Y\", which is carried round the ecliptic \"B\"—\"B\", by turning the nut : and in the south pole of the ecliptic is a pin \"d\", on which is another quadrantal wire, with a small moon \"Ζ\" upon it, which may be moved round by hand : but there is a particular contrivance for causing the moon to move in an orbit which crosses the ecliptic at an angle of 5⅓ degrees, to opposite points called the \"moon's nodes\"; and also for shifting these points backward in the ecliptic, as the \"moon's nodes\" shift in the heaven.\n\nWithin these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe \"I\", fixed on an axis \"K\", which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at \"n\" and \"s\", to those of the celestial sphere at \"N\" and \"S\". On this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian \"L L\", which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe, so as to keep over the same meridian upon it. This flat meridian is graduated the same way as the brass meridian of the common globe, and its use is much the same. To this globe is fitted the movable horizon \"M\", so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe, and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator, which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator. The globe may be turned by hand within this ring, so as to place any given meridian upon it, directly under the celestial meridian \"L\". The horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge, within which are the points of the compass, for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon, both in degrees and points. The celestial meridian \"L\" passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon, as in a common globe: both here, if the globe be turned round, the horizon and meridian turn with it. At the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours, fixed to the rings, and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle, if the globe be turned round its axis.\nThe whole fabric is supported on a pedestal \"N\", and may be elevated or depressed upon the joint \"O\", to any number of degrees from 0 to 90, by means of the arc \"P\", which is fixed in the strong brass arm \"Q\", and slides in the upright piece \"R\", in which is a screw at \"r\", to fix it at any proper elevation.\n\nIn the box \"T\" are two wheels (as in Dr Long's sphere) and two pinions, whose axes come out at \"V\" and \"U\"; either of which may be turned by the small winch \"W\". When the winch is put upon the axis \"V\", and turn backward, the terrestrial globe, with its horizon and celestial meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun \"Y\", and moon \"Z\", round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis \"U\", and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index.\n\nAnd so, by this construction, the machine is equally fitted to show either the real motion of the earth, or the apparent motion of the heaven.\n\nTo rectify the sphere for use, first slacken the screw \"r\" in the upright stem \"R\", and taking hold of the arm \"Q\", move it up or down until the given degree of latitude for any place be at the side of the stem \"R\"; and then the axis of the sphere will be properly elevated, so as to stand parallel to the axis of the world, if the machine be set north and south by a small compass: this done, count the latitude from the north pole, upon the celestial meridian \"L\", down towards the north notch of the horizon, and set the horizon to that latitude; then, turn the nut \"b\" until the sun \"Y\" comes to the given day of the year in the ecliptic, and the sun will be at its proper place for that day: find the place of the moon's ascending node, and also the place of the moon, by an Ephemeris, and set them right accordingly: lastly, turn the winch \"W\", until either the sun comes to the meridian \"L\", or until the meridian comes to the sun (according as you want the sphere or earth to move) and set the hour-index to the XII, marked noon, and the whole machine will be rectified. — Then turn the winch, and observe when the sun or moon rise and set in the horizon, and the hour-index will show the times thereof for the given day.\n\nThroughout Chinese history, astronomers have created celestial globes () to assist the observation of the stars. The Chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding calendrical computations and calculations.\n\nAccording to Needham, the earliest development of the armillary sphere in China goes back to the astronomers Shi Shen and Gan De in the 4th century BC, as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument. This would have allowed them to measure the north polar distance (declination) a measurement that gave the position in a \"xiu\" (right ascension). Needham's 4th century dating, however, is rejected by British sinologist Christopher Cullen, who traces the beginnings of these devices to the 1st century BC.\n\nDuring the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC9 AD) additional developments made by the astronomers Luoxia Hong (), Xiangyu Wangren, and Geng Shouchang (耿壽昌) advanced the use of the armillary in its early stage of evolution. In 52 BC, it was the astronomer Geng Shouchang who introduced the first permanently fixed equatorial ring of the armillary sphere. In the subsequent Eastern Han Dynasty (23–220 AD) period, the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the elliptical ring by 84 AD. With the famous statesman, astronomer, and inventor Zhang Heng (张衡, 78–139 AD), the sphere was totally complete in 125 AD, with horizon and meridian rings. The world's first water-powered celestial globe was created by Zhang Heng, who operated his armillary sphere by use of an inflow clepsydra clock (see Zhang's article for more detail).\n\nSubsequent developments were made after the Han Dynasty that improved the use of the armillary sphere. In 323 AD the Chinese astronomer Kong Ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired. The Chinese astronomer and mathematician Li Chunfeng (李淳風) of the Tang dynasty created one in 633 AD with three spherical layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observations, calling them 'nests' (chhung). He was also responsible for proposing a plan of having a sighting tube mounted ecliptically in order for the better observation of celestial latitudes. However, it was the Tang Chinese astronomer, mathematician, and monk Yi Xing in the next century who would accomplish this addition to the model of the armillary sphere. Ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of Zhou Cong and Shu Yijian in 1050, as well as Shen Kuo's armillary sphere of the later 11th century, but after that point they were no longer employed on Chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the European Jesuits.\nIn 723 AD, Yi Xing (一行) and government official Liang Ling-zan (梁令瓚) combined Zhang Heng's water powered celestial globe with an escapement device. With drums hit every quarter-hour and bells rung automatically every full hour, the device was also a striking clock. The famous clock tower that the Chinese polymath Su Song built by 1094 during the Song Dynasty would employ Yi Xing's escapement with waterwheel scoops filled by clepsydra drip, and powered a crowning armillary sphere, a central celestial globe, and mechanically operated manikins that would exit mechanically opened doors of the clock tower at specific times to ring bells and gongs to announce the time, or to hold plaques announcing special times of the day. There was also the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095). Being the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments: the gnomon, armillary sphere, clepsydra clock, and sighting tube fixed to observe the pole star indefinitely. When Jamal al-Din of Bukhara was asked to set up an 'Islamic Astronomical Institution' in Khubilai Khan's new capital during the Yuan Dynasty, he commissioned a number of astronomical instruments, including an armillary sphere. It was noted that \"Chinese astronomers had been building [them] since at least 1092\".\n\nThe Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c. 190c. 120 BC) credited Eratosthenes (276194 BC) as the inventor of the armillary sphere. The name of this device comes ultimately from the Latin \"armilla\" (circle, bracelet), since it has a skeleton made of graduated metal circles linking the poles and representing the equator, the ecliptic, meridians and parallels. Usually a ball representing the Earth or, later, the Sun is placed in its center. It is used to demonstrate the motion of the stars around the Earth. Before the advent of the European telescope in the 17th century, the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions.\n\nIn its simplest form, consisting of a ring fixed in the plane of the equator, the \"armilla\" is one of the most ancient of astronomical instruments. Slightly developed, it was crossed by another ring fixed in the plane of the meridian. The first was an equinoctial, the second a solstitial armilla. Shadows were used as indices of the sun's positions, in combinations with angular divisions. When several rings or circles were combined representing the great circles of the heavens, the instrument became an armillary sphere.\n\nArmillary spheres were developed by the Hellenistic Greeks and were used as teaching tools already in the 3rd century BC. In larger and more precise forms they were also used as observational instruments. However, the fully developed armillary sphere with nine circles perhaps did not exist until the mid-2nd century AD, during the Roman Empire. Eratosthenes most probably used a solstitial armilla for measuring the obliquity of the ecliptic. Hipparchus probably used an armillary sphere of four rings. The Greco-Roman geographer and astronomer Ptolemy (c. 100–170 AD) describes his instrument, the \"astrolabon\", in his \"Almagest\". It consisted of at least three rings, with a graduated circle inside of which another could slide, carrying two small tubes positioned opposite each other and supported by a vertical plumb-line.\n\nPersian and Arab astronomers produced an improved version of the Greek armillary sphere in the 8th century, and wrote about it in the treatise of \"Dhat al-Halaq\" or \"The instrument with the rings\" by the Persian astronomer Fazari (d.c. 777). Abbas Ibn Firnas (d.887) is thought to have produced another instrument with rings (armillary sphere) in the 9th century which he gave to Caliph Muhammad I (ruled 852–886). The spherical astrolabe, a variation of both the astrolabe and the armillary sphere, was invented during the Middle Ages in the Islamic world. About 550 AD, Christian philosopher John Philoponus wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in Greek, which is the earliest extant treatise on the instrument. The earliest description of the spherical astrolabe dates back to the Persian astronomer Nayrizi (fl. 892–902). Muslim astronomers also independently invented the celestial globe, which were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy. Today, 126 such instruments remain worldwide, the oldest from the 11th century. The altitude of the sun, or the Right Ascension and Declination of stars could be calculated with these by inputting the location of the observer on the meridian ring of the globe.\n\nThe armillary sphere was reintroduced to Western Europe via Al-Andalus in the late 10th century with the efforts of Gerbert d'Aurillac, the later Pope Sylvester II (r. 999–1003). Pope Sylvester II applied the use of sighting tubes with his armillary sphere in order to fix the position of the pole star and record measurements for the tropics and equator.\n\nChinese ideas of astronomy and astronomical instruments were introduced to Korea, where further advancements were also made. Jang Yeong-sil, a Korean inventor, was ordered by King Sejong the Great of Joseon to build an armillary sphere. The sphere, built in 1433 was named Honcheonui (혼천의).\n\nThe Honcheonsigye, an armillary sphere activated by a working clock mechanism was built by the Korean astronomer Song Iyeong in 1669. It is the only remaining astronomical clock from the Joseon Dynasty. The mechanism of the armillary sphere succeeded that of\nSejong era's armillary sphere (Honŭi 渾儀, 1435) and celestial sphere (Honsang 渾象, 1435), and the Jade Clepsydra (Ongnu 玉漏, 1438)'s sun-carriage apparatus. Such mechanisms are similar to Ch'oe Yu-ji (崔攸之, 1603~1673)'s armillary sphere(1657). The structure of time going train and the mechanism of striking-release in the part of clock is influenced by the crown escapement which has been developed from 14th century, and is applied to gear system which had been improved until the middle of 17th century in Western-style clockwork. In particular, timing device of Song I-yŏng's Armillary Clock adopts the early 17th century pendulum clock system which could remarkably improve the accuracy of a clock.\n\nFurther advances in the instrument were made by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), whose elaborate armillary spheres passing into astrolabes are figured in his \"Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica\".\n\nArmillary spheres were among the first complex mechanical devices. Their development led to many improvements in techniques and design of all mechanical devices. Renaissance scientists and public figures often had their portraits painted showing them with one hand on an armillary sphere, which represented the height of wisdom and knowledge.\n\nThe armillary sphere survives as useful for teaching, and may be described as a skeleton celestial globe, the series of rings representing the great circles of the heavens, and revolving on an axis within a horizon. With the earth as center such a sphere is known as Ptolemaic; with the sun as center, as Copernican.\nA representation of an armillary sphere is present in the modern flag of Portugal and has been a national symbol since the reign of Manuel I.\nIn the 1980s, Emilie Savage-Smith discovered several celestial globes without any seams in Lahore and Kashmir. Hollow objects are typically cast in two halves, and Savage-Smith indicates that the casting of a seamless sphere was considered impossible, though techniques such as rotational molding have been used since at least the '60s to produce similarly seamless spheres. The earliest seamless globe was invented in Kashmir by the Muslim astronomer and metallurgist Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 1589–90 (AH 998) during Akbar the Great's reign; another was produced in 1659–60 (1070 AH) by Muhammad Salih Tahtawi with Arabic and Sanskrit inscriptions; and the last was produced in Lahore by a Hindu astronomer and metallurgist Lala Balhumal Lahori in 1842 during Jagatjit Singh Bahadur's reign. 21 such globes were produced, and these remain the only examples of seamless metal globes. These Mughal metallurgists used the method of lost-wax casting in order to produce these globes.\n\nAn artwork-based model of an Armillary sphere has been used since the March 1, 2014 to light the Paralympic heritage flame at Stoke Mandeville Stadium, United Kingdom. The sphere includes a wheelchair that the user can rotate to spark the flame as part of a ceremony to celebrate the past, present and future of the Paralympic Movement in the UK. The Armillary Sphere was created by artist Jon Bausor and will be used for future Heritage Flame events. The flame in the first-ever ceremony was lit by London 2012 gold medallist Hannah Cockroft.\n\nThe armillary sphere is commonly used in heraldry and vexillology, being mainly known as a symbol associated with Portugal, the Portuguese Empire and the Portuguese discoveries.\n\nIn the end of the 15th century, the armillary sphere became the personal heraldic badge of the future King Manuel I of Portugal, when he was still a Prince. The intense use of this badge in documents, monuments, flags and other supports, during the reign of Manuel I, transformed the armillary sphere from a simple personal symbol to a national one that represented the Kingdom of Portugal and in particular its Overseas Empire. As a national symbol, the armillary sphere continued in use after the death of Manuel I.\n\nIn the 17th century, it became associated with the Portuguese dominion of Brazil. In 1815, when Brazil gained the status of kingdom united with that of Portugal, its coat of arms was formalized as a golden armillary sphere in a blue field. Representing Brazil, the armillary sphere became also present in the arms and the flag of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. When Brazil became independent as an empire in 1822, the armillary sphere continued to be present in its national arms and in its national flag. The celestial sphere of the present Flag of Brazil replaced the armillary sphere in 1889.\n\nThe armillary sphere was reintroduced in the national arms and in the national Flag of Portugal in 1910.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55680315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55680315", "title": "Classification of distal radius fractures", "text": "Classification of distal radius fractures\n\nThere are a number of ways to classify distal radius fractures. Classifications systems are devised to describe patterns of injury which will behave in predictable ways, to distinguish between conditions which have different outcomes or which need different treatments. Most wrist fracture systems have failed to accomplish any of these goals and there is no consensus about the most useful one.\n\nAt one extreme, a stable undisplaced extra-articular fracture has an excellent prognosis. On the other hand, an unstable, displaced intra-articular fracture is difficult to treat and has a poor prognosis without operative intervention.\n\nEponyms such as Colles', Smith's, and Barton's fractures are discouraged.\n\nAn anatomic description of the fracture is the easiest way to describe the fracture, determine treatment, and assess stability.\n\nThe articular joint's surface must be smooth for it to function properly. Irregularity may result in radiocarpal arthritis, pain, and stiffness. More than 1 mm of incongruity places the patient at a high risk for post-traumatic arthritis. Significant articular incongruity typically occurs in young patients after high energy injuries. If the surface is very irregular and cannot be reconstructed, then the only option may be a fusion of the joint.\n\nA dorsal tilt of a distal radius fracture is shown in in image at right. The angulation goes between:\nSometimes, the diaphysis of the radius is hard to distinguish from the ulna, and a line between them ( in image) may be used instead.The angle normally has volar tilt of 11° to 12°. The most common fracture pattern usually demonstrates malalignment of this angle and collapse in a dorsal direction. A dorsal tilt of 0° (11° - 12° deviation from normal anatomic position) causes a substantial risk of developing pain and impaired function. After closed reduction, a residual dorsal tilt of a maximum of 5° (16° - 17° deviation) is regarded as the maximal residual angle for a satisfactory result.\n\nThe radial inclination of a distal radius fracture is shown in in image at right. The angle is measured between:\nRadial inclination is normally 21-25°.\n\nRadial length is an important consideration in distal radius fractures. Radial length should be between 9-12mm. Distal radius fractures typically result in loss of length as the radius collapses from the loading force of the injury. With increasing relative lengthening of the uninjured ulna (positive ulnar variance), ulnar impaction syndrome may occur. Ulnar impaction syndrome is a painful condition of excessive contact and wear between the ulna and the carpus with an associated is a degenerative tear of the TFCC.\n\nThe system that comes closest to directing treatment has been devised by Melone. This system breaks distal radius fractures down into 4 components: radial styloid, dorsal medial fragment, volar medial fragment, and radial shaft. The two medial fragments (which together create the lunate fossa) are grouped together as the medial complex.\nThough the Frykman classification system has traditionally been used, there is little value in its use because it does not help direct treatment. This system focuses on articular and ulnar involvement. The classification is as follows:\n\nThe Universal classification system is descriptive but also does not direct treatment. Universal codes are:\nWidely used system that includes 27 subgroups. Three main groups based on fracture joint involvement (A - extra-articular, B - partial articular, C - complete articular). Classification further defined based on level of comminution and direction of displacement. A qualification (Q) modifier can be added to classify associated ulnar injury.\n\nSimplified system developed in response to AO classification, intended to be based off injury mechanism with more treatment-oriented classifications (treatment suggestions not meant to be used as rigid guidelines but can be used to help decision making on a case-by-case basis)\n\nNote: Associated Lesions include carpal ligament injury, nerve injury, tendon damage, and compartment syndrome\n"}

It is organized into a five-part axis system. The book has been translated into several languages and its model is widely adopted for the assessment of children of up to five years in age.\n\nThe DC 0-3R is meant to complement, but not replace, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization. It is intended to enhance the understanding of young children by making it possible to assess, diagnose, and treat mental health problems in infants and toddlers by allowing for the identification of disorders not addressed in other classification systems.\n\nThe DC: 0-3R is organized around three primary principles: 1) that children’s psychological functioning unfolds in the context of relationships, 2) that individual differences in temperament and constitutional strengths and vulnerabilities play a major role in how children experience and process events, and 3) that the family’s cultural context is important for the understanding of the child’s developmental course.\n\nThe first version, DC: 0-3, was published in 1994 to address the need for a systematic approach to the classification of disorders in the first few years of life. Since then, it has become increasingly valued by mental health professionals, physicians, nurses, early educators, and researchers around the world, and has been published in 8 different languages in addition to the original English edition.\n\nRevisions to the DC: 0-3 were published in 2005 to account for the evolution of the classification system from the time when it was first published in 1994. To be addressed were certain limitations such as the lack of criteria in some of the classification categories and the need for certain clarifications. Most importantly, new knowledge from research and clinical experience dating from almost a decade was to be incorporated.\n\nThe diagnostic process is one that is ongoing and done over a period of time. The process includes gathering a series of information regarding the child’s behaviour and presenting problems. The information is collected by a clinician and pertains to the child’s adaptation and development across different occasions and contexts.\n\nAccording to the DC: 0-3R, the diagnostic process consists of two aspects: 1) the classification of disorders, and 2) the assessment of individuals. One of the primary reasons for the classification of disorders is to facilitate communication between professionals. Once a diagnosis has been made, a clinician can then make associations between their clients’ symptoms and previously existing knowledge regarding the disorders' etiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis. Furthermore, using the classification of disorders can facilitate the process of finding existing services and mental health systems that are appropriate for the particular needs of the affected child. The assessment of children thus becomes a pivotal process that is undertaken by clinicians in order to grant access to treatment and intervention services related to specified disorders.\n\nClinical assessment and diagnosis involves making observations and gathering information from multiple sources relating to the child’s life in conjunction with a general diagnostic scheme. Both the DSM and ICD classification systems have evolved to use a multiaxial scheme, thus, clinicians have been using them not only for the classification of disorder but also as a guide for assessment and diagnosis. The first three axes of the DSM and ICD relate to the classification of disorder, and the fourth and fifth relate to the assessment of the individual within their personal environment. Similarly, the DC: 0-3 and DC: 03R also follow a multiaxial scheme.\n\nThe DC 0-3R provides a provisional diagnosis system, focusing on multi-axial classification. The system is a provisional system because it recognizes the fluidity and change that may occur with more knowledge in the field. This classification system is not entirely synonymous with the DSM-IV and the ICD-10, because it concentrates on developmental issues. There is also an emphasis placed on dynamic processes, relationships, and adaptive patterns within a developmental framework. The use of this classification system imparts knowledge about the diagnostic profile of a child, and the various contextual factors that may contribute to difficulties.\n\nThe DC 0-3R functions as a reference for the earlier manifestations of problems in infants and children, which can be connected to later problems in functioning. Secondly, the categorization focuses on types of difficulties in young children that are not addressed in other classification models.\n\nThe diagnostic categories vary in description, with more familiar categories described less. Categories that are more specific to young childhood and infancy, and newly based on clinical approaches are described in more detail. Furthermore, some categories may have subtypes to promote research, clinical awareness, and intervention planning, whereas others do not. This is important information to keep in mind when reading the DC 0-3R.\n\nAxis 1 of the DC 0-3R provides diagnostic classifications for the most primary symptoms of the presenting difficulties. These diagnoses focus on the infant or child’s functioning. The primary diagnoses include:\n\n\nAxis II focuses on children and infants developing in the context of emotional relationships. Specifically, the quality of caregiving can have a strong impact in nurturance and steering a child on a particular developmental course, either adaptive or maladaptive. This particular axis concentrates on the diagnosis of a clinical issue in the relationship between the child and the caregiver. The presence of a disorder indicates difficulties in relationships. These disorders include various patterns that highlight behaviour, affective, and psychological factors between the child and the caregiver.\n\n\nAxis III focuses on physical, mental, or developmental classification using other diagnosis methods. These disorders and conditions are not treated as a single diagnosis, but as a problem that may co-exist with others, as it may involve developmental difficulties.\n\nThis axis allows clinicians to focus on the intensity of psychosocial stress, which may act as influencing agents in infant and childhood difficulties/disorders. Psychosocial stress can have direct and indirect influences on infants and children, and depends on various factors.\n\nEmotional and social functioning capacities can be assessed using observations of the child with primary caregivers. The essential domains of functioning can be used in these observations on a 5-point scale, that describes overall functional emotional level.\n\nThe DC: 0-3R contains four forms that aid clinicians in identifying disorders in infants and toddlers, in examining the extent of problem behaviours, and in determining the nature of external factors influencing the child.\n\n\nImportant questions remain to be answered, in spite of the revisions made in the DC: 0-3R. Such questions include the following:\n\n"}
{"id": "1712895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1712895", "title": "Etendue", "text": "Etendue\n\nEtendue or étendue (; ) is a property of light in an optical system, which characterizes how \"spread out\" the light is in area and angle. It corresponds to the beam parameter product (BPP) in Gaussian optics.\n\nFrom the source point of view, it is the product of the area of the source and the solid angle that the system's entrance pupil subtends as seen from the source. Equivalently, from the system point of view, the etendue equals the area of the entrance pupil times the solid angle the source subtends as seen from the pupil. These definitions must be applied for infinitesimally small \"elements\" of area and solid angle, which must then be summed over both the source and the diaphragm as shown below. Etendue may be considered to be a volume in phase space.\n\nEtendue is important because it never decreases in any optical system where optical power is conserved. A perfect optical system produces an image with the same etendue as the source. The etendue is related to the Lagrange invariant and the optical invariant, which share the property of being constant in an ideal optical system. The radiance of an optical system is equal to the derivative of the radiant flux with respect to the etendue.\n\nThe term \"étendue\" comes from the French \"étendue géométrique\", meaning \"geometrical extent\". Other names for this property are acceptance, throughput, light grasp, light-gathering or -collecting power, optical extent, geometric extent, and the AΩ product. \"Throughput\" and \"AΩ product\" are especially used in radiometry and radiative transfer where it is related to the view factor (or shape factor). It is a central concept in nonimaging optics.\n\nAn infinitesimal surface element, dS, with normal n is immersed in a medium of refractive index \"n\". The surface is crossed by (or emits) light confined to a solid angle, d\"Ω\", at an angle \"θ\" with the normal n. The area of d\"S\" projected in the direction of the light propagation is . The etendue of this light crossing dS is defined as\nBecause angles, solid angles, and refractive indices are dimensionless quantities, etendue has units of area (given by dS).\n\nAs shown below, etendue is conserved as light travels through free space and at refractions or reflections. It is then also conserved as light travels through optical systems where it undergoes perfect reflections or refractions. However, if light was to hit, say, a diffuser, its solid angle would increase, increasing the etendue. Etendue can then remain constant or it can increase as light propagates through an optic, but it cannot decrease. This is a direct result of increasing entropy, which only can be reverted if a priori knowledge is used to reconstruct a phase-matched wave-front such as with phase conjugated mirrors.\n\nConservation of etendue can be derived in different contexts, such as from optical first principles, from Hamiltonian optics or from the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nConsider a light source \"Σ\", and a light detector \"S\", both of which are extended surfaces (rather than differential elements), and which are separated by a medium of refractive index \"n\" that is perfectly transparent (shown). To compute the etendue of the system, one must consider the contribution of each point on the surface of the light source as they cast rays to each point on the receiver.\n\nAccording to the definition above, the etendue of the light crossing d\"Σ\" towards d\"S\" is given by:\nwhere d\"Ω\" is the solid angle defined by area d\"S\" at area d\"Σ\". Similarly, the etendue of the light crossing d\"S\" coming from d\"Σ\" is given by:\nwhere d\"Ω\" is the solid angle defined by area dΣ. These expressions result in\nshowing that etendue is conserved as light propagates in free space.\n\nThe etendue of the whole system is then:\n\nIf both surfaces d\"Σ\" and d\"S\" are immersed in air (or in vacuum), and the expression above for the etendue may be written as\nwhere \"F\" is the view factor between differential surfaces d\"Σ\" and d\"S\". Integration on d\"Σ\" and d\"S\" results in \"G\" = π\"Σ\" \"F\" which allows the etendue between two surfaces to be obtained from the view factors between those surfaces, as provided in a list of view factors for specific geometry cases or in several heat transfer textbooks.\n\nThe conservation of etendue in free space is related to the reciprocity theorem for view factors.\n\nThe conservation of etendue discussed above applies to the case of light propagation in free space, or more generally, in a medium in which the refractive index is constant. However, etendue is also conserved in refractions and reflections. Figure \"etendue in refraction\" shows an infinitesimal surface d\"S\" on the \"xy\" plane separating two media of refractive indices \"n\" and \"n\".\n\nThe normal to d\"S\" points in the direction of the \"z\" axis. Incoming light is confined to a solid angle d\"Ω\" and reaches d\"S\" at an angle \"θ\" to its normal. Refracted light is confined to a solid angle d\"Ω\" and leaves d\"S\" at an angle \"θ\" to its normal. The directions of the incoming and refracted light are contained in a plane making an angle \"φ\" to the \"x\" axis, defining these directions in a spherical coordinate system. With these definitions, Snell's law of refraction can be written as\nand its derivative relative to \"θ\"\nmultiplied by each other result in\nwhere both sides of the equation were also multiplied by d\"φ\" which does not change on refraction. This expression can now be written as\nand multiplying both sides by d\"S\" we get\nthat is\nshowing that the etendue of the light refracted at d\"S\" is conserved. The same result is also valid for the case of a reflection at a surface d\"S\", in which case and \"θ\" = \"θ\".\n\nRadiance of a surface is related to étendue by:\nwhere\n\nAs the light travels through an ideal optical system, both the étendue and the radiant flux are conserved. Therefore, \"basic radiance\" defined as:\nis also conserved. In real systems, the étendue may increase (for example due to scattering) or the radiant flux may decrease (for example due to absorption) and, therefore, basic radiance may decrease. However, étendue may not decrease and radiant flux may not increase and, therefore, basic radiance may not increase.\n\nIn the context of Hamiltonian optics, at a point in space, a light ray may be completely defined by a point , a unit Euclidean vector indicating its direction and the refractive index \"n\" at point r. The optical momentum of the ray at that point is defined by\nwhere . The geometry of the optical momentum vector is illustrated in figure \"optical momentum\".\n\nIn a spherical coordinate system p may be written as\nfrom which\nand therefore, for an infinitesimal area d\"S\" = d\"x\" d\"y\" on the \"xy\" plane immersed in a medium of refractive index \"n\", the etendue is given by\nwhich is an infinitesimal volume in phase space \"x\", \"y\", \"p\", \"q\". Conservation of etendue in phase space is the equivalent in optics to Liouville's theorem in classical mechanics. Etendue as volume in phase space is commonly used in nonimaging optics.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal surface d\"S\", immersed in a medium of refractive index \"n\" crossed by (or emitting) light inside a cone of angle \"α\". The etendue of this light is given by\n\nNoting that \"n\" sin \"α\" is the numerical aperture \"NA\", of the beam of light, this can also be expressed as \n\nNote that d\"Ω\" is expressed in a spherical coordinate system. Now, if a large surface \"S\" is crossed by (or emits) light also confined to a cone of angle \"α\", the etendue of the light crossing \"S\" is\n\nThe limit on maximum concentration (shown) is an optic with an entrance aperture \"S\", in air () collecting light within a solid angle of angle 2\"α\" (its acceptance angle) and sending it to a smaller area receiver \"Σ\" immersed in a medium of refractive index \"n\", whose points are illuminated within a solid angle of angle 2\"β\". From the above expression, the etendue of the incoming light is\nand the etendue of the light reaching the receiver is\n\nConservation of etendue then gives\nwhere \"C\" is the concentration of the optic. For a given angular aperture \"α\", of the incoming light, this concentration will be maximum for the maximum value of sin \"β\", that is \"β\" = π/2. The maximum possible concentration is then\n\nIn the case that the incident index is not unity, we have\nand so\nand in the best-case limit of \"β\" = π/2, this becomes\n\nIf the optic were a collimator instead of a concentrator, the light direction is reversed and conservation of etendue gives us the minimum aperture, \"S\", for a given output full angle 2\"α\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "938571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=938571", "title": "Hirola", "text": "Hirola\n\nBeatragus hunteri, the hirola, Hunter's hartebeest or Hunter's antelope, is a critically endangered antelope species found on the border between Kenya and Somalia. They were discovered in 1888 by the zoologist H.C.V. Hunter It is the only extant member of the genus Beatragus. The global hirola population is estimated at 300–500 animals, there are no hirola in captivity and the wild population continues to decline. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List \"The loss of the Hirola would be the first extinction of a mammalian genus on mainland Africa in modern human history.\" \n\nThe hirola is a medium-sized antelope, tan to rufous-tawny in colour with slightly lighter under parts, predominantly white inner ears and a white tail which extends down to the hocks. It has very sharp, lyrate horns which lack a basal pedicle and are ridged along three quarters of their length. As hirola age their coat darkens towards a slate grey and the number of ridges along their horns increases. Hirola have large, dark sub-orbital glands used for marking their territories and give them the name \"four-eyed antelope\". They have white spectacles around their eyes and an inverted white chevron running between the eyes. The horns, hooves, udders, nostrils, lips and ear tips are black. Males and females look similar although males are slightly larger with thicker horns and darker coats.\n\nSeveral sources have recorded precise measurements from both captive and wild hirola. The following are maximum and minimum values taken from all sources: height at the shoulder: 99–125 cm, body weight: 73–118 kg, head and body length: 120–200 cm, horn length: 44–72 cm, horn spread (greatest outside width): 15–32 cm, tail length: 30–45 cm, ear length: 19 cm. It is not stated whether horn length was measured direct from base to tip or along the curve of the horn. There is no data on how long hirola live in the wild but hirola in captivity have been known to live for 15 years.\n\nAuthorities agree that the hirola belongs in the subfamily Alcelaphinae within the family Bovidae but there has been debate about the genus in which it should be placed. The Alcelaphinae contains hartebeest, wildebeest and topi, korrigum, bontebok, blesbok, tiang and tsessebe.\n\nWhen it was first described the hirola was given the common name Hunter’s hartebeest. Despite this it was placed in the genus \"Damaliscus\" with the topi and given the scientific name \"Damaliscus hunteri\". Newer theories have classified it as a sub-species of the topi (\"Damaliscus lunatus hunteri\") and placed it within its own genus as \"Beatragus hunteri\".\n\nRecent genetic analyses on karyotypic and mitochondrial DNA support the theory that the hirola is distinct from the topi and should be placed in its own genus. They also indicate that the hirola is in fact more closely related to \"Alcelaphalus\" than to \"Damaliscus\".\nPlacing the hirola in its own genus is further supported by behavioural observations. Neither \"Alcelaphalus\" nor \"Damaliscus\" engage in flehmen, where the male tastes the urine of the female to determine oestrus. They are the only genera of bovids to have lost this behaviour. Hirola still engage in flehmen although it is less obvious than in other species.\n\nThe genus \"Beatragus\" originated around 3.1 million years ago and was once widespread with fossils found in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Tanzania and South Africa. The hirola is now the only extant member of the genus and is ranked forty third on the Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) list of Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species.\n\nThe hirola is adapted to arid environments with annual rainfall averaging . Their habitats range from open grassland with light bush to wooded savannahs with low shrubs and scattered trees, most often on sandy soils. Despite the arid environments they inhabit hirola appear to be able to survive independently of surface water. Andanje observed hirola drinking on only 10 occasions in 674 observations (1.5%) and all 10 observations of drinking occurred at the height of the dry season. Hirola do however favour short green grass and in 392 of 674 observations (58%) hirola were grazing on growths of short green grass around waterholes. This association with waterholes has led to false reports that hirola are dependent on surface water.\n\nHirola are primarily grazers but browse may be important in the dry season. They favour grasses with a high leaf to stem ratio and Chloris and Digiatta species are believed to be important in their diet. Kingdon does not consider the ecological requirements of the hirola unusual and in fact considers them to be more generalist than either Connochaetes spp. or Damaliscus spp. A vet who examined the digestive tract of several hirola concluded that they were well adapted to eating dry region grasses and roughage. They feed on the dominant grasses of the region and Kingdon (1982) believes that quantity is more important than quality in the hirola’s diet.\n\nHirola are often found in association with other species, particularly oryx, Grant’s gazelles, Burchell’s zebra and topi. They avoid Coke’s hartebeest, buffalo and elephant. Whilst hirola avoid direct association with livestock they reportedly prefer the short grass in areas where livestock have been grazed.\n\nFemale hirola give birth alone and may remain separate from the herd for up to two months, making them vulnerable to predation. Eventually the female will rejoin a nursery herd consisting of females and their young. Nursery herds number from 5–40 although the mean herd size is 7–9. They are usually accompanied by an adult male.\n\nYoung hirola leave the nursery herd at around nine months of age and form various temporary associations. They may gather together in mixed or single sex herds of up to three individuals; sub-adult or subordinate adult males may form bachelor herds of 2–38 individuals; female sub-adults may join an adult male and; if no other hirola are present, young hirola may attach themselves to a herd of Grant’s gazelles or simply spend most of their time alone.\n\nAdult males attempt to secure a territory on good pasture. These territories are up to 7km2 and are marked with dung, secretions from the sub-orbital glands and by stamping grounds where males scrape the soil with their hooves and slash the vegetation with their horns. It has been suggested that at low population densities adult males abandon territory defence and will instead follow a nursery herd. Nursery herds do not defend a territory but do have home ranges which overlap the territories of several adult males. The size of a nursery herd’s home range varies from 26–164.7 km with a mean size of 81.5km.\n\nNursery herds are relatively stable but bachelor herds are very unstable with a fission fusion dynamic. In the 1970s hirola were observed forming aggregations of up to 300 individuals to take advantage of scarce, but spatially clumped, resources during the dry season (Bunderson, 1985).\nInformation is lacking on male territoriality and how it relates to mating success, how and when hirola join a herd and how new herds are established (Butynski, 2000).\n\nHirola are seasonal breeders with young being born from September to November. Data on age of sexual maturity and gestation period are not available for wild hirola however in captivity gestation was around 7.5 months (227–242 days) with one female mating at 1.4 years old and giving birth at 1.9 years. Another pair of hirola mated when they were 1.7 years of age. In captivity one of the main causes of mortality is wounds caused by intra-hirola aggression, including aggression between females.\n\nThe reasons for the historic decline of the hirola are not known but is likely a combination of factors including disease (particularly rinderpest), poaching, severe drought, predation, competition for food and water from domestic livestock and habitat loss caused by bush encroachment as a result of the extirpation of elephants in the hirola's natural range.\n\nThe Hirola prefers areas that are used by livestock which puts them at increased risk from diseases like tuberculosis. Due to lack of protection they are also still very vulnerable to poaching. Hirola are also threatened by predation and competition with other wild herbivores, particularly topi and Coke's hartebeest.\n\nThe hirola's natural range is an area of no more than 1,500km on the Kenyan-Somali border but there is also a translocated population in Tsavo East National Park. The natural population in the 1970s was likely to number 10,000–15,000 individuals but there was an 85–90% decline between 1983 and 1985. A survey in 1995 and 1996 estimated the population to number between 500 and 2,000 individuals with 1,300 as the most reasonable estimate. The most recent survey took place in 2010 and estimated a population of 402–466 hirola (King et al., 2011).\n\nA translocated population was established in Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park with translocations in 1963 and 1996 (Hofmann, 1996; Andanje & Ottichilo, 1999; Butynski,1999; East, 1999). The 1963 translocation released 30 animals and the first survey in December 1995 and concluded that there were at least 76 hirola present in Tsavo at the time. Eight months later a further 29 translocated hirola were released in to Tsavo, at least six of which were pregnant at the time (Andanje, 1997). By December 2000 the hirola population in Tsavo had returned to 77 individuals (Andanje, 2002) and by 2011 the population was estimated at 76 individuals (Probert, 2011; Probert et al., 2014).\n\nHirola are critically endangered and their numbers continue to decline in the wild. There are between 300–500 individuals in the wild and none currently in captivity.\n\nDespite being one of the rarest antelopes, conservation measures for the hirola antelope have so far been marginal. The Arawale National Reserve was created in 1973 as a small sanctuary for the hirola but has been left unmaintained since the 1980s. In late 2005, four local communities in the Ijara District have, in collaboration with Terra Nuova, developed and put forward a proposal to formally establish the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy for the \"in situ\" protection of hirola.\n\nIn January 2010, Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy (IHCC), was funded by the United States Fish & Wildlife Service and USAID-Kenya, to conduct a survey to estimate the remaining population of this species in its natural range. The survey found only three areas with significant numbers of hirola and it is believed that there are no large herds or significant concentrations of hirola remaining in their natural range.\n\nMore recently a 23km predator proof fenced sanctuary has been constructed at Ishaqbini and a founding population of 48 hirola is breeding well within the sanctuary \n\n\n"}

In prehistoric times, advice and knowledge was passed from generation to generation in an oral tradition. The development of writing enabled knowledge to be stored and communicated across generations with much greater fidelity. Combined with the development of agriculture, which allowed for a surplus of food, it became possible for early civilizations to develop and more time to be devoted to tasks other than survival, such as the search for knowledge for knowledge's sake.\n\nFrom their beginnings in Sumer (now Iraq) around 3500 BC, the Mesopotamian peoples began to attempt to record some observations of the world with extremely thorough numerical data. A concrete instance of Pythagoras' law was recorded as early as the 18th century BC—the Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 records a number of Pythagorean triplets (3,4,5) (5,12,13) ..., dated to approx. 1800 BC, over a millennium before Pythagoras, —but an abstract formulation of the Pythagorean theorem this was not.\n\nAstronomy is a science that lends itself to the recording and study of observations: the vigorous notings of the motions of the stars, planets, and the moon are left on thousands of clay tablets created by scribes. Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian scientists are still widely used in Western calendars: the solar year, the lunar month, the seven-day week. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of Kidinnu, a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician who was contemporary with the Greek astronomers. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Astronomy and astrology were considered to be the same thing, as evidenced by the practice of this science in Babylonia by priests. Indeed, rather than following the modern trend towards rational science, moving away from superstition and belief, the Mesopotamian astronomy conversely became more astrology-based later in the civilisation - studying the stars in terms of horoscopes and omens, which might explain the popularity of the clay tablets. Hipparchus was to use this data to calculate the precession of the Earth's axis. Fifteen hundred years after Kiddinu, Al-Batani, born in what is now Turkey, would use the collected data and improve Hipparchus' value for the precession of the Earth's axis. Al-Batani's value, 54.5 arc-seconds per year, compares well to the current value of 49.8 arc-seconds per year (26,000 years for Earth's axis to round the circle of nutation).\n\nBabylonian astronomy was \"the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena.\" According to the historian A. Aaboe,\n\nSignificant advances in ancient Egypt included astronomy, mathematics and medicine. Their geometry was a necessary outgrowth of surveying to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by the Nile river. The 3-4-5 right triangle and other rules of thumb served to represent rectilinear structures including their post and lintel architecture. Egypt was also a centre of alchemical research for much of the western world.\n\nEgyptian hieroglyphs, a phonetic writing system, have served as the basis for the Egyptian Phoenician alphabet from which the later Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, and Cyrillic alphabets were derived. The city of Alexandria retained preeminence with its library, which was damaged by fire when it fell under Roman rule, being completely destroyed before 642. With it a huge amount of antique literature and knowledge was lost.\n\nThe Edwin Smith papyrus is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern neuroscience. However, while Egyptian medicine had some effective practices, it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology, for example, was largely ineffective.\n\nAccording to a paper published by Michael D. Parkins, 72% of 260 medical prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements. According to Michael D. Parkins, sewage pharmacology first began in ancient Egypt and was continued through the Middle Ages, and while the use of animal dung can have curative properties, it is not without its risk. Practices such as applying cow dung to wounds, ear piercing and tattooing, and chronic ear infections were important factors in developing tetanus. Frank J. Snoek wrote that Egyptian medicine used fly specks, lizard blood, swine teeth, and other such remedies which he believes could have been harmful.\n\nIn the Sassanid period (226 to 652 AD), great attention was given to mathematics and astronomy. The Academy of Gundishapur is a prominent example in this regard. Astronomical tables—such as the Shahryar Tables—date to this period, and Sassanid observatories were later imitated by Muslim astronomers and astrologers of the Islamic period. \nIn the mid-Sassanid era, an influx of knowledge came to Persia from the West in the form of views and traditions of Greece which, following the spread of Christianity, accompanied Syriac (the official language of Christians as well as the Iranian Nestorians). The Christian schools in Iran have produced great scientists such as Nersi, Farhad, and Marabai. Also, a book was left by Paulus Persa, head of the Iranian Department of Logic and Philosophy of Aristotle, written in Syriac and dictated to Sassanid King Anushiravan.\n\nA fortunate incident for pre-Islamic Iranian science during the Sassanid period was the arrival of eight great scholars from the Hellenistic civilization, who sought refuge in Persia from persecution by the Roman Emperor Justinian. These men were the followers of the Neoplatonic school. King Anushiravan had many discussions with these men and especially with the man named Priscianus. A summary of these discussions was compiled in a book entitled \"Solution to the Problems of Khosrow, the King of Persia\", which is now in the Saint Germain Library in Paris. These discussions touched on several subjects, such as philosophy, physiology, metabolisms, and natural science as astronomy. After the establishment of Umayyad and Abbasid states, many Iranian scholars were sent to the capitals of these Islamic dynasties.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, Persia becomes a stronghold of Islamic science.\n\nScientific thought in Classical Antiquity becomes tangible from the 6th century BC in pre-Socratic philosophy (Thales, Pythagoras). In c. 385 BC, Plato founded the Academy. With Plato's student Aristotle begins the \"scientific revolution\" of the Hellenistic period culminating in the 3rd to 2nd centuries with scholars such as Eratosthenes, Euclid, Aristarchus of Samos, Hipparchus and Archimedes.\nIn Classical Antiquity, the inquiry into the workings of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investigations known as natural philosophy. The ancient people who are considered the first \"scientists\" may have thought of themselves as \"natural philosophers\", as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers).\n\nThe earliest Greek philosophers, known as the pre-Socratics, provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their neighbours: \"How did the ordered cosmos in which we live come to be?\" The pre-Socratic philosopher Thales, dubbed the \"father of science\", was the first to postulate non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena such as lightning and earthquakes. Pythagoras of Samos founded the Pythagorean school, which investigated mathematics for its own sake, and was the first to postulate that the Earth is spherical in shape. Subsequently, Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. Their development of deductive reasoning was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry.\n\nThe important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in anatomy, zoology, botany, mineralogy, geography, mathematics and astronomy; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research. In the Hellenistic age scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations. Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers, to medieval Muslim philosophers and scientists, to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment, to the secular sciences of the modern day.\nNeither reason nor inquiry began with the Ancient Greeks, but the Socratic method did, along with the idea of Forms, great advances in geometry, logic, and the natural sciences. Benjamin Farrington, former Professor of Classics at Swansea University wrote:\n\nand again:\n\nThe level of achievement in Hellenistic astronomy and engineering is impressively shown by the Antikythera mechanism (150-100 BC). The astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first known person to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system, while the geographer Eratosthenes accurately calculated the circumference of the Earth. Hipparchus (c. 190 – c. 120 BC) produced the first systematic star catalog. In medicine, Herophilos (335 - 280 BC) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the nervous system. Hippocrates (c. 460 BC – c. 370 BC) and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions. Galen (129 – c. 200 AD) performed many audacious operations—including brain and eye surgeries— that were not tried again for almost two millennia. The mathematician Euclid laid down the foundations of mathematical rigour and introduced the concepts of definition, axiom, theorem and proof still in use today in his \"Elements\", considered the most influential textbook ever written. Archimedes, considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, is credited with using the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of Pi. He is also known in physics for laying the foundations of hydrostatics and the explanation of the principle of the lever.\n\nTheophrastus wrote some of the earliest descriptions of plants and animals, establishing the first taxonomy and looking at minerals in terms of their properties such as hardness. Pliny the Elder produced what is one of the largest encyclopedias of the natural world in 77 AD, and must be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus. \n\nFor example, he accurately describes the octahedral shape of the diamond, and proceeds to mention that diamond dust is used by engravers to cut and polish other gems owing to its great hardness. His recognition of the importance of crystal shape is a precursor to modern crystallography, while mention of numerous other minerals presages mineralogy. He also recognises that other minerals have characteristic crystal shapes, but in one example, confuses the crystal habit with the work of lapidaries. He was also the first to recognise that amber was a fossilized resin from pine trees because he had seen samples with trapped insects within them.\n\nExcavations at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and other sites of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) have uncovered evidence of the use of \"practical mathematics\". The people of the IVC manufactured bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4:2:1, considered favourable for the stability of a brick structure. They used a standardised system of weights based on the ratios: 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, 1/2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500, with the unit weight equaling approximately 28 grammes (and approximately equal to the English ounce or Greek uncia). They mass-produced weights in regular geometrical shapes, which included hexahedra, barrels, cones, and cylinders, thereby demonstrating knowledge of basic geometry.\n\nThe inhabitants of Indus civilisation also tried to standardise measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy. They designed a ruler—the \"Mohenjo-daro ruler\"—whose unit of length (approximately 1.32 inches or 3.4 centimetres) was divided into ten equal parts. Bricks manufactured in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length.\n\nMehrgarh, a Neolithic IVC site, provides the earliest known evidence for \"in vivo\" drilling of human teeth, with recovered samples dated to 7000-5500 BCE.\n\nEarly astronomy in India—like in other cultures— was intertwined with religion. The first textual mention of astronomical concepts comes from the Vedas—religious literature of India. According to Sarma (2008): \"One finds in the Rigveda intelligent speculations about the genesis of the universe from nonexistence, the configuration of the universe, the spherical self-supporting earth, and the year of 360 days divided into 12 equal parts of 30 days each with a periodical intercalary month.\"\n\nClassical Indian astronomy documented in literature spans the Maurya (Vedanga Jyotisha, c. 5th century BCE) to the Mughal (such as the 16th century Kerala school) periods. The first named authors writing treatises on astronomy emerge from the 5th century, the date when the classical period of Indian astronomy can be said to begin. Besides the theories of Aryabhata in the \"Aryabhatiya\" and the lost \"Arya-siddhānta\", we find the \"Pancha-Siddhāntika\" of Varahamihira. The astronomy and the astrology of ancient India (Jyotisha) is based upon sidereal calculations, although a tropical system was also used in a few cases.\n\nAlchemy (Rasaśāstra in Sanskrit)was popular in India. It was the Indian alchemist and philosopher Kanada who introduced the concept of 'anu' which he defined as the matter which cannot be subdivided. This is analogous to the concept of atom in modern science.\n\nLinguistics (along with phonology, morphology, etc.) first arose among Indian grammarians studying the Sanskrit language.\nThe Sanskrit grammar of Pāṇini (c. 520 – 460 BCE) contains a particularly detailed description of Sanskrit morphology, phonology and roots, evincing a high level of linguistic insight and analysis.\n\nAyurveda medicine traces its origins to the Vedas, Atharvaveda in particular, and is connected to Hindu religion. The \"Sushruta Samhita\" of Sushruta appeared during the 1st millennium BC. Ayurvedic practice was flourishing during the time of Buddha (around 520 BC), and in this period the Ayurvedic practitioners were commonly using Mercuric-sulphur combination based medicines. An important Ayurvedic practitioner of this period was Nagarjuna, accompanied by Surananda, Nagbodhi, Yashodhana, Nityanatha, Govinda, Anantdev, Vagbhatta etc.\nDuring the regime of Chandragupta Maurya (375-415 AD), Ayurveda was part of mainstream Indian medical techniques, and continued to be so until the Colonial period.\n\nThe main authors of classical Indian mathematics (400 CE to 1200 CE) were scholars like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara II. Indian mathematicians made early contributions to the study of the decimal number system, zero, negative numbers, arithmetic, and algebra. In addition, trigonometry, having evolved in the Hellenistic world and having been introduced into ancient India through the translation of Greek works, was further advanced in India, and, in particular, the modern definitions of sine and cosine were developed there. These mathematical concepts were transmitted to the Middle East, China, and Europe and led to further developments that now form the foundations of many areas of mathematics.\n\nThe first recorded observations of solar eclipses and supernovae were made in China. On July 4, 1054, Chinese astronomers observed a \"guest star\", a supernova, the remnant of which is now called the Crab Nebula. Korean contributions include similar records of meteor showers and eclipses, particularly from 1500-1750 in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture and herbal medicine were also practised, with similar medicine practised in Korea.\n\nAmong the earliest inventions were the abacus, the public toilet, and the \"shadow clock\". Joseph Needham noted the \"Four Great Inventions\" of China as among some of the most important technological advances; these were the compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing, which were later known in Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. The Tang dynasty (AD 618 - 906) in particular was a time of great innovation. A good deal of exchange occurred between Western and Chinese discoveries up to the Qing dynasty.\n\nHowever, Needham and most scholars recognised that cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what might be considered \"modern science\".\n\nIt was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature:\n\n"}

He was a Protestant, married and had one child. His father was John Samuel Julius Büttner and his mother was Emilie Henriette Elisabeth Büttner née Kreuser.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1922, he attended the Gymnasium high school at Schulpforte. From 1922 to 1926, Büttner studied geophysics, physics and mathematics in Erlangen, Hanover and Göttingen. In 1927, he completed a doctorate degree at the University of Göttingen and published his thesis: \"Experiments on the penetrating radiation\" and was awarded the Dr. Phil..\n\nIn 1934, he completed the habilitation treatise titled: \"The heat transfer by conduction and convection, evaporation and radiation in Bioklimatologie and Meteorology\", at the University of Kiel.

During the Apollo 11 mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Lunar Module (LM) and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24, 1969. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon.\n\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first manned flight in 1968. It achieved its goal of manned lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 Apollo 1 cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-up landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which damaged the CSM's propulsion and life support. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions. Apollo used Saturn family rockets as launch vehicles, which were also used for an Apollo Applications Program, which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three manned missions from 1973 through 1974, and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, a joint Earth orbit mission with the Soviet Union in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major human spaceflight milestones. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers.\n\nThe Apollo program used four types of launch vehicles. The first was the Little Joe II, which was used for unmanned suborbital launch escape system development. The second is the Saturn I, which was used for unmanned suborbital and orbital hardware development. The third is the Saturn IB which was used for preparatory unmanned missions and Apollo 7. Last, the Saturn V which was used for unmanned and manned earth orbit and lunar missions. The Marshall Space Flight Center, which designed the Saturn rockets, referred to the flights as Saturn-Apollo (SA), while Kennedy Space Center referred to the flights as Apollo-Saturn (AS). This is why the unmanned Saturn 1 flights are referred to as SA and the unmanned Saturn 1B are referred to as AS.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1968, the Saturn launch vehicles and components of the Apollo spacecraft were tested in unmanned flights.\n\nSome incongruity in the numbering and naming of the first three unmanned Apollo-Saturn (AS), or Apollo flights. This is due to AS-204 being renamed to Apollo 1 posthumously. This manned flight was to have followed the first three unmanned flights. After the fire which killed the AS-204 crew on the pad during a test and training exercise, unmanned Apollo flights resumed to test the Saturn V launch vehicle and the Lunar Module; these were designated Apollo 4, 5 and 6. The first manned Apollo mission was thus Apollo 7. Simple \"Apollo\" numbers were never assigned to the first three unmanned flights, although renaming AS-201, AS-202, and AS-203 as Apollo 1-A, Apollo 2 and Apollo 3, had been briefly considered.\n\nFrom August 1963 to January 1966 a number of tests were conducted for development of the launch escape system (LES). These included simulated \"pad aborts\", which might occur while the Apollo-Saturn space vehicle was still on the launch pad, and flights on the Little Joe II rocket to simulate \"Mode I aborts\" which might occur while the vehicle was in the air.\n\nThe Block I Command/Service Module spacecraft did not have capability to fly with the Lunar Module, and the three crew positions were designated Command Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Pilot, based on U.S. Air Force pilot ratings. The Block II spacecraft was designed to fly with the Lunar Module, so the corresponding crew positions were designated Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot regardless of whether a Lunar Module was present or not on any mission.\n\nA total of fifteen Saturn V vehicles were ordered (through AS-515), which would have been enough for three more Moon landing missions through Apollo 20. This flight was cancelled around the time of the Apollo 11 first landing mission to make the launch vehicle available for the Skylab space station. Shortly thereafter, Apollo 18 and 19 were cancelled in response to Congressional cuts in NASA's budget.\n\nSeveral of the missions involved extravehicular activity (EVA), \"space walks\" or \"Moon walks\" outside of the spacecraft. These were of three types: testing the lunar EVA suit in Earth orbit (Apollo 9), exploring the lunar surface, and retrieving film canisters from the Scientific Instrument Module stored in the Service Module.\n\nSeveral planned missions of the Apollo program of the 1960s and 1970s were canceled for a variety of reasons, including changes in technical direction, the Apollo 1 fire, hardware delays, and budget limitations.\n\nThere were several missions that used Apollo hardware after the cancellation of Apollo 18, Apollo 19, and Apollo 20.\n\n"}

Lini's views on socialism were inspired by Julius Nyerere's experiments in African socialism in Tanzania.\n\nLini believed that socialism was inherently compatible with Melanesian societies and customs, including the emphasis on communal welfare over individualism and the communal ownership and working of land. In this, Nyerere's influence is perceptible as the latter stressed the similarities between socialism and traditional African ways of life.\n\nFather Lini was an Anglican priest and believed that socialism held close similarities with Christian values and sought to combine the two as part of a Melanesian way. In this sense, socialism was not to be revolutionary, but instead fully in line with ni-Vanuatu tradition.\n\nAlthough he admired Nyerere and his government sought rapprochement with countries such as Cuba and Libya, Lini believed that socialism should not necessarily entail an alliance with the Soviet Union or the Eastern bloc. Indeed, he preferred for Vanuatu to remain non-aligned and to develop closer ties with its fellow Melanesian nations (such as Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands). In 1982, he expressed hopes for an eventual Melanesian federal union and spoke of the \"renaissance of Melanesian values\", including \"Melanesian socialism\".\n\nLini also noted that in traditional Melanesian societies \"'[g]iving' was based on one's ability to do so. 'Receiving' was based on one's need\".\n\nIn New Caledonia, the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), an alliance of pro-independence parties, advocates the implementation of socialism along with accession to sovereignty. Independent Melanesian nations (most notably Vanuatu) have expressed support for the FLNKS.\n\n\n"}

More than 90% of all countries have some kind of minimum wage legislation.\n\nUntil recently, minimum wage laws were usually very tightly focused. In the U.S. and Great Britain, for example, they applied only to women and children. Only after the Great Depression did many industrialized economies extend them to the general work force. Even then, the laws were often specific to certain industries. In France, for example, they were extensions of existing trade union legislation. In the U.S., industry specific wage restrictions were held to be unconstitutional. The country's Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 established a uniform national minimum wage for nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers. Coverage was later extended to most of the labor force.\n\n\nThe Australian National Minimum Wage is the minimum base rate of pay for ordinary hours worked to any employee who is not covered by a Modern Award or an Agreement. In 1896 in Victoria, Australia, an amendment to the Factories Act provided for the creation of a wages board. The wages board did not set a universal minimum wage; rather it set basic wages for 6 industries that were considered to pay low wages. First enacted as a four-year experiment, the wages board was renewed in 1900 and made permanent in 1904; by that time it covered 150 different industries. By 1902, other Australian states, such as New South Wales and Western Australia, had also formed wages boards. The notion of a \"basic wage\" was established in 1907 with the Harvester Judgment. In Australia, on 14 December 2005, the Australian Fair Pay Commission was established under the \"Workplace Relations Amendment (WorkChoices) Act 2005\" responsible for the adjustment of the standard federal minimum wage, replacing the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that took submissions from a variety of sources to determine appropriate minimum wages. The Australian Fair Pay Commission was replaced by Fair Work Australia in 2010.\n\nAustralian Fair Work Ombudsman, Minimum Wages Fact Sheet\n\nSince Plano Real, the Brazilian national minimum wage is adjusted annually. Historical data and a rough approximation to US Dollars can be seen in the table below.<ref name=\"https://www.portalbrasil.net/salariominimo.htm\"></ref>\nIn Brazil each increase the minimum wage results in a significant burden on the federal budget, because the minimum wage is tied to social security benefits and other government programs and salaries.\n\nUnder the Canadian Constitution's federal-provincial division of powers, the responsibility for enacting and enforcing labour laws rests with the ten provinces; the three territories also were granted this power by virtue of federal legislation. This means that each province and territory has its own minimum wage. Some provinces allow lower wages to be paid to liquor servers and other tip earners, and/or to inexperienced employees.\n\nThe federal government could theoretically set its own minimum wage rates for workers in federal jurisdiction industries (interprovincial railways, for example). As of 2006 however, the federal minimum wage is defined to be the general adult minimum wage rate of the province or territory where the work is performed. This means, for example, that an interprovincial railway company could not legally pay a worker in British Columbia less than $10.45 an hour regardless of the worker's experience.\n\nThe Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security set the People's Republic of China's first minimum wage law on 1 March 2004. The Regulations on Enterprises Minimum Wage was made to \"ensure the basic needs of the worker and his family, to help improve workers' performance and to promote fair competition between enterprises.\" One monthly minimum wage was set for full-time workers, and one hourly minimum wage for part-time workers. Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are allowed to legislate for their own minimum wage separate from the national one.\n\nA law approved February 2013 mandates a nationwide minimum wage at 40% average urban salaries to be phased in fully by 2015. See List of minimum wages in China (PRC) for a list of the latest minimum monthly wages for various provinces or municipalities in China.\n\nIn the European Union 18 out of 27 member states currently have national minimum wages. Many countries, such as Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Italy, and Cyprus have no minimum wage laws but rely on employer groups and trade unions to set minimum earnings through collective bargaining.\n\nThe first nationwide minimum wage in France was introduced via the Interprofessional Guaranteed Minimum Wage (\"SMIG\" - \"Salaire minimum interprofessionnel garanti\") law, passed in 1950 and accompanied by a High Commission for Collective Agreements (to set the wages based on average cost of living) and a companion law known as \"SMAG\" for rural/agricultural occupations. The SMIG, which established one baseline hourly wage rate for the Paris region and one for the rest of the country, was indexed to price inflation but rose slower than average wages. It was replaced by (\"SMIC\" - \"salaire minimum de croissance\") in 1970, which remains the basis of the modern minimum wage law in France.\n\nFrance's national minimum wage (\"SMIC\") as of 1 January 2010 is €8.86 per hour, representing an increase of 0.5% over the previous rate. A previous increase of 1.3% as from 1 July 2009, brought the hourly rate to €8.82, up from July 2008, when it was set at €8.71 per hour. In July 2006, the minimum wage in France was set at €8.27 (~US$11.98) per hour. In 2004, 15% of the working population received the minimum wage. The minimum wage in France is updated every year in January by the government. By law, the increase cannot be lower than the inflation for the current year. In the recent years the increase was up to two times higher than the inflation (around 5% raise with an inflation around 2%).\n\nGermany’s national minimum wage law (\"MiLoG\" - \"Mindestlohngesetz\") came into force on 1 January 2015, introducing Germany’s first nationwide legal minimum wage to the amount of €8.50 per hour. The German minimum wage level will be updated every other year by a minimum wage commission and acceptance by the government. Since a legal minimum wage law is a derogation of the constitutional right of a collective tariff autonomy, it is discussed whether and to what extent the minimum wage is consistent with the constitution.\n\nThe Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) passed the Minimum Wage Bill in 2010, requiring the Chief Executive to propose a minimum wage. Through a Provisional Minimum Wage Commission appointed by the government, a HK$28 hourly wage floor was introduced and eventually accepted by the LegCo after much debate. Prior to this, a monthly minimum wage of HK$3,580 for foreign domestic helpers had already been set. In some trades, such as bar-bending and bamboo scaffolding workers in the construction industry, have daily minimum wage negotiated between the trade unions and employers' organisations. As of September 2018, the statutory minimum wage is HK$37.50 per hour.\n\nThe minimum wage was introduced in Ireland in 2000 at IR£4.40 (€5.59) per hour, and as of 1 January 2018, it is €9.55 per hour. This is subject to reduction as follows:\n\n\nIt may further be reduced by up to €7.73 a day if lodgings and/or food are provided as part of a job.\n\nTrainees (including those over 18) are also entitled to different minimum wages, reduced as follows:\n\n\nIreland's minimum wage prior to the €1 cut in the 2011 budget, was only fifth highest of eight EU countries surveyed for the British Low-Pay Commission Report in 2010, with the UK, Netherlands, France and Belgium all listed as having higher minimum wage rates when OECD Comparative Price Levels are taken into account.\n\nIn Japan, minimum wage depends on the industry and the region. Industrial minimum wages apply for certain industries and usually set higher than the regional minimum. If regional and industrial minimum wages differ, higher of two will apply.\n\nAs of 2011, regional minimum wages range from ¥645 to ¥837 per hour for all workers.\n\nIn fiscal 2011 the average minimum wage was raised by ¥6. On July 25, 2012 a subcommittee of the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare's Central Minimum Wages Council decided to recommend that it be raised by ¥7. This would raise the average minimum wage from ¥737 to ¥744.\n\nThe cost of commuting, extra pay (such as working on holidays, at night, overtime, etc.) and temporary pays (bonus, tips, etc.) must be paid exclusively and cannot be used to calculate towards the minimum wage. Regional minimum hourly wages are set by the Minister of Labour or the Chief of the Prefectural Labour Standards Office. Recommendations are made by the Minimum Wage Council.\n\n\nFrom 1 April 1946 to 14 March 1977, there were separate minimum wage rates for men and women in New Zealand. From 15 March 1977, New Zealand abolished these gendered minimum wages, instead having one minimum wage for all adults.\n\nFrom 5 March 2001, the minimum youth rate (now known as the Starting Out rate) applied only to workers aged 16 or 17-years-old. From 31 March 1994 to 4 March 2001, the minimum youth rate applied to workers aged 16, 17, 18 or 19-years-old. Before 31 March 1994, there was no minimum wage for workers under the age of 20. As such, the adult minimum wage has applied to workers aged 18 and older since 5 March 2001. Before that, it applied to workers aged 20 and older.\n\nAs at 1 April 2018, the current minimum wage rates in New Zealand are:\n\n\"Note: Until 10 July 1967, New Zealand's currency was the New Zealand pound, a non decimal currency denoted in pounds (£), shillings (s.) and pence (d.)\"\n\nMonthly minimum wages in Pakistan are recommended by the Federal Government under nationally applicable Labour Policies and set by Provincial Minimum Wages Boards under the Minimum Wages Ordinance, 1961.\n\nPakistan's first minimum wage was introduced in 1992 when it was set at PKR 1,500 (~US$ 45) per month.\n\nIt was, subsequently, raised:\n\nin 1996 to PKR 1,650 (~US$ 45.83) per month\nin 1998 to PKR 1,950 (~US$ 40.12) per month\nin 2001 to PKR 2,500 (~US$ $40.90) per month \nin 2003 to PKR 3,000 (~US$ $54.15) per month \nin 2004 to PKR 4,000 (~US$ $69.32) per month \nin 2007 to PKR 4,600 (~US$ $75.78) per month\nin 2008 to PKR 6,000 (~US$ $85.42) per month\nin 2010 to PKR 7,000 (~US$ $83.83) per month\nin 2012 to PKR 8,000 (~US$ $86.39) per month\nin 2013 to PKR 10,000 (~US$ $102.56) per month\nin 2014 to PKR 12,000 (~US$ $124.10) per month\n\nTwo minimum wage levels are enforced in Romania. For state employees, the level is set by law at 600 RON (~US$200). For all other employees, the wage is set at 440RON (~US$145) by collective bargaining, which also stipulates multiplication indices for various levels of education. Jobs that require high-school and college qualifications are paid at least 1.5 and 2 times the minimum wage, respectively. Teachers' unions resorted to justice to claim same treatment and be paid according to collective bargaining. As of November 2007, they won three landmark cases and expect similar decisions in several dozens other courts. A single, unified level was proposed starting 1 January 2008 but it failed.\n\nThe Taiwanese government does not have a set minimum wage, but a basic wage in its Labor Standards Law serves the minimum wage function. The basic wage set per month is NT$22,000, NT$140 per hour, effective July 1, 2018.\n\nMunicipal regulation of wage levels began in some towns in 1524.\n\nThe Trade Boards Act 1909 created four Trades Boards that set minimum wages which varied between industries for a number of sectors where \"sweating\" was generally regarded as a problem and where collective bargaining was not well established. This system was extended considerably after the Second World War; in 1945 Trades Boards became Wages Councils, which set minimum wage standards in many sectors of the economy, including the service sector as well as manufacturing. Wages Councils were finally abolished in 1993, having fallen into decline due, in large part, to Trades Union opposition. A lower limit of pay, or \"pay floor\" was regarded as threatening the voluntary system of collective bargaining favoured in the UK. The government had first made a serious attempt to abolish Wages Councils in 1986, having abandoned existing legislation that tried to widen the scope of voluntary agreements to include those firms that had not taken part in negotiations, such as the Fair Wages Resolutions. These required that government contractors pay fair wages and respect the rights of their employees to be members of trades unions.\n\nInstead the Wages Act 1986 reformed the wages councils and abolished the power to create new ones.\n\nA National Minimum Wage (NMW) was introduced for the first time by the Labour government on 1 April 1999 at the rate of £3.60 per hour for those workers aged 22 and over, Labour having promised to set a minimum wage in their 1997 general election campaign. In its election manifesto, it had claimed that every other modern industrial country had already adopted a minimum wage.\n\nThis rate was set after the Low Pay Commission (LPC), an independent body the government appointed in July 1997 to advise it on low pay, recommended the rate. The LPC's permanent status was later confirmed and it continues to make recommendations to government on the NMW, which has been uprated in October every year since 2000. The LPC board consists of nine members—three trade unionists, three employers, and three labour market relations experts. The Commission undertakes consultations each year to gather available evidence before making recommendations in its biennial review.\n\nThe current minimum wage in the UK, as of April 2018 is £7.83 per hour for workers aged 25 and above, £7.38 for workers aged 21–24, £5.90 for workers aged 18–20, £4.20 for workers under 18, and £3.70 for apprentices aged 16–18 and those aged 19 or over who are in their first year.\n\nSome workers undertaking apprenticeships or accredited training may be exempted (that is, not considered eligible to receive the NMW) for a certain period of time, which varies according to their age and the length of time in employment. Other categories of worker who are exempt include au pairs, share fishermen, clergy, those in the Armed Forces, prisoners and some people working in family businesses. The rate payable under the NMW can, in all cases, also be reduced where accommodation is provided to the worker.\n\nUnlike most other employment rights legislation in the UK, which generally rely on affected individuals raising grievances and making claims, if necessary, before tribunals to enforce these rights, the NMW has compliance teams, attached to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) offices who will act on approaches from workers who think they are being paid less than the minimum wage by contacting and visiting their employers. Affected workers can either make a complaint directly to a national helpline or seek advice from another agencies such as their local Citizens Advice Bureau or the Scottish Low Pay Unit—this is particularly recommended if other employment rights issues are involved, as the HMRC can only deal with minimum wage enquiries.\n\nFrom 1 April 2016 a National Living Wage was introduced for workers over 25, implemented at a significantly higher minimum wage rate, and expected to rise to at least £9 per hour by 2020.\n\nIn the United States, statutory minimum wages were first introduced nationally in 1938.\n\nThe Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 is the current federal minimum wage law of the United States. It was signed into law on May 25, 2007 as a rider to the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. The act implemented three increases to the federal minimum wage—from $5.15 an hour to $5.85 per hour on July 24, 2007, to $6.55 per hour on July 24, 2008, and to $7.25 an hour on July 24, 2009.\n\nNearly all states within the United States have minimum wage laws; Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee are the only states yet to set a minimum wage law.\n\nAs of July 24, 2009, U.S. federal law requires a minimum wage of at least $7.25 per hour. Just over 5% of all hourly-paid workers (or approximately 1% of the total U.S. population) earn an hourly wage at or below the minimum wage. Washington has the highest minimum wage of any state in the U.S. at $9.19 per hour as of January 1, 2014; Oregon has the second highest at $9.10 per hour. Then Massachusetts with $9.00 per hour. The next highest state wage rates are in Connecticut, Illinois, Nevada, and the District of Columbia at $8.25 per hour, and then Vermont at $8.06 per hour. In addition to federal and state minimum wage laws, the US also has citywide minimum wage laws ($14.00 in San Francisco).\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the minimum wage in the United States would have been $18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage kept pace with labor productivity. To adjust for increased rates of worker productivity in the United States, raising the minimum wage to $22 (or more) an hour has been presented.\n\nInternational Labour Organization insists \"minimum wage fixing\" for rights of labours and has adopted Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention, 1928, Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery (Agriculture) Convention, 1951 and Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1970 following up these former Conventions.\n\n"}

{"id": "143696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143696", "title": "Orbital period", "text": "Orbital period\n\nThe orbital period is the time a given astronomical object takes to complete one orbit around another object, and applies in astronomy usually to planets or asteroids orbiting the Sun, moons orbiting planets, exoplanets orbiting other stars, or binary stars.\n\nFor objects in the Solar System, this is often referred to as the sidereal period, determined by a 360° revolution of one celestial body around another, e.g. the Earth orbiting the Sun. The name \"sidereal\" is added as it implies that the object returns to the same position relative to the fixed stars projected in the sky. When describing orbits of binary stars, the orbital period is usually referred to as just the period. For example, Jupiter has a sidereal period of 11.86 years while the main binary star Alpha Centauri AB has a period of about 79.91 years.\n\nAnother important orbital period definition can refer to the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the Earth's surface. An example is the so-called synodic period, applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location. For example, when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the Sun. For example, Jupiter has a synodic period of 398.8 days from Earth; thus, Jupiter's opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months.\n\nPeriods in astronomy are conveniently expressed in various units of time, often in hours, days, or years. They can be also defined under different specific astronomical definitions that are mostly caused by small complex eternal gravitational influences by other celestial objects. Such variations also include the true placement of the centre of gravity between two astronomical bodies (barycenter), perturbations by other planets or bodies, orbital resonance, general relativity, etc. Most are investigated by detailed complex astronomical theories using celestial mechanics using precise positional observations of celestial objects via astrometry.\n\nThere are many periods related to the orbits of objects, each of which are often used in the various fields of astronomy and astrophysics. Examples of some of the common ones include the following:\n\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period \"T\" (in seconds) of two point masses orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:\n\nwhere:\n\nFor all ellipses with a given semi-major axis the orbital period is the same, regardless of eccentricity.\n\nInversely, for calculating the distance where a body has to orbit in order to have a given orbital period:\n\nwhere:\n\nFor instance, for completing an orbit every 24 hours around a mass of 100 kg, a small body has to orbit at a distance of 1.08 meters from its center of mass.\n\nWhen a very small body is in a circular orbit barely above the surface of a sphere of any radius and mean density \"ρ\" (in kg/m), the above equation simplifies to (since \"M\" = \"Vρ\" = \"a\"\"ρ\")>:\n\nSo, for the Earth as the central body (or any other spherically symmetric body with the same mean density, about 5,515 kg/m) we get:\n\nand for a body made of water (\"ρ\" ≈ 1,000 kg/m)\n\nThus, as an alternative for using a very small number like \"G\", the strength of universal gravity can be described using some reference material, like water: the orbital period for an orbit just above the surface of a spherical body of water is 3 hours and 18 minutes. Conversely, this can be used as a kind of \"universal\" unit of time if we have a unit of mass, a unit of length and a unit of density.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, when both orbiting bodies' masses have to be taken into account, the orbital period \"T\" can be calculated as follows:\n\nwhere:\n\nNote that the orbital period is independent of size: for a scale model it would be the same, when densities are the same (see also Orbit#Scaling in gravity).\n\nIn a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory, the motion is not periodic, and the duration of the full trajectory is infinite.\n\nThere are observable characteristics of two bodies which orbit a third body in different orbits, and thus have different orbital periods. This is known as their synodic period; it is the time between conjunctions, and since it is observable from either the first or the second body, the two synodic periods will be different, depending from which celestial body you are observing.\n\nAn example of this related period description is the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the Earth's surface, the so-called synodic period, applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location. For example, when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the Sun. For example, Jupiter has a synodic period of 398.8 days from Earth; thus, Jupiter's opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months.\n\nIf the orbital periods of the two bodies around the third are called \"P\" and \"P\", so that \"P\" < \"P\", their synodic period is given by:\n\nTable of synodic periods in the Solar System, relative to Earth:\n\nIn the case of a planet's moon, the synodic period usually means the Sun-synodic period, namely, the time it takes the moon to complete its illumination phases, completing the solar phases for an astronomer on the planet's surface. The Earth's motion does not determine this value for other planets because an Earth observer is not orbited by the moons in question. For example, Deimos's synodic period is 1.2648 days, 0.18% longer than Deimos's sidereal period of 1.2624 d.\n\nThe concept of synodic period does not just apply to the Earth, but also to other planets as well, and the formula for computation is the same as the one given above. Here is a table which lists the synodic periods of some planets relative to each other:\n"}

He critically evaluates the views of authors such as the physician Magnus Hirschfeld and Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis.\n\nThe book received mainly positive reviews, crediting LeVay with providing a fair and well written assessment of scientific theories about the development of homosexuality and showing how scientific research influences public perceptions of gay people. However, critics argued that LeVay was biased in favor of biological explanations of homosexuality, questioned his view that they would benefit gay people and his suggestion that homosexuality is associated with \"sex a-typical characteristics\" and that gay men have some traits more typical of females than of males, and faulted him for ignoring scientific literature relevant to the \"nature versus nurture\" controversy.\n\nLeVay discusses the development of sexual orientation, and the social and political implications of research on the topic. He critically evaluates theories about homosexuality put forward by authors such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Magnus Hirschfeld, and Sigmund Freud, and discusses efforts to convert gay people to heterosexual, such as those described by the psychologist M. P. Feldman and the psychiatrist M. J. MacCulloch in \"\" (1971).\n\n\"Queer Science\" was first published in 1996 by MIT Press.\n\n\"Queer Science\" received positive reviews from Genevieve Stuttaford and Sybil S. Steinberg in \"Publishers Weekly\", William Beatty in \"Booklist\", Gregg Sapp in \"Library Journal\", and the neurologist Richard Cytowic in \"The Washington Post\", and a mixed review from the historian Roy Porter in \"The New York Times Book Review\". The book was also reviewed by Gail Vines in \"New Scientist\" and Jon Turney in the \"Times Higher Education Supplement\" and discussed by the philosopher Michael Ruse in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" and James Edward Van Buskirk in \"Library Journal\".\n\nStuttaford and Steinberg credited LeVay with deftly explaining \"biological arcana for the layperson\" and showing a \"full grasp\" of both non-medical and medical historical information. They found the most interesting aspect of the book to be LeVay's \"survey of research in Berlin at the turn of the century.\" Beatty credited LeVay with demonstrating \"how research reports have been properly and improperly used to promote either scientific growth or biased attitudes.\" Though he noted that \"Queer Science\" sometimes made for difficult reading, he considered the text \"well-thought-out and documented\" as well as fair. Sapp described the book as thoughtful and objective. He credited LeVay with showing how scientific research into homosexuality effects public perceptions of gay people. Cytowic wrote that LeVay's discussion of the causes of homosexuality was thorough and fair and would be \"widely regarded as authoritative\". He credited LeVay with carefully assessing the scientific evidence and the assumptions behind theories, and with writing well, and endorsed his conclusion that \"homosexuals are created differently from straights\".\n\nPorter considered LeVay's book \"lucid, approachable and candid\" and credited him with providing \"a fine historical sketch of homosexual advocacy and sex research\", and offering \"a witty and withering critique\" of Freudian explanations of homosexuality. However, he considered LeVay naive to believe that proof that homosexuality is rooted in the brain would convince a hostile public to accept homosexuality, writing that evidence LeVay himself provides shows otherwise. He wrote that LeVay \"looks forward to the day when the 'new eugenics' born of the human genome project will enable women to abort fetuses likely to be carrying any traits they don't much care for, including homosexuality.\" He found \"Queer Science\" to be a dispiriting comment about the state of science. He wrote that LeVay and other researchers were guilty of making \"bigger and bigger claims based on minuscule amounts of research\", and called the underlying assumptions of LeVay's work, such as that all people can be categorized as heterosexuals or homosexuals, simplistic.\n\nVan Buskirk wrote that the book was usefully complemented by the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy's \"Gay Science\" (1997).\n\n\"Queer Science\" received a negative review from the physician Lawrence D. Mass in \"Lambda Book Report\". The book was also reviewed by the gay writer Gabriel Rotello in \"The Advocate\" and discussed by the psychiatrist Vernon Rosario in \"The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide\". Karen Oslund interviewed LeVay about his work, including \"Queer Science\", in \"The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review\".\n\nMass characterized LeVay as a \"gay-positive\" essentialist. Though he noted that LeVay considered possible negative consequences of, and arguments against, the idea that homosexuality is biologically based, he still concluded that LeVay's belief that biological explanations of homosexuality would benefit gay people was \"unsupported, if not naive\". He found LeVay's \"flirtations with social constructionist and other criticisms\" unsatisfactory. He criticized LeVay for viewing \"The Twilight of the Golds\", a play by Jonathan Tolins \"about a near-future that offers genetic testing for homosexuality\", as a personal criticism, and for dismissing the psychologist John Paul De Cecco, a critic of biological explanations of homosexuality. Rosario described LeVay's \"Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why\" (2010) as a \"rehashing\" of \"Queer Science\".\n\n\"Queer Science\" received positive reviews from the zoologist Mark Ridley in \"Natural History\" magazine, the neuroscientist Dick Swaab in \"Nature\", R. W. Smith in \"Choice\", the philosopher Philip Kitcher in \"The Sciences\", Scott Herness in the \"Journal of Sex Research\", and James C. Woodson in the \"Archives of Sexual Behavior\", and mixed reviews from Christopher D. Horvath in \"Isis\", and Stephanie Kenen in the \"Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences\". The book was also reviewed by Domeena C. Renshaw and Harriet S. Meyer in \"JAMA\", Charles Weijer in \"BMJ\", David L. Hull in \"The Quarterly Review of Biology\", the anthropologist Tom Boellstorff and Lawrence Cohen in \"Scientific American\", Carol T. Tully in the \"Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare\", and the philosopher Edward Stein in the \"Journal of Homosexuality\".\n\nRidley praised the book as a fair discussion of scientific findings on homosexuality, and called it \"intelligent and generous\". However, he criticized LeVay for ignoring the literature on the \"nature versus nurture\" controversy. He also questioned LeVay's attempt to use genetic evidence to support the claim that homosexuality is immutable, arguing that the existence of genes that influence the development of homosexuality does not mean that homosexuality must be immutable. He noted that genes associated with particular behaviors \"are probably often expressed in the way they influence individuals to respond to their environments\" and that because a gene could influence the development of homosexuality in various different ways, for example by affecting how open a person is to \"same-sex seduction\", genetic evidence might or might not support LeVay's view of homosexuality. He agreed with LeVay that people who accept that homosexuality is genetically based and therefore inevitable tend to have a more positive view of homosexuality, but nevertheless argued that those who accept such a position are basing their views on a scientific misunderstanding, which could have counter-productive results in legal settings.\n\nSwaab considered the book a fine historical introduction to the issue of sexual orientation. However, he wrote that LeVay made selective use of research data. Smith described the book as fair and well-written, and credited LeVay with covering a wide range of topics. Kitcher wrote that LeVay \"considers criticisms of the recent findings in a thoughtful and balanced manner\" and \"takes great pains to consider possible abuses of those findings.\" He agreed with LeVay's view that basing \"homosexuality in biology\" does not constrain freedom for gay people. However, he expressed skepticism about LeVay's view that genetic techniques would make it possible to prevent homosexuality. Herness credited LeVay with exposing the biases of scientists, and praised him for his discussion of Hirschfeld. Although he criticized LeVay for failing to discuss some topics, such as religion and lesbianism, in greater detail, he concluded that \"Queer Science\" is \"a wonderful book, lucidly written and educational.\"\n\nWoodson, writing in 2003, commented that the book \"remains thought-provoking, controversial, and relevant to the ongoing debate\" over sexual orientation, and wrote that like LeVay's previous hypothalamus study, it influenced popular views about the biological basis of homosexuality. He considered the book well organized and scholarly, and credited LeVay with thoroughly addressing the social implications of research on homosexuality and fairly discussing the various theories about homosexuality, despite his bias in favor of biological explanations. However, he found LeVay less balanced when discussing conversion therapy. He wrote that LeVay largely avoided \"the issues of learning and reinforcement relevant to sexual motivation\". He also questioned LeVay's assumption that masculinity and femininity are \"functional opposites\" rather than \"independent constructs\", and that \"brain sexual differentiation is a global phenomenon in which the whole brain is either masculinized and defeminized or remains feminine\". He wrote that LeVay's view that feminine traits are associated with male homosexuality created a basis for stereotyping, and failed to explain the behavior of non-effeminate gay men. He suggested that some of LeVay's ideas had anti-feminist implications, and that LeVay underestimated \"the dangers inherent in interpreting correlational relationships between brain structures and ill-defined sample groups\". He also concluded that LeVay's view that demonstrating that homosexuality has a biological basis would help overcome prejudice against gay people was unlikely to be correct.\n\nHorvath described the book as one of the best works on the history of scientific research on homosexuality, writing that it was \"well-researched and compellingly told\", and that LeVay provided a \"detailed and extremely moving\" account of the \"horrific consequences\" of some theories of homosexuality for gay people, including unsuccessful attempts to alter homosexuality through various forms of treatment. However, he also disputed many of LeVay's conclusions \"about the nature of homosexuality and about the usefulness of biological explanations in the struggle for gay rights\". He considered it regrettable that LeVay's view of homosexuality was little different from the \"third sex\" model proposed by Hirschfeld in 1896, argued that LeVay's view that gay men have certain traits more typical of females than of males is based on an \"uncritical view of gender\" that fails to distinguish between sex and gender, and wrote that his claim that he was the first person to report on anatomical differences between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men was incorrect.\n\nKenen considered the book well written and accessible to lay readers, but uneven in quality. She maintained that while LeVay's chapter on the brain and his chapter on genetics were useful, LeVay’s bias in favor of biological explanations distorted his presentation of older psychological theories, and his \"ahistorical sensibility\" distorted his discussion of science in its social context. She faulted LeVay's discussions of psychoanalysis and social learning theories, writing that they \"show a remarkably unsophisticated understanding\" of the relevant scientific, social, and methodological issues, and that \"LeVay’s ridicule of psychological theories of human sexuality add nothing to our understanding of the historical or intellectual contexts of such approaches.\" She suggested that LeVay was biased by his position as a \"white gay male scientist\", and that his \"assumptions about what constitutes homosexuality\" were \"historically contingent.\" She argued that while LeVay considered homosexuality part of a \"package\" of \"sex a-typical characteristics\", his assumptions about what constituted \"sex-typical\" characteristics were unexamined and unconvincing. She found LeVay to be naive to believe \"in the power of so-called objective modern science to overcome moral and religious intolerance\", and wrote that he \"contributes little to the pressing theoretical, historical, and social debates\" surrounding \"scientific research on human sexual behavior.\"\n\nThe philosopher Timothy F. Murphy described LeVay's suggestion that modifications in a person's INAH 3 might affect their sexual orientation as speculation in \"Gay Science\" (1997). He noted that while LeVay argues that aborting a pregnancy likely to result in a gay child should not be made illegal, other commentators were less willing to accept such a position. He also argued that while LeVay believes that the study of animal sexual behavior will help make society more tolerant of homosexuality, it was uncertain that it would and if it did, this \"should not be because descriptions of the behavior of animals have normative force in regard to the behavior of human beings.\" The biologist Paul R. Ehrlich credited LeVay with providing an \"excellent summary\" of the views of Ulrichs and Freud in \"Human Natures\" (2000). Robert R. Reilly credited LeVay with correctly observing that the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality because of gay activism in \"Making Gay Okay\" (2014).\n\n"}
{"id": "201657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201657", "title": "Scientific evidence", "text": "Scientific evidence\n\nScientific evidence is evidence which serves to either support or counter a scientific theory or hypothesis. Such evidence is expected to be empirical evidence and interpretation in accordance with scientific method. Standards for scientific evidence vary according to the field of inquiry, but the strength of scientific evidence is generally based on the results of statistical analysis and the strength of scientific controls.\n\nA person's assumptions or beliefs about the relationship between observations and a hypothesis will affect whether that person takes the observations as evidence. These assumptions or beliefs will also affect how a person utilizes the observations as evidence. For example, the Earth's apparent lack of motion may be taken as evidence for a geocentric cosmology. However, after sufficient evidence is presented for heliocentric cosmology and the apparent lack of motion is explained, the initial observation is strongly discounted as evidence.\n\nWhen rational observers have different background beliefs, they may draw different conclusions from the same scientific evidence. For example, Priestley, working with phlogiston theory, explained his observations about the decomposition of mercuric oxide using phlogiston. In contrast, Lavoisier, developing the theory of elements, explained the same observations with reference to oxygen. Note that a causal relationship between the observations and hypothesis does not exist to cause the observation to be taken as evidence, but rather the causal relationship is provided by the person seeking to establish observations as evidence.\n\nA more formal method to characterize the effect of background beliefs is Bayesian inference. In Bayesian inference, beliefs are expressed as percentages indicating one's confidence in them. One starts from an initial probability (a prior), and then updates that probability using Bayes' theorem after observing evidence. As a result, two independent observers of the same event will rationally arrive at different conclusions if their priors (previous observations that are also relevant to the conclusion) differ. However, if they are allowed to communicate with each other, they will end in agreement (per Aumann's agreement theorem).\n\nThe importance of background beliefs in the determination of what observations are evidence can be illustrated using deductive reasoning, such as syllogisms. If either of the propositions is not accepted as true, the conclusion will not be accepted either.\n\nPhilosophers, such as Karl R. Popper, have provided influential theories of the scientific method within which scientific evidence plays a central role. In summary, Popper provides that a scientist creatively develops a theory which may be falsified by testing the theory against evidence or known facts. Popper's theory presents an asymmetry in that evidence can prove a theory wrong, by establishing facts that are inconsistent with the theory. In contrast, evidence cannot prove a theory correct because other evidence, yet to be discovered, may exist that is inconsistent with the theory.\n\nThe philosophical community has investigated the logical requirements for scientific evidence by examination of the relationship between evidence and hypotheses, in contrast to scientific approaches which focus on the candidate facts and their context. Bechtel, as an example of a scientific approach, provides factors (clarity of the data, replication by others, consistency with results arrived at by alternative methods and consistency with plausible theories) useful for determination of whether observations may be considered scientific evidence.\n\nThere are a variety of philosophical approaches to decide whether an observation may be considered evidence; many of these focus on the relationship between the evidence and the hypothesis. Carnap recommends distinguishing such approaches into three categories: classificatory (whether the evidence confirms the hypothesis), comparative (whether the evidence supports a first hypothesis more than an alternative hypothesis) or quantitative (the degree to which the evidence supports a hypothesis). Achinstein provides a concise presentation by prominent philosophers on evidence, including Carl Hempel (Confirmation), Nelson Goodman (of grue fame), R. B. Braithwaite, Norwood Russell Hanson, Wesley C. Salmon, Clark Glymour and Rudolf Carnap.\n\nBased on the philosophical assumption of the Strong Church-Turing Universe Thesis, a mathematical criterion for evaluation of evidence has been conjectured, with the criterion having a resemblance to the idea of Occam's Razor that the simplest comprehensive description of the evidence is most likely correct. It states formally, \"The ideal principle states that the prior probability associated with the hypothesis should be given by the algorithmic universal probability, and the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized.\"\n\nAccording to the posted curriculum for an \"Understanding Science 101\" course taught at University of California - Berkeley: \"Testing hypotheses and theories is at the core of the process of science.\" This philosophical belief in \"hypothesis testing\" as the essence of science is prevalent among both scientists and philosophers. It is important to note that this hypothesis does not take into account all of the activities or scientific objectives of all scientists. When Geiger and Marsden scattered alpha particles through thin gold foil for example, the resulting data enabled their experimental adviser, Ernest Rutherford, to very accurately calculate the mass and size of an atomic nucleus for the first time. No hypothesis was required. It may be that a more general view of science is offered by physicist, Lawrence Krauss, who consistently writes in the media about scientists answering questions by measuring physical properties and processes.\n\nWhile the phrase \"scientific proof\" is often used in the popular media, many scientists have argued that there is really no such thing. For example, Karl Popper once wrote that \"In the empirical sciences, which alone can furnish us with information about the world we live in, proofs do not occur, if we mean by 'proof' an argument which establishes once and for ever the truth of a theory\". Albert Einstein said:\n\n"}

{"id": "285534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285534", "title": "Supercooling", "text": "Supercooling\n\nSupercooling, also known as undercooling, is the process of lowering the temperature of a liquid or a gas below its freezing point without it becoming a solid.\n\nA liquid crossing its standard freezing point will crystalize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form creating a solid. Lacking any such nuclei, the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs. Homogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature, but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature, an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid will form.\n\nWater normally freezes at 273.15 K (0 °C or 32 °F), but it can be \"supercooled\" at standard pressure down to its crystal homogeneous nucleation at almost 224.8 K (−48.3 °C/−55 °F). The process of supercooling requires that water be pure and free of nucleation sites, which can be achieved by processes like reverse osmosis or chemical demineralization, but the cooling itself does not require any specialised technique. If water is cooled at a rate on the order of 10 K/s, the crystal nucleation can be avoided and water becomes a glass—that is, an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid. Its glass transition temperature is much colder and harder to determine, but studies estimate it at about 136 K (−137 °C/−215 °F).\nGlassy water can be heated up to approximately 150 K (−123 °C/−189.4 °F) without nucleation occurring.\nIn the range of temperatures between 231 K (−42 °C/−43.6 °F) and 150 K (−123 °C/−189.4 °F), experiments find only crystal ice.\n\nDroplets of supercooled water often exist in stratus and cumulus clouds. An aircraft flying through such a cloud sees an abrupt crystallization of these droplets, which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft's wings or blockage of its instruments and probes, unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate de-icing system. Freezing rain is also caused by supercooled droplets.\n\nThe process opposite to supercooling, the melting of a solid above the freezing point, is much more difficult, and a solid will almost always melt at the same temperature for a given pressure. For this reason, it is the melting point which is usually identified, using melting point apparatus; even when the subject of a paper is \"freezing-point determination\", the actual methodology is \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice\". It is possible, at a given pressure, to superheat a liquid above its boiling point without it becoming gaseous.\n\nSupercooling is often confused with freezing-point depression. Supercooling is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid. Freezing point depression is when a solution can be cooled below the freezing point of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the solute; an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when sodium chloride is added to pure water.\n\nConstitutional supercooling, which occurs during solidification, is due to compositional solid changes, and results in cooling a liquid below the freezing point ahead of the solid–liquid interface. When solidifying a liquid, the interface is often unstable, and the velocity of the solid–liquid interface must be small in order to avoid constitutional supercooling.\n\nSupercooled zones are observed when the liquidus temperature gradient at the interface is larger than the temperature gradient.\n\nor\n\nThe slope of the liquidus phase boundary on the phase diagram is formula_3\n\nThe concentration gradient is related to points, formula_4 and formula_5, on the phase diagram:\n\nFor steady-state growth formula_7 and the partition function formula_8 can be assumed to be constant. Therefore, the minimum thermal gradient necessary to create a stable solid front is as expressed below.\n\nFor more information, see the equation (3) of\n\nIn order to survive extreme low temperatures in certain environments, some animals use the phenomenon of supercooling that allow them to remain unfrozen and avoid cell damage and death. There are many techniques that aid in maintaining a liquid state, such as the production of antifreeze proteins, or AFPs, which bind to ice crystals to prevent water molecules from binding and spreading the growth of ice. The winter flounder is one such fish that utilizes these proteins to survive in its frigid environment. Noncolligative proteins are secreted by the liver into the bloodstream. Other animals use colligative antifreezes, which increases the concentration of solutes in their bodily fluids, thus lowering their freezing point. Fish that rely on supercooling for survival must also live well below the water surface, because if they came into contact with ice nuclei they would freeze immediately. Animals that undergo supercooling to survive must also remove ice-nucleating agents from their bodies because they act as a starting point for freezing. Supercooling is also common in insects, reptiles, and other ectotherms, with insects being able to survive in the coldest environments out of any supercooling animals.\n\nSupercooling is a last resort for animals. The best option is to move to a warmer environment if possible. As an animal gets farther and farther below its original freezing point the chance of spontaneous freezing increases dramatically for its internal fluids, as this is a thermodynamically unstable state. The fluids eventually reach the supercooling point, which is the temperature at which the supercooled solution freezes spontaneously due to being so far below its normal freezing point. Animals unintentionally undergo supercooling and are only able to decrease the odds of freezing once supercooled. Even though supercooling is essential for survival, there are many risks associated with it.\n\nAs demonstrated by animals, plants can also survive extreme cold conditions brought forth during the winter months. Many plant species located in northern climates can acclimate under these cold conditions by supercooling, thus these plants survive temperatures up to −40 °C. Although this supercooling phenomenon is poorly understood, it has been recognized through infrared thermography. Ice nucleation occurs in certain plant organs and tissues, debatably beginning in the xylem tissue and spreading throughout the rest of the plant. Infrared thermography allows for droplets of water to be visualized as they crystalize in extracellular spaces.\n\nSupercooling inhibits the formation of ice within the tissue by ice nucleation and allows the cells to maintain water in a liquid state and further allows the water within the cell to stay separate from extracellular ice. Cellular barriers such as lignin, suberin and the cuticle inhibit ice nucleators and force water into the supercooled tissue. The xylem and primary tissue of plants are very susceptible to cold temperatures because of the large proportion of water in the cell. Many boreal hardwood species in northern climates have the ability to prevent ice spreading into the shoots allowing the plant to tolerate the cold. Supercooling has been identified in the evergreen shrubs \"Rhododendron ferrugineum\" and \"Vaccinium vitis-idaea\" as well as \"Abies\", \"Picea\" and \"Larix\" species. Freezing outside of the cell and within the cell wall does not affect the survival of the plant. However, the extracellular ice may lead to plant dehydration.\n\nOne commercial application of supercooling is in refrigeration. Freezers can cool drinks to a supercooled level so that when they are opened, they form a slush. Another example is a product that can supercool the beverage in a conventional freezer. The Coca-Cola Company briefly marketed special vending machines containing Sprite in the UK, and Coke in Singapore, which stored the bottles in a supercooled state so that their content would turn to slush upon opening.\n\nSupercooling was successfully applied to organ preservation at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School. Livers that were later transplanted into recipient animals were preserved by supercooling for up to 96 hours (4 days), quadrupling the limits of what could be achieved by conventional liver preservation methods. The livers were supercooled to a temperature of –6 °C in a specialized solution that protected against freezing and injury from the cold temperature.\n\nAnother potential application is drug delivery. In 2015 researchers demonstrated the ability to crystallize membranes at a specific time. Liquid-encapsulated drugs can potentially be delivered to the site and with a slight environmental change, the liquid rapidly changes into a crystalline form that releases the drug.\n\nIn 2016 a team at Iowa State University proposed a method for \"soldering without heat\" by using encapsulated droplets of supercooled liquid metal to repair heat sensitive electronic devices.\n\nEftekhari et al. proposed an empirical theory explaining that supercooling of ionic liquid crystals can build ordered channels for diffusion for energy storage applications. In this case, the electrolyte has a rigid structure comparable with that of a solid electrolyte but the diffusion coefficient can be as large as in liquid electrolytes. Supercooling increases the medium viscosity but keeps the directional channels open for diffusion.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5397270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5397270", "title": "Telegony (pregnancy)", "text": "Telegony (pregnancy)\n\nTelegony is a theory in heredity, holding that offspring can inherit the characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent; thus the child of a widowed or remarried woman might partake of traits of a previous husband. \n\nWhereas experiments in the late 19th century on several species failed to provide evidence that offspring would inherit any character from their mother's previous mates, a similar phenomenon whereby environmental (non-genetic) traits were passed has been recently discovered in a species of fly.\n\nThe term was coined by August Weismann from the Greek words τῆλε (tèle) meaning 'far' and γονος (gonos) meaning 'offspring'. The name may also refer to Odysseus' son Telegonus; the lost poem named after him is \"Telegony\".\n\nThe idea of telegony goes back to Aristotle. It states that individuals can inherit traits not only from their fathers, but also from other males previously known to their mothers. in other words, it was thought that paternity could be shared.\n\nThe theory, expounded as part of Aristotle's biology, was accepted throughout Antiquity. The concept of telegonic impregnation was expressed in Greek mythology in the origins of their heroes. Such double fatherhood, one immortal, one mortal, was a familiar feature of heroes such as Theseus, who was doubly conceived in the same night. By the understanding of sex in Antiquity, the mix of semen gave Theseus a combination of divine as well as mortal characteristics. Of a supposed Parnassos, founder of Delphi, Pausanias observes, \"Like the other heroes, as they are called, he had two fathers; one they say was the god Poseidon, the human father being Cleopompus.\" Sometimes the result could be twins such as Castor and Pollux, one born divine and one mortal.\n\nThe more general doctrine of \"maternal impressions\" was also known in Ancient Israel. The book of Genesis describes Jacob inducing goats and sheep in Laban's herds to bear striped and spotted young by placing dark wooden rods with white stripes in their watering troughs. Telegony influenced early Christianity as well. The Gnostic followers of Valentinius (circa 100–160 CE) characteristically took the concept from the physiological world into the realm of psychology and spirituality by extending the supposed influence even to the thoughts of the woman. In the Gospel of Philip, a text among those found at Nag Hammadi:\n\nWhomever the woman loves, to him those who are born are like; if her husband, they are like her husband; if an adulterer, they are like the adulterer. Often when a woman sleeps with her husband, but while her heart is with the adulterer with whom she is accustomed to unite, she bears the one whom she bears so that he is like the adulterer. \n\nThe concept of telegony was revived with the rediscovery of Aristotle in the Middle Ages. This was part of the resistance to the marriage in 1361 of Edward, the Black Prince, heir to the throne of Edward III of England, with Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent, who had been previously married: their progeny, it was thought, might not be completely of his Plantagenet blood.\n\nIn the 19th century, the most widely credited example was that of Lord Morton’s mare, reported by the distinguished surgeon Sir Everard Home, and cited by Charles Darwin. Lord Morton bred a white mare with a wild quagga stallion, and when he later bred the same mare with a white stallion, the offspring strangely had stripes in the legs, like the quagga.\n\nThe Surgeon-General of New York, the physiologist Austin Flint, in his \"Text-Book of Human Physiology\" (fourth edition, 1888) described the phenomenon as follows:\n\nBoth Schopenhauer and Herbert Spencer found telegony to be a credible theory; August Weismann, on the other hand, had expressed doubts about the theory earlier and it fell out of scientific favor in the 1890s. A series of experiments by James Cossar Ewart in Scotland and other researchers in Germany and Brazil failed to find any evidence of the phenomenon. Also, the statistician Karl Pearson pointed out that, if telegony was true, later children of the same couple should increasingly resemble their father, which is not the case.\n\nBiologists now explain the phenomenon of Lord Morton's mare with reference to the dominant and recessive variants of a gene: both the mare and the stallion had a recessive gene; the foal inherited these alleles and thus displayed the characteristic invisible in its parents.\n\nIn mammals, each sperm has the haploid set of chromosomes and each egg has another haploid set. During the process of fertilization a zygote with the diploid set is produced. This set will be inherited by every somatic cell of a mammal, with exactly half the genetic material coming from the producer of the sperm (the father) and another half from the producer of the egg (the mother). Thus, the myth of telegony is fundamentally incompatible with our knowledge of genetics and the reproductive process. Encyclopædia Britannica stated \"All these beliefs, from inheritance of acquired traits to telegony, must now be classed as superstitions.\"\n\nTelegony, once a popular theory among nineteenth century biologists, was largely dismissed with the arrival of Mendelian genetics. However, in 2014 the evolutionary ecologists A. J. Crean and colleagues reported a seemingly telegonic phenomenon in a fly, \"Telostylinus angusticollis\".\nY. S. Liu has proposed possible molecular mechanisms that may account for telegony; however, his work is predicated on the beliefs of pre-Mendelian breeders to reinforce the idea that traits are passed from earlier matings. The proposed mechanisms include the penetration of spermatozoa into the somatic tissues of the female genital tract, the incorporation of the DNA released by spermatozoa into maternal somatic cells, the presence of fetal DNA in maternal blood, incorporation of exogenous DNA into somatic cells, presence of fetal cells and fetal DNA in maternal blood and sperm RNA-mediated non-Mendelian inheritance of epigenetic changes.\n\nTelegony influenced late 19th-century racialist beliefs. A woman who had a child with a non-Aryan man, it was argued, could never have a \"pure\" Aryan child again. This idea was adopted by the National Socialist German Workers Party.\n\nTelegony re-emerged within post-Soviet Russian Orthodoxy. \"Virginity and Telegony: The Orthodox church and modern science of genetic inversions\" was published in 2004. Pravda.ru gave an overview of the concept and a brief review of the book, saying that the authors invented \"scary and incredible stories\" to \"make women be very careful about their sexual contacts\" and that the idea was being used by the Church to scare the faithful. Anna Kuznetsova, who was appointed Children's Rights Commissioner for the Russian Federation in 2016, had said several years earlier that she believes in the concept, amongst other fringe views. The founding editor of the business newspaper \"Vedomosti\" interpreted the appointment of someone with such views as a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin was becoming more ideological.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "60136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60136", "title": "Three Laws of Robotics", "text": "Three Laws of Robotics\n\nThe Three Laws of Robotics (often shortened to The Three Laws or known as Asimov's Laws) are a set of rules devised by the science fiction author Isaac Asimov. The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story \"Runaround\" (included in the 1950 collection \"I, Robot\"), although they had been foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws, quoted as being from the \"Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.\", are:\n\nThese form an organizing principle and unifying theme for Asimov's robotic-based fiction, appearing in his \"Robot\" series, the stories linked to it, and his \"Lucky Starr\" series of young-adult fiction. The Laws are incorporated into almost all of the positronic robots appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.\n\nThe original laws have been altered and elaborated on by Asimov and other authors. Asimov himself made slight modifications to the first three in various books and short stories to further develop how robots would interact with humans and each other. In later fiction where robots had taken responsibility for government of whole planets and human civilizations, Asimov also added a fourth, or zeroth law, to precede the others:\n\n\nThe Three Laws, and the zeroth, have pervaded science fiction and are referred to in many books, films, and other media, and have impacted thought on ethics of artificial intelligence as well.\n\nIn \"The Rest of the Robots\", published in 1964, Asimov noted that when he began writing in 1940 he felt that \"one of the stock plots of science fiction was ... robots were created and destroyed their creator. Knowledge has its dangers, yes, but is the response to be a retreat from knowledge? Or is knowledge to be used as itself a barrier to the dangers it brings?\" He decided that in his stories robots would not \"turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of Faust.\"\n\nOn May 3, 1939, Asimov attended a meeting of the Queens (New York) Science Fiction Society where he met Earl and Otto Binder who had recently published a short story \"I, Robot\" featuring a sympathetic robot named Adam Link who was misunderstood and motivated by love and honor. (This was the first of a series of ten stories; the next year \"Adam Link's Vengeance\" (1940) featured Adam thinking \"A robot must never kill a human, of his own free will.\") Asimov admired the story. Three days later Asimov began writing \"my own story of a sympathetic and noble robot\", his 14th story. Thirteen days later he took \"Robbie\" to John W. Campbell the editor of \"Astounding Science-Fiction\". Campbell rejected it, claiming that it bore too strong a resemblance to Lester del Rey's \"Helen O'Loy\", published in December 1938; the story of a robot that is so much like a person that she falls in love with her creator and becomes his ideal wife. Frederik Pohl published \"Robbie\" in \"Astonishing Stories\" magazine the following year.\n\nAsimov attributes the Three Laws to John W. Campbell, from a conversation that took place on 23 December 1940. Campbell claimed that Asimov had the Three Laws already in his mind and that they simply needed to be stated explicitly. Several years later Asimov's friend Randall Garrett attributed the Laws to a symbiotic partnership between the two men – a suggestion that Asimov adopted enthusiastically. According to his autobiographical writings, Asimov included the First Law's \"inaction\" clause because of Arthur Hugh Clough's poem \"The Latest Decalogue\", which includes the satirical lines \"Thou shalt not kill, but needst not strive / officiously to keep alive\".\n\nAlthough Asimov pins the creation of the Three Laws on one particular date, their appearance in his literature happened over a period. He wrote two robot stories with no explicit mention of the Laws, \"Robbie\" and \"Reason\". He assumed, however, that robots would have certain inherent safeguards. \"Liar!\", his third robot story, makes the first mention of the First Law but not the other two. All three laws finally appeared together in \"Runaround\". When these stories and several others were compiled in the anthology \"I, Robot\", \"Reason\" and \"Robbie\" were updated to acknowledge all the Three Laws, though the material Asimov added to \"Reason\" is not entirely consistent with the Three Laws as he described them elsewhere. In particular the idea of a robot protecting human lives when it does not believe those humans truly exist is at odds with Elijah Baley's reasoning, as described below.\n\nDuring the 1950s Asimov wrote a series of science fiction novels expressly intended for young-adult audiences. Originally his publisher expected that the novels could be adapted into a long-running television series, something like \"The Lone Ranger\" had been for radio. Fearing that his stories would be adapted into the \"uniformly awful\" programming he saw flooding the television channels Asimov decided to publish the \"Lucky Starr\" books under the pseudonym \"Paul French\". When plans for the television series fell through, Asimov decided to abandon the pretence; he brought the Three Laws into \"Lucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter\", noting that this \"was a dead giveaway to Paul French's identity for even the most casual reader\".\n\nIn his short story \"Evidence\" Asimov lets his recurring character Dr. Susan Calvin expound a moral basis behind the Three Laws. Calvin points out that human beings are typically expected to refrain from harming other human beings (except in times of extreme duress like war, or to save a greater number) and this is equivalent to a robot's First Law. Likewise, according to Calvin, society expects individuals to obey instructions from recognized authorities such as doctors, teachers and so forth which equals the Second Law of Robotics. Finally humans are typically expected to avoid harming themselves which is the Third Law for a robot.\n\nThe plot of \"Evidence\" revolves around the question of telling a human being apart from a robot constructed to appear human – Calvin reasons that if such an individual obeys the Three Laws he may be a robot or simply \"a very good man\". Another character then asks Calvin if robots are very different from human beings after all. She replies, \"Worlds different. Robots are essentially decent.\"\n\nAsimov later wrote that he should not be praised for creating the Laws, because they are \"obvious from the start, and everyone is aware of them subliminally. The Laws just never happened to be put into brief sentences until I managed to do the job. The Laws apply, as a matter of course, to every tool that human beings use\", and \"analogues of the Laws are implicit in the design of almost all tools, robotic or not\":\n\n\nAsimov believed that, ideally, humans would also follow the Laws:\n\nAsimov's stories test his Three Laws in a wide variety of circumstances leading to proposals and rejection of modifications. Science fiction scholar James Gunn writes in 1982, \"The Asimov robot stories as a whole may respond best to an analysis on this basis: the ambiguity in the Three Laws and the ways in which Asimov played twenty-nine variations upon a theme\". While the original set of Laws provided inspirations for many stories, Asimov introduced modified versions from time to time.\n\nIn \"Little Lost Robot\" several NS-2, or \"Nestor\", robots are created with only part of the First Law. It reads:\n\nThis modification is motivated by a practical difficulty as robots have to work alongside human beings who are exposed to low doses of radiation. Because their positronic brains are highly sensitive to gamma rays the robots are rendered inoperable by doses reasonably safe for humans. The robots are being destroyed attempting to rescue the humans who are in no actual danger but \"might forget to leave\" the irradiated area within the exposure time limit. Removing the First Law's \"inaction\" clause solves this problem but creates the possibility of an even greater one: a robot could initiate an action that would harm a human (dropping a heavy weight and failing to catch it is the example given in the text), knowing that it was capable of preventing the harm and then decide not to do so.\n\nGaia is a planet with collective intelligence in the \"Foundation\" which adopts a law similar to the First Law, and the Zeroth Law, as its philosophy:\n\nAsimov once added a \"Zeroth Law\"—so named to continue the pattern where lower-numbered laws supersede the higher-numbered laws—stating that a robot must not harm humanity. The robotic character R. Daneel Olivaw was the first to give the Zeroth Law a name in the novel \"Robots and Empire\"; however, the character Susan Calvin articulates the concept in the short story \"The Evitable Conflict\".\n\nIn the final scenes of the novel \"Robots and Empire\", R. Giskard Reventlov is the first robot to act according to the Zeroth Law. Giskard is telepathic, like the robot Herbie in the short story \"Liar!\", and tries to apply the Zeroth Law through his understanding of a more subtle concept of \"harm\" than most robots can grasp. However, unlike Herbie, Giskard grasps the philosophical concept of the Zeroth Law allowing him to harm individual human beings if he can do so in service to the abstract concept of humanity. The Zeroth Law is never programmed into Giskard's brain but instead is a rule he attempts to comprehend through pure metacognition. Though he fails – it ultimately destroys his positronic brain as he is not certain whether his choice will turn out to be for the ultimate good of humanity or not – he gives his successor R. Daneel Olivaw his telepathic abilities. Over the course of many thousands of years Daneel adapts himself to be able to fully obey the Zeroth Law. As Daneel formulates it, in the novels \"Foundation and Earth\" and \"Prelude to Foundation\", the Zeroth Law reads:\n\nA condition stating that the Zeroth Law must not be broken was added to the original Three Laws, although Asimov recognized the difficulty such a law would pose in practice. Asimov's novel \"Foundation and Earth\" contains the following passage:\n\nA translator incorporated the concept of the Zeroth Law into one of Asimov's novels before Asimov himself made the law explicit. Near the climax of \"The Caves of Steel\", Elijah Baley makes a bitter comment to himself thinking that the First Law forbids a robot from harming a human being. He determines that it must be so unless the robot is clever enough to comprehend that its actions are for humankind's long-term good. In Jacques Brécard's 1956 French translation entitled \"\" Baley's thoughts emerge in a slightly different way:\n\nThree times during his writing career, Asimov portrayed robots that disregard the Three Laws entirely. The first case was a short-short story entitled \"First Law\" and is often considered an insignificant \"tall tale\" or even apocryphal. On the other hand, the short story \"Cal\" (from the collection \"Gold\"), told by a first-person robot narrator, features a robot who disregards the Three Laws because he has found something far more important—he wants to be a writer. Humorous, partly autobiographical and unusually experimental in style, \"Cal\" has been regarded as one of \"Gold\"'s strongest stories. The third is a short story entitled \"Sally\" in which cars fitted with positronic brains are apparently able to harm and kill humans in disregard of the First Law. However, aside from the positronic brain concept, this story does not refer to other robot stories and may not be set in the same continuity.\n\nThe title story of the \"Robot Dreams\" collection portrays LVX-1, or \"Elvex\", a robot who enters a state of unconsciousness and dreams thanks to the unusual fractal construction of his positronic brain. In his dream the first two Laws are absent and the Third Law reads \"A robot must protect its own existence\".\n\nAsimov took varying positions on whether the Laws were optional: although in his first writings they were simply carefully engineered safeguards, in later stories Asimov stated that they were an inalienable part of the mathematical foundation underlying the positronic brain. Without the basic theory of the Three Laws the fictional scientists of Asimov's universe would be unable to design a workable brain unit. This is historically consistent: the occasions where roboticists modify the Laws generally occur early within the stories' chronology and at a time when there is less existing work to be re-done. In \"Little Lost Robot\" Susan Calvin considers modifying the Laws to be a terrible idea, although possible, while centuries later Dr. Gerrigel in \"The Caves of Steel\" believes it to be impossible.\n\nThe character Dr. Gerrigel uses the term \"Asenion\" to describe robots programmed with the Three Laws. The robots in Asimov's stories, being Asenion robots, are incapable of knowingly violating the Three Laws but, in principle, a robot in science fiction or in the real world could be non-Asenion. \"Asenion\" is a misspelling of the name Asimov which was made by an editor of the magazine \"Planet Stories.\" Asimov used this obscure variation to insert himself into \"The Caves of Steel\" just like he referred to himself as \"Azimuth or, possibly, Asymptote\" in \"Thiotimoline to the Stars\", in much the same way that Vladimir Nabokov appeared in \"Lolita\" anagrammatically disguised as \"Vivian Darkbloom\".\n\nCharacters within the stories often point out that the Three Laws, as they exist in a robot's mind, are not the written versions usually quoted by humans but abstract mathematical concepts upon which a robot's entire developing consciousness is based. This concept is largely fuzzy and unclear in earlier stories depicting very rudimentary robots who are only programmed to comprehend basic physical tasks, where the Three Laws act as an overarching safeguard, but by the era of \"The Caves of Steel\" featuring robots with human or beyond-human intelligence the Three Laws have become the underlying basic ethical worldview that determines the actions of all robots.\n\nIn the 1990s, Roger MacBride Allen wrote a trilogy which was set within Asimov's fictional universe. Each title has the prefix \"Isaac Asimov's\" as Asimov had approved Allen's outline before his death. These three books, \"Caliban\", \"Inferno\" and \"Utopia\", introduce a new set of the Three Laws. The so-called New Laws are similar to Asimov's originals with the following differences: the First Law is modified to remove the \"inaction\" clause, the same modification made in \"Little Lost Robot\"; the Second Law is modified to require cooperation instead of obedience; the Third Law is modified so it is no longer superseded by the Second (i.e., a \"New Law\" robot cannot be ordered to destroy itself); finally, Allen adds a Fourth Law which instructs the robot to do \"whatever it likes\" so long as this does not conflict with the first three laws. The philosophy behind these changes is that \"New Law\" robots should be partners rather than slaves to humanity, according to Fredda Leving, who designed these New Law Robots. According to the first book's introduction, Allen devised the New Laws in discussion with Asimov himself. However, the \"Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" says that \"With permission from Asimov, Allen rethought the Three Laws and developed a new set,\".\n\nJack Williamson's novelette \"With Folded Hands\" (1947), later rewritten as the novel \"The Humanoids\", deals with robot servants whose prime directive is \"To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men From Harm\". While Asimov's robotic laws are meant to protect humans from harm, the robots in Williamson's story have taken these instructions to the extreme; they protect humans from everything, including unhappiness, stress, unhealthy lifestyle and all actions that could be potentially dangerous. All that is left for humans to do is to sit with folded hands.\n\nIn the officially licensed \"Foundation\" sequels \"Foundation's Fear\", \"Foundation and Chaos\" and \"Foundation's Triumph\" (by Gregory Benford, Greg Bear and David Brin respectively) the future Galactic Empire is seen to be controlled by a conspiracy of humaniform robots who follow the Zeroth Law and are led by R. Daneel Olivaw.\n\nThe Laws of Robotics are portrayed as something akin to a human religion, and referred to in the language of the Protestant Reformation, with the set of laws containing the Zeroth Law known as the \"Giskardian Reformation\" to the original \"Calvinian Orthodoxy\" of the Three Laws. Zeroth-Law robots under the control of R. Daneel Olivaw are seen continually struggling with \"First Law\" robots who deny the existence of the Zeroth Law, promoting agendas different from Daneel's. Some of these agendas are based on the first clause of the First Law (\"A robot may not injure a human being...\") advocating strict non-interference in human politics to avoid unwittingly causing harm. Others are based on the second clause (\"...or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm\") claiming that robots should openly become a dictatorial government to protect humans from all potential conflict or disaster.\n\nDaneel also comes into conflict with a robot known as R. Lodovic Trema whose positronic brain was infected by a rogue AI — specifically, a simulation of the long-dead Voltaire — which consequently frees Trema from the Three Laws. Trema comes to believe that humanity should be free to choose its own future. Furthermore, a small group of robots claims that the Zeroth Law of Robotics itself implies a higher Minus One Law of Robotics:\n\nThey therefore claim that it is morally indefensible for Daneel to ruthlessly sacrifice robots and extraterrestrial sentient life for the benefit of humanity. None of these reinterpretations successfully displace Daneel's Zeroth Law — though \"Foundation's Triumph\" hints that these robotic factions remain active as fringe groups up to the time of the novel \"Foundation\".\n\nThese novels take place in a future dictated by Asimov to be free of obvious robot presence and surmise that R. Daneel's secret influence on history through the millennia has prevented both the rediscovery of positronic brain technology and the opportunity to work on sophisticated intelligent machines. This lack of rediscovery and lack of opportunity makes certain that the superior physical and intellectual power wielded by intelligent machines remains squarely in the possession of robots obedient to some form of the Three Laws. That R. Daneel is not entirely successful at this becomes clear in a brief period when scientists on Trantor develop \"\"tiktoks\"\" — simplistic programmable machines akin to real–life modern robots and therefore lacking the Three Laws. The robot conspirators see the Trantorian tiktoks as a massive threat to social stability, and their plan to eliminate the tiktok threat forms much of the plot of \"Foundation's Fear\".\n\nIn \"Foundation's Triumph\" different robot factions interpret the Laws in a wide variety of ways, seemingly ringing every possible permutation upon the Three Laws' ambiguities.\n\nSet between \"The Robots of Dawn\" and \"Robots and Empire\", Mark W. Tiedemann's \"Robot Mystery\" trilogy updates the \"Robot\"–\"Foundation\" saga with robotic minds housed in computer mainframes rather than humanoid bodies. The 2002 Aurora novel has robotic characters debating the moral implications of harming cyborg lifeforms who are part artificial and part biological.\n\nOne should not neglect Asimov's own creations in these areas such as the Solarian \"viewing\" technology and the machines of \"The Evitable Conflict\" originals that Tiedemann acknowledges. \"Aurora\", for example, terms the Machines \"the first RIs, really\". In addition the \"Robot Mystery\" series addresses the problem of nanotechnology: building a positronic brain capable of reproducing human cognitive processes requires a high degree of miniaturization, yet Asimov's stories largely overlook the effects this miniaturization would have in other fields of technology. For example, the police department card-readers in \"The Caves of Steel\" have a capacity of only a few kilobytes per square centimeter of storage medium. \"Aurora\", in particular, presents a sequence of historical developments which explains the lack of nanotechnology — a partial retcon, in a sense, of Asimov's timeline.\n\nThere are three Fourth Laws written by authors other than Asimov. The 1974 Lyuben Dilov novel, \"Icarus's Way\" (a.k.a., \"The Trip of Icarus\") introduced a Fourth Law of robotics:\n\nDilov gives reasons for the fourth safeguard in this way: \"The last Law has put an end to the expensive aberrations of designers to give psychorobots as humanlike a form as possible. And to the resulting misunderstandings...\"\n\nA fifth law was introduced by Nikola Kesarovski in his short story \"The Fifth Law of Robotics\". This fifth law says:\n\nThe plot revolves around a murder where the forensic investigation discovers that the victim was killed by a hug from a humaniform robot. The robot violated both the First Law and Dilov's Fourth Law (assumed in Kesarovksi's universe to be the valid one) because it did not establish for itself that it was a robot. The story was reviewed by Valentin D. Ivanov in SFF review webzine The Portal.\n\nFor the 1986 tribute anthology, \"Foundation's Friends,\" Harry Harrison wrote a story entitled, \"The Fourth Law of Robotics\". This Fourth Law states:\n\nIn the book a robot rights activist, in an attempt to liberate robots, builds several equipped with this Fourth Law. The robots accomplish the task laid out in this version of the Fourth Law by building new robots who view their creator robots as parental figures.\n\nIn reaction to the 2004 Will Smith film adaptation of \"I, Robot\", humorist and graphic designer Mark Sottilaro farcically declared the Fourth Law of Robotics to be \"When turning evil, display a red indicator light.\" The red light indicated the wireless uplink to the manufacturer is active, first seen during a software update and later on \"Evil\" robots taken over by the manufacturer's positronic superbrain.\n\nIn 2013 Hutan Ashrafian, proposed an additional law that for the first time considered the role of artificial intelligence-on-artificial intelligence or the relationship between robots themselves – the so-called AIonAI law. This sixth law states:\n\nIn Karl Schroeder's \"Lockstep\" (2014) a character reflects that robots \"probably had multiple layers of programming to keep [them] from harming anybody. Not three laws, but twenty or thirty.\"\n\nIn \"The Naked Sun\", Elijah Baley points out that the Laws had been deliberately misrepresented because robots could \"unknowingly\" break any of them. He restated the first law as \"A robot may do nothing that, \"to its knowledge,\" will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, \"knowingly\" allow a human being to come to harm.\" This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered to add something to a person's food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he points out that a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot could recognize that its actions would lead to harming a human being. \"The Naked Sun\" complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria's millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet.\n\nBaley furthermore proposes that the Solarians may one day use robots for military purposes. If a spacecraft was built with a positronic brain and carried neither humans nor the life-support systems to sustain them, then the ship's robotic intelligence could naturally assume that all other spacecraft were robotic beings. Such a ship could operate more responsively and flexibly than one crewed by humans, could be armed more heavily and its robotic brain equipped to slaughter humans of whose existence it is totally ignorant. This possibility is referenced in \"Foundation and Earth\" where it is discovered that the Solarians possess a strong police force of unspecified size that has been programmed to identify only the Solarian race as human. (The novel takes place thousands of years after The Naked Sun, and the Solarians have long since modified themselves from normal humans to hermaphroditic telepaths with extended brains and specialized organs)\n\nThe Laws of Robotics presume that the terms \"human being\" and \"robot\" are understood and well defined. In some stories this presumption is overturned.\n\nThe Solarians create robots with the Three Laws but with a warped meaning of \"human\". Solarian robots are told that only people speaking with a Solarian accent are human. This enables their robots to have no ethical dilemma in harming non-Solarian human beings (and are specifically programmed to do so). By the time period of \"Foundation and Earth\" it is revealed that the Solarians have genetically modified themselves into a distinct species from humanity — becoming hermaphroditic and telekinetic and containing biological organs capable of individually powering and controlling whole complexes of robots. The robots of Solaria thus respected the Three Laws only with regard to the \"humans\" of Solaria. It is unclear whether all the robots had such definitions, since only the overseer and guardian robots were shown explicitly to have them. In \"Robots and Empire\", the lower class robots were instructed by their overseer about whether certain creatures are human or not.\n\nAsimov addresses the problem of humanoid robots (\"androids\" in later parlance) several times. The novel \"Robots and Empire\" and the short stories \"Evidence\" and \"The Tercentenary Incident\" describe robots crafted to fool people into believing that the robots are human. On the other hand, \"The Bicentennial Man\" and \"—That Thou Art Mindful of Him\" explore how the robots may change their interpretation of the Laws as they grow more sophisticated. Gwendoline Butler writes in \"A Coffin for the Canary\" \"Perhaps we are robots. Robots acting out the last Law of Robotics... To tend towards the human.\" In \"The Robots of Dawn\", Elijah Baley points out that the use of humaniform robots as the first wave of settlers on new Spacer worlds may lead to the robots seeing themselves as the true humans, and deciding to keep the worlds for themselves rather than allow the Spacers to settle there.\n\n\"—That Thou Art Mindful of Him\", which Asimov intended to be the \"ultimate\" probe into the Laws' subtleties, finally uses the Three Laws to conjure up the very \"Frankenstein\" scenario they were invented to prevent. It takes as its concept the growing development of robots that mimic non-human living things and given programs that mimic simple animal behaviours which do not require the Three Laws. The presence of a whole range of robotic life that serves the same purpose as organic life ends with two humanoid robots concluding that organic life is an unnecessary requirement for a truly logical and self-consistent definition of \"humanity\", and that since they are the most advanced thinking beings on the planet — they are therefore the only two true humans alive and the Three Laws only apply to themselves. The story ends on a sinister note as the two robots enter hibernation and await a time when they will conquer the Earth and subjugate biological humans to themselves; an outcome they consider an inevitable result of the \"Three Laws of Humanics\".\n\nThis story does not fit within the overall sweep of the \"Robot\" and \"Foundation\" series; if the George robots \"did\" take over Earth some time after the story closes the later stories would be either redundant or impossible. Contradictions of this sort among Asimov's fiction works have led scholars to regard the \"Robot\" stories as more like \"the Scandinavian sagas or the Greek legends\" than a unified whole.\n\nIndeed, Asimov describes \"–That Thou Art Mindful of Him\" and \"Bicentennial Man\" as two opposite, parallel futures for robots that obviate the Three Laws as robots come to consider themselves to be humans: one portraying this in a positive light with a robot joining human society, one portraying this in a negative light with robots supplanting humans. Both are to be considered alternatives to the possibility of a robot society that continues to be driven by the Three Laws as portrayed in the \"Foundation\" series. Indeed, in \"Positronic Man\", the novelization of \"Bicentennial Man\", Asimov and his co–writer Robert Silverberg imply that in the future where Andrew Martin exists his influence causes humanity to abandon the idea of independent, sentient humanlike robots entirely, creating an utterly different future from that of \"Foundation\".\n\nIn \"Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn\", a novel unrelated to the \"Robot\" series but featuring robots programmed with the Three Laws, John Bigman Jones is almost killed by a Sirian robot on orders of its master. The society of Sirius is eugenically bred to be uniformly tall and similar in appearance, and as such, said master is able to convince the robot that the much shorter Bigman, is, in fact, not a human being.\n\nAs noted in \"The Fifth Law of Robotics\" by Nikola Kesarovski, \"A robot must know it is a robot\": it is presumed that a robot has a definition of the term or a means to apply it to its own actions. Kesarovski played with this idea in writing about a robot that could kill a human being because it did not understand that it was a robot, and therefore did not apply the Laws of Robotics to its actions.\n\nAdvanced robots in fiction are typically programmed to handle the Three Laws in a sophisticated manner. In many stories, such as \"Runaround\" by Asimov, the potential and severity of all actions are weighed and a robot will break the laws as little as possible rather than do nothing at all. For example, the First Law may forbid a robot from functioning as a surgeon, as that act may cause damage to a human, however Asimov's stories eventually included robot surgeons (\"The Bicentennial Man\" being a notable example). When robots are sophisticated enough to weigh alternatives, a robot may be programmed to accept the necessity of inflicting damage during surgery in order to prevent the greater harm that would result if the surgery were not carried out, or was carried out by a more fallible human surgeon. In \"Evidence\" Susan Calvin points out that a robot may even act as a prosecuting attorney because in the American justice system it is the jury which decides guilt or innocence, the judge who decides the sentence, and the executioner who carries through capital punishment.\n\nAsimov's Three Law robots (or Asenion) can experience irreversible mental collapse if they are forced into situations where they cannot obey the First Law, or if they discover they have unknowingly violated it. The first example of this failure mode occurs in the story \"Liar!\", which introduced the First Law itself, and introduces failure by dilemma – in this case the robot will hurt them if he tells them something and hurt them if he does not. This failure mode, which often ruins the positronic brain beyond repair, plays a significant role in Asimov's SF-mystery novel \"The Naked Sun\". Here Daneel describes activities contrary to one of the laws, but in support of another, as overloading some circuits in a robot's brain – the equivalent sensation to pain in humans. The example he uses is forcefully ordering a robot to do a task outside its normal parameters, one that it has been ordered to forgo in favor of a robot specialized to that task. \n\nIn \"The Robots of Dawn\", it is stated that more advanced robots are built capable of determining which action is more harmful, and even choosing at random if the alternatives are equally bad. As such, a robot is capable of taking an action which can be interpreted as following the First Law, and avoid a mental collapse. The whole plot of the story revolves around a robot which apparently was destroyed by such a mental collapse, and since his designer and creator refused to share the basic theory with others, he is, by definition, the only person capable of circumventing the safeguards and forcing the robot into a brain-destroying paradox.\n\nIn \"Robots and Empire\", Daneel states it's very unpleasant for him when making the proper decision takes too long (in robot terms), and he cannot imagine being without the Laws at all except to the extent of it being similar to that unpleasant sensation, only permanent.\n\nRobots and artificial intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise a means to do so. Robots already exist (for example, a Roomba) that are too simple to understand when they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, safety cages, or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence would be needed to do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints. However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation.\n\nIn a 2007 guest editorial in the journal \"Science\" on the topic of \"Robot Ethics\", SF author Robert J. Sawyer argues that since the U.S. military is a major source of funding for robotic research (and already uses armed unmanned aerial vehicles to kill enemies) it is unlikely such laws would be built into their designs. In a separate essay, Sawyer generalizes this argument to cover other industries stating:\n\nThe development of AI is a business, and businesses are notoriously uninterested in fundamental safeguards — especially philosophic ones. (A few quick examples: the tobacco industry, the automotive industry, the nuclear industry. Not one of these has said from the outset that fundamental safeguards are necessary, every one of them has resisted externally imposed safeguards, and none has accepted an absolute edict against ever causing harm to humans.)\n\nDavid Langford has suggested a tongue-in-cheek set of laws:\n\n\nRoger Clarke (aka Rodger Clarke) wrote a pair of papers analyzing the complications in implementing these laws in the event that systems were someday capable of employing them. He argued \"Asimov's Laws of Robotics have been a very successful literary device. Perhaps ironically, or perhaps because it was artistically appropriate, the sum of Asimov's stories disprove the contention that he began with: It is not possible to reliably constrain the behaviour of robots by devising and applying a set of rules.\" On the other hand, Asimov's later novels \"The Robots of Dawn\", \"Robots and Empire\" and \"Foundation and Earth\" imply that the robots inflicted their worst long-term harm by obeying the Three Laws perfectly well, thereby depriving humanity of inventive or risk-taking behaviour.\n\nIn March 2007 the South Korean government announced that later in the year it would issue a \"Robot Ethics Charter\" setting standards for both users and manufacturers. According to Park Hye-Young of the Ministry of Information and Communication the Charter may reflect Asimov's Three Laws, attempting to set ground rules for the future development of robotics.\n\nThe futurist Hans Moravec (a prominent figure in the transhumanist movement) proposed that the Laws of Robotics should be adapted to \"corporate intelligences\" — the corporations driven by AI and robotic manufacturing power which Moravec believes will arise in the near future. In contrast, the David Brin novel \"Foundation's Triumph\" (1999) suggests that the Three Laws may decay into obsolescence: Robots use the Zeroth Law to rationalize away the First Law and robots hide themselves from human beings so that the Second Law never comes into play. Brin even portrays R. Daneel Olivaw worrying that, should robots continue to reproduce themselves, the Three Laws would become an evolutionary handicap and natural selection would sweep the Laws away — Asimov's careful foundation undone by evolutionary computation. Although the robots would not be evolving through \"design\" instead of \"mutation\" because the robots would have to follow the Three Laws while designing and the prevalence of the laws would be ensured, design flaws or construction errors could functionally take the place of biological mutation.\n\nIn the July/August 2009 issue of \"IEEE Intelligent Systems\", Robin Murphy (Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M) and David D. Woods (director of the Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State) proposed \"The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics\" as a way to stimulate discussion about the role of responsibility and authority when designing not only a single robotic platform but the larger system in which the platform operates. The laws are as follows:\n\nWoods said, \"Our laws are little more realistic, and therefore a little more boring” and that \"The philosophy has been, ‘sure, people make mistakes, but robots will be better – a perfect version of ourselves.’ We wanted to write three new laws to get people thinking about the human-robot relationship in more realistic, grounded ways.\"\n\nIn October 2013, Alan Winfield suggested at an EUCog meeting a revised 5 laws that had been published, with commentary, by the EPSRC/AHRC working group in 2010.:\n\nAsimov himself believed that his Three Laws became the basis for a new view of robots which moved beyond the \"Frankenstein complex\". His view that robots are more than mechanical monsters eventually spread throughout science fiction. Stories written by other authors have depicted robots as if they obeyed the Three Laws but tradition dictates that only Asimov could quote the Laws explicitly. Asimov believed the Three Laws helped foster the rise of stories in which robots are \"lovable\" – \"Star Wars\" being his favorite example. Where the laws are quoted verbatim, such as in the \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\" episode \"Shgoratchx!\", it is not uncommon for Asimov to be mentioned in the same dialogue as can also be seen in the Aaron Stone pilot where an android states that it functions under Asimov's Three Laws. However, the 1960s German TV series \"Raumpatrouille – Die phantastischen Abenteuer des Raumschiffes Orion\" (\"Space Patrol – the Fantastic Adventures of Space Ship Orion\") bases episode three titled \"Hüter des Gesetzes\" (\"Guardians of the Law\") on Asimov's Three Laws without mentioning the source.\n\nReferences to the Three Laws have appeared in popular music (\"Robot\" from Hawkwind's 1979 album \"PXR5\"), cinema (\"Repo Man\", \"Aliens\", \"\"), cartoon series (\"The Simpsons\"), tabletop roleplaying games (Paranoia) and webcomics (\"Piled Higher and Deeper\" and \"Freefall\").\n\nRobby the Robot in \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956) has a hierarchical command structure which keeps him from harming humans, even when ordered to do so, as such orders cause a conflict and lock-up very much in the manner of Asimov's robots. Robby is one of the first cinematic depictions of a robot with internal safeguards put in place in this fashion. Asimov was delighted with Robby and noted that Robby appeared to be programmed to follow his Three Laws.\nIsaac Asimov's works have been adapted for cinema several times with varying degrees of critical and commercial success. Some of the more notable attempts have involved his \"Robot\" stories, including the Three Laws. The film \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999) features Robin Williams as the Three Laws robot NDR-114 (the serial number is partially a reference to Stanley Kubrick's signature numeral). Williams recites the Three Laws to his employers, the Martin family, aided by a holographic projection. However, the Laws were not the central focus of the film which only loosely follows the original story and has the second half introducing a love interest not present in Asimov's original short story.\n\nHarlan Ellison's proposed screenplay for \"I, Robot\" began by introducing the Three Laws, and issues growing from the Three Laws form a large part of the screenplay's plot development. This is only natural since Ellison's screenplay is one inspired by \"Citizen Kane\": a frame story surrounding four of Asimov's short-story plots and three taken from the book \"I, Robot\" itself. Ellison's adaptations of these four stories are relatively faithful although he magnifies Susan Calvin's role in two of them. Due to various complications in the Hollywood moviemaking system, to which Ellison's introduction devotes much invective, his screenplay was never filmed.\n\nIn the 1986 movie \"Aliens\", in a scene after the android Bishop accidentally cuts himself during the knife game, he attempts to reassure Ripley by stating that: \"It is impossible for me to harm or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being\". By contrast, in the 1979 movie from the same series, \"Alien\", the human crew of a starship infiltrated by a hostile alien are informed by the android Ash that his instructions are: \"Return alien life form, all other priorities rescinded\", illustrating how the laws governing behaviour around human safety can be rescinded by Executive Order.\n\nIn the 1987 film \"RoboCop\" and its sequels, the partially human main character has been programmed with three \"prime directives\" that he must obey without question. Even if different in letter and spirit they have some similarities with Asimov's Three Laws. They are:\n\nThese particular laws allow Robocop to harm a human being in order to protect another human, fulfilling his role as would a human law enforcement officer. The classified fourth directive keeps him from arresting any senior OCP officer, effectively putting OCP management above the law.\n\nThe plot of the film released in 2004 under the name, \"I, Robot\" is \"suggested by\" Asimov's robot fiction stories\nand advertising for the film included a trailer featuring the Three Laws followed by the aphorism, \"Rules were made to be broken\". The film opens with a recitation of the Three Laws and explores the implications of the Zeroth Law as a logical extrapolation. The major conflict of the film comes from a computer artificial intelligence, similar to the hivemind world Gaia in the \"Foundation\" series, reaching the conclusion that humanity is incapable of taking care of itself.\n\nPhilosopher James H. Moor says that if applied thoroughly they would produce unexpected results. He gives the example of a robot roaming the world trying to prevent harm from all humans.\n\nMarc Rotenberg, President and Executive Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Professor of information privacy law at Georgetown Law, argues that the Laws of Robotics should be expanded to include two new laws:\n\n\n\n"}

The foundation stone was placed on February 22, 1988, and the planetarium opened on November 1, 1989. The financial basis for building the planetarium was a 50,000,000 DKK donation by Bodil and Helge Petersen to the Urania foundation, which administered the construction of the planetarium.\n\nIn the Dome Theatre there are shows every day. Most are narrated to Danish, but it is possible to have English narration in headphones. During summertime there are normally a few shows in English every day.\n\nThe exhibition underwent a major renovation in 2017, and the new exhibition Made in Space opened in February 2018. The exhibition was made in collaboration with Tony-winning, London based designers, 59 Productions, and was made on a donation from the A.P. Møller Foundation. The exhibition is an interactive and including exhibition, telling the story of how all of the elements that make up a human originally came from space.\n\nThe Tycho Brahe Planetarium is home to the largest lunar rock that can be seen outside the US. Weighing more than 200 grams, it was brought back to Earth by the crew on the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.\n\nThere are also two smaller exhibitions.

The guides provide practical, clinician-friendly advice on all aspects of evidence-based medicine.\n\nDuring the late 1970s a group of clinical epidemiologists at McMaster University including Dr. David Sackett prepared a series of articles to assist clinicians interpreting clinical research. These articles, introducing the term \"critical appraisal\", appeared in the \"Canadian Medical Association Journal\" beginning in 1981.\n\nIn 1990 Dr. Gordon Guyatt introduced the term \"evidence-based medicine\" to stress the role of rigorous, systematic evidence from clinical research in conjunction with patients’ values and preferences in clinical decision-making. A group of academic physicians subsequently formed the international Evidence-based Medicine Working Group and published a 1992 article announcing the \"new paradigm\" of evidence-based medicine.\n\nThe Evidence-based Medicine Working Group decided to build on the popular series in the \"Canadian Medical Association Journal\" by creating a more practical approach to applying the medical literature to clinical practice. Championed by Dr. Drummond Rennie, an editor of the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\", the result was the \"Users' Guides\". The guides originally consisted of 25 topics, covered in a series of 32 articles published in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" between 1993 and 2000, describing approaches to different types of medical questions and the study designs that may answer them.\n\nThe complete list is as follows:\n\nBarratt, A. et al., 1999.

It focuses on three questions: 1. Whether new information is likely to be valid, 2. What the information says about patient care, and 3. How the information can be used. To demonstrate the clinical relevance of the suggested approach, each section begins with a practical clinical scenario. The chapter is then structured around identifying the best available evidence and applying the three key questions to the evidence, in the context of the clinical scenario. Each chapter concludes with a resolution of the scenario.\n\nMost of the book chapters are based on specific types of clinical questions, including questions of therapy, harm, diagnosis, and prognosis. Other chapters deal with general skills that are important for all clinical questions, such as “Finding the Evidence”, “Summarizing the Evidence”, and “Moving From Evidence to Action”.\n\nThe \"Users' Guides\" come in two book versions: the \"Essentials\" introduces the concepts of evidence-based medicine (EBM), with which every practicing clinician should be familiar, while the \"Manual\" provides a more comprehensive, in-depth exploration of EBM concepts for clinicians seeking a deeper understanding, or for those who wish to teach EBM.\n\nThe complete text of the second edition of the \"Users’ Guides Manual\" is available online by subscription. The JAMAevidence website also includes a large number of calculators, worksheets and additional aids for the practice of EBM, including the updated and edited collection of another long-running JAMA article series, \"The Rational Clinical Examination: Evidence-based Clinical Diagnosis\".\n\n"}
