In other words, it is a type of heuristic in which emotional response, or \"affect\" in psychological terms, plays a lead role. It is a subconscious process that shortens the decision-making process and allows people to function without having to complete an extensive search for information. It is shorter in duration than a mood, occurring rapidly and involuntarily in response to a stimulus. Reading the words \"lung cancer\" usually generates an affect of dread, while reading the words \"mother's love\" usually generates a feeling of affection and comfort. The affect heuristic is typically used while judging the risks and benefits of something, depending on the positive or negative feelings that people associate with a stimulus. It is the equivalent of \"going with your gut\". If their feelings towards an activity are positive, then people are more likely to judge the risks as low and the benefits high. On the other hand, if their feelings towards an activity are negative, they are more likely to perceive the risks as high and benefits low.\n\nThe theory of affect heuristic is that a human being's affect can influence how he or she makes decisions. Research has shown that risk and benefits are negatively correlated in people's minds. This was found after researchers found that the inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit of an activity was linked to the strength of positive or negative affect associated with the activity as measured by rating the activity on bipolar scales (e.g. good/bad). This implies that people base their judgements of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it, but also on how they feel about it. The affect heuristic gained early attention in 1980 when Robert B. Zajonc argued that affective reactions to stimuli are often the first reaction which occur automatically and subsequently influencing the way in which we process and judge information. The affect heuristic received more recent attention when it was used to explain the unexpected negative correlation between benefit and risk perception. Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic and Johnson theorized in 2000 that a good feeling towards a situation (i.e., positive affect) would lead to a lower risk perception and a higher benefit perception, even when this is logically not warranted for that situation. This implies that a strong emotional response to a word or other stimulus might alter a person's judgment. He or she might make different decisions based on the same set of facts and might thus make an illogical decision. Overall, the affect heuristic is of influence in nearly every decision-making arena.\n\nAn alternative thought to the “gut feeling” response is Antonio Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis. It is the opinion that thought is made largely from images which include perceptual and symbolic representations. These images then become “marked” by positive or negative feelings linked directly or indirectly to somatic states. When a negative somatic marker is linked to an image of a future outcome, it sounds an alarm in the brain. When a positive marker is linked to an image, it becomes a signal of incentive. He hypothesized that somatic markers increase the accuracy of the decision process and the absence of these markers, mostly seen in people with certain types of brain damage, degrades the ability to make good decisions. This hypothesis arose when observing patients with damage to their prefrontal cortex who had severe impairments in personal and social decision-making despite their other abilities.\n\nIt has been argued by researchers that people use affect heuristics as a first response to an issue, they rely on spontaneous affective reactions which make it more efficient than having to research and analyze external information. Slovic, Finucane, Peters and MacGregor (2005) contrast two modes of thinking: the analytic system and the experiential system. The analytic system, also referred to as the rational system, is thought that is considered to be slow and requires effort; it requires consciousness, probabilities, logical reasoning, and substantial evidence. The experiential system is the exact opposite. It is intuitive and mostly automatic which makes it more convenient for people because it does not require effort or consciousness. It relies on images, metaphors, and narratives which are then used to estimate the probability of a hazard. This is due to the experience of affect, in other words, a “gut feeling.” Affective reactions that accompany judgements are not necessarily voluntary, but are automatic responses. Zajonc states that “one might be able to control the expression of emotion, but not the experience of it itself.” However, he also clarifies that feelings are not free of thought and that thoughts are not free of feeling. The experiential system also takes past experiences into account. In other words, if a person has already experienced a certain issue, he or she is more likely to take more precautions towards the issue.\n\nMany studies have been done to further look into affect heuristics and many have found that these heuristics shape our attitudes and opinions towards our decisions, especially risk perception. These studies demonstrate how affect is an important characteristic of the decision-making process in many different domains and aspects as well as how it can lead to a strong conditioner of preference. As demonstrated below, affect is independent of cognition which indicate that there are conditions where affect does not require cognition.\n\nThe cause of affect does not necessarily have to be consciously perceived. A study conducted by Winkielman, Zajonc and Schwarz (1997) demonstrated the speed at which an affective reaction can influence judgements. To do this they used a subliminal priming paradigm where participants were \"primed\" through exposure to either a smiling face, a frowning face, or a neutral polygon presented at about of a second. This was considered an amount of time where the nature of the stimuli could not be recalled. Participants were then exposed to an ideograph (e.g. a Chinese character) for two seconds and asked to rate the ideograph on a scale of liking. Researchers found that participants preferred the ideograph preceded with a smiling face as opposed to those preceded by a frowning face or neutral polygon despite the fact that the smiling face was only shown for of a second.\n\nThe same experiment demonstrated the persistence of initial affect. During a second session, participations were primed with the same characters, but these characters were preceded by a different face that they were not previously exposed to (e.g. those previously exposed to the smiling face were now exposed to the neutral polygon). Participants continued to show preference for the characters based on the first association, even though the second exposure was preceded by a different affective stimulus. In other words, the second priming was ineffective because the effects of the first priming still remained. If the participant liked a character following exposure to a smiling face, they would continue to like the character even when it was preceded by a frowning face during the second exposure. (The experimental outcome was statistically significant and adjusted for variables such as non-affective preference for certain characters).\n\nSometimes affective responses to certain stimuli are a result of a lack of sensitivity to other factors, for example, numbers. Slovic and Peters (2006) did a study on psychophysical numbing, the inability to discriminate change in a physical stimulus as the magnitude of the stimulus increases, and found that students more strongly supported an airport-safety measure that was expected to save a high percentage of 150 lives at risk as opposed to a measure that was expected to save 150 lives. This is thought to have occurred because although saving 150 lives is good, it is somewhat harder to comprehend and thus the decision comes from the positive feeling associated with the higher percentage.\n\nResearch has been conducted in the influence that time plays in decision-making. In two experiments, Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic and Johnson (2000) studied the affect heuristic under time pressure and the influence that providing risk and benefit information has on the affect heuristic. The researchers compared individuals under no time pressure and those with time pressure. They predicted that individuals under time pressure would rely more heavily on their affect in order to be more efficient in their responses whereas those under no time pressure would use more logic in their decision-making. To do this, university students were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions (time pressure or no time pressure) and one of the two counterbalancing orders (risk judgements followed by benefit judgements or vice versa). They were then given a task in which they had to make judgements about the risk or benefit of certain activities and technologies. As predicted, individuals in the time-pressure condition took less time to make risk judgements than did individuals in the no time pressure condition. In the second experiment, students again had to make judgements about certain activities, but this time were given additional information about the risk and benefits. Information was framed as being high risk, low risk, high benefit or low benefit. The researchers found that this additional information did in fact influence their judgements.\n\nTwo similar studies were conducted by Wilson and Arvai in 2006, in which they also looked at the affect heuristic affects high and low risk options. These experiments examine the affect heuristic and the “evaluability hypothesis”, the joint evaluation when options are evaluated in a side-by-side comparison and separate evaluation where options are evaluated on their own. They take this concept and discuss how it relates to the affect heuristic by specifically looking at making traits of an option more or less meaningful in terms of the context of choice, more specifically, affect. To examine this relationship more closely, they conducted two experiments where participants received quantitative information about the nature of risks and were placed in one of two groups: \"affect-poor\" combined with high risks and \"affect-rich\" combined with low risks. In their first study, they looked how the influence of affect on evaluability in joint evaluations as compared to separate evaluations. To this, participants were asked to make choices about the \"affect-rich\" problem of crime and the \"affect-poor\" problem of deer overpopulation. Participants were asked to rate how they perceived crime and deer overpopulation by rating on a scale from \"very good\" to \"very bad.\" They found that participants ignored the quantitative information and focused on the affect characteristics.\n\nHealth campaigns often use “fear appeals” to grab the attention of their audience. Fear appeals are a type of advertising that specifically uses methods of creating anxiety in the consumer which results in the consumer wanting to cure this fear by purchasing the product. In a study by Averbeck, Jones, and Robertson (2011), researchers look at how prior knowledge influences one's response to fear appeals. Surveys were distributed which manipulated prior knowledge as low or high and two different topics: sleep deprivation or spinal meningitis. Various scale were used to test how prior knowledge affects certain health-related issues. Researchers found that individuals who had prior knowledge in a certain subject exhibited less fear and were least likely to fall prey to the affect heuristic as opposed to individuals that did not have prior knowledge who exhibited more fear and were more likely to fall prey.\n\nResearch has shown that Americans are aware of climate change, but do not consider it to be a serious problem due to the lack of an affective response. Many people report as not having experienced the consequences of climate change or that it is a long-term consequence that will not happen in the near future. Therefore, it is considered to be of lower priority and not much is done as a solution to global climate change.\n\nResearch on the affect heuristic had its origin in risk perception. Communicating risk is meant to improve the correspondence between the magnitude of the risk of an issue and the magnitude to which people respond to that risk. Affect, specifically negative affect, is an important method for increasing perceived risk considering its influences on perceived risk and thus has been utilized as essential for communicating risk to the public.\n\nRaising risk awareness is thought to be increased when risk information is presented in the form of frequences (e.g. “Within 40 years there is a 33% probability of flood”) or probabilities (e.g. “Each year there is a 1% probability of flood). This method is thought to evoke an affective response which then increases the availability of risk which results in greater perceived risk. This demonstrates how the way in which information is presented influences the way in which people interpret the information, more specifically, potential risks. Research also shows that people's financial risk taking is affected by their emotional state,\n\nResearchers have looked at the affective and experiential modes of thinking in terms of cancer prevention. Research has shown that affect plays a significant role in whether people choose to get screened for certain types of cancer. Current research is now looking into how to communicate the risks and benefits of cancer prevention and treatment options. So far research has shown that the way in which information is framed does play a role in the way in which the information is interpreted. Research has also shown that treatment options may not have significant meaning to patients unless it has an affective connection. It is for this reason that researchers are looking into using affective coding such as icon arrays to make numerical information easier to understand and process.\n\nResearch has been done on how smiling can cause affective responses and thus influence our opinions of others. An experiment by LaFrance and Hecht (1995) investigated whether a smiling target would elicit more leniency than those that do not. Participants judged a case of potential academic misconduct and were asked to rate a list of subjects. Materials included photos of a female target either showing a neutral expression, felt smile, false smile, or miserable smile. Researchers found that the student pictured as smiling received less punishment than did the student who did not smile despite the fact that the smiling student was not seen as less guilty. They did not find a significant difference between the different smiles. Smiling students were also rated as more trustworthy, honest, genuine, good, obedient, sincere, and admirable compared to the student that did not smile.\n\nResearchers have studied how one's memory load increases one's chances of using the affect heuristic. In a study by Stiv and Fedorikhin (1999), participants were asked to either memorize a two-digit number (low cognitive demand) or a seven-digit number (high cognitive demand). Participants were then asked to enter another room where they would report their number. On the way there, they were asked for their preference for two snacks: chocolate cake (more favorable affect, less favorable cognition) or fruit salad (less favorable affect, more favorable cognition). Researchers predicted that participants given the seven-digits to remember (high cognitive load) would reduce their deliberation process due to having to remember a large amount of information. This would increase the chances of these participants choosing the cake over the fruit salad due to it being the more affectively favorable option. This hypothesis proved true with participants choosing the chocolate cake 63% of the time when given a high cognitive load and only 41% when given a low cognitive load. In the same study they also tested the impulsiveness of the participants in moderating the effects of processing-resources of choice and at the time they were asked for their preference for the two snacks high cognitive demand chose the chocolate cake 84.2%. This provides evidence that people's decisions can be influenced by affect heuristic in a relatively spontaneous manner from the stimulus, with little involvement of higher-order cognitive demand.\n\nAnother common situation involving affect heuristic is where a strong, emotional first impression can inform a decision, even if subsequent evidence weight cognitively against the original decision made. In a study by Sherman, Kim and Zajonc (1998), they investigated how long the induced effects of an affective response could last. Participants were asked to study Chinese characters and their English meanings. Half of the meanings were positive (e.g. beauty) and the other half negative (e.g. disease). Participants were then tested on these meanings, which was followed by a task in which they were given pairs of characters and asked to choose which character they preferred. Researchers found that participants preferred the character with a positive meaning.\n\nIn the same experiment, participants were given a new task where the characters were presented with a neutral meaning (e.g. linen) and participants were told that these were the true meanings of the character. The testing procedure was the same and despite exposing participants with the new meanings, their preferences in characters remained the same. Characters that were paired with positive meanings continued to be preferred.\n\nWhile heuristics can be helpful in many situations, it can also lead to biases which can result in poor decision-making habits. Like other heuristics, it can provide efficient and adaptive responses, but relying on affect can also cause decisions to be misleading.\n\nStudies have looked at how the affect influences smoking behavior. Smokers tend to act experientially in the sense that they give little conscious thought to the risks before they start. It is usually as a result of affective responses in the moment that occur when seeing others partake in the behavior. Epstein (1995) found that there has been quite a bit of manipulation of consumers when it comes to packaging and marketing products. This is especially the case with tobacco companies. Research has shown that cigarette advertisements were designed to increase the positive affect associated with smoking and decrease the perceptions of risk. Therefore, seeing this advertisement could lead people astray to start smoking because of its induced appeal. In a study by Slovic et al. (2005), he released a survey to smokers in which he asked “If you had it to do all over again, would you start smoking?” and more than 85% of adult smokers and about 80% of young smokers (between the ages of 14-22) answered “No.” He found that most smokers, especially those that start at a younger age, do not take the time and think about how their future selves will perceive the risks associated with smoking. Essentially, smokers give little conscious thought to smoking before they start and it is usually after they have started smoking and have become addicted that they learn new information about health risk.\n\n"}

The word \"angst\" was introduced into English from the Danish, Norwegian, and Dutch word \"angst\" and the German word \"Angst\". It is attested since the 19th century in English translations of the works of Kierkegaard and Freud. It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety, or inner turmoil.\n\nIn other languages, having the meaning of the Latin word \"pavor\" for \"fear\", the derived words differ in meaning; for example, as in the French \"anxiété\" and \"peur\". The word \"angst\" has existed since the 8th century, from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*anghu-\", \"restraint\" from which Old High German \"angust\" developed. It is pre-cognate with the Latin \"angustia\", \"tensity, tightness\" and \"angor\", \"choking, clogging\"; compare to the Ancient Greek ἄγχω (\"ankho\") \"strangle\".\n\nIn Existentialist philosophy, the term \"angst\" carries a specific conceptual meaning. The use of the term was first attributed to Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855). In \"The Concept of Anxiety\" (also known as \"The Concept of Dread\", depending on the translation), Kierkegaard used the word \"Angest\" (in common Danish, \"angst\", meaning \"dread\" or \"anxiety\") to describe a profound and deep-seated condition. Where non-human animals are guided solely by instinct, said Kierkegaard, human beings enjoy a freedom of choice that we find both appealing and terrifying. It is the anxiety of understanding of being free when considering undefined possibilities of one's life and one's power of choice over them. Kierkegaard's concept of angst reappeared in the works of existentialist philosophers who followed, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Martin Heidegger, each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways. While Kierkegaard's angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a religious personal belief system, later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles, cultural norms, and existential despair.\nExistential angst makes its appearance in classical musical composition in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war-torn times. Notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss (operas \"Elektra\" and \"Salome\"), Claude-Achille Debussy (opera \"Pelleas et Melisande\", ballet \"Jeux\", other works), Jean Sibelius (especially the Fourth Symphony), Arnold Schoenberg \"(A Survivor from Warsaw\", other works), Alban Berg, Francis Poulenc (opera \"Dialogues of the Carmelites\"), Dmitri Shostakovich (opera \"Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District\", symphonies and chamber music), Béla Bartók (opera \"Bluebeard's Castle\", other works), and Krzysztof Penderecki (especially \"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima\").\nAngst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid- to late 1950s amid widespread concerns over international tensions and nuclear proliferation. Jeff Nuttall's book \"Bomb Culture\" (1968) traced angst in popular culture to Hiroshima. Dread was expressed in works of folk rock such as Bob Dylan's \"Masters of War\" (1963) and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\". The term often makes an appearance in reference to punk rock, grunge, nu metal, and works of emo where expressions of melancholy, existential despair, or nihilism predominate.\n"}

Born and his co-workers expanded his principle to a framework that is also known as reciprocity theory.\n\nBorn noticed a symmetry among configuration space and momentum space representations of a free particle, in that its wave function description is invariant to a change of variables \"x\" → \"p\" and \"p\" → −\"x\". (It can also be worded such as to include scale factors, e.g. invariance to \"x\" → \"ap\" and \"p\" → −\"bx\" where \"a\", \"b\" are constants.) Born hypothesized that such symmetry should apply to the four-vectors of special relativity, that is, to the four-vector space coordinates\n\nand the four-vector momentum (four-momentum) coordinates\nBoth in classical and in quantum mechanics, the Born reciprocity conjecture postulates that the transformation \"x\" → \"p\" and \"p\" → −\"x\" leaves invariant the Hamilton equations:\n\nFrom his reciprocity approach, Max Born conjectured the invariance of a space-time-momentum-energy line element. Born and H.S. Green similarly introduced the notion an invariant (quantum) metric operator formula_5 as extension of the Minkowski metric of special relativity to an invariant metric on phase space coordinates. The metric is invariant under the group of quaplectic transformations.\n\nSuch a reciprocity as called for by Born can be observed in much, but not all, of the formalism of classical and quantum physics. Born's reciprocity theory was not developed much further for reason of difficulties in the mathematical foundations of the theory.\n\nHowever Born's idea of a quantum metric operator was later taken up by Hideki Yukawa when developing his nonlocal quantum theory in the 1950s. In 1981, Eduardo R. Caianiello proposed a \"maximal acceleration\", similarly as there is a minimal length at Planck scale, and this concept of maximal acceleration has been expanded upon by others. It has also been suggested that Born reciprocity may be the underlying physical reason for the T-duality symmetry in string theory, and that Born reciprocity may be of relevance to developing a quantum geometry.\n\nBorn chose the term \"reciprocity\" for the reason that in a crystal lattice, the motion of a particle can be described in \"p\"-space by means of the reciprocal lattice.\n\n"}
{"id": "4112038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4112038", "title": "Command responsibility", "text": "Command responsibility\n\nCommand responsibility, sometimes referred to as the Yamashita standard or the Medina standard, and also known as superior responsibility, is the legal doctrine of hierarchical accountability for war crimes.\n\nThe term may also be used more broadly to refer to the duty to supervise subordinates, and liability for the failure to do so, both in government, military law, and with regard to corporations and trusts.\n\nThe doctrine of \"command responsibility\" was established by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, partly based on the American Lieber code, a war manual for the Union forces signed by President Abraham Lincoln 1863, and was applied for the first time by the German Supreme Court at the Leipzig War Crimes Trials after World War I, in the 1921 trial of Emil Müller.\n\nThe United States of America confirmed and incorporated the mentioned 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions on \"command responsibility\" into United States federal law through the precedent set by the United States Supreme Court (called the \"Yamashita standard\") in the case of Japanese General Tomoyuki Yamashita. He was prosecuted in 1945 for atrocities committed by troops under his command in the Philippines, in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Yamashita was charged with \"unlawfully disregarding and failing to discharge his duty as a commander to control the acts of members of his command by permitting them to commit war crimes.\"\n\nFurthermore, the so-called \"Medina standard\" clarified the U.S. law to clearly also encompass U.S officers, so that those as well as foreign officers such as General Yamashita can be prosecuted in the United States. The \"Medina standard\" is based upon the 1971 prosecution of U.S. Army Captain Ernest Medina in connection with the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. It holds that a U.S. commanding officer, being aware of a human rights violation or a war crime, will be held criminally liable if he does not take action. However, Medina was acquitted of all charges.\n\nIn \"The Art of War\", written during the 6th century BC, Sun Tzu argued that it was a commander's duty to ensure that his subordinates conducted themselves in a civilised manner during an armed conflict. Similarly, in the Bible (Kings 1: Chapter 21), within the story of Ahab and the killing of Naboth, King Ahab was blamed for the killing of Naboth on orders from Queen Jezebel, because Ahab (as king) is responsible for everyone in his kingdom.\n\nThe trial of Peter von Hagenbach by an ad hoc tribunal of the Holy Roman Empire in 1474, was the first \"international\" recognition of commanders' obligations to act lawfully. Hagenbach was put on trial for atrocities committed during the occupation of Breisach, found guilty of war crimes and beheaded. Since he was convicted for crimes \"he as a knight was deemed to have a duty to prevent\" Hagenbach defended himself by arguing that he was only following orders from the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, to whom the Holy Roman Empire had given Breisach. Despite the fact there was no explicit use of a doctrine of \"command responsibility\" it is seen as the first trial based on this principle.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the concept developed further, as is seen in the \"Lieber Code\". This regulated accountability by imposing criminal responsibility on commanders for ordering or encouraging soldiers to wound or kill already disabled enemies. Article 71 of the Lieber Code provided that:\n\nWhoever intentionally inflicts additional wounds on an enemy already wholly disabled, or kills such an enemy, or \"who orders or encourages soldiers to do so\", shall suffer death, if duly convicted, whether he belongs to the Army of the United States, or is an enemy captured after having committed his misdeed.\nThe Hague Convention of 1899 was the first attempt at codifying the principle of command responsibility on a multinational level and was reaffirmed and updated entirely by the Hague Convention of 1907. The doctrine was specifically found within \"Laws and Customs of War on Land\" (Hague IV); October 18, 1907: \"Section I on Belligerents: Chapter I The Qualifications of Belligerents\", \"Section III Military Authority over the territory of the hostile State\", and \"Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention\" (Hague X); October 18, 1907. Article 1 of Section I of the 1907 Hague IV stated that: \n\nThe laws, rights, and duties of war apply not only to armies, but also to militia and volunteer corps fulfilling the following conditions: \nAnother example of command responsibility is shown in Article 43 of Section III of the same convention which stipulated that: \n\nThe authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.\nIn \"Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention\" (Hague X), Article 19 stated that:\n\nThe commanders in chief of the belligerent fleets must arrange for the details of carrying out the preceding articles, as well as for cases not covered thereby, in accordance with the instructions of their respective Governments and in conformity with the general principles of the present Convention.\nWhile the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 does not explicitly create a doctrine of command responsibility, it does uphold a notion that a superior must account for their actions of his subordinates. It also suggests that military superiors have a duty to ensure that their troops act in accordance with international law and if they fail to command them lawfully, their respective states may be held criminally liable. In turn, those states may choose to punish their commanders. At such, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 has been viewed as a foundational root of modern doctrine of command responsibility. After World War I, the Allied Powers' Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on the Enforcement of Penalties recommended the establishment of an international tribunal, which would try individuals for \"order[ing], or, with knowledge thereof and with power to intervene, abstain[ing] from preventing or taking measures to prevent, putting an end to or repressing, violations of the laws or customs of war.\"\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, private contractors have become more prevalent in zones of conflict. Both political and legal scholars highlight the multiple challenges this has introduced when tracing the responsibility of crimes in the field. Some, such as Martha Lizabeth Phelps, go as far to claim that if hired contractors are indistinguishable from national troops, the contractors borrow the state's legitimacy. The command responsibility of actions in warfare become increasingly unclear when actors are viewed as being part of a state's force, but are, in truth, private actors.\n\nCommand responsibility is an omission mode of individual criminal liability: the superior is responsible for crimes committed by his subordinates and for failing to prevent or punish (as opposed to crimes he ordered). \"In re Yamashita\" before a United States military commission in 1945, General Yamashita became the first to be charged solely on the basis of responsibility for an omission. He was commanding the 14th Area Army of Japan in the Philippines during the Pacific Theater of World War II when some of the Japanese troops engaged in atrocities against thousands of civilians and prisoners of war. As commanding officer, he was charged with \"unlawfully disregarding and failing to discharge his duty as a commander to control the acts of members of his command by permitting them to commit war crimes.\"\n\nBy finding Yamashita guilty, the Commission adopted a new standard, stating that where \"vengeful actions are widespread offenses and there is no effective attempt by a commander to discover and control the criminal acts, such a commander may be held responsible, even criminally liable.\" However, the ambiguous wording resulted in a long-standing debate about the amount of knowledge required to establish command responsibility. The matter was appealed, and was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in 1946. After sentencing, Yamashita was executed.\n\nFollowing \"In re Yamashita\", courts clearly accepted that a commander's actual knowledge of unlawful actions is sufficient to impose individual criminal responsibility.\n\nIn the \"High Command Case\" (1947–8), the U.S. military tribunal argued that in order for a commander to be criminally liable for the actions of his subordinates \"there must be a personal dereliction\" which \"can only occur where the act is directly traceable to him or where his failure to properly supervise his subordinates constitutes criminal negligence on his part\" based upon \"a wanton, immoral disregard of the action of his subordinates amounting to acquiescence\".\n\nIn the \"Hostage Case\" (1947–8), the U.S. military tribunal seemed to limit the situations where a commander has a duty to know to instances where he has already had some information regarding subordinates' unlawful actions.\n\nAfter World War II, the parameters of command responsibility were thus increased, imposing liability on commanders for their failure to prevent the commission of crimes by their subordinates. These cases – the latter two part of the Nürnberg tribunals – discussed explicitly the requisite standard of \"mens rea\", and were unanimous in finding that a lesser level of knowledge than actual knowledge may be sufficient.\n\nThe first international treaty to comprehensively codify the doctrine of command responsibility was the Additional Protocol I (\"AP I\") of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Article 86(2) states that:\n\nArticle 87 obliges a commander to \"prevent and, where necessary, to suppress and report to competent authorities\" any violation of the Conventions and of AP I.\n\nIn Article 86(2) for the first time a provision would \"explicitly address the knowledge factor of command responsibility\".\n\nIn the discussion regarding \"command responsibility\" the term \"command\" can be defined as\n\nA. De jure (legal) command, which can be both military and civilian. The determining factor here is not rank but subordination. Four structures are identified:\nInternational case law has developed two special types of \"de jure commanders.\"\n\nB. De facto (factual) command, which specifies effective control, as opposed to formal rank. This needs a superior-subordinate relationship. Indicia are:\n\nAdditional Protocol I and the Statutes of the ICTY, the ICTR, and the ICC makes prevention or prosecution of crimes mandatory.\n\nFollowing World War II, communis opinio was that the atrocities committed by the Nazis were so severe a special tribunal had to be held. However, contemporary jurists such as Harlan Fiske Stone criticized the Nuremberg Trials as victor's justice. The Nuremberg Charter determined the basis to prosecute people for:\n\nThe jurisdiction ratione personae is considered to apply to \"leaders, organisers, instigators and accomplices\" involved in planning and committing those crimes.\n\nThe ICTY statute article 7 (3) establishes that the fact that crimes \"were committed by a subordinate does not relieve his superior of criminal responsibility if he knew or had reason to know that the subordinate was about to commit such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish the perpetrators.\"\n\nIn The Prosecutor v. Delalić et al. (\"the Čelebići case\") first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that \"had reason to know\" (article 7(3)) means that a commander must have \"had in his possession information of a nature, which at the least, would put him on notice of the risk of ... offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether ... crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates.\"\n\nIn The Prosecutor v. Blaškić (\"the Blaškić case\") this view was corroborated. However, it differed regarding \"mens rea\" required by AP I. The Blaškić Trial Chamber concluded that \"had reason to know\", as defined by the ICTY Statute, also imposes a stricter \"should have known\" standard of \"mens rea\".\n\nThe conflicting views of both cases were addressed by the Appeals Chambers in Čelebići and in a separate decision in Blaškić. Both rulings hold that some information of unlawfal acts by subordinates must be available to the commander following which he did not, or inadequately, discipline the perpetrator.\n\nThe concept of command responsibility has developed significantly in the jurisprudence of the ICTY. One of the most recent judgements that extensively deals with the subject is the Halilović judgement of 16 November 2005 (para. 22-100).\n\nThe United Nations Security Council Resolution 955 (1994) set up an international criminal tribunal to judge people responsible for the Rwandan Genocide and other serious violations of international law in Rwanda, or by Rwandan citizens in nearby states, between 1 January and 31 December 1994; additional later resolutions expanded the scope and timeline of the tribunal. The tribunal has jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.\n\nThe judgement against Jean-Paul Akayesu established rape as a war crime. Rape was placed in line with \"other acts of serious bodily and mental harm\" rather than the historical view of rape as \"a trophy of war.\" Akayesu was held responsible for his actions and non-actions as mayor and police commander of a commune in which many Tutsis were killed, raped, tortured, and otherwise persecuted.\n\nAnother case prosecuted persons in charge of a radio station and a newspaper that incited and then encouraged the Rwandan genocide. The defendants were charged with genocide, incitement to genocide, and crimes against humanity for their positions of control and command in the \"hate media,\" although they physically had not committed the acts.\n\nFollowing several ad hoc tribunals, the international community decided on a comprehensive court of justice for future crimes against humanity. This resulted in the International Criminal Court, which identified four categories.\n\nArticle 28 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court codified the doctrine of command responsibility. With Article 28(a) military commanders are imposed with individual responsibility for crimes committed by forces under their effective command and control if they:\n\nIt uses the stricter \"should have known\" standard of mens rea, instead of \"had reason to know,\" as defined by the ICTY Statute.\n\nThe Bush administration has adopted the American Servicemembers' Protection Act and entered in Article 98 agreements in an attempt to protect any US citizen from appearing before this court. As such it interferes with implementing the command responsibility principle when applicable to US citizens.\n\nA number of commentators have advanced the argument that the principle of \"command responsibility\" could make high-ranking officials within the Bush administration guilty of war crimes committed either with their knowledge or by persons under their control.\n\nAs a reaction to the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. government adopted several controversial measures (e.g., asserting \"unlawful combatant\" status and \"enhanced interrogation methods\").\n\nAlberto Gonzales and others argued that detainees should be considered \"unlawful combatants\" and as such not be protected by the Geneva Conventions in multiple memoranda regarding these perceived legal gray areas.\n\nGonzales' statement that denying coverage under the Geneva Conventions \"substantially reduces the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the War Crimes Act\" suggests, at the least, an awareness by those involved in crafting policies in this area that U.S. officials are involved in acts that could be seen to be war crimes. The U.S. Supreme Court overruled the premise on which this argument is based in \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\", in which it ruled that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applies to detainees in Guantanamo Bay, and that the Guantanamo military commission used to try these suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law because it was not created by Congress.\n\nOn April 14, 2006, Human Rights Watch said that Secretary Donald Rumsfeld could be criminally liable for his alleged involvement in the abuse of Mohammad al-Qahtani. Dave Lindorff contends that by ignoring the Geneva Conventions. the U.S. administration, including President Bush, as Commander-in-Chief, is culpable for war crimes. In addition, former chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg Trials Benjamin Ferencz has called the invasion of Iraq a \"clear breach of law\", and as such it constitutes a crime against peace. On November 14, 2006, invoking universal jurisdiction, legal proceedings were started in Germany - for their alleged involvement of prisoner abuse - against Donald Rumsfeld, Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo, George Tenet and others. This allegedly prompted recently retired Donald Rumsfeld to cancel a planned visit to Germany.\n\nFormer Army Lt. Ehren Watada refused to be deployed to Iraq based on his claims of command responsibility. Although his own deployment was not ordered until after Security Council Resolution 1511 authorized a multinational force in Iraq, Watada argued that the invasion of Iraq was illegal, and as such he claimed he was bound by command responsibility to refuse to take part in an illegal war. He was discharged from the Army in 2009.\n\nThe Military Commissions Act of 2006 is seen as an amnesty law for crimes committed in the War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act and by abolishing habeas corpus, effectively making it impossible for detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.\n\nLuis Moreno-Ocampo told \"The Sunday Telegraph\" that he is willing to start an inquiry by the International Criminal Court (ICC), and possibly a trial, for war crimes committed in Iraq involving British Prime Minister Tony Blair and American President George W. Bush, even though under the Rome Statute the ICC has no jurisdiction over Bush, since the United States is not a State Party to the relevant treaty—unless Bush were accused of crimes inside a State Party, or the UN Security Council (where the United States has a veto) requested an investigation. However, Blair does fall under ICC jurisdiction as Britain is a State Party.\n\nNat Hentoff wrote on August 28, 2007, that a leaked report by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the July 2007 report by Human Rights First and Physicians for Social Responsibility, titled Leave No Marks: Enhanced Interrogation Techniques and the Risk of Criminality, might be used as evidence of American war crimes if there was a Nuremberg-like trial regarding the War on Terror.\n\nShortly before the end of President Bush's second term, newsmedia in other countries started opining that under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the United States is obligated to hold those responsible for prisoner abuse to account under criminal law. One proponent of this view was the United Nations special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Professor Manfred Nowak) who, on January 20, 2009, remarked on German television that former president George W. Bush had lost his head of state immunity and under international law, the United States would now be mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in these violations of the UN Convention Against Torture. Law professor Dietmar Herz explained Nowak's comments by saying that under U.S. and international law former President Bush is criminally responsible for adopting torture as an interrogation tool.\n\nHuman Rights Watch commented on this conflict by stating that:\n\nThe Sunday Times in March 2006, and the Sudan Tribune in March 2008, reported that the UN Panel of Experts determined that Salah Gosh and Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein\n\nFollowing an inquiry by the United Nations, regarding allegations of involvement of the Government in genocide, the dossier was referred to the International Criminal Court. On May 2, 2007, the ICC issued arrest warrants for militia leader Ali Muhammad al-Abd al-Rahman, of the Janjaweed, a.k.a. Ali Kushayb, and Ahmad Muhammad Haroun for crimes against humanity and war crimes. To this day Sudan has refused to comply with the arrest warrants and has not turned them over to the ICC.\n\nThe International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, announced on July 14, 2008, ten criminal charges against President Omar al-Bashir, accusing him of sponsoring war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. The ICC's prosecutors have charged al-Bashir with genocide because he \"masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part\" three tribal groups in Darfur because of their ethnicity. The ICC's prosecutor for Darfur, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, is expected within months to ask a panel of ICC judges to issue an arrest warrant for Bashir.\n\nFor his conduct as President of Zimbabwe, including allegations of torture and murder of political opponents, it is suggested Robert Mugabe may be prosecuted using this doctrine. Because Zimbabwe has not subscribed to the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction it may be authorised by the United Nations Security Council. The precedent for this was set by its referral to bring indictments relating to the crimes committed in Darfur. Otherwise, a Zimbabwean regime following Mugabe's would have jurisdiction over his alleged crimes (in the absence of any amnesty law) as would the numerous countries with universal jurisdiction over torture, including the UK.\n\n"}

In contrast, DM proposes a deeper understanding and sophisticated manipulation of matter by directly using rigorous mathematics as complete volumetric descriptions of real objects. By utilizing technologies such as Function representation (FRep) it becomes possible to compactly describe and understand the surface and internal structures or properties of an object at an infinite resolution. Thus models can accurately represent matter across all scales making it possible to capture the complexity and quality of natural and real objects and ideally suited for digital fabrication and other kinds of real world interactions.

Several religious and ethnic religious groups are traditionally more endogamous, although sometimes with the added dimension of requiring marital religious conversion. This permits an exogamous marriage, as the convert, by accepting the partner's religion, becomes accepted within the endogamous rules. The effects of endogamy, separate from consanguinity, are transmission of genetic disorders, the so called Founder effect.\n\nEndogamy can serve as a form of self-segregation; a community can use it to resist integrating and completely merging with surrounding populations. Minorities can use it to stay ethnically homogeneous over a long time as distinct communities within societies with other practices and beliefs.\n\nThe isolationist practices of endogamy may lead to a group's extinction, as genetic diseases may develop that can affect a larger percentage of the population. However, this disease effect would tend to be small unless there is a high degree of close inbreeding, or if the endogamous population becomes very small in size.\n\nThe Urapmin, a small tribe in Papua New Guinea, practice strict endogamy.

{"id": "4669030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4669030", "title": "Exclusion zone", "text": "Exclusion zone\n\nAn exclusion zone is a territorial division established for various case specific purposes. \n\nPer the United States Department of Defense, an exclusion zone is a territory where sanctioning body prohibits specific activities in a specific geographic area (see Military exclusion zone). These zones are created for control of populations for safety, crowd control, or military purposes, or as a border zone, and they may be temporary or permanent.\n\nLarge-scale geographic exclusion zones have been established after major disasters in which nuclear power plants went into meltdown:\n\n\nBorder zones are areas where movement, property ownership or other activity is prohibited or restricted by legislation. Unlike regular territory, border zones are under administrative control of the border authorities. Entrance is generally only with an individual permit. Entering a border zone without authorization is a crime or misdemeanor and grounds for arrest. Border zones are instituted to pinpoint illegal intruders, conceal and obscure and prevent interference with border security procedures and equipment, and thus aid border guards with their work. For example, Russia maintains sizable border zones.\n\nSimilarly, exclusion zones have been established due to natural disasters. There is an exclusion zone on the island of Montserrat, where the long-dormant Soufrière Hills volcano started erupting in 1995 and has continued erupting since. It encompasses the south part of the island, accounting for over half of its land mass and most areas of the island which were populated before the volcano erupted. The volcano destroyed the island's urban center and capital Plymouth, as well as many other villages and neighborhoods. The zone is now strictly enforced; entry into most of the destroyed areas is prohibited, while some areas are subject to restrictions during volcanic activity or open only as a \"daytime entry zone\".\n\nExclusion zones are commonly used in the construction industry worldwide. For this purpose they are defined locations to prohibit the entry of personnel in to danger areas, established through the risk assessment process for a construction activity. Typically, exclusion zones are set up and maintained around plant and below work at height.\n\nWith regard to protesting, an exclusion zone is an area that protesters are legally prohibited from protesting in.\n\nExclusion zones often exist around seats of government and abortion clinics. As a result of protests by the Westboro Baptist Church at the funerals of soldiers killed in the Iraq War, 29 states and the US Congress created exclusion zones around soldiers' funerals. In 2005, the Parliament of the United Kingdom created a one kilometre exclusion zone around itself.\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \"Congress shall make no law... abridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" The existence of exclusion zones is based on court rulings that allow the government to regulate the time, place, and manner of protests.\n\nAn exclusion zone is related to a free speech zone. Protesters are required to picket in a free speech zone, thus rendering the area around the free speech zone to be an exclusion zone.\n\nWhen a restraining order is issued, an exclusion zone is an area that the respondent is prohibited from entering—often an area surrounding the petitioner's residence or workplace. For example, if a Wisconsin harassment restraining order or domestic abuse restraining order is violated, the court may order GPS monitoring of the respondent. If the exclusion zone is entered, in violation of the order, the GPS technology is used to notify law enforcement and the petitioner.\n\n"}
{"id": "2785756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2785756", "title": "Extinction (psychology)", "text": "Extinction (psychology)\n\nExtinction is observed in both operantly conditioned and classically conditioned behavior. When operant behavior that has been previously reinforced no longer produces reinforcing consequences the behavior gradually stops occurring. In classical conditioning, when a conditioned stimulus is presented alone, so that it no longer predicts the coming of the unconditioned stimulus, conditioned responding gradually stops. For example, after Pavlov's dog was conditioned to salivate at the sound of a metronome, it eventually stopped salivating to the metronome after the metronome had been sounded repeatedly but no food came. Many anxiety disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder are believed to reflect, at least in part, a failure to extinguish conditioned fear.\nThe dominant account of extinction involves associative models. However, there is debate over whether extinction involves simply \"unlearning\" the unconditional stimulus (US) – Conditional stimulus (CS) association (e.g., the Rescorla–Wagner account) or, alternatively, a \"new learning\" of an inhibitory association that masks the original excitatory association (e.g., Konorski, Pearce and Hall account). A third account concerns non-associative mechanisms such as habituation, modulation and response fatigue. Myers and Davis laboratory work with fear extinction in rodents has suggested that multiple mechanisms may be at work depending on the timing and circumstances in which the extinction occurs.\n\nGiven the competing views and difficult observations for the various accounts researchers have turned to investigations at the cellular level (most often in rodents) to tease apart the specific brain mechanisms of extinction, in particular the role of the brain structures (amygdala, hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex), and specific neurotransmitter systems (e.g., GABA, NMDA). A recent study in rodents by Amano, Unal and Paré published in \"Nature Neuroscience\" found that extinction of a conditioned fear response is correlated with synaptic inhibition in the fear output neurons of the central amygdala that project to the periaqueductal gray that controls freezing behavior. They infer that inhibition derives from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and suggest promising targets at the cellular level for new treatments of anxiety.\n\nIn the operant conditioning paradigm, extinction refers to the process of no longer providing the reinforcement that has been maintaining a behavior. Operant extinction differs from forgetting in that the latter refers to a decrease in the strength of a behavior over time when it has not been emitted. For example, a child who climbs under his desk, a response which has been reinforced by attention, is subsequently ignored until the attention-seeking behavior no longer occurs. In his autobiography, B.F. Skinner noted how he accidentally discovered the extinction of an operant response due to the malfunction of his laboratory equipment:\nWhen the extinction of a response has occurred, the discriminative stimulus is then known as an extinction stimulus (SΔ or \"S-delta\"). When an S-delta is present, the reinforcing consequence which characteristically follows a behavior does not occur. This is the opposite of a discriminative stimulus which is a signal that reinforcement will occur. For instance, in an operant chamber, if food pellets are only delivered when a response is emitted in the presence of a green light, the green light is a discriminative stimulus. If when a red light is present food will not be delivered, then the red light is an extinction stimulus (food here is used as an example of a reinforcer).\nHowever, some make the distinction between extinction stimuli and \"S-Delta\" due to the behavior not having a reinforcement history, i.e. in an array of three items (phone, pen, paper) \"Which one is the phone\" the \"pen\" and \"paper\" will not produce a response in the teacher but is not technically extinction on the first trial due to selecting \"pen\" or \"paper\" missing a reinforcement history. This still would be considered as S-Delta. \n\nIn order for extinction to work effectively, it must be done consistently. Extinction is considered successful when responding in the presence of an extinction stimulus (a red light or a teacher not giving a bad student attention, for instance) is zero. When a behavior reappears again after it has gone through extinction, it is called resurgence.\n\nWhile extinction, when implemented consistently over time, results in the eventual decrease of the undesired behavior, in the short term the subject might exhibit what is called an \"extinction burst\". An extinction burst will often occur when the extinction procedure has just begun. This usually consists of a sudden and temporary \"increase\" in the response's frequency, followed by the eventual decline and extinction of the behavior targeted for elimination. Novel behavior, or emotional responses or aggressive behavior, may also occur.\n\nTake, as an example, a pigeon that has been reinforced to peck an electronic button. During its training history, every time the pigeon pecked the button, it will have received a small amount of bird seed as a reinforcer. So, whenever the bird is hungry, it will peck the button to receive food. However, if the button were to be turned off, the hungry pigeon will first try pecking the button just as it has in the past. When no food is forthcoming, the bird will likely try again ... and again, and again. After a period of frantic activity, in which their pecking behavior yields no result, the pigeon's pecking will decrease in frequency.\n\nAlthough not explained by reinforcement theory, the extinction burst can be understood using control theory. In perceptual control theory, the degree of output involved in any action is proportional to the discrepancy between the reference value (desired rate of reward in the operant paradigm) and the current input. Thus, when reward is removed, the discrepancy increases, and the output is increased. In the long term, 'reorganisation', the learning algorithm of control theory, would adapt the control system such that output is reduced.\n\nThe evolutionary advantage of this extinction burst is clear. In a natural environment, an animal that persists in a learned behavior, despite not resulting in immediate reinforcement, might still have a chance of producing reinforcing consequences if the animal tries again. This animal would be at an advantage over another animal that gives up too easily.\n\nDespite the name, however, not every explosive reaction to adverse stimuli subsides to extinction. Indeed, a small minority of individuals persist in their reaction indefinitely.\n\nExtinction-induced variability serves an adaptive role similar to the extinction burst. When extinction begins, subjects can exhibit variations in response topography (the movements involved in the response). Response topography is always somewhat variable due to differences in environment or idiosyncratic causes but normally a subject's history of reinforcement keeps slight variations stable by maintaining successful variations over less successful variations. Extinction can increase these variations significantly as the subject attempts to acquire the reinforcement that previous behaviors produced. If a person attempts to open a door by turning the knob, but is unsuccessful, they may next try jiggling the knob, pushing on the frame, knocking on the door or other behaviors to get the door to open. Extinction-induced variability can be used in shaping to reduce problematic behaviors by reinforcing desirable behaviors produced by extinction-induced variability.\n\nExtinction learning can also occur in a classical conditioning paradigm. In this model, a neutral cue or context can come to elicit a conditioned response when it is paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An unconditioned stimulus is one that naturally and automatically triggers a certain behavioral response. A certain stimulus or environment can become a conditioned cue or a conditioned context, respectively, when paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An example of this process is a fear conditioning paradigm using a mouse. In this instance, a tone paired with a mild footshock can become a conditioned cue, eliciting a fear response when presented alone in the future. In the same way, the context in which a footshock is received such as a chamber with certain dimensions and a certain odor can elicit the same fear response when the mouse is placed back in that chamber in the absence of the footshock.\n\nIn this paradigm, extinction occurs when the animal is re-exposed to the conditioned cue or conditioned context in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. As the animal learns that the cue or context no longer predicts the coming of the unconditioned stimulus, conditioned responding gradually decreases, or extinguishes.\n\nGlutamate is a neurotransmitter that has been extensively implicated in the neural basis of learning. D-Cycloserine (DCS) is an agonist for the glutamate receptor NMDA, and has been trialed as an adjunct to conventional exposure-based treatments based on the principle of cue extinction.\n\nA role for glutamate has also been identified in the extinction of a cocaine-associated environmental stimuli through testing in rats. Specifically, the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor (mGlu5) is important for the extinction of a cocaine-associated context and a cocaine-associated cue.\n\nDopamine is another neurotransmitter recently implicated in extinction learning across both appetitive and aversive domains. Dopamine signaling has been implicated in the extinction of conditioned fear and the extinction of drug-related learning\n\nThe brain region most extensively implicated in extinction learning is the infralimbic cortex (IL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) The IL is important for the extinction of reward- and fear-associated behaviors, while the amygdala has been strongly implicated in the extinction of conditioned fear. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) have also been identified as regions that may be associated with impaired extinction in adolescents.\n\nThere is a strong body of evidence to suggest that extinction alters across development. That is, extinction learning may differ during infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood. During infancy and childhood, extinction learning is especially persistent, which some have interpreted as erasure of the original CS-US association, but this remains contentious. In contrast, during adolescence and adulthood extinction is less persistent, which is interpreted as new learning of a CS-no US association that exists in tandem and opposition to the original CS-US memory.\n\n"}

Fermions are particles that obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, like electrons, protons and neutrons, and in general, particles with half-integer spin. These statistics determine the energy distribution of fermions in a Fermi gas in thermal equilibrium, and is characterized by their number density, temperature, and the set of available energy states. The model is named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi.\n\nThis physical model can be accurately applied to many systems with a large number of fermions. Some key examples are the behaviour of charge carriers in a metal, nucleons in an atomic nucleus, neutrons in a neutron star, and electrons in a white dwarf.\n\nAn ideal Fermi gas or free Fermi gas is a physical model assuming a collection of non-interacting fermions in a constant potential well. It is the quantum mechanical version of an ideal gas, for the case of fermionic particles.\n\nBy the Pauli exclusion principle, no quantum state can be occupied by more than one fermion with an identical set of quantum numbers. Thus a non-interacting Fermi gas, unlike a Bose gas, concentrates a small number of particles per energy. Thus a Fermi gas is prohibited from condensing into a Bose–Einstein condensate, although weakly-interacting Fermi gases might. The total energy of the Fermi gas at absolute zero is larger than the sum of the single-particle ground states because the Pauli principle implies a sort of interaction or pressure that keeps fermions separated and moving. For this reason, the pressure of a Fermi gas is non-zero even at zero temperature, in contrast to that of a classical ideal gas. For example, this so-called degeneracy pressure stabilizes a neutron star (a Fermi gas of neutrons) or a white dwarf star (a Fermi gas of electrons) against the inward pull of gravity, which would ostensibly collapse the star into a black hole. Only when a star is sufficiently massive to overcome the degeneracy pressure can it collapse into a singularity.\n\nIt is possible to define a Fermi temperature below which the gas can be considered degenerate (its pressure derives almost exclusively from the Pauli principle). This temperature depends on the mass of the fermions and the density of energy states.\n\nThe main assumption of the free electron model to describe the delocalized electrons in a metal can be derived from the Fermi gas. Since interactions are neglected due to screening effect, the problem of treating the equilibrium properties and dynamics of an ideal Fermi gas reduces to the study of the behaviour of single independent particles. In these systems the Fermi temperature is generally many thousands of kelvins, so in human applications the electron gas can be considered degenerate. The maximum energy of the fermions at zero temperature is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi energy surface in reciprocal space is known as the Fermi surface.\n\nThe nearly free electron model adapts the Fermi gas model to consider the crystal structure of metals and semiconductors. Where electrons in a crystal lattice are substituted by Bloch waves with a corresponding crystal momentum. As such, periodic systems are still relatively tractable and the model forms the starting point for more advanced theories that deal with interactions, e.g., using the perturbation theory.\n\nThe one-dimensional infinite square well of length \"L\" is a model for a one-dimensional box. It is a standard model-system in quantum mechanics for which the solution for a single particle is well known. The levels are labelled by a single quantum number \"n\" and the energies are given by\n\nwhere formula_2 is the potential energy level inside the box, formula_3 the mass of a single fermion, and formula_4 is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nSuppose now that instead of one particle in this box we have \"N\" particles in the box and that these particles are fermions with spin-½. Then not more than two particles can have the same energy, i.e., two particles can have the energy of formula_5, two other particles can have energy formula_6 and so forth. The reason that two particles can have the same energy is that a particle can have a spin of ½ (spin up) or a spin of −½ (spin down), leading to two states for each energy level. In the configuration for which the total energy is lowest (the ground state), all the energy levels up to \"n\" = \"N\"/2 are occupied and all the higher levels are empty.\n\nDefining the reference for the Fermi energy to be formula_2, the Fermi energy is therefore given by\nwhere \"N*\" is equal to (\"N\" − 1) when the number of particles \"N\" is odd, and its equal to (N) for an even number of particles.\n\nThe three-dimensional isotropic and non-relativistic case is known as the Fermi sphere.\n\nLet us now consider a three-dimensional infinite square well, that is, a cubical box that has a side length \"L\". The states are now labelled by three quantum numbers \"n\", \"n\", and \"n\". The single particle energies are\nwhere \"n\", \"n\", \"n\" are positive integers. There are multiple states with the same energy, for example formula_10. Now let's put \"N\" non-interacting fermions of spin ½ into this box. To calculate the Fermi energy, we look at the case where \"N\" is large.\n\nIf we introduce a vector formula_11 then each quantum state corresponds to a point in 'n-space' with energy \n\nWith formula_13denoting the square of the usual Euclidean length formula_14. \nThe number of states with energy less than \"E\" +  \"E\" is equal to the number of states that lie within a sphere of radius formula_15 in the region of n-space where \"n\", \"n\", \"n\" are positive. In the ground state this number equals the number of fermions in the system.\n\nthe factor of two is once again because there are two spin states, the factor of 1/8 is because only 1/8 of the sphere lies in the region where all \"n\" are positive. We find\nso the Fermi energy is given by\n\nWhich results in a relationship between the Fermi energy and the number of particles per volume (when we replace \"L\" with \"V\"):\n\nThe total energy of a Fermi sphere of formula_19 fermions is given by \n\nTherefore, the average energy per particle is given by:\n\nUsing this definition of Fermi energy, various related quantities can be useful.\nThe Fermi temperature is defined as:\nwhere formula_23 is the Boltzmann constant. The Fermi temperature can be thought of as the temperature at which thermal effects are comparable to quantum effects associated with Fermi statistics. The Fermi temperature for a metal is a couple of orders of magnitude above room temperature.\n\nOther quantities defined in this context are Fermi momentum \nand Fermi velocity\n\nThese quantities are the momentum and group velocity, respectively, of a fermion at the Fermi surface. The Fermi momentum can also be described as formula_26, where formula_27 is the radius of the Fermi sphere and is called the Fermi wave vector.\n\nThese quantities are \"not\" well-defined in cases where the Fermi surface is non-spherical.\n\nAs we showed above, a Fermi gas has a non-zero total energy even at zero temperature. By using the first law of thermodynamics, we can associate a pressure to this internal energy, that is\n\nwhere the expression is only valid for temperatures much smaller than the Fermi temperature. This pressure is known as the degeneracy pressure. In this sense, systems composed of fermions are also referred as degenerate matter.\n\nStandard stars avoid collapse by balancing thermal pressure (plasma and radiation) against gravitational forces. At the end of the star lifetime, when thermal processes are weaker, some stars may become white dwarfs, which are only sustained against gravity by electron degeneracy pressure. Using the Fermi gas as a model, it is possible to calculate the Chandrasekhar limit, i.e. the maximum mass any star may acquire (without significant thermally generated pressure) before collapsing into a black hole or a neutron star. The latter, is a star mainly composed of neutrons, where the collapse is also avoided by neutron degeneracy pressure.\n\nFor the case of metals, the electron degeneracy pressure contributes to the compressibility or bulk modulus of the material.\n\nAssuming that the concentration of fermions does not change with temperature, then the total chemical potential \"µ\" (Fermi level) of the three-dimensional ideal Fermi gas is related to the zero temperature Fermi energy \"E\" by a Sommerfeld expansion (assuming formula_29):\nwhere \"T\" is the temperature.\n\nHence, the internal chemical potential, \"µ\"-\"E\", is approximately equal to the Fermi energy at temperatures that are much lower than the characteristic Fermi temperature \"T\". This characteristic temperature is on the order of 10 K for a metal, hence at room temperature (300 K), the Fermi energy and internal chemical potential are essentially equivalent.\n\nFor the three dimensional case, with fermions of spin-½, we can obtain the number of particles as a function of the energy formula_31 by substituting the Fermi energy by a variable energy formula_32:\nwhich we can use to obtain the density of states (number of energy states per energy per volume) formula_34. It can be calculated by differentiating the number of particles with respect to the energy:\nUsing a volume integral on formula_36 dimensions, we can find the state density:\nBy then looking for the number density of particles, we can extract the Fermi energy:\nTo get:\n\nwhere formula_40 is the corresponding \"d\"-dimensional volume, formula_41 is the dimension for the internal Hilbert space. For the case of spin-½, every energy is twice-degenerate, so in this case formula_42.\n\nA particular result is obtained for formula_43, where the density of states becomes a constant (does not depend on the energy):\n\nUnder the free electron model, the electrons in a metal can be considered to form a Fermi gas. The number density formula_45 of conduction electrons in metals ranges between approximately 10 and 10 electrons/m, which is also the typical density of atoms in ordinary solid matter.\nThis number density produces a Fermi energy of the order:\n\nwhere \"m\" is the electron mass. This Fermi energy corresponds to a Fermi temperature of the order of 10 kelvins, much higher than the temperature of the sun surface. Any metal will boil before reaching this temperature under atmospheric pressure. Thus for any practical purpose a metal, can be considered as a Fermi gas at zero temperature as a first approximation (normal temperatures are small compared to \"T\").\n\nStars known as white dwarfs have mass comparable to our Sun, but have about a hundredth of its radius. The high densities mean that the electrons are no longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas. The number density of electrons in a white dwarf is of the order of 10 electrons/m. \nThis means their Fermi energy is:\n\nAnother typical example is that of the particles in a nucleus of an atom. The radius of the nucleus is roughly:\n\nThe number density of nucleons in a nucleus is therefore:\n\nNow since the Fermi energy only applies to fermions of the same type, one must divide this density in two. This is because the presence of neutrons does not affect the Fermi energy of the protons in the nucleus, and vice versa.\n\nSo the Fermi energy of a nucleus is about:\n\nwhere \"m\" is the proton mass.\n\nThe radius of the nucleus admits deviations around the value mentioned above, so a typical value for the Fermi energy is usually given as 38 MeV.\n\nFor the whole article, we have only discussed the case where particles have a parabolic relation between energy and momentum, as is the case in non-relativistic mechanics. For particles with energies close to their respective rest mass, we have to use the equations of special relativity. Where single-particle energy is given by:\nFor this system, the Fermi energy is given by:\nwhere the formula_53 equality is only valid in the ultrarelativistic limit, and \nThe relativistic Fermi gas model is also used for the description of large white dwarfs which are close to the Chandresekhar limit. For the ultrarelativistic case, the degeneracy pressure is proportional to formula_55.\nIn 1956, Lev Landau developed the Fermi liquid theory, where he treated the case of a Fermi liquid, i.e., a system with repulsive, not necessarily small, interactions between fermions. The theory shows that the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas and a Fermi liquid do not differ that much. It can be shown that the Fermi liquid is equivalent to a Fermi gas composed of collective excitations or quasiparticles, each with a different effective mass and magnetic moment.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "564387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=564387", "title": "Flow (psychology)", "text": "Flow (psychology)\n\nIn positive psychology, flow, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time.\n\nNamed by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi in 1975, the concept has been widely referred to across a variety of fields (and has an especially big recognition in occupational therapy), though the concept has existed for thousands of years under other names, notably in some Eastern religions.\n\nFlow shares many characteristics with hyperfocus. However, hyperfocus is not always described in a positive light. Some examples include spending \"too much\" time playing video games or getting side-tracked and pleasurably absorbed by one aspect of an assignment or task to the detriment of the overall assignment. In some cases, hyperfocus can \"capture\" a person, perhaps causing them to appear unfocused or to start several projects, but complete few.\n\nJeanne Nakamura and Csíkszentmihályi identify the following six factors as encompassing an experience of flow:\n\nThose aspects can appear independently of each other, but only in combination do they constitute a so-called \"flow experience\". Additionally, psychology writer Kendra Cherry has mentioned three other components that Csíkszentmihályi lists as being a part of the flow experience: \nJust as with the conditions listed above, these conditions can be independent of one another.\n\nFlow is so named because during Csíkszentmihályi's 1975 interviews several people described their \"flow\" experiences using the metaphor of a water current carrying them along.\n\nMihaly Csikszentmihályi and his fellow researchers began researching flow after Csikszentmihályi became fascinated by artists who would essentially get \"lost\" in their work. Artists, especially painters, got so immersed in their work that they would disregard their need for food, water and even sleep. Thus, the origin of research on the theory of flow came about when Csikszentmihályi tried to understand this phenomenon experienced by these artists. Flow research became prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s, with Csikszentmihályi and his colleagues in Italy still at the forefront. Researchers interested in optimal experiences and emphasizing positive experiences, especially in places such as schools and the business world, also began studying the theory of flow at this time. The theory of flow was greatly used in the theories of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers in their development of the humanistic tradition of psychology.\n\nIdeas similar to flow have been recognized throughout history and across cultures. The teachings of Buddhism and of Taoism speak of a state of mind known as the \"action of inaction\" or \"doing without doing\" (\"wu wei\" in Taoism) that greatly resembles the idea of flow. Also, Hindu texts on Advaita philosophy such as Ashtavakra Gita and the Yoga of Knowledge such as Bhagavad-Gita refer to a similar state.\n\nIn any given moment, there is a great deal of information made available to each individual. Psychologists have found that one's mind can attend to only a certain amount of information at a time. According to Csikszentmihályi's 2004 TED talk, that number is about \"110 bits of information per second\". That may seem like a lot of information, but simple daily tasks take quite a lot of information. Just decoding speech takes about 60 bits of information per second. That is why when having a conversation one cannot focus as much attention on other things.\n\nFor the most part (except for basic bodily feelings like hunger and pain, which are innate), people are able to decide what they want to focus their attention on. However, when one is in the flow state, they are completely engrossed with the one task at hand and, without making the conscious decision to do so, lose awareness of all other things: time, people, distractions, and even basic bodily needs. This occurs because all of the attention of the person in the flow state is on the task at hand; there is no more attention to be allocated.\n\nThe flow state has been described by Csikszentmihályi as the \"optimal experience\" in that one gets to a level of high gratification from the experience. Achieving this experience is considered to be personal and \"depends on the ability\" of the individual. One's capacity and desire to overcome challenges in order to achieve their ultimate goals not only leads to the optimal experience, but also to a sense of life satisfaction overall.\n\nThere are three common ways to measure flow experiences: the flow questionnaire (FQ), the experience sampling method (ESM), and the \"standardized scales of the componential approach\".\n\nThe FQ requires individuals to identify definitions of flow and situations in which they believe that they have experienced flow, followed by a section that asks them to evaluate their personal experiences in these flow-inducing situations. The FQ identifies flow as multiple constructs, therefore allowing the results to be used to estimate differences in the likelihood of experiencing flow across a variety of factors. Another strength of the FQ is that it does not assume that everyone's flow experiences are the same. Because of this, the FQ is the ideal measure for estimating the prevalence of flow. However, the FQ has some weaknesses that more recent methods have set out to address. The FQ does not allow for measurement of the intensity of flow during specific activities. This method also does not measure the influence of the ratio of challenge to skill on the flow state.\n\nThe ESM requires individuals to fill out the experience sampling form (ESF) at eight randomly chosen time intervals throughout the day. The purpose of this is to understand subjective experiences by estimating the time intervals that individuals spend in specific states during everyday life. The ESF is made up of 13 categorical items and 29 scaled items. The purpose of the categorical items is to determine the context and motivational aspects of the current actions (these items include: time, location, companionship/desire for companionship, activity being performed, reason for performing activity). Because these questions are open-ended, the answers need to be coded by researchers. This needs to be done carefully so as to avoid any biases in the statistical analysis. The scaled items are intended to measure the levels of a variety of subjective feelings that the individual may be experiencing. The ESM is more complex than the FQ and contributes to the understanding of how flow plays out in a variety of situations, however the possible biases make it a risky choice.\n\nSome researchers are not satisfied with the methods mentioned above and have set out to create their own scales. The scales developed by Jackson and Eklund are the most commonly used in research, mainly because they are still consistent with Csíkszentmihályi's definition of flow and consider flow as being both a state and a trait. Jackson and Eklund created two scales that have been proven to be psychometrically valid and reliable: the Flow State Scale-2 (which measures flow as a state) and the Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (designed to measure flow as either a general trait or domain-specific trait). The statistical analysis of the individual results from these scales gives a much more complete understanding of flow than the ESM and the FQ.\n\nA flow state can be entered while performing any activity, although it is most likely to occur when one is wholeheartedly performing a task or activity for intrinsic purposes. Passive activities like taking a bath or even watching TV usually do not elicit flow experiences as individuals have to actively do something to enter a flow state. While the activities that induce flow may vary and be multifaceted, Csikszentmihályi asserts that the experience of flow is similar despite the activity.\n\nFlow theory postulates three conditions that have to be met to achieve a flow state:\n\nHowever, it was argued that the antecedent factors of flow are interrelated, as a perceived balance between challenges and skills requires that one knows what he or she has to do (clear goals) and how successful he or she is in doing it (immediate feedback). Thus, a perceived fit of skills and task demands can be identified as the central precondition of flow experiences.\n\nIn 1987, Massimini, Csíkszentmihályi and Carli published the 8-channel model of flow shown here. Antonella Delle Fave, who worked with Fausto Massimini at the University of Milan, now calls this graph the Experience Fluctuation Model. The Experience Fluctuation Model depicts the channels of experience that result from different levels of perceived challenges and perceived skills. This graph illustrates one further aspect of flow: it is more likely to occur when the activity at hand is a higher-than-average challenge (above the center point) and the individual has above-average skills (to the right of the center point). The center of this graph (where the sectors meet) represents one's average levels of challenge and skill across all activities an individual performs during their daily life. The further from the center an experience is, the greater the intensity of that state of being (whether it is flow or anxiety or boredom or relaxation).\n\nSeveral problems of this model have been discussed in literature. One is that it does not ensure a perceived balance between challenges and skills which is supposed to be the central precondition of flow experiences. Individuals with a low average level of skills and a high average level of challenges (or the other way round) do not necessarily experience a fit between skills and challenges when both are above their individual average. In addition, one study found that low challenge situations which were surpassed by skill were associated with enjoyment, relaxation, and happiness, which, they claim, is contrary to flow theory.\n\nSchaffer (2013) proposed 7 flow conditions:\n\nSchaffer also published a measure, the Flow Condition Questionnaire (FCQ), to measure each of these 7 flow conditions for any given task or activity.\n\nSome of the challenges to staying in flow include states of apathy, boredom, and anxiety. Being in a state of apathy is characterized when challenges are low and one's skill level is low producing a general lack of interest in the task at hand. Boredom is a slightly different state in that it occurs when challenges are low, but one's skill level exceeds those challenges causing one to seek higher challenges. Lastly, a state of anxiety occurs when challenges are so high that they exceed one's perceived skill level causing one great distress and uneasiness. These states in general differ from being in a state of flow, in that flow occurs when challenges match one's skill level. Consequently, Csíkszentmihályi has said, \"If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills.\"\n\nCsíkszentmihályi hypothesized that people with several very specific personality traits may be better able to achieve flow more often than the average person. These personality traits include curiosity, persistence, low self-centeredness, and a high rate of performing activities for intrinsic reasons only. People with most of these personality traits are said to have an \"autotelic personality\". The term “autotelic” is acquired from two Greek words, \"auto\", meaning self, and \"telos\" meaning goal. Being Autotelic means having a self-contained activity, one that is done not with the expectation of some future benefit, but simply to experience it as the main goal.\n\nAt this point, there is not much research on the \"autotelic personality\", but results of the few studies that have been conducted suggest that indeed some people are more prone to experience flow than others. One researcher (Abuhamdeh, 2000) found that people with an autotelic personality have a greater preference for \"high-action-opportunity, high-skills situations that stimulate them and encourage growth\" compared to those without an autotelic personality. It is in such high-challenge, high-skills situations that people are most likely to enter the flow state.\n\nExperimental evidence shows that a balance between skills of the individual and demands of the task (compared to boredom and overload) only elicits flow experiences in individuals characterized by an internal locus of control or a habitual action orientation. Several correlational studies found need for achievement to be a personal characteristic that fosters flow experiences.\n\nGroup flow is notably different from independent flow as it is inherently mutual. Group flow is attainable when the performance unit is a group, such as a team or musical group. When groups cooperate to agree on goals and patterns, social flow, commonly known as group cohesion, is much more likely to occur. If a group still has not entered flow, a team-level challenge may stimulate the group to harmonize.\n\nOnly Csíkszentmihályi seems to have published suggestions for extrinsic applications of the flow concept, such as design methods for playgrounds to elicit the flow experience. Other practitioners of Csíkszentmihályi's flow concept focus on intrinsic applications, such as spirituality, performance improvement, or self-help. His work has also informed the measurement of donor momentum by The New Science of Philanthropy.\n\nIn education, the concept of overlearning plays a role in a student's ability to achieve flow. Csíkszentmihályi states that overlearning enables the mind to concentrate on visualizing the desired performance as a singular, integrated action instead of a set of actions. Challenging assignments that (slightly) stretch one's skills lead to flow.\n\nIn the 1950s British cybernetician Gordon Pask designed an adaptive teaching machine called SAKI, an early example of \"e-learning\". The machine is discussed in some detail in Stafford Beer's book \"Cybernetics and Management\". In the patent application for SAKI (1956), Pask's comments (some of which are included below) indicate an awareness of the pedagogical importance of balancing student competence with didactic challenge, which is quite consistent with flow theory:\n\nAround 2000, it came to the attention of Csíkszentmihályi that the principles and practices of the Montessori Method of education seemed to purposefully set up continuous flow opportunities and experiences for students. Csíkszentmihályi and psychologist Kevin Rathunde embarked on a multi-year study of student experiences in Montessori settings and traditional educational settings. The research supported observations that students achieved flow experiences more frequently in Montessori settings.\n\nMusicians, especially improvisational soloists, may experience a state of flow while playing their instrument.\nResearch has shown that performers in a flow state have a heightened quality of performance as opposed to when they are not in a flow state. In a study performed with professional classical pianists who played piano pieces several times to induce a flow state, a significant relationship was found between the flow state of the pianist and the pianist's heart rate, blood pressure, and major facial muscles. As the pianist entered the flow state, heart rate and blood pressure decreased and the major facial muscles relaxed. This study further emphasized that flow is a state of effortless attention. In spite of the effortless attention and overall relaxation of the body, the performance of the pianist during the flow state improved.\n\nGroups of drummers experience a state of flow when they sense a collective energy that drives the beat, something they refer to as \"getting into the groove\" or entrainment. Likewise drummers and bass guitarists often describe a state of flow when they are feeling the downbeat together as being \"in the pocket.\"\n\nThe concept of \"being in the zone\" during an athletic performance fits within Csíkszentmihályi's description of the flow experience, and theories and applications of \"being in the zone\" and its relationship with athletic competitive advantage are topics studied in the field of sport psychology.\n\nTimothy Gallwey's influential works on the \"inner game\" of sports such as golf and tennis described the mental coaching and attitudes required to \"get in the zone\" and fully internalize mastery of the sport.\n\nRoy Palmer suggests that \"being in the zone\" may also influence movement patterns as better integration of the conscious and subconscious reflex functions improves coordination. Many athletes describe the effortless nature of their performance while achieving personal bests.\n\nIn many martial arts, the term Budō is used to describe psychological flow. Mixed martial arts champion and Karate master Lyoto Machida uses meditation techniques before fights to attain mushin, a concept that, by his description, is in all respects equal to flow.\n\nThe Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, during qualifying for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, explained: \"I was already on pole, [...] and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car. And suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it by a kind of instinct, only I was in a different dimension. It was like I was in a tunnel.\"\n\nFormer 500 GP rider Wayne Gardner talking about his victory at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix on \"The Unrideables 2\" documentary said: <nowiki>\"</nowiki>During these last five laps I had this sort of above body experience where actually raised up above and I could see myself racing. It was kind of a remote control and it's the weirdest thing I've ever had in my life. [...] After the race Mick [Doohan] and in fact Wayne Rainey said: <nowiki>\"</nowiki>How the hell did you do that?<nowiki>\"</nowiki> and I said: <nowiki>\"</nowiki>I have no idea.'<nowiki></nowiki>\n\nCsíkszentmihályi may have been the first to describe this concept in Western psychology, he was most certainly not the first to quantify the concept of flow or develop applications based on the concept.\n\nFor millennia, practitioners of Eastern religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and later in Sufism have honed the discipline of overcoming the duality of self and object as a central feature of spiritual development. Eastern spiritual practitioners have developed a very thorough and holistic set of theories around overcoming duality of self and object, tested and refined through spiritual practice instead of the systematic rigor and controls of modern science.\n\nCsíkszentmihályi's flow concept relates to the idea of being at one with things or as psychology expert, Kendra Cherry, describes it: \"complete immersion in an activity\". Practitioners of the varied schools of Zen Buddhism apply concepts similar to flow to aid their mastery of art forms, including, in the case of Japanese Zen Buddhism, Aikido, Cheng Hsin, Judo, Honkyoku, Kendo and Ikebana. In yogic traditions such as Raja Yoga, reference is made to a state of \"flow\" in the practice of Samyama, a psychological absorption in the object of meditation. Theravada Buddhism refers to \"access concentration\", which is a state of flow achieved through meditation and used to further strengthen concentration into jhana, and/or to develop insight.\n\nIn Sufi Islam, the first mental state that precedes human action is known as jila al-khatir, which roughly translates to 'cleansing the heart'.\n\nFlow in games and gaming has been linked to the Laws of Learning as part of the explanation for why learning-games (the use of games to introduce material, improve understanding, or increase retention) have the potential to be effective. In particular, flow is intrinsically motivating, which is part of the Law of Readiness. The condition of feedback, required for flow, is associated with the feedback aspects of the Law of Exercise. This is exhibited in well designed games, in particular, where players perform at the edge of their competency as they are guided by clear goals and feedback. The positive emotions associated with flow are associated with the Law of Effect. The intense experiences of being in a state of flow are directly associated with the Law of Intensity. Thus, the experience of gaming can be so engaging and motivating as it meets many of the Laws of Learning, which are inextricably connected to creating flow.\n\nIn games often much can be achieved thematically through an imbalance between challenge level and skill level. Horror games often keep challenges significantly above the player's level of competency in order to foster a continuous feeling of anxiety. Conversely, so called \"relaxation games\" keep the level of challenges significantly below the player's competency level, in order to achieve a similar but opposite effect. The video game Flow was designed as part of Jenova Chen's master's thesis for exploring the design decisions that allow players to achieve the flow state, by adjusting the difficulty dynamically during play.\n\nIt improves performance; calling the phenomenon \"TV trance\", a 1981 \"BYTE\" article discussed how \"the best seem to enter a trance where they play but don't pay attention to the details of the game\". The primary goal of games is to create entertainment through intrinsic motivation, which is related to flow; that is, without intrinsic motivation it is virtually impossible to establish flow. Through the balance of skill and challenge the player's brain is aroused, with attention engaged and motivation high. Thus, the use of flow in games helps foster an enjoyable experience which in turn increases motivation and draws players to continue playing. As such, game designers strive to integrate flow principles into their projects. Overall, the experience of play is fluid and is intrinsically psychologically rewarding independent of scores or in-game successes in the flow state.\n\nA simplified modification to flow has been combined with the technology acceptance model (TAM) to help guide the design of and explain the adoption of intrinsically motivated computer systems. This model, the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) is model to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamification. Instead of a minor, TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based concept of cognitive absorption (CA). The HMSAM further builds on van der Heijden's (2004) model of hedonic system adoption by including CA as a key mediator of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and of behavioral intentions to use (BIU) hedonic-motivation systems. Typically, models simplistically represent \"intrinsic motivations\" by mere perceived enjoyed. Instead, HMSAM uses the more complex, rich construct of CA, which includes joy, control, curiosity, focused immersion, and temporal dissociation. CA is construct that is grounded in the seminal flow literature, yet CA has traditionally been used as a static construct, as if all five of its subconstructs occur at the same time—in direct contradiction to the flow literature. Thus, part of HMSAM's contribution is to return CA closer to its flow roots by re-ordering these CA subconstructs into more natural process-variance order as predicted by flow. Empirical data collection along with mediation tests further support this modeling approach.\n\nDevelopers of computer software reference getting into a flow state as \"wired in\", or sometimes as \"The Zone\", \"hack mode\", or operating on \"software time\" when developing in an undistracted state. Stock market operators often use the term \"in the pipe\" to describe the psychological state of flow when trading during high volume days and market corrections. Professional poker players use the term \"playing the A-game\" when referring to the state of highest concentration and strategical awareness, while pool players often call the state being in \"dead stroke\".\n\nConditions of flow, defined as a state in which challenges and skills are equally matched, play an extremely important role in the workplace. Because flow is associated with achievement, its development could have concrete implications in increasing workplace satisfaction and accomplishment. Flow researchers, such as Csikszentmihályi, believe that certain interventions may be performed to enhance and increase flow in the workplace, through which people would gain 'intrinsic rewards that encourage persistence\" and provide benefits. In his consultation work, Csikszentmihályi emphasizes finding activities and environments that are conducive to flow, and then identifying and developing personal characteristics to increase experiences of flow. Applying these methods in the workplace, can improve morale by fostering a sense of greater happiness and accomplishment, which may be correlated with increased performance. In his review of Mihály Csikszentmihályi's book \"Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning,\" Coert Visser introduces the ideas presented by Csikszentmihályi, including \"good work\" in which one \"enjoys doing your best while at the same time contributing to something beyond yourself.\" He then provides tools by which managers and employees can create an atmosphere that encourages good work. Some consultants suggest that the experience sampling form (EMS) method be used for individuals and teams in the workplace in order to identify how time is currently being spent, and where focus should be redirected to in order to increase flow experiences.\n\nIn order to achieve flow, Csikszentmihályi lays out the following three conditions:\n\nCsikszentmihályi argues that with increased experiences of flow, people experience \"growth towards complexity\". People flourish as their achievements grow and with that comes development of increasing \"emotional, cognitive, and social complexity.\" Creating a workplace atmosphere that allows for flow and growth, Csikszentmihályi argues, can increase the happiness and achievement of employees. An increasingly popular way of promoting greater flow in the workplace is using Serious Play facilitation methods. Some commercial organisations have used the concept of flow in building corporate branding and identity for example The Floow Limited which created its company brand from the concept.\n\nThere are, however, barriers to achieving flow in the workplace. In his chapter \"Why Flow Doesn't Happen on the Job,\" Csikszentmihályi argues the first reason that flow does not occur is that the goals of one's job are not clear. He explains that while some tasks at work may fit into a larger, organization plan, the individual worker may not see where their individual task fits it. Second, limited feedback about one's work can reduce motivation and leaves the employee unaware of whether or not they did a good job. When there is little communication of feedback, an employee may not be assigned tasks that challenge them or seem important, which could potentially prevent an opportunity for flow.\n\nIn the study \"Predicting flow at work: Investigating the activities and job characteristics that predict flow states at work\", Karina Nielsen and Bryan Cleal used a 9- item flow scale to examine predictors of flow at two levels: activity level (such as brainstorming, problem solving, and evaluation) and at a more stable level (such as role clarity, influence, and cognitive demands). They found that activities such as planning, problem solving, and evaluation predicted transient flow states, but that more stable job characteristics were not found to predict flow at work. This study can help us identify which task at work can be cultivated and emphasized in order to help employees experience flow on the job. \nIn her article in \"Positive Psychology News Daily\", Kathryn Britton examines the importance of experiencing flow in the workplace beyond the individual benefits it creates. She writes, \"Flow isn't just valuable to individuals; it also contributes to organizational goals. For example, frequent experiences of flow at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development (Csikszentmihályi, 1991, 2004). So finding ways to increase the frequency of flow experiences can be one way for people to work together to increase the effectiveness of their workplaces.\"\n\nBooks by Csikszentmihályi suggest that enhancing the time spent in flow makes our lives more happy and successful. Flow experiences are predicated to lead to positive affect as well as to better performance. For example, delinquent behavior was reduced in adolescents after two years of enhancing flow through activities.\n\nPeople who have experienced flow, describe the following feelings:\nHowever, further empirical evidence is required to substantiate these preliminary indications, as flow researchers continue to explore the problem of how to directly investigate causal consequences of flow experiences using modern scientific instrumentation to observe the neuro-physiological correlates of the flow state.\n\nFlow is an innately positive experience; it is known to \"produce intense feelings of enjoyment\". An experience that is so enjoyable should lead to positive affect and happiness in the long run. Also, Csikszentmihályi stated that happiness is derived from personal development and growth – and flow situations permit the experience of personal development.\n\nSeveral studies found that flow experiences and positive affect go hand in hand, and that challenges and skills above the individual's average foster positive affect. However, the causal processes underlying those relationships remains unclear at present.\n\nFlow experiences imply a growth principle. When one is in a flow state, he or she is working to master the activity at hand. To maintain that flow state, one must seek increasingly greater challenges. Attempting these new, difficult challenges stretches one's skills. One emerges from such a flow experience with a bit of personal growth and great \"feelings of competence and efficacy\". By increasing time spent in flow, intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning also increases.\n\nFlow has a documented correlation with high performance in the fields of artistic and scientific creativity, teaching, learning, and sports;\n\nFlow has been linked to persistence and achievement in activities while also helping to lower anxiety during various activities and raise self-esteem.\n\nHowever, evidence regarding better performance in flow situations is mixed. For sure, the association between the two is a reciprocal one. That is, flow experiences may foster better performance but, on the other hand, good performance makes flow experiences more likely. Results of a longitudinal study in the academic context indicate that the causal effect of flow on performance is only of small magnitude and the strong relationship between the two is driven by an effect of performance on flow.\nIn the long run, flow experiences in a specific activity may lead to higher performance in that activity as flow is positively correlated with a higher subsequent motivation to perform and to perform well.\n\nCsikszentmihályi writes about the dangers of flow himself: ...enjoyable activities that produce flow have a potentially negative effect: while they are capable of improving the quality of existence by creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at which point the self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and is then unwilling to cope with the ambiguities of life.Further, he writes:The flow experience, like everything else, is not \"good\" in an absolute sense. It is good only in that it has the potential to make life more rich, intense, and meaningful; it is good because it increases the strengths and complexity of the self. But whether the consequence of any particular instance of flow is good in a larger sense needs to be discussed and evaluated in terms of more inclusive social criteria.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It was devised by Kenneth Garside while he was deputy librarian there. Intellectually, it was based on the close relationship between the library and the teaching departments. The library at UCL rejected the major published classification schemes because \"none of them would generally acceptable to the teaching departments without such major modifications as would have destroyed its essential character.\"\ninstead, it was modeled around the \"subject reading rooms\" into which the collection had been divided. The intent was to utilise the expertise of the departments, and their teaching needs in drawing up the divisions within the scheme.\n\nThe principles of the scheme were \"To provide the optimum arrangement of books in each subject; to permit the revision of the classification to meet a changing academic approach to a subject without disturbing in any way other parts of the scheme; and to provide as simple a shelf mark as possible to help the reader find the book he wants with the minimum mental effort.\" \n\nIn his article \"The basic principles of the new library classification at University College London\" Garside set out the generic structure of the system. The library would be divided into subject based reading rooms such as, in the below example, a dedicated space for biology related materials. These would then be subdivided according to the below table, using alphabetical characters:\nThe alphabetical sub-divisions were designed in consultation with the teaching department.\nThese subsections would then be divided by numbers:\nThe completed shelf mark would then include the first three letters of the author's surname.\n\ne.g. \"Basic concepts in population, quantitative, and evolutionary genetics\" by James F. Crow is shelved at BIOLOGY H 5 CRO.\n\nIn order to provide for a single subject card catalogue, Garside added a further table to which the top reading room divisions could be mapped.\n\nThe scheme is used at UCL. A adapted version is used by the Folklore Society. Garside instituted a similar scheme in his time at Leeds University.\n"}

It publishes books and magazines, organises seminars and lectures and its representatives regularly appear in television and print media exposing superstitions.\n\nThe Indian Rationalist Association was founded in 1949 at Chennai (then Madras). The founding president was R.P. Paranjpye (later High Commissioner of India in Australia and vice-chancellor of Bombay University). Sanal Edamaruku, well-known broadcaster and author, became its president in 2005.\n\nThe Indian Rationalist Association has branches in different states of India, with the headquarters of the association located in New Delhi. The Indian Rationalist Association took the initiative to form the Rationalist International in 1995 and organised three International Rationalist Conferences in co-operation with it.\n\nThe association was founded in 1949 by R.P. Paranjpye.\n\nThe Divine Miracle Exposure Campaign conducted across India during the period 1975-76 had given unprecedented popularity for the rationalist movement. Organized rationalist associations came up in each and every State and each of the State units got affiliated to IRA as parent body of rationalists and atheists in the Country.\n\nJyothi Shankar dedicated his work for more than three decades to build IRA as a powerful movement to spread scientific attitude and to live life freed from superstitious belief. He left for Canada on domestic and personal grounds around the time that Joseph Edamaruku, a staunch rationalist activist and writer of atheist literature, was made one of the Vice-Presidents of IRA. Edamaruku along with his family had already shifted from his home town at Kottayam in Kerala to New Delhi and settled there. Edamaruku vented his strong desire to shift the headquarters of IRA to New Delhi, the capital city of India. Since there were no responsible activists available in Madras at that point of time to look after the affairs of IRA, his request was conceded and the headquarters of IRA thus became the residence of Edamaurku clan at Delhi.\n\nSoon after the event, Joseph Edamaruku came down to Madras and shifted the Ramanathan Library with its precious collection of books and periodicals to his residential house in Delhi.\n\nJoseph Edamaruku became the President of the Association. After his death in 2005, his son Sanal Edamaruku took over the role.\n\nThe Indian Rationalist Association attempts to oppose superstition and pseudoscience in India. It has led media and educational campaigns debunking the Monkey-man of Delhi monster hysteria, godmen, claims of miraculous milk-drinking statues, superstitions related to solar eclipses, and even the beliefs behind ritual human sacrifices.\n\nSometimes referred to as \"guru busters,\" the group critiques India's culturally influential godmen. Performing magic demonstrations that replicate the purportedly miraculous feats of the godmen, such as walking on coals, producing sacred ash from thin air, exploding stones with \"mental power,\" levitating, or turning water into blood. Thousands of volunteers assist with these demonstrations throughout India.\n\nSimilarly, the Indian Rationalist Association demonstrate on television how ordinary statues can appear to drink milk and other fluids.\n\nWorking with the Dakshina Kannada Rationalist Association, the Indian Rationalist Association opposed a 2009 proposal to make yoga a compulsory subject for high school and primary school students in Mangalore.\n\nThe Australian writer Greg Egan has featured the Indian Rationalist Association in his novel \"Teranesia\".\n\n"}

This identity is not static but dynamic. Each being in the universe 'selves,' that is, enacts its identity. And the human being, the most highly selved, the most individually distinctive being in the universe, recognizes the inscape of other beings in an act that Hopkins calls \"instress\", the apprehension of an object in an intense thrust of energy toward it that enables one to realize specific distinctiveness. Ultimately, the instress of inscape leads one to Christ, for the individual identity of any object is the stamp of divine creation on it.\nThis is related to a logocentric theology and the Imago Dei. A logocentric theology of creation is based on correlation of the Genesis account and John 1. Since all creation is by the Word (divine fiat) human identity in God's image is grounded in God's speech and no two creation words are ever spoken alike. This idea is reflected by J. R. R. Tolkien who compares the Creator to a perfect prism and creation to the refraction of perfect light. Tolkien writes,\n\nThe idea is strongly embraced by the Trappist monk and author Thomas Merton who admired both Scotus and Hopkins. In \"New Seeds of Contemplation\" Merton equates the unique \"thingness\" of a thing, its inscape, to sanctity. Merton writes,\n\n\"No two created beings are exactly alike. And their individuality is no imperfection. On the contrary, the perfection of each created thing is not merely its conformity to an abstract type but in its own individual identity with itself.\"\n\nThe result is that holiness itself is grounded in God's creation, his call, and not in a Platonic ideal. To the extent that any \"thing\" (including humans) honors God's unique idea of them they are holy. Holiness thus connects to \"vocation\" (from the Latin vocare for \"voice\") in two ways. First, God creates through the word; and second, when being responds rightly to God's speech by expressing his unique word the result is Holiness.\n\n\n"}

The operator's efficiency is measured as the time spent producing product divided by the time the operator is on duty. For example: if an operator is assigned to run a CNC machine tool for seven hours, but he only has four hours worth of continuous uninterrupted output of workpieces - his MOE rating is 57% (4 divided by 7) for this seven-hour period of time.\n\nThere is a similar lean manufacturing KPI called overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). The major difference between OEE and MOE is that the OEE rating is on the machine and the MOE is on the person.\n\nMOE is a measure of operator performance only, regardless of the type of machine or the speed of the machine he is working on. MOE only measures the operator's ability to keep the machine running continuously (load and unload parts faster that the automatic cycle time of the machine). The MOE rating of an operator will travel with him as he moves from one machine to another. This is easily accomplished because the MOE rating is a universal calculation of time and not reliant on the complex OEE calculations of loading, availability, performance, and quality.\n\nIndustrial Dashboards can be used to display statistics for MOE ratings on each operator. To boost overall profitability for a manufacturing plant, machine operators are sometimes compensated with a salary bonus based on their MOE ratings.\n"}

{"id": "599917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=599917", "title": "Mental image", "text": "Mental image\n\nA mental image or mental picture is the representation in a person's mind of the physical world outside that person. It is an experience that, on most occasions, significantly resembles the experience of perceiving some object, event, or scene, but occurs when the relevant object, event, or scene is not actually present to the senses. There are sometimes episodes, particularly on falling asleep (hypnagogic imagery) and waking up (hypnopompic), when the mental imagery, being of a rapid, phantasmagoric and involuntary character, defies perception, presenting a kaleidoscopic field, in which no distinct object can be discerned. Mental imagery can sometimes produce the same effects as would be produced by the behavior or experience imagined.\n\nThe nature of these experiences, what makes them possible, and their function (if any) have long been subjects of research and controversy in philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, and, more recently, neuroscience. As contemporary researchers use the expression, mental images or imagery can comprise information from any source of sensory input; one may experience auditory images, olfactory images, and so forth. However, the majority of philosophical and scientific investigations of the topic focus upon \"visual\" mental imagery. It has sometimes been assumed that, like humans, some types of animals are capable of experiencing mental images. Due to the fundamentally introspective nature of the phenomenon, there is little to no evidence either for or against this view.\n\nPhilosophers such as George Berkeley and David Hume, and early experimental psychologists such as Wilhelm Wundt and William James, understood ideas in general to be mental images. Today it is very widely believed that much imagery functions as mental representations (or mental models), playing an important role in memory and thinking. William Brant (2013, p. 12) traces the scientific use of the phrase \"mental images\" back to John Tyndall's 1870 speech called the \"Scientific Use of the Imagination\". Some have gone so far as to suggest that images are best understood to be, by definition, a form of inner, mental or neural representation; in the case of hypnagogic and hypnapompic imagery, it is not representational at all. Others reject the view that the image experience may be identical with (or directly caused by) any such representation in the mind or the brain, but do not take account of the non-representational forms of imagery.\n\nIn 2010, IBM applied for a patent on a method to extract mental images of human faces from the human brain. It uses a feedback loop based on brain measurements of the fusiform face area in the brain that activates proportionate with degree of facial recognition. It was issued in 2015.\n\nThe notion of a \"mind's eye\" goes back at least to Cicero's reference to mentis oculi during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of simile.\n\nIn this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to \"the Syrtis of his patrimony\" and \"the Charybdis of his possessions\" involved similes that were \"too far-fetched\"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of \"the rock\" and \"the gulf\" (respectively)—on the grounds that \"the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard\".\n\nThe concept of \"the mind's eye\" first appeared in English in Chaucer's (c. 1387) Man of Law's Tale in his \"Canterbury Tales\", where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with \"the eyes of his mind\"; namely, those eyes \"with which all men see after they have become blind\".\n\nThe biological foundation of the mind's eye is not fully understood. Studies using fMRI have shown that the lateral geniculate nucleus and the V1 area of the visual cortex are activated during mental imagery tasks. Ratey writes:\nThe visual pathway is not a one-way street. Higher areas of the brain can also send visual input back to neurons in lower areas of the visual cortex. [...] As humans, we have the ability to see with the mind's eye – to have a perceptual experience in the absence of visual input. For example, PET scans have shown that when subjects, seated in a room, imagine they are at their front door starting to walk either to the left or right, activation begins in the visual association cortex, the parietal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex - all higher cognitive processing centers of the brain.\n\nThe rudiments of a biological basis for the mind's eye is found in the deeper portions of the brain below the neocortex, or where the center of perception exists. The thalamus has been found to be discrete to other components in that it processes all forms of perceptional data relayed from both lower and higher components of the brain. Damage to this component can produce permanent perceptual damage, however when damage is inflicted upon the cerebral cortex, the brain adapts to neuroplasticity to amend any occlusions for perception. It can be thought that the neocortex is a sophisticated memory storage warehouse in which data received as an input from sensory systems are compartmentalized via the cerebral cortex. This would essentially allow for shapes to be identified, although given the lack of filtering input produced internally, one may as a consequence, hallucinate - essentially seeing something that isn't received as an input externally but rather internal (i.e. an error in the filtering of segmented sensory data from the cerebral cortex may result in one seeing, feeling, hearing or experiencing something that is inconsistent with reality).\n\nNot all people have the same internal perceptual ability. For many, when the eyes are closed, the perception of darkness prevails. However, some people are able to perceive colorful, dynamic imagery. The use of hallucinogenic drugs increases the subject's ability to consciously access visual (and auditory, and other sense) percepts.\n\nFurthermore, the pineal gland is a hypothetical candidate for producing a mind's eye; Rick Strassman and others have postulated that during near-death experiences (NDEs) and dreaming, the gland might secrete a hallucinogenic chemical \"N\",\"N\"-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) to produce internal visuals when external sensory data is occluded. However, this hypothesis has yet to be fully supported with neurochemical evidence and plausible mechanism for DMT production.\n\nThe hypothesized condition where a person lacks a mind's eye is called aphantasia. The term was first suggested in a 2015 study.\n\nCommon examples of mental images include daydreaming and the mental visualization that occurs while reading a book. Another is of the pictures summoned by athletes during training or before a competition, outlining each step they will take to accomplish their goal. When a musician hears a song, he or she can sometimes \"see\" the song notes in their head, as well as hear them with all their tonal qualities. This is considered different from an after-effect, such as an after-image. Calling up an image in our minds can be a voluntary act, so it can be characterized as being under various degrees of conscious control.\n\nAccording to psychologist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, our experiences of the world are represented in our minds as mental images. These mental images can then be associated and compared with others, and can be used to synthesize completely new images. In this view, mental images allow us to form useful theories of how the world works by formulating likely sequences of mental images in our heads without having to directly experience that outcome. Whether other creatures have this capability is debatable.\n\nThere are several theories as to how mental images are formed in the mind. These include the dual-code theory, the propositional theory, and the functional-equivalency hypothesis. The dual-code theory, created by Allan Paivio in 1971, is the theory that we use two separate codes to represent information in our brains: image codes and verbal codes. Image codes are things like thinking of a picture of a dog when you are thinking of a dog, whereas a verbal code would be to think of the word \"dog\". Another example is the difference between thinking of abstract words such as \"justice\" or \"love\" and thinking of concrete words like \"elephant\" or \"chair.\" When abstract words are thought of, it is easier to think of them in terms of verbal codes—finding words that define them or describe them. With concrete words, it is often easier to use image codes and bring up a picture of a \"human\" or \"chair\" in your mind rather than words associated or descriptive of them.\n\nThe propositional theory involves storing images in the form of a generic propositional code that stores the meaning of the concept not the image itself. The propositional codes can either be descriptive of the image or symbolic. They are then transferred back into verbal and visual code to form the mental image.\n\nThe functional-equivalency hypothesis is that mental images are \"internal representations\" that work in the same way as the actual perception of physical objects. In other words, the picture of a dog brought to mind when the word \"dog\" is read is interpreted in the same way as if the person looking at an actual dog before them.\n\nResearch has occurred to designate a specific neural correlate of imagery; however, studies show a multitude of results. Most studies published before 2001 suggest neural correlates of visual imagery occur in brodmann area 17. Auditory performance imagery have been observed in the premotor areas, precunes, and medial brodmann area 40. Auditory imagery in general occurs across participants in the temporal voice area (TVA), which allows top-down imaging manipulations, processing, and storage of audition functions. Olfactory imagery research shows activation in the anterior piriform cortex and the posterior piriform cortex; experts in olfactory imagery have larger gray matter associated to olfactory areas. Tactile imagery is found to occur in the dorsolateral prefrontal area, inferior frontal gyrus, frontal gyrus, insula, precentral gyrus, and the medial frontal gyrus with basil ganglia activation in the ventral posteriomedial nucleus and putamen (hemisphere activation corresponds to the location of the imagined tactile stimulus). Research in gustatory imagery reveals activation in the anterior insular cortex, frontal operculum, and prefrontal cortex. Novices of a specific form of mental imagery show less gray matter than experts of mental imagery congruent to that form. A meta-analysis of neuroimagery studies revealed significant activation of the bilateral dorsal parietal, interior insula, and left inferior frontal regions of the brain.\n\nImagery has been thought to cooccur with perception; however, participants with damaged sense-modality receptors can sometimes perform imagery of said modality receptors. Neuroscience with imagery has been used to communicate with seemingly unconscious individuals through fMRI activation of different neural correlates of imagery, demanding further study into low quality consciousness. A study on one patient with one occipital lobe removed found the horizontal area of their visual mental image was reduced.\n\nVisual imagery is the ability to create mental representations of things, people, and places that are absent from an individual’s visual field. This ability is crucial to problem-solving tasks, memory, and spatial reasoning. Neuroscientists have found that imagery and perception share many of the same neural substrates, or areas of the brain that function similarly during both imagery and perception, such as the visual cortex and higher visual areas. Kosslyn and colleagues (1999) showed that the early visual cortex, Area 17 and Area 18/19, is activated during visual imagery. They found that inhibition of these areas through repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) resulted in impaired visual perception and imagery. Furthermore, research conducted with lesioned patients has revealed that visual imagery and visual perception have the same representational organization. This has been concluded from patients in which impaired perception also experience visual imagery deficits at the same level of the mental representation.\n\nBehrmann and colleagues (1992) describe a patient C.K., who provided evidence challenging the view that visual imagery and visual perception rely on the same representational system. C.K. was a 33-year old man with visual object agnosia acquired after a vehicular accident. This deficit prevented him from being able to recognize objects and copy objects fluidly. Surprisingly, his ability to draw accurate objects from memory indicated his visual imagery was intact and normal. Furthermore, C.K. successfully performed other tasks requiring visual imagery for judgment of size, shape, color, and composition. These findings conflict with previous research as they suggest there is a partial dissociation between visual imagery and visual perception. C.K. exhibited a perceptual deficit that was not associated with a corresponding deficit in visual imagery, indicating that these two processes have systems for mental representations that may not be mediated entirely by the same neural substrates. \n\nSchlegel and colleagues (2013) conducted a functional MRI analysis of regions activated during manipulation of visual imagery. They identified 11 bilateral cortical and subcortical regions that exhibited increased activation when manipulating a visual image compared to when the visual image was just maintained. These regions included the occipital lobe and ventral stream areas, two parietal lobe regions, the posterior parietal cortex and the precuneus lobule, and three frontal lobe regions, the frontal eye fields, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex. Due to their suspected involvement in working memory and attention, the authors propose that these parietal and prefrontal regions, and occipital regions, are part of a network involved in mediating the manipulation of visual imagery. These results suggest a top-down activation of visual areas in visual imagery.\n\nUsing Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to determine the connectivity of cortical networks, Ishai et al. (2010) demonstrated that activation of the network mediating visual imagery is initiated by prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex activity. Generation of objects from memory resulted in initial activation of the prefrontal and the posterior parietal areas, which then activate earlier visual areas through backward connectivity. Activation of the prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex has also been found to be involved in retrieval of object representations from long-term memory, their maintenance in working memory, and attention during visual imagery. Thus, Ishai et al. suggest that the network mediating visual imagery is composed of attentional mechanisms arising from the posterior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex.\n\nVividness of visual imagery is a crucial component of an individual’s ability to perform cognitive tasks requiring imagery. Vividness of visual imagery varies not only between individuals but also within individuals. Dijkstra and colleagues (2017) found that the variation in vividness of visual imagery is dependent on the degree to which the neural substrates of visual imagery overlap with those of visual perception. They found that overlap between imagery and perception in the entire visual cortex, the parietal precuneus lobule, the right parietal cortex, and the medial frontal cortex predicted the vividness of a mental representation. The activated regions beyond the visual areas are believed to drive the imagery-specific processes rather than the visual processes shared with perception. It has been suggested that the precuneus contributes to vividness by selecting important details for imagery. The medial frontal cortex is suspected to be involved in the retrieval and integration of information from the parietal and visual areas during working memory and visual imagery. The right parietal cortex appears to be important in attention, visual inspection, and stabilization of mental representations. Thus, the neural substrates of visual imagery and perception overlap in areas beyond the visual cortex and the degree of this overlap in these areas correlates with the vividness of mental representations during imagery.\n\nMental images are an important topic in classical and modern philosophy, as they are central to the study of knowledge. In the \"Republic\", Book VII, Plato has Socrates present the Allegory of the Cave: a prisoner, bound and unable to move, sits with his back to a fire watching the shadows cast on the cave wall in front of him by people carrying objects behind his back. These people and the objects they carry are representations of real things in the world. Unenlightened man is like the prisoner, explains Socrates, a human being making mental images from the sense data that he experiences.\n\nThe eighteenth-century philosopher Bishop George Berkeley proposed similar ideas in his theory of idealism. Berkeley stated that reality is equivalent to mental images—our mental images are not a copy of another material reality but that reality itself. Berkeley, however, sharply distinguished between the images that he considered to constitute the external world, and the images of individual imagination. According to Berkeley, only the latter are considered \"mental imagery\" in the contemporary sense of the term.\n\nThe eighteenth century British writer Dr. Samuel Johnson criticized idealism. When asked what he thought about idealism, he is alleged to have replied \"I refute it thus!\" as he kicked a large rock and his leg rebounded. His point was that the idea that the rock is just another mental image and has no material existence of its own is a poor explanation of the painful sense data he had just experienced.\n\nDavid Deutsch addresses Johnson's objection to idealism in \"The Fabric of Reality\" when he states that, if we judge the value of our mental images of the world by the quality and quantity of the sense data that they can explain, then the most valuable mental image—or theory—that we currently have is that the world has a real independent existence and that humans have successfully evolved by building up and adapting patterns of mental images to explain it. This is an important idea in scientific thought.\n\nCritics of scientific realism ask how the inner perception of mental images actually occurs. This is sometimes called the \"homunculus problem\" (see also the mind's eye). The problem is similar to asking how the images you see on a computer screen exist in the memory of the computer. To scientific materialism, mental images and the perception of them must be brain-states. According to critics, scientific realists cannot explain where the images and their perceiver exist in the brain. To use the analogy of the computer screen, these critics argue that cognitive science and psychology have been unsuccessful in identifying either the component in the brain (i.e., \"hardware\") or the mental processes that store these images (i.e. \"software\").\n\nCognitive psychologists and (later) cognitive neuroscientists have empirically tested some of the philosophical questions related to whether and how the human brain uses mental imagery in cognition.\n\nOne theory of the mind that was examined in these experiments was the \"brain as serial computer\" philosophical metaphor of the 1970s. Psychologist Zenon Pylyshyn theorized that the human mind processes mental images by decomposing them into an underlying mathematical proposition. Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler challenged that view by presenting subjects with 2D line drawings of groups of 3D block \"objects\" and asking them to determine whether that \"object\" is the same as a second figure, some of which rotations of the first \"object\". Shepard and Metzler proposed that if we decomposed and then mentally re-imaged the objects into basic mathematical propositions, as the then-dominant view of cognition \"as a serial digital computer\" assumed, then it would be expected that the time it took to determine whether the object is the same or not would be independent of how much the object had been rotated. Shepard and Metzler found the opposite: a linear relationship between the degree of rotation in the mental imagery task and the time it took participants to reach their answer.\n\nThis mental rotation finding implied that the human mind—and the human brain—maintains and manipulates mental images as topographic and topological wholes, an implication that was quickly put to test by psychologists. Stephen Kosslyn and colleagues showed in a series of neuroimaging experiments that the mental image of objects like the letter \"F\" are mapped, maintained and rotated as an image-like whole in areas of the human visual cortex. Moreover, Kosslyn's work showed that there are considerable similarities between the neural mappings for imagined stimuli and perceived stimuli. The authors of these studies concluded that, while the neural processes they studied rely on mathematical and computational underpinnings, the brain also seems optimized to handle the sort of mathematics that constantly computes a series of topologically-based images rather than calculating a mathematical model of an object.\n\nRecent studies in neurology and neuropsychology on mental imagery have further questioned the \"mind as serial computer\" theory, arguing instead that human mental imagery manifests both visually and kinesthetically. For example, several studies have provided evidence that people are slower at rotating line drawings of objects such as hands in directions incompatible with the joints of the human body, and that patients with painful, injured arms are slower at mentally rotating line drawings of the hand from the side of the injured arm.\n\nSome psychologists, including Kosslyn, have argued that such results occur because of interference in the brain between distinct systems in the brain that process the visual and motor mental imagery. Subsequent neuroimaging studies showed that the interference between the motor and visual imagery system could be induced by having participants physically handle actual 3D blocks glued together to form objects similar to those depicted in the line-drawings. Amorim et al. have shown that, when a cylindrical \"head\" was added to Shepard and Metzler's line drawings of 3D block figures, participants were quicker and more accurate at solving mental rotation problems. They argue that motoric embodiment is not just \"interference\" that inhibits visual mental imagery but is capable of facilitating mental imagery.\n\nAs cognitive neuroscience approaches to mental imagery continued, research expanded beyond questions of serial versus parallel or topographic processing to questions of the relationship between mental images and perceptual representations. Both brain imaging (fMRI and ERP) and studies of neuropsychological patients have been used to test the hypothesis that a mental image is the reactivation, from memory, of brain representations normally activated during the perception of an external stimulus. In other words, if perceiving an apple activates contour and location and shape and color representations in the brain’s visual system, then imagining an apple activates some or all of these same representations using information stored in memory. Early evidence for this idea came from neuropsychology. Patients with brain damage that impairs perception in specific ways, for example by damaging shape or color representations, seem to generally to have impaired mental imagery in similar ways. Studies of brain function in normal human brains support this same conclusion, showing activity in the brain’s visual areas while subjects imagined visual objects and scenes.\n\nThe previously mentioned and numerous related studies have led to a relative consensus within cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy on the neural status of mental images. In general, researchers agree that, while there is no homunculus inside the head viewing these mental images, our brains do form and maintain mental images as image-like wholes. The problem of exactly how these images are stored and manipulated within the human brain, in particular within language and communication, remains a fertile area of study.\n\nOne of the longest-running research topics on the mental image has basis on the fact that people report large individual differences in the vividness of their images. Special questionnaires have been developed to assess such differences, including the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ) developed by David Marks. Laboratory studies have suggested that the subjectively reported variations in imagery vividness are associated with different neural states within the brain and also different cognitive competences such as the ability to accurately recall information presented in pictures Rodway, Gillies and Schepman used a novel long-term change detection task to determine whether participants with low and high vividness scores on the VVIQ2 showed any performance differences. Rodway et al. found that high vividness participants were significantly more accurate at detecting salient changes to pictures compared to low-vividness participants. This replicated an earlier study.\n\nRecent studies have found that individual differences in VVIQ scores can be used to predict changes in a person's brain while visualizing different activities. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study the association between early visual cortex activity relative to the whole brain while participants visualized themselves or another person bench pressing or stair climbing. Reported image vividness correlates significantly with the relative fMRI signal in the visual cortex. Thus, individual differences in the vividness of visual imagery can be measured objectively.\n\nLogie, Pernet, Buonocore and Della Sala (2011) used behavioural and fMRI data for mental rotation from individuals reporting vivid and poor imagery on the VVIQ. Groups differed in brain activation patterns suggesting that the groups performed the same tasks in different ways. These findings help to explain the lack of association previously reported between VVIQ scores and mental rotation performance.\n\nSome educational theorists have drawn from the idea of mental imagery in their studies of learning styles. Proponents of these theories state that people often have learning processes that emphasize visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems of experience. According to these theorists, teaching in multiple overlapping sensory systems benefits learning, and they encourage teachers to use content and media that integrates well with the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems whenever possible.\n\nEducational researchers have examined whether the experience of mental imagery affects the degree of learning. For example, imagining playing a 5-finger piano exercise (mental practice) resulted in a significant improvement in performance over no mental practice—though not as significant as that produced by physical practice. The authors of the study stated that \"mental practice alone seems to be sufficient to promote the modulation of neural circuits involved in the early stages of motor skill learning\".\n\nIn general, Vajrayana Buddhism, Bön, and Tantra utilize sophisticated visualization or \"imaginal\" (in the language of Jean Houston of Transpersonal Psychology) processes in the thoughtform construction of the yidam sadhana, kye-rim, and dzog-rim modes of meditation and in the yantra, thangka, and mandala traditions, where holding the fully realized form in the mind is a prerequisite prior to creating an 'authentic' new art work that will provide a sacred support or foundation for deity.\n\nMental imagery can act as a substitute for the imagined experience: Imagining an experience can evoke similar cognitive, physiological, and/or behavioral consequences as having the corresponding experience in reality. At least four classes of such effects have been documented.\n\n"}

{"id": "2216683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216683", "title": "Mistake (contract law)", "text": "Mistake (contract law)\n\nIn contract law, a mistake is an erroneous belief, \"at contracting\", that certain facts are true. It can be argued as a defense, and if raised successfully can lead to the agreement in question being found void \"ab initio\" or voidable, or alternatively an equitable remedy may be provided by the courts. Common law has identified three different types of mistake in contract: the 'unilateral mistake', the 'mutual mistake' and the 'common mistake'. The distinction between the 'common mistake' and the 'mutual mistake' is important.\n\nAnother breakdown in contract law divides mistakes into four traditional categories: unilateral mistake, mutual mistake, mistranscription, and misunderstanding.\n\nMistake can be-\n(1) Mistake of Law; or\n(2) Mistake of Fact\n\nMistake of law: when a party enters into a contract, without the knowledge of the law in the country, the contract is affected by such mistakes but it is not void. The reason here is that ignorance of law is not an excuse. However, if a party is \"induced\" to enter into a contract by the mistake of law then such a contract is not valid.\nIllustration: Harjoth and Danny make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian law of Limitation; the contract is not voidable.\n\nMistake of Fact: Where both the parties enter into an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.\n\nExplanation: An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.\n\nIllustration: A sells a cow to B for $80 because it is an infertile cow. The cow is actually pregnant and worth $1000. The contract is void.\n\nAnti-Illustration: Lady found a stone and sold it as a Topaz for $1 ($25 today). It was a raw uncut diamond worth $700 (today $17,000). The contract is not voidable. There was no mistake because neither party knew what the stone was.\n\nA unilateral mistake is where only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter contained in a contract. This kind of mistake is more common than other types of mistake. One must first distinguish between mechanical calculations and business error when looking at unilateral mistake. \n\nOrdinarily, unilateral mistake does not make a contract void. Traditionally, Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware), and under Common Law Caveat Venditor (let the seller beware).\n\nA contract might be voidable from unilateral mistake for any of the following:\n\nA mutual mistake occurs when the parties to a contract are both mistaken about the same \"material\" fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is a meeting of the minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. \"Collateral\" mistakes will not afford the right of rescission. A collateral mistake is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For a mutual mistake to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be \"material\" (emphasis added). When there is a material mistake about a material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, there is the question of the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario.\n\nThis is easily confused with mutual assent cases such as \"Raffles v Wichelhaus\".\n\nIn \"Raffles\", there was an agreement to ship goods on a vessel named \"Peerless\", but each party was referring to a different vessel. Therefore, each party had a different understanding that they did not communicate about when the goods would be shipped.\n\nIn this case, both parties believed there was a \"meeting of the minds,\" but discovered that they were each mistaken about the other party's different meaning. This represents not a mutual mistake but a failure of mutual assent. In this situation, no contract has been formed, since mutual assent is required in the formation stage of contract. Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 20 deals with this scenario.\n\nA common mistake is where both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts.\n\nThe House of Lords case of \"Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd.\" established that common mistake can void a contract only if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.\n\nLater in \"Solle v Butcher\", Lord Denning added requirements for common mistake in equity, which loosened the requirements to show common mistake. However, since that time, the case has been heavily criticized in cases such as \"Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd\".. For Australian application of Great Peace Shipping (other than in Queensland), see \"Svanosio v McNamara\". For Queensland, see \"Australian Estates v Cairns City Council\".\n\nThose categories of mistake in the United States exist as well, but it is often necessary to identify whether the error was a \"decisional mistake,\" which is a mistake as a matter of law (faced with two known choices, making the wrong one), or an \"ignorant mistake,\" unaware of the true state of affairs.\n\nThe difference is in the extent to which an innocent in the information chain, passing along or using or processing incorrect information, becomes liable. There is a principle that an entity or person cannot be made more liable merely by being in the information chain and passing along information taken in good faith in the belief that it was true, or at least without knowledge of the likelihood of falsity or inaccuracy.\n\nUnder New Mexico law a bank, title company, document processing firm, or the like is not liable for false information provided to it, any more than a bank was liable for false information from a trusted customer turned embezzler who drew an unauthorized cashier’s check. \"Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.\", 56 N.M. 107, 240 P.2d 143 (1952):\n\n‘A thing is done “in good faith” within the meaning of this act, when it is in fact done honestly, whether it be done negligently or not.\n‘…[a] transferee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.’\n\n56 N.M. at 112-113 (quoting from the Uniform Fiduciaries Act).\n\nRoswell was the case of first impression on this issue in the state of New Mexico, and drew on cases in other jurisdictions interpreting the same language, most notably \"Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456\", 12 A.2d 66 (1940), which on similar facts to Roswell came to the same conclusion and exonerated the innocent actor in favor of shifting any responsibility for the loss to tortfeasors and those who enabled them to act by giving them unjustified authority. 56 N.M. at 114.\n\nThe Davis case leads into another good analysis, in a case relied upon by Davis:\n\n\"Union Bank & Trust Co.v. Girard Trust Co.\", 307 Pa. 468, 500-501, 161 A.2d 865 (1932).\n\nThe law governing record-keeping mistakes and how they are corrected has been gathered by the U.S. Court of International Trade in \"Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States\", 414 F. Supp. 2d 1317 (C.I.T. 2006), in which the Court was faced with application of a tariff which had been calculated at the wrong rate by a customs clerk. To enforce \"anti-dumping\" legislation against foreign-made goods (in this case, Korean electronic components) made using cheap labor and undercutting American industry, a regulatory scheme was implemented under which such imports were charged a “liquidation duty” at a rate to be found on a schedule. The schedule had been made up by a panel of experts using standards for adjusting the price differential in the overseas goods. The custom clerk used the wrong category of goods and overcharged the duty, and by the time Hynix figured out what had happened, part of a very short statute of limitations on protest had expired. Hynix nevertheless prevailed and received the correction in its tariff rate by showing that such an error “…was correctable under 19 U.S.C. § 1520(c) as a mistake of fact or clerical error not amounting to an error in the construction of a law, and because the failure to file a protest within ninety days of the liquidation of the entries is without legal consequence in this context …” Id. at 1319.\n\nThe \"Hynix\" court explains the difference between a mistake of law “…where the facts are known but the legal consequences are not, or are believed to be different than they really are…,” \"Century Importers, Inc. v. United States\", 205 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2000), and a mistake of fact, “…where either (1) the facts exist, but are unknown, or (2) the facts do not exist as they are believed to [exist],” quoting \"Hambro Auto. Corp. v. United States\", 66 C.C.P.A. 113, 118, C.A.D. 1231, 603 F.2d 850, 853 (1979) (“A mistake of fact is any mistake except a mistake of law.” Id. at 855) Hynix, 414 F. Supp. 2d. at 1325.\n\n\"Hynix\", in reviewing the tariff application to the facts, also provided a guided tour of the different kinds of mistake and how they are treated in the federal court system. The key distinction is between “decisional mistakes” and “ignorant mistakes.” Id. at 1326; \"G & R Produce Co, v. U.S.\", 281 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1331 (2003); \"Prosegur, Inc. v. U.S.\", 140 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1378 (2001); \"Universal Cooperatives, Inc. v. United States\", 715 F. Supp. 1113, 1114 (1989).\n\n‘Decisional mistakes are mistakes of law and occur when “…a party [makes] the wrong choice between two known, alternative sets of facts.” \"Universal Cooperatives\", (citation partly omitted), 715 F. Supp. at 1114. On the other hand, an ignorant mistake occurs where “…a party is unaware of the existence of the correct alternative set of facts.” Id. “In order for the goods to be reliquidated under 1520 (c) (1), the alleged mistake of fact must be an ignorant mistake.” Prosegur, (citation partly omitted), 140 F.

(Sept. 8, 2004) (“[A] mistake of fact … is a factual error that, if the correct fact had been known, would have resulted in a different classification.”) The error must be “material” in order to be corrected without consequence.\n\n"}
{"id": "2895304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2895304", "title": "Model category", "text": "Model category\n\nIn mathematics, particularly in homotopy theory, a model category is a category with distinguished classes of morphisms ('arrows') called 'weak equivalences', 'fibrations' and 'cofibrations'. These abstract from a conventional homotopy category of topological spaces or of chain complexes (derived category theory), via the acyclic model theorem. The concept was introduced by .\n\nIn recent decades, the language of model categories has been used in some parts of algebraic \"K\"-theory and algebraic geometry, where homotopy-theoretic approaches led to deep results.\n\nModel categories can provide a natural setting for homotopy theory: the category of topological spaces is a model category, with the homotopy corresponding to the usual theory. Similarly, objects that are thought of as spaces often admit a model category structure, such as the category of simplicial sets.\n\nAnother model category is the category of chain complexes of \"R\"-modules for a commutative ring \"R\". Homotopy theory in this context is homological algebra. Homology can then be viewed as a type of homotopy, allowing generalizations of homology to other objects, such as groups and \"R\"-algebras, one of the first major applications of the theory. Because of the above example regarding homology, the study of closed model categories is sometimes thought of as homotopical algebra.\n\nThe definition given initially by Quillen was that of a closed model category, the assumptions of which seemed strong at the time, motivating others to weaken some of the assumptions to define a model category. In practice the distinction has not proven significant and most recent authors (e.g., Mark Hovey and Philip Hirschhorn) work with closed model categories and simply drop the adjective 'closed'.\n\nThe definition has been separated to that of a model structure on a category and then further categorical conditions on that category, the necessity of which may seem unmotivated at first but becomes important later. The following definition follows that given by Hovey.\n\nA model structure on a category \"C\" consists of three distinguished classes of morphisms (equivalently subcategories): weak equivalences, fibrations, and cofibrations, and two functorial factorizations formula_1 and formula_2 subject to the following axioms. Note that a fibration that is also a weak equivalence is called an acyclic (or trivial) fibration and a cofibration that is also a weak equivalence is called an acyclic (or trivial) cofibration (or sometimes called an anodyne morphism).\n\n\n\nA model category is a category that has a model structure and all (small) limits and colimits, i.e., a complete and cocomplete category with a model structure.\n\nThe axioms imply that any two of the three classes of maps determine the third (e.g., cofibrations and weak equivalences determine fibrations).\n\nAlso, the definition is self-dual: if \"C\" is a model category, then its opposite category formula_6 also admits a model structure so that weak equivalences correspond to their opposites, fibrations opposites of cofibrations and cofibrations opposites of fibrations.\n\nThe category of topological spaces, Top, admits a standard model category structure with the usual (Serre) fibrations and with weak equivalences as weak homotopy equivalences. The cofibrations are not the usual notion found here, but rather the narrower class of maps that have the left lifting property with respect to the acyclic Serre fibrations.\nEquivalently, they are the retracts of the relative cell complexes, as explained for example in Hovey's \"Model Categories\". This structure is not unique; in general there can be many model category structures on a given category. For the category of topological spaces, another such structure is given by Hurewicz fibrations and standard cofibrations, and the weak equivalences are the (strong) homotopy equivalences.\n\nThe category of (nonnegatively graded) chain complexes of \"R\"-modules carries at least two model structures, which both feature prominently in homological algebra:\n\nor\n\nThis explains why Ext-groups of \"R\"-modules can be computed by either resolving the source projectively or the target injectively. These are cofibrant or fibrant replacements in the respective model structures.\n\nThe category of arbitrary chain-complexes of \"R\"-modules has a model structure that is defined by\n\n\nOther examples of categories admitting model structures include the category of all small categories, the category of simplicial sets or simplicial presheaves on any small Grothendieck site, the category of topological spectra, and the categories of simplicial spectra or presheaves of simplicial spectra on a small Grothendieck site.\n\nSimplicial objects in a category are a frequent source of model categories; for instance, simplicial commutative rings or simplicial \"R\"-modules admit natural model structures. This follows because there is an adjunction between simplicial sets and simplicial commutative rings (given by the forgetful and free functors), and in nice cases one can lift model structures under an adjunction.\n\nA \"simplicial model category\" is a simplicial category with a model structure that is compatible with the simplicial structure.\n\nGiven any category \"C\" and a model category \"M\", under certain extra hypothesis the category of functors Fun (\"C\", \"M\") (also called \"C\"-diagrams in \"M\") is also a model category. In fact, there are always \"two\" candidates for distinct model structures: in one, the so-called projective model structure, fibrations and weak equivalences are those maps of functors which are fibrations and weak equivalences when evaluated at each object of \"C\". Dually, the injective model structure is similar with cofibrations and weak equivalences instead. In both cases the third class of morphisms is given by a lifting condition (see below). In some cases, when the category \"C\" is a Reedy category, there is a third model structure lying in between the projective and injective.\n\nThe process of forcing certain maps to become weak equivalences in a new model category structure on the same underlying category is known as Bousfield localization. For example, the category of simplicial sheaves can be obtained as a Bousfield localization of the model category of simplicial presheaves.\n\nDenis-Charles Cisinski has developed a general theory of model structures on presheaf categories (generalizing simplicial sets, which are presheaves on the simplex category).\n\nIf \"C\" is a model category, then so is the category Pro(\"C\") of pro-objects in \"C\". However, a model structure on Pro(\"C\") can also be constructed by imposing a weaker set of axioms to \"C\".\n\nEvery closed model category has a terminal object by completeness and an initial object by cocompleteness, since these objects are the limit and colimit, respectively, of the empty diagram. Given an object \"X\" in the model category, if the unique map from the initial object to \"X\" is a cofibration, then \"X\" is said to be cofibrant. Analogously, if the unique map from \"X\" to the terminal object is a fibration then \"X\" is said to be fibrant.\n\nIf \"Z\" and \"X\" are objects of a model category such that \"Z\" is cofibrant and there is a weak equivalence from \"Z\" to \"X\" then \"Z\" is said to be a cofibrant replacement for \"X\". Similarly, if \"Z\" is fibrant and there is a weak equivalence from \"X\" to \"Z\" then \"Z\" is said to be a fibrant replacement for \"X\". In general, not all objects are fibrant or cofibrant, though this is sometimes the case. For example, all objects are cofibrant in the standard model category of simplicial sets and all objects are fibrant for the standard model category structure given above for topological spaces.\n\nLeft homotopy is defined with respect to cylinder objects and right homotopy is defined with respect to path space objects. These notions coincide when the domain is cofibrant and the codomain is fibrant. In that case, homotopy defines an equivalence relation on the hom sets in the model category giving rise to homotopy classes.\n\nCofibrations can be characterized as the maps which have the left lifting property with respect to acyclic fibrations, and acyclic cofibrations are characterized as the maps which have the left lifting property with respect to fibrations. Similarly, fibrations can be characterized as the maps which have the right lifting property with respect to acyclic cofibrations, and acyclic fibrations are characterized as the maps which have the right lifting property with respect to cofibrations.\n\nThe \"homotopy category\" of a model category \"C\" is the localization of \"C\" with respect to the class of weak equivalences. This definition of homotopy category does not depend on the choice of fibrations and cofibrations. However, the classes of fibrations and cofibrations are useful in describing the homotopy category in a different way and in particular avoiding set-theoretic issues arising in general localizations of categories. More precisely, the \"fundamental theorem of model categories\" states that the homotopy category of \"C\" is equivalent to the category whose objects are the objects of \"C\" which are both fibrant and cofibrant, and whose morphisms are left homotopy classes of maps (equivalently, right homotopy classes of maps) as defined above. (See for instance Model Categories by Hovey, Thm 1.2.10)\n\nApplying this to the category of topological spaces with the model structure given above, the resulting homotopy category is equivalent to the category of CW complexes and homotopy classes of continuous maps, whence the name.\n\nA pair of adjoint functors\nbetween two model categories \"C\" and \"D\" is called a Quillen adjunction if \"F\" preserves cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations or, equivalently by the closed model axioms, such that G preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations. In this case \"F\" and \"G\" induce an adjunction\nbetween the homotopy categories. There is also an explicit criterion for the latter to be an equivalence (\"F\" and \"G\" are called a \"Quillen equivalence\" then).\n\nA typical example is the standard adjunction between simplicial sets and topological spaces:\ninvolving the geometric realization of a simplicial set and the singular chains in some topological space. The categories sSet and Top are not equivalent, but their homotopy categories are. Therefore, simplicial sets are often used as models for topological spaces because of this equivalence of homotopy categories.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Naraka is usually translated into English as \"hell\" or \"purgatory\". However, Naraka differs from the hells of Abrahamic religions as souls are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment. Furthermore, the length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long—measured in billions of years. A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous karma (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.\n\nThese realms are situated in the seven lower levels (\"adho lok\") of the universe while the human abode of Jambudvip is in the middle (\"madhya lok\") and the heavenly realms exist above (\"urdhva loka\"). These layers together, form the shape of a man with arms akimbo (the familiar 'keyhole' shaped emblem of Jainism), with the human realm of Jambudvip at the waist, \"adho lok\" below, \"urdhva lok\" above, and \"siddha lok\" or \"siddhashila\" (the realm of the siddhas) at or above the head. Many Jain temples are built to display this cosmology such Jambudvip in Hastinapur and the fifteen story Trilok Teerth Dham temple in Uttar Pradesh. The seven lower grounds are:\n\n\nThe first ground, owing to a predominance of \"ratnas\" or jewels, is called \"Ratnaprabha\". Similarly, the second, owing to a predominance of \"sarkara\" or gravel, is called \"Sarkraprabha\". The third owing to a predominance of \"valuka\" or sands, is called \"Valukaprabha\". The fourth, owing to an excess of \"panka\" or mud, is called \"Pankaprabha\". The fifth, owing to an excess of \"dhuma\" or smoke, is called \"Dhumaprabha\". The sixth, owing to a marked possession of \"tamas\" or darkness, is called \"Tamahprabha\", while the seventh, owing to a high concentration of \"mahatamas\" or dense darkness, is called \"Mahatamahprabha\".\n\nThe hellish beings (, \"\") are a type of soul which reside in these various hells. They are born in hells by sudden manifestation. The hellish beings each possess a \"vaikriya\" body (protean body which can transform itself and take various forms). They have a fixed life span in the respective hells where they reside. The minimum life span of hellish beings in the first to seventh hellish grounds is 10000 years, 1 \"sagaropama\" year (Ocean-measured years which are countless years as per Jain cosmology), 3 \"sagaropama\" years, 7 \"sagaropama\" years, 10 \"sagaropama\" years, 17 \"sagaropama\" years and 22 \"sagaropama\" years respectively. The maximum life span of hellish beings in the first to sixth hellish grounds is 1 \"sagaropama\" year, 3 \"sagaropama\" years, 7 \"sagaropama\" years, 10 \"sagaropama\" years, 17 \"sagaropama\" years and 22 \"sagaropama\" years respectively. They experience five types of sufferings: bodily pain, inauspicious \"leśyā \" or soul colouring and pariṇāma or physical transformation, from the nature and location of hells, pain inflicted on one other and torture inflicted by mansion-dwelling demi-gods.\n\nIn a dialogue between Sudharma Swami and Mahavira in the Jain text Sutrakritanga, Mahavira speaks of various reasons a soul may take birth in hells:\n\nAccording to Jain scripture, Tattvarthasutra, following are the causes for birth in hell:\n\n\nIn a dialogue between Sudharma and Mahavira the Jain text Sutrakritanga, Mahavira describes various tortures and sufferings in hells:\n\nIn Hell beings have a life span of innumerable years and are not easily killed even though they endure great torture. Even if they are killed they immediately take birth and are then repeatedly killed. This is described as thus:\n"}
{"id": "998070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=998070", "title": "Node (physics)", "text": "Node (physics)\n\nA node is a point along a standing wave where the wave has minimum amplitude. For instance, in a vibrating guitar string, the ends of the string are nodes. By changing the position of the end node through frets, the guitarist changes the effective length of the vibrating string and thereby the note played. The opposite of a node is an anti-node, a point where the amplitude of the standing wave is a maximum. These occur midway between the nodes.\n\nStanding waves result when two sinusoidal wave trains of the same frequency are moving in opposite directions in the same space and interfere with each other. They occur when waves are reflected at a boundary, such as sound waves reflected from a wall or electromagnetic waves reflected from the end of a transmission line, and particularly when waves are confined in a resonator at resonance, bouncing back and forth between two boundaries, such as in an organ pipe or guitar string.\n\nIn a standing wave the nodes are a series of locations at equally spaced intervals where the wave amplitude (motion) is zero (see animation above). At these points the two waves add with opposite phase and cancel each other out. They occur at intervals of half a wavelength (λ/2). Midway between each pair of nodes are locations where the amplitude is maximum. These are called the antinodes. At these points the two waves add with the same phase and reinforce each other.\n\nIn cases where the two opposite wave trains are not the same amplitude, they do not cancel perfectly, so the amplitude of the standing wave at the nodes is not zero but merely a minimum. This occurs when the reflection at the boundary is imperfect. This is indicated by a finite standing wave ratio (SWR), the ratio of the amplitude of the wave at the antinode to the amplitude at the node.\n\nIn resonance of a two dimensional surface or membrane, such as a drumhead or vibrating metal plate, the nodes become nodal lines, lines on the surface where the surface is motionless, dividing the surface into separate regions vibrating with opposite phase. These can be made visible by sprinkling sand on the surface, and the intricate patterns of lines resulting are called Chladni figures.\n\nIn transmission lines a voltage node is a current antinode, and a voltage antinode is a current node.\n\nNodes are the points of zero displacement, not the points where two constituent waves intersect.\n\nWhere the nodes occur in relation to the boundary reflecting the waves depends on the end conditions or boundary conditions. Although there are many types of end conditions, the ends of resonators are usually one of two types that cause total reflection:\n\n\n\nA sound wave consists of alternating cycles of compression and expansion of the wave medium. During compression, the molecules of the medium are forced together, resulting in the increased pressure and density. During expansion the molecules are forced apart, resulting in the decreased pressure and density.\n\nThe number of nodes in a specified length is directly proportional to the frequency of the wave.\n\nOccasionally on a guitar, violin, or other stringed instrument, nodes are used to create harmonics. When the finger is placed on top of the string at a certain point, but does not push the string all the way down to the fretboard, a third node is created (in addition to the bridge and nut) and a harmonic is sounded. During normal play when the frets are used, the harmonics are always present, although they are quieter. With the artificial node method, the overtone is louder and the fundamental tone is quieter. If the finger is placed at the midpoint of the string, the first overtone is heard, which is an octave above the fundamental note which would be played, had the harmonic not been sounded. When two additional nodes divide the string into thirds, this creates an octave and a perfect fifth (twelfth). When three additional nodes divide the string into quarters, this creates a double octave. When four additional nodes divide the string into fifths, this creates a double-octave and a major third (17th). The octave, major third and perfect fifth are the three notes present in a major chord.\n\nThe characteristic sound that allows the listener to identify a particular instrument is largely due to the relative magnitude of the harmonics created by the instrument.\n\nIn chemistry, quantum mechanical waves, or \"orbitals\", are used to describe the wave-like properties of electrons. Many of these quantum waves have nodes and antinodes as well. The number and position of these nodes and antinodes give rise to many of the properties of an atom or covalent bond. Atomic orbitals are classified according to the number of radial and angular nodes, while molecular orbitals are classified according to bonding character. Molecular orbitals with an antinode between nuclei are very stable, and are known as \"bonding orbitals\" which strengthen the bond. In contrast, molecular orbitals with a node between nuclei will not be stable due to electrostatic repulsion and are known as \"anti-bonding orbitals\" which weaken the bond. Another such quantum mechanical concept is the particle in a box where the number of nodes of the wavefunction can help determine the quantum energy state—zero nodes corresponds to the ground state, one node corresponds to the 1st excited state, etc. In general, \"If one arranges the eigenstates in the order of increasing energies, formula_1, the eigenfunctions likewise fall in the order of increasing number of nodes; the \"n\"th eigenfunction has \"n−1\" nodes, between each of which the following eigenfunctions have at least one node\".\n"}

{"id": "1341369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1341369", "title": "Norm (philosophy)", "text": "Norm (philosophy)\n\nNorms are concepts (sentences) of practical import, oriented to effecting an action, rather than conceptual abstractions that describe, explain, and express. Normative sentences imply \"ought-to\" types of statements and assertions, in distinction to sentences that provide \"is\" types of statements and assertions. Common normative sentences include commands, permissions, and prohibitions; common normative abstract concepts include \"sincerity\", \"justification\", and \"honesty\". A popular account of norms describes them as reasons to take action, to believe, and to feel.\n\nOrders and permissions express norms. Such norm sentences do not describe how the world is, they rather prescribe how the world should be. Imperative sentences are the most obvious way to express norms, but declarative sentences also may be norms, as is the case with laws or 'principles'. Generally, whether an expression is a norm depends on what the sentence intends to assert. For instance, a sentence of the form \"All Ravens are Black\" could on one account be taken as descriptive, in which case an instance of a white raven would contradict it, or alternatively \"All Ravens are Black\" could be interpreted as a norm, in which case it stands as a principle and definition, so 'a white raven' would then not be a raven.\n\nThose norms purporting to create obligations (or duties) and permissions are called \"deontic norms\" (see also deontic logic). The concept of deontic norm is already an extension of a previous concept of norm, which would only include imperatives, that is, norms purporting to create duties. The understanding that permissions are norms in the same way was an important step in ethics and philosophy of law.\n\nIn addition to deontic norms, many other varieties have been identified. For instance, some constitutions establish the national anthem. These norms do not directly create any duty or permission. They create a \"national symbol\". Other norms create nations themselves or political and administrative regions within a nation. The action orientation of such norms is less obvious than in the case of a command or permission, but is essential for understanding the relevance of issuing such norms: When a folk song becomes a \"national anthem\" the meaning of singing one and the same song changes; likewise, when a piece of land becomes an administrative region, this has legal consequences for many activities taking place on that territory; and without these consequences concerning action, the norms would be irrelevant. A more obviously action-oriented variety of such \"constitutive norms\" (as opposed to deontic or \"regulatory norms\") establishes social institutions which give rise to new, previously inexistent types of actions or activities (a standard example is the institution of marriage without which \"getting married\" would not be a feasible action; another is the rules constituting a game: without the norms of soccer, there would not exist such an action as executing an indirect free kick).\n\nAny convention can create a norm, although the relation between both is not settled.\n\nThere is a significant discussion about (legal) norms that give someone the power to create other norms. They are called \"power-conferring norms\" or \"norms of competence\". Some authors argue that they are still deontic norms, while others argue for a close connection between them and institutional facts (see Raz 1975, Ruiter 1993).\n\nLinguistic conventions, for example, the convention in English that \"cat\" means cat or the convention in Portuguese that \"gato\" means cat, are among the most important norms.\n\nGames completely depend on norms. The fundamental norm of many games is the norm establishing who wins and loses. In other games, it is the norm establishing how to score points.\n\nOne major characteristic of norms is that, unlike propositions, they are not descriptively true or false, since norms do not purport to describe anything, but to prescribe, create or change something. Some people say they are \"prescriptively true\" or false. Whereas the truth of a descriptive statement is purportedly based on its correspondence to reality, some philosophers, beginning with Aristotle, assert that the (prescriptive) truth of a prescriptive statement is based on its correspondence to right desire. Other philosophers maintain that norms are ultimately neither true or false, but only successful or unsuccessful (valid or invalid), as their propositional content obtains or not (see also John Searle and speech act).\n\nThere is an important difference between \"norms\" and \"normative propositions\", although they are often expressed by identical sentences. \"You may go out.\" usually expresses a norm if it is uttered by the teacher to one of the students, but it usually expresses a normative proposition if it is uttered to one of the students by one of his or her classmates. Some ethical theories reject that there can be normative propositions, but these are accepted by cognitivism. One can also think of propositional norms; assertions and questions arguably express propositional norms (they set a proposition as asserted or questioned).\n\nAnother purported feature of norms, it is often argued, is that they never regard only natural properties or entities. Norms always bring something artificial, conventional, institutional or \"unworldly\". This might be related to Hume's assertion that it is not possible to derive ought from is and to G.E. Moore's claim that there is a naturalistic fallacy when one tries to analyse \"good\" and \"bad\" in terms of a natural concept. In aesthetics, it has also been argued that it is impossible to derive an aesthetical predicate from a non-aesthetical one. The acceptability of non-natural properties, however, is strongly debated in present-day philosophy. Some authors deny their existence, some others try to reduce them to natural ones, on which the former supervene.\n\nOther thinkers (Adler, 1986) assert that norms can be natural in a different sense than that of \"corresponding to something proceeding from the object of the prescription as a strictly internal source of action\". Rather, those who assert the existence of natural prescriptions say norms can suit a natural \"need\" on the part of the prescribed entity. More to the point, however, is the putting forward of the notion that just as descriptive statements being considered true are conditioned upon certain self-evident descriptive truths suiting the nature of reality (such as: it is impossible for the same thing to be and not be at the same time and in the same manner), a prescriptive truth can suit the nature of the will through the authority of it being based upon self-evident prescriptive truths (such as: one ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else).\n\nRecent works maintain that normativity has an important role in several different philosophical subjects, not only in ethics and philosophy of law (see Dancy, 2000).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23322540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23322540", "title": "Parker immunity doctrine", "text": "Parker immunity doctrine\n\nThe Parker immunity doctrine is an exemption from liability for engaging in antitrust violations. It applies to the state when it exercises legislative authority in creating a regulation with anticompetitive effects, and to private actors when they act at the direction of the state after it has done so. The doctrine is named for the Supreme Court of the United States case in which it was initially developed, \"Parker v. Brown\".\n\nThe rationale behind \"Parker\" immunity is that Congress, in enacting the Sherman Act, evidenced no intent to restrain state behavior.\n\nFor the doctrine to apply, the state must act as a sovereign, rather than as a \"participant in a private agreement or combination by others for restraint of trade. Antitrust laws do not bar anticompetitive restraints that sovereign states impose \"as an act of government\". \"The key question is whether the allegedly anticompetitive restraint may be considered the product of sovereign state action. If it is not, then even if sectors of state government are involved, the activity will not constitute \"state action\" under the Parker doctrine and will not receive immunity.\"\n\nMoreover, the Parker court found that \"a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful.\"Instead, the anticompetitive conduct \"must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign,\" not merely prompted by state action, to be immunized under the state action doctrine.\n\n\"State action,\" as defined in cases granting Parker immunity, is qualitatively different from \"state action\" in other contexts such as the Fourteenth Amendment. While the Fourteenth Amendment can cover\nBecause it is grounded in federalism and respect for state sovereignty, this interest in protecting the acts of the sovereign state, even if anticompetitive, outweighs the importance of a freely competitive marketplace, especially in the absence of contrary congressional intent.\n\n\"State action\" as defined by the Parker doctrine differs from the government \"actions\" which results from petitioning. The two are not coterminous. A finding of immunity from injury caused by government action under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not require a finding of Parker state action. If the government \"action\" taken is the result of petitioning, Noerr-Pennington immunity attaches to a broader range of government action than does Parker immunity. Noerr-Pennington immunity protects petitioning, so long as it is not a sham. Under Noerr-Pennington immunity, the government actions which flow from valid petitioning need not qualify as Parker \"state action.\" Petitioning \"would be considerably chilled by a rule which would require an advocate to predict whether the desired legislation would withstand a constitutional challenge in the courts and to expose itself to a potential treble antitrust action based on that prediction.\"\n\nWithout clear congressional intent to preempt, federal laws should not invalidate state programs. \"In a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to Congress.\" While individual anticompetitive acts of state governments may be considered unwise or counterproductive, the decision to make such choices lies within the sovereign power of the states. Congress did not intend to override important state interests in passing the Sherman Act. \"The general language of the Sherman Act should not be interpreted to prohibit anticompetitive actions by the States in their governmental capacities as sovereign regulators.\"\n\nThe Sherman Act was enacted to address the unlawful combination of private businesses. \"There is no suggestion of a purpose to restrain state action in the Act's legislative history.\" The Sherman Act was passed \"in the era of 'trusts' and of 'combinations' of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern.\" Given its focus on the problems of private monopolies and combinations, it is not surprising that the Sherman Act does not set out to curb clearly defined anticompetitive state actions.\n\nWhen a state clearly acts in its sovereign capacity it avoids the constraints of the Sherman Act and may act anticompetitively to further other policy goals. For example, state governments frequently sanction monopolies to ensure consistent provision of essential services like electric power, gas, cable television, or local telephone service. But \"a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful.\" Only an affirmative decision by the state itself, acting in its sovereign capacity, and with active supervision, can immunize otherwise anticompetitive activity.\n\nApplying \"Midcal\" is unnecessary if the alleged antitrust injury was the direct result of a clear sovereign state act. In \"Massachusetts School of Law\", the Court held that where \"the states are sovereign in imposing the bar admission requirements [the alleged anticompetitive restraints], the clear articulation and active supervision requirements . . . are inapplicable.\" There is less need for scrutiny \"when the conduct is that of the sovereign itself . . . [because] the danger of unauthorized restraint of trade does not arise.\" Similarly, concerns about the legitimacy of the action are reduced. The test to determine sufficient state involvement as sovereign is unnecessary when the state legislature or state supreme court acts directly. As the Supreme Court explained: \"Closer analysis is required when the activity at issue is not directly that of the legislature or supreme court, but is carried out by others pursuant to state authorization... When the conduct is that of the sovereign itself, on the other hand, the danger of unauthorized restraint of trade does not arise. When the conduct at issue is in fact that of the state legislature or supreme court, we need not address the issues of 'clear articulation' and 'active supervision.'\n\nHowever, when it is uncertain whether an act should be treated as state action for the purposes of Parker immunity, courts apply the test set forth in \"California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.\" (1980) to \"determine whether anticompetitive conduct engaged in by private parties should be deemed state action and thus shielded from the antitrust laws.\" \"First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself.\"\n\n\nIn \"Midcal\", the Supreme Court clarified that requires states to meet two conditions before antitrust immunity will attach: \"First, the challenged restraint must be 'one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy'; second, the policy must be 'actively supervised' by the State itself.\" This clearly articulated state policy may be inferred \"if suppression of competition is the 'foreseeable result' of what the statute authorizes\". Under \"Midcal\", a state \"may displace competition with active state supervision if the displacement is both intended by the State and implemented in its specific details. Actual state involvement, not deference to private pricefixing arrangements under the general auspices of state law, is the precondition for immunity from federal law.\"\n\nTo qualify as state action under the \"Midcal\" test, \"the challenged restraint must be one 'clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy.'\" A government entity need not \"be able to point to a specific, detailed, legislative authorization\" to assert a successful Parker defense. But it must be evident that under the \"clear articulation\" standard the challenged restraint is part of state policy. As the Supreme Court has stated, \"Midcal confirms that while a State may not confer antitrust immunity on private persons by fiat, it may displace competition with active state supervision if the displacement is both intended by the State and implemented in its specific details\".\n\nThe second prong of the \"Midcal\" test is whether the resulting antitrust violation was \"actively supervised\" by the state. This standard is more problematic. The essential inquiry of the \"actively supervised\" prong is to determine if the \"anticompetitive scheme is the State's own\". The active supervision prong \"requires that state officials have and exercise power to review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy.\" \"Absent such a program of supervision, there is no realistic assurance that a private party's anticompetitive conduct promotes state policy, rather than merely the party's individual interests.\" Id. at 100-01. \"Such active state review is clearly necessary where private defendants are empowered with some type of discretionary authority in connection with the anticompetitive acts (e.g. to determine price or rate structures).\" Rubberstamp approval of private action does not constitute state action. A state must independently review and approve the anticompetitive behavior to satisfy this prong of the Parker doctrine.\n\nA \"hybrid restraint\" is discussed by Justice Stevens in his concurrence in \"Rice v. Norman Williams Co.\". They are not purely private actions, nor are they entirely attributable to the state in the manner of a legislative act. Hybrid restraints are not the type of sovereign state action found in \"Massachusetts School of Law\" or \"Zimomra\", that avoid \"Midcal\" treatment. Instead, hybrid restraints involve a degree of private action which calls for \"Midcal\" analysis.\n\n\n"}

The earliest documented prosecution of gender-based/targeted crimes is from 1474 when Sir Peter von Hagenbach was convicted for rapes committed by his troops. However, the trial was unsuccessful in indicting Sir von Hagenbach with the charge of rape because the war in which the rapes occurred was \"undeclared\" and thus the rapes were only considered illegal. Gender-targeted crimes continued to be prosecuted, but it was not until after World War II when an international criminal tribunal- the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Tokyo Tribunal)- were officers charged for being responsible of the gender-targeted crimes (particularly rape) and other crimes against humanity. Despite the various rape charges, the Charter of the Tokyo Tribunal did not make references to rape, and rape was considered as subordinate to other war crimes. This is also the situation for other tribunals that followed, but with the establishments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), there was more attention to the prosecution of gender-targeted crimes with each of the statutes explicitly referring to rape and other forms of gender-targeted violence.\n\nDomestic violence covers a wide range of gender-targeted crimes such as rape and honor killings. As many women, who make up a majority of the victims, deny they are facing domestic violence, there are not enough reliable statistics on Domestic violence. Due to the lack of information, violence against women is often dismissed as a \"private\" matter and no legal action is done.\n\nDespite the reforms that will be mentioned in the \"Rape\" section below, there is still a continuous debate over how the trials of the crimes should be conducted and over the effectiveness of the prosecution. The Violence Against Women Act, which was passed in 1994, paved the way in providing services and resources for women facing abuse and other forms of violence. However, there are limits on gender-targeted crimes reaching the Supreme Court and many are given to the state governments to oversee.\n\nA study in the UK conducted from 2011 to 2012 found that false claims of rape and domestic violence are uncommon. This notion of frequent false accusations came about after the police and investigators began to follow an \"over-cautious approach\" when addressing reports of domestic violence. However, the study showed there were only a few false allegations during seventeen months over 2011-2012. The study revealed that during the seventeen months, there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape and 111,891 for domestic violence in England and Wales, and in the same timespan, there were thirty-five prosecutions for making false allegations of rape, six prosecutions for false allegations of domestic violence, and three for false allegations of both crimes. Following the study and the eleven percent increase of reported cases of domestic violence in the last three months of 2012, there have been enhancements in the handling of the reported crimes with random checks of cases to ensure the correct handling of the prosecution of the cases.\n\nBefore there were reforms in rape laws and special units to prosecute rape crimes, rape was a difficult case to prosecute as a crime; this is due to issue of consent, the need to provide sufficient evidence to charge the accused, and sometime biased cultural depictions of sexuality and gender. The prosecution largely relies on organizations, advocacy groups, or social movements such as the Anti-rape movement in order to be effective. The difficulties can also bring negative consequences upon the victims. For example in the United States, a study in the 1980s found that the rape victims who went through the prosecution system had a slower recovery process than those who were not prosecuted.\n\nIn the United States, the late 1980s saw a nationwide movement of women's groups lobbying for reforms in rape laws. Their main goal was to prosecute rape in the similar manner that other crimes are prosecuted by focusing not on the victim's reputation or behavior but on the unlawful acts perpetrated by the offender. The movement also urged to have new laws improve the treatment of rape victims, and it hoped to have an increase in the number of reports of rape. The movement eventually led to rape law reforms for all fifty states. States varied in their reforms, but the common changes that resulted from the reforms were:\n\n\nIn India after the 2012 Delhi gang rape case amendments were made to the laws concerning rape with more specific protocols towards the trial proceedings. The new law, Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013, also defines new crimes such as stalking and voyeurism, expands the definition of rape, and brings higher sentences for punishment of the offenders (such as the death penalty for repeated offenders and for cases resulting in the victim's death). The law was passed by India's Parliament on March 2013, and with the passing of this law, it is also a crime for the police to refuse to open cases for sexual attack allegations.\n\nMarital rape is a form of sexual abuse and domestic violence. It is today increasingly criminalized around the world, but not all countries recognize it as a crime. Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but other countries in Western Europe and the English-speaking Western World outlawed it much later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s. In many countries of the world marital rape laws are very new, having been enacted during the 2000s. In 2006, the UN Secretary General found that: \"Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 States. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated.\" Since 2006 several other countries have made marital rape illegal.\n\nIn December 1993, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights published the \"Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women\". This establishes marital rape as a human rights violation.\n\nThe idea that marriage grants either spouse's consent to sex formed the basis for the reason why marital rape is not a universally accepted crime. Traditional perceptions of marriage and of women contribute to the reasons why marital rape is not universally identified as crime. Wives were regarded as the property of the husband, and therefore the husband was not responsible for a crime when he raped his wife since he did not infringe on another man's property rights. In the early 18th century of England, Blackstone's common law united the husband and the wife into a single legal entity upon marriage with the husband having the control of this entity. Although this view evolved to having independent rights for the wife, the concept of marital rape not as a crime went on with few challenges. In 1958, the \"Encyclopædia Britannica's\" definition of rape stated as \"A husband cannot commit rape upon his wife unless she is legally separated from him.\" \n\nIn the United States, criminalization of marital rape started in the mid-1970s, but it was not until the 1990s when action in regards to marital rape was followed through. Although all fifty states recognized marital rape as a crime on July 5, 1993, not all states treat marital rape the same as other forms of rape (see Marital rape#United States).\n\nIn South Asia, marital rape falls under Family law rather than criminal law. Marital rape cannot be prosecuted in India and Sri Lanka, unless the couple is separated. The religious laws tend to undermine the legal recognition of marital rape.\n\nThere is very poor data on the practice of Honor killing (also known as honor violence) due to the fact that many do not get reported or happen in remote areas or are classified as a different form of crime. This is the situation for the international data and American data, but for American data, no national or state agency collects data on honor violence. However, the practice of honor killings do occur with the family committing acts of honor killing believing that the daughter has become too Westernized and/or after she has refused to follow traditional customs such as arranged marriages. For example, in Phoenix, Arizona, the police arrested a man for murder after he ran down his 20-year-old daughter for refusing to accept an arranged marriage to a man in the family's native country of Iraq. The prosecution of such crimes are carried out in the United States, but the crimes are not identified as honor killings under a form of law. It has been argued that the lack of using the label \"honor killings\" and instead using the all-encompassing label of \"domestic violence\" prevents the public from seeing the key differences between honor killings and domestic violence and also prevents any policies limiting and ultimately, putting an end, to the honor killings.\n\nAlthough a law in 2004 made honor killings illegal in Pakistan, honor killings still occur in Pakistan largely because of the lack of strict enforcement and the tendency of the legal system following the religious law. By creating laws that aligned legal laws with Islamic law, the Hudood Ordinance of Pakistan, enacted in 1979, created obstacles for women victimized of gender-based crimes. Women were required to provide four male witnesses, but if they were unable to do so, the case is not prosecuted. For women who are married, they face the punishment for having sex outside of marriage, which range from stoning to public lashing, and some families will commit honor killings due to the dishonor she has brought upon the family. A bill removed the four male witnesses requirement of the Hudood Ordinances in 2006, but there are allegations that the police force and other law enforcing officials are not necessarily enforcing the law and bill. Women rights advocacy groups have pressured the Pakistani government to respond to the deficiencies, but in March 2005, a bill that sought to strengthen the law against the practice of honor killing was rejected by the Pakistani parliament after being declared as un-Islamic by a majority vote.\n\nFemale genital mutilation (also referred as FGM) is a common case of genital mutilation. The act has been practiced in parts of Africa for centuries, but after the United Nations made recommendations in its Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), in the present times, many nations such as Ghana and Egypt have placed laws stopping the practice of FGM through legal means. Despite these laws, FGM continues to be practiced in the communities. In Egypt, FGM is banned by ministerial health decree and not in federal law as of 2007, but FGM is a prevalent practice in Egypt with 90% or more prevalence in girls and women between fifteen and forty-nine years of age. 90% of girls who went through FGM were under fourteen years old. Additionally, an estimated 90% of the procedures are done by doctors or other trained medical personnel. In January 2015 Raslan Fadl, a doctor, became the first in Egypt to be convicted of FGM, following an appeal of his acquittal of the manslaughter of Sohair al-Bataa during an FGM procedure. He was sentenced to two years in jail for manslaughter plus three months for the FGM.\n\nFGM came about to the attention of the American public with a U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals case in which a 17-year-old girl from Togo fled to the U.S. after being forced into a polygamous marriage and told she was to face genital mutilation. The girl was eventually granted asylum In September 1996, Congress enacted the \"Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act,\" which prohibits FGM on persons under 18 years old. A landmark case is that of Khalid Adem who was the first person prosecuted and convicted of FGM in the United States after he circumcised his 2 year-old daughter. A native from Ethiopia and living in Georgia, Adem, circumcised his young daughter with a pair of scissors, and the young girl's mother did not find out about the act until two year later. After this case, Georgia enacted a law specifically forbidding the practice of FGM, but Adem, while originally facing forty years in prison, was only sentenced to ten years. Adem's case was the not first case involving FGM for in 2004, two California residents were arrested for conspiring to perform on FGM on young girls.\n\nThe first prosecution for FGM in the UK took place in 2014.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) was adopted in 1998 to specifically address war crimes and make advances in the prosecution of crimes committed against women. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which established the ICC, ensures effective prosecution of all crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC and particularly mentions crimes involving sexual violence. The ICC appointed a Special Gender Advisor to specially manage the crimes of gender-targeted violence.\n\nThe United States has not officially joined as a member state of the ICC since it has not ratified the Rome Statute for the ICC. The lack of United State's ratifying the statute is considered as limiting the potential of the ICC to prosecute the gender-targeted crimes.\n\nA Tribunal is a governmental body that makes up courts with a special jurisdiction. As ad hoc courts, they have specific purposes and are created in a response to certain situations. When it comes to gender-targeted crimes, tribunals hear the trials of the related crimes. Two examples of tribunals that have carried out trials of gender-targeted crimes are the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). These two tribunals have particularly focused on gender-based crimes while other tribunals have not. For example, another failure that the Tokyo Tribunal was its omission to call the female victims to give evidence at trial. The ICTR and ICTY have made improvements in regards to effectively prosecuting gender-targeted crimes and have carried out indictments that charge the accused with gender-based violence other than just rape charges. Women serve in high-level positions of both tribunals and have a prominent role in the prosecution of the gender-based crimes. This has allowed more cases to be heard as the female investigators and lawyers are able to reach out to the victims.\n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established in November 1994 by the United Nations Security Council with jurisdiction over the crimes committed during the Rwandan Genocide. For its first rape indictment, it took the ICTR three years to proceed. Two years after the establishment of the ICTR, a sexual assault unit of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) was created with three legal officers, one psychologist, one nurse, two lawyers, two policewomen, and one policeman. Under the ICTR, the sexual assault unit of the (OTP) created a policy to specifically carry out the legal proceedings of rape, genital mutilation, and other gender-targeted crimes. The OTP also has a Rape and Sexual Violence Section. This section under the OTP is headed by a female lawyer-investigator, and the OTP use female investigators and trial lawyers to reach out to the victims of rape and sexual violence, who are mostly women. Before the OTP, it was difficult to prosecute crimes of sexual violence under international criminal law, and because of these aspects, the OTP is considered to have founded the legal developments in the prosecution of gender-targeted crimes in international law.\n\nA landmark case conducted by the OTP is the 1998 conviction of the mayor of Taba commune in south Rwanda, Jean-Paul Akayesu, who directed acts of sexual violence on Tutsi girls and women in the Taba commune. Akayesu was the first person to be convicted of rape and sexual violence charges by an international court, and the case also represented the first international war crimes trial to convict a defendant for the crime of genocide. The case broke through the criminal networks that attempted to protect high-status, powerful political figures such as Akayesu who while not directly carrying out the slaughter, gave out undocumented orders for the mass killings. The case also made the following significant changes\n\n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was established in 1993 by the United Nations Security Council to conduct the trials of crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars. Feminist activists played a part in creating the structure of the ICTY over the gender-targeted crimes, and states and international organizations urged criminalizing rape with the main argument that the Geneva Conventions provided the context. This led to the ICTY Statue specifically listing rape as a crime against humanity. Under the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the ICTY, there is a \"Legal Advisor for Gender-related Crimes\" position that directs the prosecution's dealings with gender-based crimes similar to the one made in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). ICTY has a Victims and Witnesses Unit that provides support and counseling to victims and witnesses particularly in rape and sexual assault cases, and the unit is employed by women.\n\nThree cases- \"Čelebići,\" \"Furundžija,\" and \"Kunarac\"- are examples of the ICTY making indictments of gender-targeted violence.\n\nIn \"Kunarac,\" The ICTY convicted Serbian men of confining Bosnian Muslim women under the charges of enslavement, which was listed as a crime against humanity in the Statue. There are arguments that the accused should have been found guilty of sexual slavery and of genocide rather than enslavement \n\nFurundžija was a commander of the Jokers- a unit of the Bosnian Croatian Militia, which allegedly attacked villages of Bosnian Muslims through imprisonment, murder, sexual abuse, and other forms of violence- he was accused of participating in the torture involving forced sexual intercourse of a woman at the Jokers' headquarters. The prosecution depended on the testimony of the woman, and this drew debate over the credibility of the victim's memory. The case led to the concern for the survivors of traumatic events in addition to the victims.\n\nThe Čelebići case found four men guilty for committing various acts of violence while detaining Bosnian Muslims in a prison camp. The case is noteworthy for clarifying that the ones responsible of such events include \"not only military commanders, but also civilians holding positions of authority...\" and \"not only persons in de jure positions but also those in such position de facto...\" It is also the first conviction of an accused person for the charges of rape by the ICTY \n\nGender and security sector reform\n"}

In terms of popular support, few whites would not vote for the UBP (In an April 2009 poll, some 85% of whites would vote for the party, while only 4% would vote PLP), while black voters favoured the PLP (in the aforementioned poll, 62% of blacks would vote PLP, 14% UBP). White rejection of the PLP is often linked to repeated racist rhetoric from the party, aimed not only at whites but at black opponents, who have been referred to as \"house niggers\" (race traitors). The party has even been described as a \"write-off\" in terms of diversity by members of the Portuguese-Bermudian community, which is often regarded as a separate ethnic/racial group. Black rejection of the UBP stems from associating the party with racial segregation and slavery; while formed in the 1960s, white old money that was involved in those institutions supports the party. Within the House of Assembly of Bermuda, there is negligible white presence, with only five white MPs (four UBP and one PLP) out of thirty-six (around 14%); in the appointed Senate of Bermuda, the white presence is three out of eleven (around 27%).\n\nEconomically the advantage lies in the white population, with white holding higher positions and earning higher incomes; these figures do not distinguish between Bermudians and temporary expatriate workers, however, leading to exaggerated figures stemming from the hire of executives from the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom (thus, typically white), and the hire of unskilled, poorly treated labourers from the Caribbean, Jamaica in particular, (thus, typically black) and so leave their relevance unknown.\n\nSociologist Dr Syed Farid Alatas pointed out \"We do not live according to the three principles for harmonious relations – recognising the multi-cultural origins of civilization, inter-religious encounters and showing respect and understanding the point of the other,\" \"We have little appreciation for each other’s religion and culture.\" \"Our education system does not inculcate these attitudes in us but instead tends to polarise us. We have little appreciation for each other’s religion and culture. In China, there is a strong interaction between Islam and Chinese culture.\" He also said \"Dialogue is a matter of national integration but the Malaysian education system does not inculcate the three pre-requisites for inter-religious cooperation and relations\".\n\nWhen asked why this was so, Rais stated that in national schools, there is \"too much religion, too much Islam. They became frightened. That is the big impediment to the races studying together under one roof.\" He then recommended \"Have religious classes by all means. But keep away Islam from other aspects of life in the school. No doa (Muslim prayers) at the assembly, no doa in the classroom except during religious classes.\" (see Issues in Malaysian Education)\n\n"}
{"id": "634444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=634444", "title": "Social structure", "text": "Social structure\n\nIn the social sciences, social structure is the patterned social arrangements in society that are both emergent from and determinant of the actions of the individuals. On the macro scale, social structure is the system of socioeconomic stratification (e.g., the class structure), social institutions, or, other patterned relations between large social groups. On the meso scale, it is the structure of social network ties between individuals or organizations. On the micro scale, it can be the way norms shape the behavior of individuals within the social system.\n\nSocial norms influence social structure through relations between the majority and the minority. Because those who align with the majority are considered normal while those who align with the minority are considered abnormal, majority-minority relations create a hierarchical stratification within social structures that favors the majority in all aspects of society.\n\nThese scales are not always kept separate. For example, recent scholarship by John Levi Martin has theorized that certain macro-scale structures are the emergent properties of micro-scale cultural institutions (this meaning of \"structure\" resembles that used by anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss). Likewise, another recent study, in ethnography, describes how indigenous social structure in the Republic of Panama changed macro social structures and impeded a planned Panama Canal expansion. Marxist sociology also has a history of mixing different meanings of social structure, though it has done so by simply treating the cultural aspects of social structure as epiphenomena of its economic ones.\n\nSince the 1920s, the term has been in general use in social science, especially as a variable whose sub-components needed to be distinguished in relationship to other sociological variables.\n\nThe notion of social structure \"as relationship between different entities or groups\" or as \"enduring and relatively stable patterns of relationship\" emphasises the idea that society is grouped into structurally related groups or sets of roles, with different functions, meanings or purposes. One example of social structure is the idea of \"social stratification\", which refers to the idea that most societies are separated into different strata (levels), guided (if only partially) by the underlying structures in the social system. This approach has been important in the academic literature with the rise of various forms of structuralism. It is important in the modern study of organizations, because an organization's structure may determine its flexibility, capacity to change, and many other factors. Therefore, structure is an important issue for management.\n\nSocial structure may be seen to influence important social systems including the economic system, legal system, political system, cultural system, and others. Family, religion, law, economy, and class are all social structures. The \"social system\" is the parent system of those various systems that are embedded in it.\n\nThe early study of social structures has informed the study of institutions, culture and agency, social interaction, and history. Alexis de Tocqueville was apparently the first to use the term social structure; later, Karl Marx, Herbert Spencer, Max Weber, Ferdinand Tönnies, and Émile Durkheim all contributed to structural concepts in sociology. Weber investigated and analyzed the institutions of modern society: market, bureaucracy (private enterprise and public administration), and politics (e.g. democracy).\n\nOne of the earliest and most comprehensive accounts of social structure was provided by Karl Marx, who related political, cultural, and religious life to the mode of production (an underlying economic structure). Marx argued that the economic base substantially determined the cultural and political superstructure of a society. Subsequent Marxist accounts, such as that by Louis Althusser, proposed a more complex relationship that asserted the relative autonomy of cultural and political institutions, and a general determination by economic factors only \"in the last instance\".\n\nIn 1905, the German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies first published his study \"The Present Problems of Social Structure\" in the U.S.A, arguing that only the \"constitution\" of a multitude into a unity creates a \"social structure\" (basing this approach on his concept of social will).\n\nÉmile Durkheim (drawing on the analogies between biological and social systems popularized by Herbert Spencer and others) introduced the idea that diverse social institutions and practices played a role in assuring the functional integration of society through assimilation of diverse parts into a unified and self-reproducing whole. In this context, Durkheim distinguished two forms of structural relationship: mechanical solidarity and organic solidarity. The former describes structures that unite similar parts through a shared culture; the latter describes differentiated parts united through social exchange and material interdependence.\n\nAs did Marx and Weber, more generally, Georg Simmel developed a wide-ranging approach that provided observations and insights into domination and subordination, competition, division of labor, formation of parties, representation, inner solidarity coupled with exclusiveness toward the outside, and many similar features in the state, in a religious community, in an economic association, in an art school, and in family and kinship networks (however diverse the interests that give rise to these associations, the forms in which interests are realized may yet be identical (Crothers, 1996)).\n\nThe notion of social structure was extensively developed in the 20th century, with key contributions from structuralist perspectives drawing on the theories of Claude Lévi-Strauss, Feminist or Marxist perspectives, from functionalist perspectives such as those developed by Talcott Parsons and his followers, or from a variety of analytic perspectives (see Blau 1975, Lopez and Scott 2000). Some follow Marx in trying to identify the basic dimensions of society that explain the other dimensions, most emphasizing either economic production or political power. Others follow Lévi-Strauss in seeking logical order in cultural structures. Still others, notably Peter Blau, follow Simmel in attempting to base a formal theory of social structure on numerical patterns in relationships—analyzing, for example, the ways in which factors like group size shape intergroup relations.\n\nThe notion of social structure is intimately related to a variety of central topics in social science, including the relation of structure and agency. The most influential attempts to combine the concept of social structure with agency are Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration and Pierre Bourdieu's practice theory. Giddens emphasizes the duality of structure and agency, in the sense that structures and agency cannot be conceived apart from one another. This permits him to argue that structures are neither independent of actors nor determining of their behavior, but rather sets of rules and competencies on which actors draw, and which, in the aggregate, they reproduce. Giddens's analysis, in this respect, closely parallels Jacques Derrida's deconstruction of the binaries that underlie classic sociological and anthropological reasoning (notably the universalizing tendencies of Lévi-Strauss's structuralism). Bourdieu's practice theory also seeks a more supple account of social structure as embedded in, rather than determinative of, individual behavior.\n\nOther recent work by Margaret Archer (morphogenesis theory), Tom R. Burns and collaborators (actor-system dynamics theory and social rule system theory), and Immanuel Wallerstein (World Systems Theory) provided elaborations and applications of the sociological classics in structural sociology.\n\nAs noted above, social structure has been identified as\n\nLopez and Scott (2000) distinguish between \"institutional structure\" and \"relational structure\", where in the former:\n\nwhereas in the latter:\n\nSocial structure can also be divided into microstructure and macrostructure. Microstructure is the pattern of relations between most basic elements of social life, that cannot be further divided and have no social structure of their own (for example, pattern of relations between individuals in a group composed of individuals - where individuals have no social structure, or a structure of organizations as a pattern of relations between social positions or social roles, where those positions and roles have no structure by themselves). Macrostructure is thus a kind of 'second level' structure, a pattern of relations between objects that have their own structure (for example, a political social structure between political parties, as political parties have their own social structure). Some types of social structures that modern sociologist differentiate are \"relation structures\" (in family or larger family-like clan structures), \"communication structures\" (how information is passed in organizations) and \"sociometric structures\" (structures of sympathy, antipathy and indifference in organisations - this was studied by Jacob L. Moreno).\n\nSocial rule system theory reduces the structures of (3) to particular rule system arrangements, that is, the types of basic structures of (1 and 2). It shares with role theory, organizational and institutional sociology, and network analysis the concern with structural properties and developments and at the same time provides detailed conceptual tools needed to generate interesting, fruitful propositions and models and analyses.\n\nSociologists also distinguish between:\n\nSome believe that social structure is naturally developed. It may be caused by larger system needs, such as the need for labour, management, professional and military classes, or by conflicts between groups, such as competition among political parties or among elites and masses. Others believe that this structuring is not a result of natural processes, but is socially constructed. It may be created by the power of elites who seek to retain their power, or by economic systems that place emphasis upon competition or cooperation. \n\nEthnography has contributed to understandings about social structure by revealing local practices and customs that differ from Western practices of hierarchy and economic power in its construction.\n\nThe most thorough account of the evolution of social structure is perhaps provided by structure and agency accounts that allow for a sophisticated analysis of the co-evolution of social structure and human agency, where socialised agents with a degree of autonomy take action in social systems where their action is on the one hand mediated by existing institutional structure and expectations but may, on the other hand, influence or transform that institutional structure. \n\nThe notion of social structure may mask systematic biases, as it involves many identifiable subvariables, for example, gender. Some argue that men and women who have otherwise equal qualifications receive different treatment in the workplace because of their gender, which would be termed a \"social structural\" bias, but other variables (such as time on the job or hours worked) might be masked. Modern social structural analysis takes this into account through multivariate analysis and other techniques, but the analytic problem of how to combine various aspects of social life into a whole remains.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10177813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10177813", "title": "Splitting (psychology)", "text": "Splitting (psychology)\n\nSplitting (also called black-and-white thinking or all-or-nothing thinking) is the failure in a person's thinking to bring together the dichotomy of both positive and negative qualities of the self and others into a cohesive, realistic whole. It is a common defense mechanism used by many people. The individual tends to think in extremes (i.e., an individual's actions and motivations are \"all\" good or \"all\" bad with no middle ground).\n\nThe concept of splitting was first described by Ronald Fairbairn in his formulation of object relations theory; it begins as the inability of the infant to combine the fulfilling aspects of the parents (the good object) and their unresponsive aspects (the unsatisfying object) into the same individuals, instead seeing the good and bad as separate. In psychoanalytic theory this functions as a defense mechanism.\n\nSplitting creates instability in relationships because one person can be viewed as either personified virtue or personified vice at different times, depending on whether they gratify the subject's needs or frustrate them. This, along with similar oscillations in the experience and appraisal of the self, leads to chaotic and unstable relationship patterns, identity diffusion, and mood swings. The therapeutic process can be greatly impeded by these oscillations, because the therapist too can come to be seen as all good or all bad. To attempt to overcome the negative effects on treatment outcome, constant interpretations by the therapist are needed.\n\nSplitting contributes to unstable relationships and intense emotional experiences. Splitting is common during adolescence, but is regarded as transient. Splitting has been noted especially with persons diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Treatment strategies have been developed for individuals and groups based on dialectical behavior therapy, and for couples. There are also self-help books on related topics such as mindfulness and emotional regulation that claim to be helpful for individuals who struggle with the consequences of splitting.\n\nSplitting is a relatively common defense mechanism for people with borderline personality disorder. One of the DSM IV-TR criteria for this disorder is a description of splitting: \"a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation\". In psychoanalytic theory, people with borderline personality disorder are not able to integrate the good and bad images of both self and others, resulting in a \"bad representation\" which dominates the \"good representation\". This school hypothesizes that they consequently experience love and sexuality as perverse and violent qualities which they cannot integrate with the tender, intimate side of relationships.\n\nPeople matching the diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder also use splitting as a central defense mechanism. Most often narcissists do this as an attempt to stabilize their sense of self positivity in order to preserve their self-esteem, by perceiving themselves as purely upright or admirable and others who do not conform to their will or values as purely wicked or contemptible.\n\nThe cognitive habit of splitting also implies the use of other related defense mechanisms, namely idealization and devaluation, which are preventive attitudes or reactions to narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury.\n\nIn depression, exaggerated all-or-nothing thinking can form a self-reinforcing cycle: these thoughts might be called \"emotional amplifiers\" because, as they go around and around, they become more intense. Typical all-or-nothing thoughts:\n\nSplits in consciousness (\"normal self\" vs. \"secondary self\") was first described by Pierre Janet in \"De l'Automatisme Psychologique\" (1889). His ideas were extended by Bleuler (who in 1908 coined the word schizofrenia from the Ancient Greek \"skhízō\" and \"phrḗn\" ) and Freud to explain the splitting () of consciousness, not (with Janet) as the product of innate weakness, but as the result of inner conflict. With the development of the idea of repression, splitting moved to the background of Freud's thought for some years, being largely reserved for cases of double personality. However, his late work saw a renewed interest in how it was \"possible for the ego to avoid a rupture... by effecting a cleavage or division of itself\", a theme which was extended in his \"Outline of Psycho-Analysis\" (1940a [1938]) beyond fetishism to the neurotic in general.\n\nHis daughter Anna Freud explored how in healthy childhood development a splitting of loving and aggressive instincts could be avoided.\n\nThere was, however, from early on, another use of the term \"splitting\" in Freud, referring rather to resolving ambivalence \"by splitting the contradictory feelings so that one person is only loved, another one only hated ... the good mother and the wicked stepmother in fairy tales\". Or, with opposing feelings of love and hate, perhaps \"the two opposites should have been split apart and one of them, usually the hatred, has been repressed\". Such splitting was closely linked to the defence of \"isolation ... The division of objects into congenial and uncongenial ones ... making 'disconnections'.\"\n\nIt was the latter sense of the term that was predominantly adopted and exploited by Melanie Klein. After Freud, \"the most important contribution has come from Melanie Klein, whose work enlightens the idea of 'splitting of the object' (\"\") (in terms of 'good/bad' objects)\". In her object relations theory, Klein argues that \"the earliest experiences of the infant are split between wholly good ones with 'good' objects and wholly bad experiences with 'bad' objects\", as children struggle to integrate the two primary drives, love and hate, into constructive social interaction. An important step in childhood development is the gradual depolarization of these two drives.\n\nAt what Klein called the paranoid-schizoid position, there is a stark separation of the things the child loves (good, gratifying objects) and the things the child hates (bad, frustrating objects), \"because everything is polarised into extremes of love and hate, just like what the baby seems to experience and young children are still very close to.\" Klein refers to the \"good breast\" and the \"bad breast\" as split mental entities, resulting from the way \"these primitive states tend to deconstruct objects into 'good' and 'bad' bits (called 'part-objects')\". The child sees the breasts as opposite in nature at different times, although they actually are the same, belonging to the same mother. As the child learns that people and objects can be good \"and\" bad at the same time, he or she progresses to the next phase, the depressive position, which \"entails a steady, though painful, approximation towards the reality of oneself and others\": integrating the splits and \"being able to balance [them] out ... are tasks that continue into early childhood and indeed are never completely finished.\"\n\nHowever, Kleinians also utilize Freud's first conception of splitting, to explain the way \"In a related process of splitting, the person divides his own self. This is called 'splitting of the ego'.\" Indeed, Klein herself maintained that \"the ego is incapable of splitting the object—internal or external—without a corresponding splitting taking place within the ego\". Arguably at least, by this point \"the idea of splitting does not carry the same meaning for Freud and for Klein\": for the former, \"the ego finds itself 'passively' split, as it were. For Klein and the post-Kleinians, on the other hand, splitting is an 'active' defence mechanism\". As a result, by the close of the century \"four kinds of splitting can be clearly identified, among many other possibilities\" for post-Kleinians: \"a coherent split in the object, a coherent split in the ego, a fragmentation of the object, and a fragmentation of the ego.\"\n\nIn the developmental model of Otto Kernberg, the overcoming of splitting is also an important developmental task. The child has to learn to integrate feelings of love and hate. Kernberg distinguishes three different stages in the development of a child with respect to splitting:\n\nIf a person fails to accomplish this developmental task satisfactorily, borderline pathology can emerge. \"In the borderline personality organization\", Kernberg found 'dissociated ego states that result from the use of \"splitting\" defences'. His therapeutic work then aimed at \"the analysis of the repeated and oscillating projections of unwanted self and object representations onto the therapist\" so as to produce \"something more durable, complex and encompassing than the initial, split-off and polarized state of affairs\".\n\nHeinz Kohut has emphasized in his self psychology the distinction between horizontal and vertical forms of splitting. Traditional psychoanalysis saw repression as forming a horizontal barrier between different levels of the mind – so that for example an unpleasant truth might be accepted superficially but denied in a deeper part of the psyche. Kohut contrasted with this vertical fractures of the mind into two parts with incompatible attitudes separated by mutual disavowal.\n\nIt has been suggested that interpretation of the transference \"becomes effective through a sort of splitting of the ego into a reasonable, judging portion and an experiencing portion, the former recognizing the latter as not appropriate in the present and as coming from the past\". Clearly, \"in this sense, splitting, so far from being a pathological phenomenon, is a manifestation of self-awareness\". Nevertheless, \"it remains to be investigated how this desirable 'splitting of the ego' and 'self-observation' are to be differentiated from the pathological cleavage ... directed at preserving isolations\".\n"}

Telematic art challenges the traditional relationship between active viewing subjects and passive art objects by creating interactive, behavioural contexts for remote aesthetic encounters. \"Telematics\" was first coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in \"The Computerization of Society\". Roy Ascott sees the telematic art form as the transformation of the viewer into an active participator of creating the artwork which remains in process throughout its duration. Ascott has been at the forefront of the theory and practice of telematic art since 1978 when he went online for the first time, organizing different collaborative online projects.\n\nAlthough Ascott was the first person to name this phenomenon, the first use of telecommunications as an artistic medium has occurred in 1922 when the Hungarian constructivist artist László Moholy-Nagy made the work \"Telephone Pictures\". This work questioned the idea of the isolated individual artist and the unique art object. In 1932 Bertold Brecht emphasized the idea of telecommunications as an artistic medium in his essay 'The Radio as an Apparatus of Communication'. In this essay Brecht advocated the two-way communication for radio to give the public the power of representation and to pull it away from the control of corporate media. Art historian Edward A. Shanken has authored several historical accounts of telematic art, including \"From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott.\"\n\nIn 1977 'Satellite Arts Project' by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz used satellites to connect artists on the east and west coast of the United States. This was the first time that artists were connected in a telematic way. With the support of NASA the artists produced composite images of participants, enabling an interactive dance concert amongst geographically disparate performers. An estimated audience of 25,000 saw bi-coastal discussions on the impact of new technologies on art, and improvised, interactive dance and music performances that were mixed in real time and shown on a split screen. These first satellite works emphasized the primacy of process that remained central to the theory and practice of telematic art.\n\nAscott used telematics for the first time in 1978 when he organized a computer-conferencing project between the United States and the United Kingdom called \"Terminal Art\". For this project he used Jacques Vallée's Infomedia Notepad System, which made it possible for the users to retrieve and add information stored in the computer’s memory. This made it possible to interact with a group of people to make \"aesthetic encounters more participatory, culturally diverse, and richly layered with meaning\". Ascott did more similar projects like \"Ten Wings\" which was part of Robert Adrian’s \"The World in 24 Hours\" in 1982. The most important telematic artwork of Ascott is \"La Plissure du Texte\" from 1983. This project allowed Ascott and other artists to participate in collectively creating texts to an emerging story by using computer networking. This participation has been termed as ‘distributed authorship’. But the most significant matter of this project is the interactivity of the artwork and the way it breaks the barriers of time and space. In the late 1980s the interest in this kind of project using computer networking expanded, especially with the release of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s.\n\nThanks to the Minitel, France had a public telematic infrastructure more than a decade before the emergence of the World Wide Web in 1994. This enabled a different style of telematic art than the point-to-point technologies to which other locations were limited in the 1970s and 1980s. As reported by Don Foresta, Karen O'Rourke, and Gilbertto Prado, several French artists made some collective art experiments using the Minitel, among them Jean-Claude Anglade, Jacques-Elie Chabert, Frédéric Develay, Jean-Marc Philippe, Fred Forest, Marc Denjean and Olivier Auber. These mostly-forgotten experiments (with notable exceptions like the still-active Poietic Generator) foreshadowed later web applications, especially the social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, even as they offered theoretical critiques of them.\n\nTelematic art is now being used more frequently by televised performers. Shows such as \"American Idol\" that are based highly form viewer polls incorporate telematic art. This type of consumer applications is now grouped under the term \"transmedia\".\n\n\n\n"}

It differs from the ‘supernatural’ and the ‘rational’ in that it neither directly controverts nor affirms logical sense or reason. A transrational experience is not pathological. The transrational does not engage with the question of how to sensibly fit an experience into a rational framework, instead allowing the experience to remain as it was experienced or witnessed, uninterpreted by rational sensemaking or meaning-making. The experience is what it is and is taken on its own terms.\n\nThe concept was first conceptualized in this sense by Jungian analyst Jerome Bernstein in 2000, however it had also been used to very different effect by Ken Wilber in his 1995 book, \"Sex, Ecology, Spirituality\".\n\nPeople are so afraid of being considered pre-rational that they avoid and deny the very possibility of the transrational.

{"id": "73511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73511", "title": "T–V distinction", "text": "T–V distinction\n\nIn sociolinguistics, a T–V distinction (from the Latin pronouns and ) is a contrast, within one language, between various forms of addressing one's conversation partner or partners that are specialized for varying levels of politeness, social distance, courtesy, familiarity, age or insult toward the addressee. Many languages lack this type of distinction, instead relying on more explicit wording to convey these meanings. The morphosyntactic T–V distinction, though, is found in a variety of languages around the world.\n\nEnglish does not have a T–V distinction, with the exception of a few dialects. There previously was one with the pronouns \"thou\" and \"you\", with the familiar \"thou\" disappearing from Early Modern English. Additionally British commoners have historically spoken to nobility and royalty using the third person rather than the second person, a practice that has fallen out of favor. English speakers today often employ semantic analogues to convey the mentioned attitudes towards the addressee, such as whether to address someone by given or surname, or whether to use \"sir\"/\"ma'am\". Under a broader classification, T and V forms are examples of honorifics.\n\nThe T–V distinction is expressed in a variety of forms. Two particularly common means are\n\nThe terms T and V, based on the Latin pronouns and , were first used in a paper by the social psychologist Roger Brown and the Shakespearian scholar Albert Gilman. This was a historical and contemporary survey of the uses of pronouns of address, seen as semantic markers of social relationships between individuals. The study considered mainly French, Italian, Spanish and German. The paper was highly influential and with few exceptions, the terms T and V have been used in subsequent studies.\n\nIn Latin, was originally the singular, and the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. According to Brown and Gilman, usage of the plural to the Roman emperor began in the 4th century AD. They mention the possibility that this was because there were two emperors at that time (in Constantinople and Rome), but also mention that \"plurality is a very old and ubiquitous metaphor for power\". This usage was extended to other powerful figures, such as Pope Gregory I (590–604). However, Brown and Gilman note that it was only between the 12th and 14th centuries that the norms for the use of T- and V-forms crystallized. Less commonly, the use of the plural may be extended to other persons, such as the \"royal \"we\"\" (majestic plural) in English.\n\nBrown and Gilman argued that the choice of form is governed by either relationships of 'power' and/or 'solidarity', depending on the culture of the speakers, showing that 'power' had been the dominant predictor of form in Europe until the 20th century. Thus, it was quite normal for a powerful person to use a T-form but expect a V-form in return. However, in the twentieth century the dynamic shifted in favour of solidarity, so that people would use T-forms with those they knew, and V-forms in service encounters, with reciprocal usage being the norm in both cases.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages (the 5th century to the 10th century), the pronoun was used to address the most exalted figures, emperors and popes, who would use the pronoun to address a subject. This use was progressively extended to other states and societies, and down the social hierarchy as a mark of respect to individuals of higher rank, religious authority, greater wealth, or seniority within a family. The development was slow and erratic, but a consistent pattern of use is estimated to have been reached in different European societies by the period 1100 to 1500. Use of V spread to upper-class individuals of equal rank, but not to lower class individuals.\nThis may be represented in Brown and Gilman's notation:\n\nSpeakers developed greater flexibility of pronoun use by redefining relationships between individuals. Instead of defining the father–son relationship as one of power, it could be seen as a shared family relationship. Brown and Gilman term this the semantics of solidarity. Thus a speaker might have a choice of pronoun, depending on how they perceived the relationship with the person addressed. Thus a speaker with superior power might choose V to express fellow feeling with a subordinate. For example, a restaurant customer might use V to their favourite waiter. Similarly a subordinate with a friendly relationship of long standing might use T. For example, a child might use T to express affection for their parent.\n\nThis may be represented as:\nThese choices were available not only to reflect permanent relationships, but to express momentary changes of attitude. This allowed playwrights such as Racine, Molière, Ben Johnson, Marlowe and Shakespeare to express a character's inner changes of mood through outward changes of pronoun.\n\nFor centuries, it was the more powerful individual who chose to address a subordinate either with T or with V, or to allow the subordinate to choose. For this reason, the pronouns were traditionally defined as the \"pronoun of either condescension or intimacy\" (T) and \"the pronoun of reverence or formality\" (V). Brown and Gilman argue that modern usage no longer supports these definitions.\n\nDevelopments from the nineteenth century have seen the solidarity semantic more consistently applied. It has become less acceptable for a more powerful individual to exercise the choice of pronoun. Officers in most armies are not permitted to address a soldier as T. Most European parents cannot oblige their children to use V. The relationships illustrated above have changed in the direction of the following norms:\nThe tendency to promote the solidarity semantic may lead to the abolition of any choice of address pronoun. During the French Revolution attempts were made to abolish V. In 17th century England the Society of Friends obliged its members to use only T to everyone, and some continue to use T (\"thee\") to one another. In most Modern English dialects the choice of T no longer exists outside of poetry.\n\nIt was reported in 2012 that use of the French and the Spanish are in decline in social media. An explanation offered was that such online communications favour the philosophy of equality, regardless of usual formal distinctions. Similar tendencies were observed in German, Persian and Chinese as well as in Italian.\n\nThe Old English and Early Middle English second person pronouns and (with variants) were used for singular and plural reference respectively with no T–V distinction. The earliest entry in the Oxford English Dictionary for \"ye\" as a V pronoun in place of the singular \"thou\" exists in a Middle English text of 1225 composed in 1200. The usage may have started among the Norman French nobility in imitation of French. It made noticeable advances during the second half of the 13th century. During the 16th century, the distinction between the subject form \"ye\" and the object form \"you\" was largely lost, leaving \"you\" as the usual V pronoun (and plural pronoun). After 1600, the use of \"ye\" in standard English was confined to literary and religious contexts or as a consciously archaic usage.\n\nDavid Crystal summarises Early Modern English usage thus:\n\nV would normally be used\n\nT would normally be used\n\nThe T–V distinction was still well preserved when Shakespeare began writing at the end of the 16th century. However, other playwrights of the time made less use of T–V contrasts than Shakespeare. The infrequent use of T in popular writing earlier in the century such as the Paston Letters suggest that the distinction was already disappearing from gentry speech. In the first half of the 17th century, \"thou\" disappeared from Standard English, although the T–V distinction was preserved in many regional dialects. When the Quakers began using \"thou\" again in the middle of the century, many people were still aware of the old T–V distinction and responded with derision and physical violence.\n\nIn the 19th century, one aspect of the T–V distinction was restored to some English dialects in the form of a pronoun that expressed friendly solidarity, written as \"y'all\". Unlike earlier \"thou\", it was used primarily for plural address, and in some dialects for singular address as well. The pronoun was first observed in the southern states of the US among African-American speakers, although its precise origin is obscure. The pronoun spread rapidly to White speakers in those southern states, and (to a lesser extent) other regions of the US and beyond. This pronoun is not universally accepted, and may be regarded as either nonstandard or a regionalism.\n\n\"Yous(e)\" (pron. , ) as a plural is found mainly in (Northern) England, Scotland, parts of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, northern Nova Scotia and parts of Ontario in Canada and parts of the northeastern United States (especially areas where there was historically Irish or Italian immigration), including in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and scattered throughout working class Italian-American communities in the American Rust Belt. It also occurs in Scouse (the regional dialect of the Liverpool area).\n\nIn Old French texts, the pronouns and are often used interchangeably to address an individual, sometimes in the same sentence. However, some emerging pattern of use has been detected by recent scholars. Between characters equal in age or rank, was more common than as a singular address. However, was sometimes used to put a young man in his place, or to express temporary anger. There may also have been variation between Parisian use and that of other regions.\n\nIn the Middle French period a relatively stable T–V distinction emerged. \"Vous\" was the V form used by upper-class speakers to address one another, while was the T form used among lower class speakers. Upper-class speakers could choose to use either T or V when addressing an inferior. Inferiors would normally use V to a superior. However, there was much variation; in 1596 in his comprehensive survey observed that the French sometimes used to inferiors as well as to superiors \"\" (\"according to our natural tendencies\"). In poetry, was often used to address kings or to speak to God.\n\nThe boundaries between formal and informal language differ from language to language, as well as within social groups of the speakers of a given language. In some circumstances, it is not unusual to call other people by first name and the respectful form, or last name and familiar form. For example, German teachers use the former construct with upper-secondary students, while Italian teachers typically use the latter (switching to a full V-form with university students). This can lead to constructions denoting an intermediate level of formality in T–V-distinct languages that sound awkward to English-speakers. In Italian, can be addressed with the (familiar) form or the (formal) one, but complete addresses range from (peer to peer or family) and (teacher or fellow student to high-school student, as stated above) to (live-in servant to master or master's son) and (senior staff member to junior) and (among peers).\n\nThe use of these forms may be an issue for compensating translation of dialogue into English if the translator does not wish to use the \"thou\" pronoun to translate. For example, a character in a French film or novel saying \"\" (\"Use [the informal pronoun] when addressing me!\") might be translated \"Do not be so formal!\" or \"Call me by my first name!\"\n\nConversely, when translating from English to a T–V language, the translator must decide again and again throughout the work which second-person form the reader would deem the more appropriate in a given situation. In the current German DVD release of \"Gone with the Wind\", the translators of the dubbed soundtrack and of the subtitles sometimes make opposite decisions; the actors dubbed voices speak with the familiar form, while the subtitles for the same scene are more formal.\n\nIn many languages, the respectful singular pronoun derives from a plural form. Some Romance languages have familiar forms derived from the Latin singular and respectful forms derived from Latin plural , sometimes via a circuitous route. Sometimes, singular V-form derives from a third person pronoun; in German and some Nordic languages, it is the third person \"plural\". Some languages have separate T and V forms for both singular and plural; others have the same form; others have a T–V distinction only in the singular.\n\nDifferent languages distinguish pronoun uses in different ways. Even within languages, there are differences between groups (older people and people of higher status tending both to use and to expect more respectful language) and between various aspects of one language. For example, in Dutch, V form is slowly falling into disuse in the plural, thus one could sometimes address a group as T form (which clearly expresses the plural) when one would address each member individually as (which has the disadvantage of being ambiguous). In Latin American Spanish, the opposite change has occurred – having lost the T form , Latin Americans address all groups as , even if the group is composed of friends whom they would call or (both T forms). In Standard Peninsular Spanish however, (literally, \"you others\") is still regularly employed in familiar conversation. In some cases V-forms are likely to be capitalized when written.\n\nThe following is a table of the nominative case of the singular and plural second person in many languages, including their respectful variants (if any):\n\nModern Afrikaans rarely makes the distinction between the informal and (\"you\" subject and \"your\" / \"you\" object) and the more formal (or when addressing God), although sometimes it is upheld in a formal setting, such as in politics, business or in a polite conversation. The trend is moving towards using the informal pronoun most often.\n\nOld Dutch did not appear to have a T–V distinction. was used as the second-person singular, and as the second-person plural. In early Middle Dutch, influenced by Old French usage, the original plural pronoun (or in the north) came to be used as a respectful singular pronoun, creating a T–V distinction. However, the formal started to be used in more and more situations. By the 17th century, had largely fallen out of use, although it lingered on in some of the more peripheral areas. At this point, the original T–V distinction had been lost, and the original V-pronoun / was used universally for both singular and plural regardless of the type of address. This resembled the state of English today, which has also (outside of dialectal, literary or religious use) lost its original T-pronoun \"thou\".\n\nAround this time, a new formal pronoun started to come into use. This was also the object form of the subject pronoun /, and how it came to be used as a subject pronoun is not exactly clear. It is usually related to a form of address in writing of the time: letters were often addressed formally to , standing for (\"Your Highness\"), which is thought to have been shortened to eventually. It can be compared to the Spanish , which is a similar contraction of a phrase of indirect address. As in Spanish, the Dutch was originally conjugated as the third person in verbs, although most verbs had identical second- and third-person singular forms, so that this difference was not apparent for the most part. It remains today in the use of (\"you (formal) have\", like \"he has\"), compared to (\"you (informal) have\"). However, is now also common.\n\nAround the same time, it became more common to clarify when multiple people were being spoken to, by adding , (\"people\"), or a shortened variety, to the end of the pronoun. Thus, when speaking to multiple people, one would use or . This combination was contracted and fused over time, eventually resulting in , the informal plural pronoun that is used today. It can be compared, in its origin, to the English \"y'all\" or Spanish .\n\nModern northern Dutch, and usually standard Dutch as well, has two forms of second person pronouns, namely and . is the formal pronoun, whereas is used as the informal personal pronoun to address a single person. In the plural, is also used, alongside the informal . In the south, only one pronoun, , is generally used in all three roles: both singular and plural, formal and informal. \"U\" is sometimes also used in formal situations, but the southern does not have a distinct informal connotation like the northern/standard , and can be used to address anyone without offence. Religious Dutch speakers in all areas address God using either or ; is never used. For speakers of the north, this is usually the only place where is encountered, giving it a formal and archaic tone, even though it is neutral in the southern areas where it is still used.\n\nThe pronoun (unstressed variant of ) can also be used impersonally, corresponding to the English generic you. The more formal Dutch term corresponding to English generic you or one is .\n\nIn Dutch the formal personal pronoun is used for older people or for people with a higher or equal status, unless the addressed makes it clear they want to be spoken to with the informal pronoun. Unlike for example in German, there is no defined line (in the case of German, roughly when someone passes the age of 16) in which everyone, apart from family, is addressed with the formal pronoun. Addressing parents by has become very rare; is often even used to address grandparents. There is also a tendency towards more use of the informal pronoun. Some companies such as IKEA consciously address their customers with the informal . However, can still be considered more or less obligatory in situations where, for example, a pupil addresses their teacher, people testify in court or communication between a doctor and their patient.\n\nContemporary English generally uses only the form \"you\", regardless of level of familiarity.\n\nOld English used in the second-person singular for both formal and informal contexts. Following the Norman Conquest, the Middle English that emerged continued to use ' at first, but by the 13th century, Norman French influence had led to the use of the second-person plural or in formal contexts.\n\nIn Early Modern English superiors and strangers were therefore respectfully addressed as \"ye\" in the nominative and \"you\" in the objective; \"thou\" and \"thee\" were used for familiars and subordinates. The more widespread and observed this division became, the more pejorative it became to strangers to be called by the familiar form of address. By the 17th century, such a use among the nobility was strongly and deliberately contemptuous, as in the declamation of the prosecutor at Sir Walter Raleigh's 1603 trial \"I thou thee, thou traitor!\" Accordingly, the use of \"thou\" began to decline and it was effectively extinct in the everyday speech of most English dialects by the early 18th century, supplanted by the polite \"you\", even when addressing children and animals, something also seen in Dutch and Latin America (most of Brazil and parts of Spanish America). Meanwhile, as part of English's continuing development away from its synthetic origins since the influx of French vocabulary following the Norman invasion, \"you\" had been replacing \"ye\" since the 15th century. Standard English was left with a single second-person pronoun for all cases, numbers and contexts and largely incapable of maintaining a T–V distinction.\nNotwithstanding all of this, the translators of the King James version of the Bible chose to employ the older forms in their work (1604–1611) in order to convey the grammatical distinctions made by their Hebrew, Greek and Latin sources. Its subsequent popularity and the religious rationale of many who continued to employ \"thou\" has preserved its use in English, but made it seem pious and ironically \"more\" formal and respectful than the everyday \"you\".\n\nIn the United States, some Protestant sects, such as the Quakers and Mormons insisted on addressing everyone as \"thou\", because they considered every person to be a friend and an equal. This persisted until the 19th or early 20th century.\n\nIn West Frisian, the formal singular nominative (pronounced \"yo\") is very close to the English \"you\" and the Middle and Early Modern English . There is no such distinction in the plural; the plural second person pronoun is always . , a Dutch dialect with strong Frisian influence, parallels this distinction (, , ).\n\nWest Frisian is used slightly more often than Dutch . Native speakers of Dutch are sometimes warned against addressing newly acquainted people with too soon.\n\nIn German, the formal address is the same as the third person plural pronoun . Verbs used with this form of address are also identical to third person plural forms. The polite form and its inflected forms are always capitalized in writing, to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nThe corresponding informal German address is or . The verbs and mean respectively \"to address using \" and \"to address using \" and the phrases or mean, \"to be on du terms\". The use of often coincides with the use of the title plus surname, usage of which is more widespread in German-speaking areas than Anglophone areas. In general terms, is used to children, animals and God, and between adults (or between adults and children) who are good friends of or related to each other. is used in other situations, such as in a business situation or where there is no existing relationship. In Internet chats and forums, Germans rarely use , although there are exceptions. Except in the case of adults addressing children, where it is common for the child to address the adult as , but be addressed as in return, it is not common in German for one party to address the other as , but be addressed as in return. In almost all cases it can be considered as impolite to use the \"wrong\" pronoun, that is a pronoun that is not expected by the other party. However on the other hand, using an unexpected can also be a very welcome sign of affection, and using an unexpected can, in the young, be a very welcome sign of appreciation of the addressed one's maturity.\n\nHigh school students in Germany are often called plus given name () by their teachers when they enter the  — the last 2 or 3 years of high school — around the age of 16.\n\nChildren and teenagers are expected to use when addressing all adults except for family members and family friends whom they have known since early childhood. Street and similar social workers, sports clubs trainers will sometimes tell children and teens to address them with . In shops, bars, and other establishments, if they target a younger audience, it is becoming increasingly common for customers and staff to address each other as , to the degree that it is sometimes considered awkward if a waitress and a customer who are both in their twenties call each other .\n\nThe use of or between two strangers may also be determined by the setting in which they meet (casual/formal), as well as clothing (casual/formal), gender (same/opposite), and personal preference. For example, it is customary to use in traditional small pubs and taverns in certain regions (including the Rhineland). This applies also to older people, whom one would otherwise address as . Two people who addressed each other as in a pub may go back to when they meet in the street if their acquaintance was only very superficial. During the famous Rhenish carnival, it is customary for most revelers to address each other as . Only if the age difference is more than one generation, the younger person might still use . Another setting in which is often used between adults is sporting events.\n\nBeing has also become increasingly common in workplace environments (depending on the line of business and corporate culture to varying degrees), mostly regardless of age. In such environments, the basis may also be observed as a (sometimes necessary) mark of good social integration within a working group. As a rule of thumb, one might expect to see team colleagues on the workplace level in many industries on a customary basis with each other, though not always with the group manager and more rarely with higher-ranking managers. As entrants to a team are more closely integrated, this is often marked by making an informal affirmation to that basis or by formally offering it, as a matter of style and habituality. Both the tempo and extent of using the basis depends much on the culture (and sometimes the climate) of the business, and in some places even more so on that of the particular workgroup itself. Business cultures that pride themselves on a \"flat hierarchy\" are more likely to adopt or accent a general professional parlance of and given name while inside corporations tending to emphasize professional formality, a may be expected to be used always except between very close colleagues or inside closed groups (sometimes including managers meeting on the same level with the exclusion of any subordinates), and strictly always in the presence of a superior. The superior, on the other hand, has the right to address the other perform informally or formally, which is a personal preference.\n\nCustomarily, the switch from to is initially proposed by the elder of the two people, the person with socially higher standing or by the lady to the gentleman. Alternatively, one person may use while they ask the other person if it is acceptable to be addressed informally, and then act accordingly. One way to propose the use of rather than is by stating one's first name (as in: ). One accepts the proposal by introducing one's own first name. Should a person later forget that they have adopted , it is polite to remind them by saying, (We moved on to terms). Sometimes switching back to is used as a method of distancing oneself from the addressee; the connotation is slightly ironic courtesy.\n\nThe inappropriate and uninvited use of towards someone who would otherwise reasonably expect to be addressed as is considered to be condescending and disrespectful, although insistence on in an environment where is largely accepted (flat hierarchies) can be interpreted as being equally disrespectful. The degree of offense that might be taken will depend on how obvious the etiquette violation was (an example of an obvious violation would be a teenager in the street addressing an elderly stranger on the street with , addressing a senior manager with as a result of a misjudged professional relationship would probably be taken with less offense), and will also depend on the upbringing of the person in question – progressive vs. conservative outlooks and age are examples of factors which can play a role in how individuals prefer to be addressed and choose to address others.\n\nIt has become the policy of some businesses for their employees to address customers with , often to set a progressive, \"modern\" tone, occasionally for other cultural reasons. IKEA, for instance, does this to reflect the widespread use of the form in Sweden (see ).\n\nIn Germany, an old custom (called , drinking brotherhood) involves two friends formally sharing a bottle of wine or drinking a glass of beer together to celebrate their agreement to call one another rather than . This custom has also been adopted among the Swiss-French of the Jura, in Poland and Russia (called by its German name, spelled and respectively), though the custom in Poland is now slowly disappearing. It was formerly found also in Sweden.\n\nAlthough the use of generally coincides with the use of title plus surname, especially in northern and eastern Germany, there is an intermediate address combining with the first name (), whereas in the Berlin region, sometimes is combined with the surname (). The former usage also occurs when addressing teenagers, household staff, or guests of TV or radio programs, while the latter style is usually considered inferior and mainly occurs in working class environments. It may be associated with professional contexts, when colleagues have known one another for a long time, but, e. g. due to differences of status, do not want to switch to the usual style; or in situations where strangers (e.g. customers) are present for whom it would not be appropriate to learn the first name of the addressee.\n\nWhen speaking to more than one person in formal situations where one would use to each one of them separately, Standard German uses . However, in this situation can often be heard instead, especially in the South of Germany and in Swiss German dialects, and is standard usage for pastors when preaching. If the standard here is followed, then the usage varies when addressing a group containing both and persons: Some speakers use the informal plural others prefer the formal and many, concerned that both pronouns might cause offence, prefer to use circumlocutions that avoid either pronoun, for example by expressing an imperative in infinitive form (), by applying the passive voice (), or using the indefinite pronoun ().\n\nFormerly, the 2nd person plural (\"ye\") was used to address social superiors, unless more informal relations had been established. The use of as the polite form, as this is the case with in the French language, has still survived in Bernese German and other Alemannic dialects. in this case has to be capitalized. However, itself shows a degree of informality, and would for example be used in addressing one's father. For the formal address, the third person would be used; and this in the singular with , (capitalized) to a social inferior, as a farmer addressing a stableboy, or in the plural to a social superior. It is from the latter occurrences that modern takes its origin; is the 3rd person plural pronoun. However, itself is relatively young, and it was rather the formal addresses, often itself singular forms, that took the plural. Even as late as in Dürrenmatt's \"The Visit\" (written in 1956), an address (\"You do know that, Mr Mayor\", modern German would just say ) can be found; Herr Bürgermeister is the formal address and itself a singular term, but wissen is plural. However, if the formal address itself contains a personal pronoun as in (His Majesty) etc., this one would be put to the 2nd person plural: (not: ) (\"What does [but plural] Your Majesty condescend to order?\")\n\nThus, all these go by a similar grammar rule pertaining to the verb used with these addresses as modern . The dated capitalized address demands the same verb form as the modern second person plural pronoun , the dated / demands the same verb form as the modern third person singular and , and the dated 3rd person plural address without demands, just as itself, the same verb form as the 3rd person plural pronoun (they).\n\nThe forms are still found today in some dialects as a respectful way of addressing elders, and is still very often found in works of art and literature (such as books and movies) depicting events at least several centuries in the past, or in a \"past-like\" fantasy setting, even if modern German is otherwise used in these works; indeed, using the modern in such a setting would be considered an out-of-place anachronism. and the 3rd person plural without is somewhat analogous to the English majestic plural.\n\nThe / form is not widely known or understood by the average person any more. While is often still used in dubbed films, especially in medieval/fantasy contexts such as Lord of the Rings e.g. \"\" (\"you have entered the Realm of the Lady of the Wood, you can not turn back\"). In this context, a historical level is used where the second person plural indicates some nobility of or respect for the addressee, such that from being used to address a single person, the viewer could mostly, without looking, conclude that the person was of elevated rank such as a king or nobleman, or at least being treated with expressed regard. would not normally be used to address a peasant (unless he is a prince in disguise or a future prince and the person addressing him has gathered some knowledge or presumption of that).\n\nIn Danish, the informal second-person singular is and the formal form of address uses the third-person plural , capitalized to distinguish it from its other use. The second-person plural and the third-person singular (\"he\") or (\"she\") were sometimes used until the early 19th century in standard Danish and awhile longer in the countryside. The German-inspired form entered Danish in the 18th century, too late to enter liturgical use. In church, as in rural or dialect-speaking areas, has always been the universal form, especially in Jutland.\n\nAs in other Scandinavian languages, even among the prestige dialects, the formal pronoun is waning in use — in the case of Danish, since the (\"Youth Revolts\") during and after the protests of 1968. As a general rule, the informal is accepted everywhere today, except when addressing royalty or during military service. In other contexts, it has come to seem excessively formal and old-fashioned to most Danes. Even at job interviews and among parliamentarians, has become standard.\n\nIn written Danish, remains current in legal, legislative, and formal business documents, as well as in some translations from other languages. This is sometimes audience-dependent, as in the Danish government's general use of except in healthcare information directed towards the elderly, where is still used. Other times, it is maintained as an affectation, as by the staff of some formal restaurants, the newspaper, TV 2 announcers, and the avowedly conservative Maersk corporation. Attempts by other corporations to avoid sounding either stuffy or too informal by employing circumlocutions — using passive phrasing or using the pronoun (\"one\") — have generally proved awkward and been ill-received, and (with the notable exception of the national railway DSB) most have opted for the more personable form.\n\nModern Icelandic is the Scandinavian dialect closest to Old Norse, which made a distinction between the plural and the dual . This distinction continued in written Icelandic the early 1920 when the plural was also used on formal occasions. The formal usage of seems to have pushed the dual to take over the plural so modern Icelandic normally uses as a plural. However, in formal documents such as by the president is still used as plural, and the usage of as plural and as dual is still retained in the Icelandic translation of the Christian scriptures. There are still a number of fixed expressions — particularly religious adages such as \"seek and ye shall find\" () — and the formal pronoun is sometimes used in translations from a language that adheres to a T–V distinction, but otherwise it appears only when one wants to be excessively formal either from the gravity of the occasion (as in court proceedings and legal correspondence) or out of contempt (in order to ridicule another person's self-importance), and is used in all other cases.\n\nIn Norwegian, the polite form / () and / () has more or less disappeared in both spoken and written language. Norwegians now exclusively use , and the polite form does not have a strong cultural pedigree in the country. Until recently, would sometimes be found in written works, business letters, plays and translations where an impression of formality must be retained. The popular belief that is reserved for the king is incorrect, since according to royal etiquette, the King (and other members of the royal family) will be addressed as ()/ () (Your majesty) or in third person singular as (His majesty), / (Her majesty), (the King), (the Queen) and similar.\n\nNorwegians generally refer to one another by first name only, unless the person is better known by full or last name only. This also contributes to the weakening of these pronouns and a general pattern of declining use of polite speech. For example, a student might address their professor by their first name, but would refer to a leading politician by their last name. Norwegian politicians and celebrities are sometimes referred to by their first names, especially in newspaper headlines, while the text of the article most likely would use the person's last name. Nicknames are not very common.\n\nThe distinction between and exists primarily for written Norwegian (most Norwegians speak dialects that differ from the standard written forms), and the T–V rules are the same for both forms—except that uses the third person plural to indicate politeness (as in German), while uses the second person plural (as in French). In both forms, when these pronouns are used to indicate politeness, they are always capitalised (to show deference, and separate them from when they indicate, respectively, the third and second person plural).\n\nIn Swedish, there has in the last two centuries been a marked difference between usage in Finland Swedish and in Sweden.\n\nIn the Swedish of Sweden, the polite was known from earlier epochs, but had come to be considered somewhat careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost altogether. Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the 1960s.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. In the sixties, the so-called ('thou-reform') was carried out. First, authorities and influential circles tried rehabilitating the in a so-called \" reform\"—but most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, almost overnight and dubbed the \" reform\", the system broke down, and (noted as informal above) became the accepted way of addressing anyone except for royalty.\n\nAddressing royalty went somewhat more slowly from a universal ('Your Majesty'), etc., to that address only on formal occasions, otherwise replaced by third person (singular if the addressee is single) with title ( 'the King', etc.).\n\nThese rules still apply, with marginal exceptions. The vast majority of Swedes, including younger people in most or all situations, stick to the . In order to \"alleviate the intrusion\" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal \"du\" address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial revival.\n\nFinland Swedish has undergone a similar development to mainland Swedish since the 1960s, but slower and slightly less. There, one may have to reckon with influence from the Finnish language, still slightly more conservative. In Finland Swedish, the second person plural form (noted as formal above) was indeed the traditional respectful address to a single person up to the 1970s or so.\n\nSwedish, also, has verbs for the addresses: 'to say ', and 'to say '.\n\nIn Modern Scots the second person singular nominative (, Southern Scots , Shetlandic ) survived in colloquial speech until the mid 19th century in most of lowland Scotland. It has since been replaced by / in most areas except in Insular Scots where (, Shetlandic ) is also used, in North Northern Scots and in some Southern Scots varieties. is used as the familiar form by parents speaking to children, elders to youngsters, or between friends or equals. The second person formal singular or is used when speaking to a superior or when a youngster addresses an elder. The older second person singular possessive (), and (, Shetlandic along with ) still survive to some extent where remains in use.\n\nYiddish makes use of the second person plural form as the polite form for both singular and plural. In the second person plural form (), there is therefore no distinction between formal and informal forms. There is a dialectal pronoun () strictly for informal second-person plural form, but this pronoun is rarely used today and is only found in some dialects of Poland and neighboring regions.\n\nGiven that old German dialects were the main influence on the development of the Yiddish language, this form may be recognized with older polite forms of the German language.\n\nIn most French-speaking regions (Canada is an exception; see \"North American French\" below), a rigid T–V distinction is upheld. With regard to the second person singular, is used informally, whereas is used to convey formality. (The second person plural is always .) The formal is expected when encountering any unknown adult under normal circumstances. In general, the switch from to is \"negotiated\" on a case-by-case basis; it can happen nearly unconsciously, or can be explicitly negotiated. For instance, some couples have been known to call each other for some time while dating, and gradually switch to calling each other . The verb means \"address someone with -forms, speak informally\"; by contrast means \"address someone with forms\". Rigidly sticking to \"vous\" can become equally awkward in a long-standing relationship.\n\nIn certain circumstances, however, is used more broadly. For example, new acquaintances who are conscious of having something socially significant in common (e.g., student status, or the same \"rank\" in some hierarchy) often use \"tu\" more or less immediately. In some cases, there may be an explicitly defined practice in a particular company, political party, as to the use of and . Also, using the in conjunction with someone's given name is rather current in France as a less formal way of addressing someone, e.g. at work, among members of an association etc. Children and adolescents generally use to speak with someone of their own age, whether known or not. can also be used to show disrespect to a stranger, such as when surprising a thief or cursing other drivers on the road.\n\nIn families, was traditionally used to address older family members. Children were taught to use to address their parents, and was used until about 1950 between spouses of the higher classes. Former president Jacques Chirac and his wife Bernadette are a prominent example of the continuation of this usage.\n\nWhen praying, is nowadays often used in addressing the deity, though was used in Catholic prayers until the Second Vatican Council, and is still used to address the Blessed Virgin Mary. In Louisiana, however, is always used to convey a sense of respect and reverence when praying.\n\nIn Walloon, the use of which tends, in any case, to be restricted mostly to \"familiar\" contexts, (equivalent to ) is the general usage and is considered informal and friendly. (equivalent to ), on the other hand, is considered vulgar, and its use can be taken as an expression of an aggressive attitude towards the person addressed. This influence from Walloon affects the usage of and in the French spoken in Belgium, though more so among people accustomed to using Walloon as their everyday language (a tiny minority, mostly in the countryside). The influence of Standard French, particularly as exercised through the mass media, is eroding this particularity among younger French-speakers.\n\nIn the , the use of honorific styles or their abbreviation (literally \"she\", irrespective of the gender of the addressee, as the honorifics were feminine nouns) together with the 3rd person singular was also common. See below for Italian which has kept this style.\n\nNorth American dialects of French, including Quebec French and Acadian French as well as Louisiana French, permit and expect a far broader usage of the familiar than in Standard French. There are still circumstances in which it is necessary to say : in a formal interview (notably for a job) or when addressing people of very high rank (such as judges or prime ministers), senior citizens, between professors and students in universities, towards customers or new acquaintances in a formal setting. As acquaintances become familiar with one another, they may find to be unnecessarily formal and may agree to return to the with which they are generally more comfortable.\n\nFor a number of Francophones in Canada, sounds stilted or snobbish, and archaic. is by no means restricted to intimates or social inferiors. There is however an important minority of people, often those who call for a use of standard French in Quebec, who prefer to be addressed as . At Radio-Canada (the public broadcaster, often considered as establishing the normative objectives of standard French in Canada), the use of is widespread even among colleagues.\n\nIn , local languages (such as Baoulé, Dioula, etc.) do not make a distinction between informal or formal pronouns, which reflects on the local usage of French. It is thus uncommon to call an individual . A waiter, shop-keeper or taxi driver can very well call a customer , just like an employee towards a superior. For example, an accountant could call her direct branch manager , but will still use to address the company's CEO.\n\nRelationships between men and women are typically less formal than between people of the same gender (a female supermarket worker will more easily say towards a male customer than her male colleague).\n\nEven in formal situations (business, politics), the superiors can often be called in a familiar way by subordinates who will use affectionate terms of address such as , , , , for males, , , , for females, instead of the standard and . Superiors reciprocate with terms of address such as , , , . All those terms of address typically exclude the use of \"vous\".\n\nThe use is also conditioned to the \"level\" of French being spoken: using a Standard French code and/or accent (what is call in Ivorian French) will prompt addresses of , whereas code switching to Ivorian French will typically invite a concomitant switch to .\n\nInformed local people will still, most of the time, make a conscious effort to use and / when addressing Westerners in formal situations (unless, again, that Westerner talks Ivorian French rather than Standard French). Other groups of foreigners such as other Africans, Asians or Middle-Eastern people are less likely to enjoy that \"privilege\".\n\nThe use of , just like the use of and , is thus restricted to very formal situations where Standard French is being used, mostly for the higher class between themselves: managers at a meeting with the CEO, representatives of different political parties, upper class people who don't know each other at a social gathering. A switching to can still happen as soon as the formal event is over (such as managers getting out of the meeting room) or just after having been introduced to each other – usually simultaneous to a switch from Standard French to Ivorian French.\n\nCatalan uses the singular pronouns (informal) and (formal), while (informal) and (formal) are used for two or more addressees. The form , used instead of to address someone respectfully, follows the same concordance rules as the French (verbs in second person plural, adjectives in singular), and follows the same concordance rules as the Spanish (verbs in third person). originated from as a calque from Spanish, and replaced the original Catalan form .\n\nIn some dialects, is no longer used. Other dialects have a three-way distinction / / , where is used as a respectful form for elders and respected friends, and for foreigners and people whom one does not know well. is more distant than .\n\nThe Administration uses to address people.\n\nIn Peninsular, Mexican, and Peruvian Spanish, as in Italian, an original and usage similar to French disappeared in the Early Modern period. Today, is used for informal and familiar address while the respectful form is the third-person , which can be used respectfully to anyone. Scholars argue that evolved as a contraction of the Old Spanish (\"your mercy\"), with as a transitional form. In some cases, the title is also employed when speaking to a respected older man, while is used for older women.\n\nAmong Spanish dialects, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Spanish Empire was created during the middle of this linguistic shift, leading to differing linguistic norms being established across its territory. The region surrounding the Colombian capital of Bogotá (although not the city itself) preserves an alternate respectful form simplified from a different contraction of . In Rioplatense, was preserved — but as a replacement for and not as a respectful form of address; in Chile, in Western Venezuela, parts of Colombia and in Central America, is used in spoken address and is used in print and to express moderate formality, that is, it has essentially switched its function to the former role of . In Costa Rica and part of Colombia, is used as the common pronoun, using it both in formal and informal situations.\n\nIn the second-person plural, modern Spanish speakers in most of Spain employ (masculine) and (feminine) informally and (as the third-person plural) to express respect. In western Andalucia, is used in both contexts, but its verbs are conjugated in the second-person plural. Throughout the Americas and the Canaries, is used in all contexts and in the third person.\n\nIn European Portuguese (as well as in Africa, Timor-Leste and Macau), (singular \"you\") is commonly used as the familiar addressing pronoun, while is a general form of address; (plural both of and ) is used for both familiar and general. The forms and (plurals and ) are used for more formal situations (roughly equivalent to \"Mr/Sir\" and \"Mrs/Madam\".) Similarly to some Romance languages (e.g. Italian), can be omitted because the verb ending provides the necessary information. Not so much so with or / because the verb ending is the same as for the third person (historically, derives from (\"your mercy\" or \"your grace\") via the intermediate forms and ). The second person plural pronoun , from Latin , is archaic in most of the Portuguese-speaking world, but can be heard in liturgy and has a limited regional use.\n\nIn Brazilian Portuguese, and (singular and plural \"you\", respectively) are used informally, while and (\"Mr\"/\"Sir\" and \"Mrs\"/\"Madam\", plurals and ) are used in formal speech. Although now seen as archaic, is used when speaking ironically, very formally or when one is demonstrating respect to a superior and it is sometimes replaced by (\"Lady\"). Informal terms of respect to superiors, elders or strangers are (abbreviation of ) and (feminine of i.e. ). / and (\"Lad\"/\"Young man\" and \"Lady\") are used by seniors when addressing non-intimate youths and also as an equalizing form among strange youths. (\"youngster\") is used in the same manner by elders when addressing strange youths of both genders.\n\nOn premises where the atmosphere requires extreme formality like the Senate or different courts, the protocolar forms to address dignitaries (\"Your Excellence\") and (\"Your Lordship/Ladyship\") can still be heard. In a direct address to a judge or the president, must follow the vocatives (\"Your Honour\", literally \"full of merit\") and (\"Mr/Mrs\" President). When addressing an ecclesiastical dignitary the form (\"Your Reverence\") is used. Although is regarded as protocolar, it is an equalizing form.\n\nIn many parts of the geographic extension of the language e.g. most of Southern and Northeastern Brazil, some sociolects of coastal São Paulo, mainly in Greater Santos, colloquial sociolect, mainly among the less educated and some all-class youths of Greater Rio de Janeiro, and in Uruguay, \"tu\" (singular \"you\" or simply \"thou\") is used informally, but the plural form is always . For the overwhelmingly majority of people, the pronoun is commonly used with the verb conjugated as (third-person singular) rather than in the traditional conjugation (second-person singular). is somewhat familiar, even intimate, and should never be addressed to superiors, or strange elders, while is much more neutral, although equalizing.\n\nThe dialect that includes , capital city of Santa Catarina, as well as its shore and inner regions in the proximity like Blumenau, is an exception, as the use of is widespread, even addressing formally to an authority or to a superior. It is one of the few dialects in Brazil in which second-person singular agreement is used (along with the relatively conservative dialect of the state of ).\n\nIn Standard Italian the informal second-person singular pronoun is and the formal second-person singular pronoun is ( \"she\",  \"her\"), always used with the third-person singular conjugation of the verb. The pronouns may be freely omitted. Despite the original meaning of , modern Italian typically concords with the gender of the addressee when is the sentence subject; using feminine adjectives for a male addressee is not especially insulting but sounds confusing, literary or even archaic. When is an object, using feminine adjectives is normal (, i.e. \"I saw you (m.)\"), whereas gender concord is considered non-standard (, i.e. \"I saw you (m.)).\n\nAlthough seldom encountered, the third person or (\"Your Lord-\" or \"Ladyship\") is sometimes seen in formal correspondence and invitations, as a stronger form of its descendant .\n\nThe Romanian word when used for the second-person singular formal takes plural verbs but singular adjectives, similar to French . It is used roughly in the same manner as in Continental French and shows no signs of disappearing. It is also used as a more formal . It originates from – your lordship. In the past it was used extreme rarely to nobles especially, but its sense extended to other people in the 20th century but not so common and when the communists arrived it took the actual form. As happens with all subject pronouns, is often omitted from sentences, its use being implied by verbs in the second person plural form.\n\nThe form (originating from – thy lordship) is less distant than and somewhat midway between and . The verb is conjugated, as for , in the second person singular form. Older people towards younger people and peers favor . Its use is gradually declining.\n\nA more colloquial form of is , or . It is more familiar than and is used only in some regions of Romania. It is used only with immediate family members, and is spelled and pronounced the same in all cases, similar to . It is used with verbs in the second person singular, as is .\n\nThe plural form is a recent borrowing. Proto-Romanian and Aromanian, like Classical Latin, do not have the plural form.\n\nMost dialects of Sicilian Language have utilised , , or to express formality. However, due to encroachment by Italian language has become increasingly common particularly among younger speakers.\n\nIn Ancient Greek, () was the singular, and () the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. Paul addresses King Agrippa II as (Acts 26:2).\n\nLater, and (,\"we\") became too close in pronunciation, and a new plural or (/) was invented, the initial () being a euphonic prefix that was also extended to the singular (/).\n\nIn Modern Greek, (, second person plural) with second person plural verb conjugation is used as the formal counterpart of (, second person singular) when talking to strangers and elders, although in everyday life it is common to speak to strangers of your age or younger using the singular pronoun. In addition, the informal second person singular is used even with older people you are acquainted with, depending on the level of mutual familiarity.\n\nSince the formal () has become less common outside schools and workplaces, many people often do not know which form to use (because using a formal version might sound too snobbish even to an elder and using the informal version might sound inappropriate to some strangers) and thus prefer to replace verbs with nouns (avoiding the dilemma) until enough information on the counterpart's intentions is gathered in order to choose between formal or informal second person pronoun and verb conjugation. A good rule of thumb is that singular accompanies first names and plural accompanies surnames with title (Mr, Mrs, etc.). Exceptions are rare, for example younger schoolchildren may address their teacher in the plural, title and \"first name\", or an officer may address a soldier in the singular and surname. The sequence singular-title-surname is a faux pas that can often indicate lack of education, of good manners, or of both.\n\nThe modern social custom when using Greek in Greece is to ask the other person \"may we speak in the singular?\" in which the other person is expected to answer \"yes\" and afterwards the discussion continues using the informal (); it is unthinkable for the other person to answer \"no\" or show preference for plural forms, and for this reason one should not even ask this question to a person of high status, such as a professional. Therefore, asking this question can itself be considered a form of disrespect in some social situations. Likewise, not asking this question and simply using the singular without prior explicit or implicit agreement would also be considered disrespectful in various social contingencies. In other cases, even using the formal plural (without a question) could also be considered offensive. A person being inappropriately addressed in the singular will often indicate their displeasure by insisting on responding in the plural, in a display of irony that may or may not be evident to the other party. A similar social custom exists with the words (Mr/Sir) and (Mrs/Madam), which can show both respect and a form of \"mock respect\" essentially communicating disapproval, often depending on the voice intonation and the social situation. Overall, the distinction between formal and informal forms of address and when to use each can be quite subtle and not easily discernible by a non-native speaker.\n\nCypriot Greek traditionally had no T–V distinction, with even persons of very high social status addressed in the singular, usually together with an honorific or title such as (\"teacher\", mainly for priests) or (literally \"master\", loosely \"sir\"). Even today, the singular form is used much more frequently in Cyprus compared to Greece, although this is changing under the influence of Standard Modern Greek. The plural form is now expected in a formal setting.\n\nIn Scottish Gaelic, the informal form of the second-person singular is / (emphatic: /), used when addressing a person the speaker knows well, or when addressing a person younger or relatively the same age as the speaker. When addressing a superior, an elder, or a stranger, or in conducting business, the form (emphatic: ) is used. ( is also the second person plural). This distinction carries over into prepositional pronouns: for instance, and (at you), and (against you), and (before you), etc., and into possessive pronouns and (your).\n\nIn Irish, the use of as an address to one person has died out, and is preferred. Formerly, Roman Catholic priests were addressed with the plural form , especially in Ulster, due to the possibility that the priest may be carrying the Eucharist on his person—belief in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist would require the use of the plural.\n\nModern Welsh, Cornish and Breton all retain a T–V distinction to varying degrees.\n\nIn spoken Welsh, the plural pronoun is used when speaking to strangers, elders or superiors, while (or in some parts of the North) is used with friends, close family, animals and children. is also the form used when addressing God. Nonetheless, the use of and varies between families and regions, but those guidelines are generally observed.\n\nA similar distinction exists between Cornish singular / and plural / . The singular form is used when talking to friends, family, animals and children, and the plural form is used to talk to a group of people, or when being especially polite to one person.\n\nIn Breton the second person plural is used as a polite form when addressing a single person and the singular is reserved for informal situations. However, in a large area of central Brittany the singular form has been entirely replaced by , as in English.\n\nModern Russian distinguishes between the familiar ' () and the respectful ' (), the latter also being the plural of both forms. (Respectful () may be capitalised in written correspondence, while plural is not.) The distinction appeared relatively recently and began to gain currency among the educated classes in the 18th century through French influence.\n\nGenerally, is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults but are taught to address adults with . Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal but may transition to very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses to address B, then B also uses to address A. While people may transition quickly from to , such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult (or, in the case of opposite-sexed people, overly flirtatious), particularly if the other party maintains using .\n\nHistorically, the rules used to be more class-specific: as late as at the end of the 19th century, it was accepted in some circles (in aristocracy and especially gentry) that was to be used also between friends, between husband and wife, and when addressing one's parents (but not one's children), all of which situations today would strongly call for using . Meanwhile, up to this day, common people, especially those living in rural areas, hardly ever use the polite . Russian speakers online uphold the distinction and mainly use for strangers, although in the earlier days of internet it was more common and expected to use to address everyone.\n\nThe choice between and is closely related to, yet sometimes different from, the choice of the addressing format – that is, the selection from the first name, patronymics, last name, and the title to be used when addressing the person. Normally, is associated with the informal addressing by first name only (or, even more informally, by the patronymic only), whereas is associated with the more formal addressing format of using the first name together with patronymics (roughly analogous to \"title followed by last name\" in English) or the last name together with a title (the last name is almost never used together with either of the other two names to \"address\" someone, although such combinations are routinely used to \"introduce\" or \"mention\" someone). However, nowadays, can also be employed while addressing by first name only.\n\nIn Ukrainian, the present practice is essentially the same as in Russian, historically this was primarily in the Eastern, Russian-ruled part of Ukraine. Until about 1945, due to Polish influence, the practices in the former Galicia and Volyn regions, tended to more closely resemble the Polish practices, as described below. But since those areas became annexed to the Soviet Union, the East Ukrainian and Russian practices have become prevalent all over Ukraine, with the , , , etc. forms only being preserved in the émigré diaspora.\n\nIn all standard forms of Serbo-Croatian, i.e. Serbian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Bosnian, the use of is limited to friends and family, and used among children. In any formal use, , the second-person plural, is used only; can be used among peers in a workplace but is rare in official documents. It is a common misconception, even among native speakers, that is always capitalized when used in formal tone; is capitalized only in direct personal correspondence between two persons.\n\nWith the polite , masculine plural (in participles and adjectives) is used regardless of the sex of the person addressed.\n\nBulgarian distinguishes between familiar () and respectful (). is always singular and implies familiarity. , the plural of , also functions as the formal singular.\n\nIn addressing more than one person, the plural is always used. For example, \" means \"\"You\" two leave, please!\"). Here, although and both means \"you\", can not be used.\n\nWhen addressing a single person, if the people talking are acquainted then singular is used, otherwise plural should be used. Sometimes people start a new acquaintance straightforwardly with singular , but generally this is considered offensive, rude, or simply impolite. Children are taught to always use between themselves, but for addressing more than one child or an unknown adult.\n\nThe grammatically correct spelling of the singular word is always with a capital letter, whether being the first word in a sentence or not. For example, the sentence \"But \"you\" are wrong!\", if spelled (in Bulgarian) (the word with capital ), it would convey that the speaker is addressing an individual person with a plural, because he/she wants to express a polite, official manner; if spelt (the second possible Bulgarian translation of \"But \"you\" are wrong!\"), it would then mean that someone is talking to several persons.\n\nGenerally, is used among friends and relatives. When talking to each other, young people often start with the formal but quickly transition to in an informal situation. Unless there is a substantial difference in social situation (e.g. a teacher and a student), the choice of the form is symmetric: if A. uses to address B., then B. also uses to address A. While people may transition quickly from to , such transition presumes mutual agreement. There is a recent trend not to use the formal at all, but this can lead to awkward situations.\n\nMacedonian distinguishes between familiar () and respectful () – which is also the plural of both forms, used to address a pair or group. (Respectful may be capitalized, while plural is not.) Generally, is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults, but are taught to address adults with . Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal , but may transit to very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses to address B, then B also uses to address A. While people may transit quickly from to , such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult, particularly if the other party maintains using .\n\nPolish uses as formal forms the words (meaning \"mister\" or \"gentleman\") and (\"lady\"), and in the plural (\"gentlemen\") and (\"ladies\") respectively, being used for mixed groups (originally a neutral noun, meaning roughly \"lordship\", but also, and until today, \"state\"). is used with the plural, like and . Because of their character as nouns (and not pronouns) these words are used with the third person: For example, the familiar (\"You want to drink\") becomes (literally \"The gentleman wants to drink\").\n\nFurther, and can be combined with the first name, the last name and with titles like \"President\", \"Professor\", \"Doctor\", \"Editor\" and others (, etc.; using these titles is considered necessary); using both (, ) is considered more polite or, in some context, even submissive. Addressing a present person with the last name is only usual in court or in other affairs, where government authority is involved, and generally considered impolite or condescending. When addressing someone, all these forms always require the vocative case, which is otherwise optional (for example (\"Mr Kowalski!\"), (\"Mrs Joanna!\"), (\"Professor!\")). For , etc. alone, + genitive is used instead of vocative: , , , and .\n\nA unique practice among both Poles and Western Ukrainians is addressing a lawyer as , meaning \"Mr. Philanthropist\", derived from the name of an ancient Greek king known for his generosity.\n\nThe V-forms are capitalized only in actual letters (or e-mails), where the T-forms and are also capitalized.\n\nPlural is also used as V-form in dialects, for example (\"Mother, what are you eating?\"). Following its Russian usage, the plural V-form was also promoted in the Polish language from 1945, becoming associated with Communist ideology and addressing of a person by a government or Party official.\n\nBesides, other forms can be sometimes used like in third person when talking to older family members (, \"May mother say\"), to clergy (, \"Yes, priest got it right\") or to other people in less formal or semi-formal situations, e.g. polite quarrel or dispute (, \"Also, may my dear friend please learn more and only then instruct others\").\n\nIn Slovenian, although informal address using the second person singular form (known as ) is officially limited to friends and family, talk among children, and addressing animals, it is increasingly used instead of its polite or formal counterpart using the second person plural form (known as ).\n\nThere is an additional nonstandard but widespread use of a singular participle combined with a plural auxiliary verb (known as ) that also reveals the gender of the person and is used in somewhat less formal situations:\n\n\nThe use of the third person plural form (known as in both direct address and indirect reference) as an ultra-polite form is now archaic or dialectal; it is associated with servant-master relationships in older literature, the child-parent relationship in certain conservative rural communities, and in general with relationships with people of highest respect (parents, clergy, royalty).\n\nIn Czech, there are three levels of formality. The most formal is using the second person plural verb forms (V form) with the surname or title of the addressed person, usual between strangers or people in a professional relationship. The second common form is made by using the second person singular verb forms (T form) together with the given name of the other person, used between friends and in certain social groups (students etc.). The third form, which is rather less common, is using the V form in combination with the given name. It may be used by a teacher when addressing a student (especially at the secondary school level), by a boss addressing their secretary, or in other relationships where a certain degree of familiarity has developed, but has not superseded some level of mutually acknowledged respect or distance. This form of address is usually asymmetrical (the perceived social superior uses V form in combination with the first name, the perceived social inferior using V form and the surname or honorific), less often symmetrical. Using the singular verb forms together with the surname or title is considered very rude. Where a stranger introduces themself with title (like , ), it is considered more polite to address them using the V form in combination with their title (always preceded by the honorific /, i.e. Mr/Ms), rather than their surname. However, it is considered poor manners to address somebody with their title in combination with the T form.\n\nTraditionally, use of the informal form was limited for relatives, very close friends, and for children. During the second half of the 20th century, use of the informal form grew significantly among coworkers, youth and members of organisations and groups. The formal form is always used in official documents and when dealing with a stranger (especially an older one) as a sign of respect. 2nd-person pronouns (, , , ) are often capitalized in letters, advertisement, etc. The capitalization is optional and is slowly becoming obsolete. A variant of the formal form modeled after German (/, /, verb ) was frequently used during the 19th century but has since disappeared. This form is also associated with Czech Jewish community before Second World War, and still appears very often in Jewish humour as sign of local colour. Sometimes it is used as irony.\n\nIn the Internet age, where people communicate under nicknames or pseudonymes and almost solely in informal way, capitalizing (/) is used to emphasise respect, or simply presence of respect. ( = friends, honored acquaintance, strangers = basic form, / = most formal, used to create distance or express contempt, very rude if not sufficiently advocated, often used as insult itself). \n\nIn grammar, plural forms are used in personal and possessive pronouns ( – you, – your) and in verbs, but not in participles and adjectives, they are used in singular forms (when addressing a single person). This differs from some other Slavic languages (Slovak, Russian, etc.)\n\nGreetings are also connected with T–V distinction. Formal (good day) and (good-bye) are used with formal , while , , (meaning both \"hello\", \"hi\", and \"bye\") are informal and used with .\n\nIn Lithuanian, historically, aside from familiar and respectful or , also used to express plural, there was a special form , mostly referred to in third person singular (although referring in second person singular is also not uncommon). This form was used to communicate with a stranger who has not earned particular respect (a beggar, for example). Modern Lithuanian Dictionary describes as a polite form of second singular person , making its meaning somewhere in the middle between informal and formal . Through the Soviet occupation period, however, this form was mostly replaced by standard neutral form (the vocative case for , \"comrade\", the latter being the standard formal form of addressing in all languages of the Soviet Union used in all situations, from \"comrade Stalin\" to \"comrade student\"), and by now is used sparsely. A common way of addressing people whom one doesn't know well is also (m) and (f), from Polish forms of address and , respectively.\n\nIn the standard forms of both Hindi and Urdu there are three levels of honorifics:\n\nBengali has three levels of formality in its pronouns; the most neutral forms of address among closer members of a family are and (plural). These two pronouns are also typically used when speaking to children, or to younger members of the extended family. is also used when addressing God. When speaking with adults outside the family, or with senior members of the extended family, the pronouns and (plural) are used. This is also true in advertisements and public announcements. A third set of pronouns, and (plural), is reserved for use between very close friends, and by extension, between relatives who share a bond not unlike a close friendship. It is also used when addressing people presumed to be of \"inferior\" social status; this latter use is occasionally used when speaking to housemaids, rickshaw-pullers, and other service workers, although this use is considered offensive.\n\nThe situations in which these different pronouns can be used vary considerably depending on many social factors. In some families, children may address their parents with and , although this is becoming increasingly rare. Some adults alternate between all three pronoun levels when speaking to children, normally choosing and , but also often choosing and to indicate closeness, or or in a joking manner. Additionally, Bengalis vary in which pronoun they use when addressing servants in the home; some may use and to indicate respect for an adult outside the family, while others may use and to indicate either inclusion into the family or to indicate somewhat less honorable status. Others may even use and to indicate inferior status.\n\nIn Finnish, today the use of the informal singular form of address () is widespread in all social circles, even among strangers and in business situations. The use of formal address has not disappeared however, and persists in situations involving customer service (especially if the customer is clearly older than the person serving them) and in general in addressing the elderly or in situations where strict adherence to form is expected, such as in the military. An increase in the use of formal address has been reported in recent years, whereby some people are choosing to use the formal form more often.. As the use of the form conveys formal recognition of the addressee's status and, more correctly, of polite social distance, the formal form might also occasionally be used jeeringly or to protest the addressee's snobbery. A native speaker may also switch to formal form when speaking in anger, as an attempt to remain civil. Advertisements, instructions and other formal messages are mostly in informal singular form ( and its conjugations), but the use of formal forms has increased in recent years. For example, as the tax authorities tend to become more informal, in contrast the social security system is reverting to using the formal form.\n\nThe same forms, such as the pronoun , are used for formal singular and for both formal and informal plural.\n\nIn Finnish the number is expressed in pronouns ( for second person singular, or for second person plural), verb inflections, and possessive suffixes. Almost all of these elements follow the grammar of the second person plural also in the formal singular form. For example, polite vs. informal , \"Could you move your car, (please)?\". Each of the person markers are modified: to (verb person), to (pronoun), to (possessive suffix).\n\nAs a few examples of this could be mentioned the way imperatives are expressed: \"Go!\" (plural), vs. \"Go!\" (singular), and the usage of the plural suffix \"your\" instead of the singular \"your\".\n\nThere is number agreement in Finnish, thus you say \"you are\" (singular), but \"you are\" (plural). However, this does not extend to words describing the addressee, which are in the singular, e.g. \"are you doctor?\" (plural, plural, singular)\n\nA common error, nowadays often made even by native speakers unused to the formal forms, is to use the plural form of the main verb in the perfect and pluperfect constructions. The main verb should be in the singular when addressing one person in the formal plural: instead of \"Have you heard?\"\n\nSometimes the third person is used as a polite form of address, after the Swedish model: \"What would madam like to have?\" This is far less common in the Eastern parts of Finland, influenced less by the Swedish language and all in all a declining habit. The passive voice may be used to circumvent the choice of the correct form of address. In another meaning, the passive voice is also the equivalent of the English patronizing \"we\" as in \"How are we feeling today?\"\n\nFinnish language includes the verbs for calling one with informal singular or formal plural: , , respectively.\n\nIn the Bible and in the Kalevala, only the \"informal\" singular is used in all cases.\n\nEstonian is a language with T–V distinction, second person plural () is used instead of second person singular () as a means of expressing politeness or formal speech. is the familiar form of address used with family, friends, and minors. The distinction is still much more widely used and more rigid than in closely related Finnish language.\n\nSimilar to the French language , the verb is used, and is used when addressing a (new) customer or a patient, or when talking to a person in his/her function. In hierarchical organizations, like large businesses or armies, is used between members of a same rank/level while is used between members of different ranks. (the verb is also used) is used with relatives, friends, when addressing children and with close colleagues. Borderline situations, such as distant relatives, young adults, customers in rental shops or new colleagues, sometimes still present difficulties.\n\nHungarian provides numerous, often subtle means of T–V distinction:\n\nThe use of the second-person conjugation with the pronoun (plural ) is the most informal mode. As in many other European languages, it is used within families, among children, lovers, close friends, (nowadays often) among coworkers, and in some communities, suggesting an idea of brotherhood. Adults unilaterally address children this way, and it is the form used in addressing God and other Christian figures (such as Jesus Christ or the Blessed Virgin), animals, and objects or ideas. Sociologically, the use of this form is widening. Whereas traditionally the switch to is often a symbolic milestone between people, sometimes sealed by drinking a glass of wine together (), today people under the age of about thirty will often mutually adopt automatically in informal situations. A notable example is the Internet: strangers meeting online use the informal forms of address virtually exclusively, regardless of age or status differences. \n\nNevertheless, formal forms of address are alive and well in Hungarian:\nIt is important to keep in mind that formal conjugation doesn't automatically imply politeness or vice versa; these factors are independent of each other. For example, \"What would you like to have?\" (literally, \"What do you command?\") is in the informal conjugation, while it can be extremely polite, making it possible to express one's honour towards people one has previously established a friendly relationship with. On the other hand, \"What do you want?\" is expressed with the formal conjugation, nevertheless it may sound rude and aggressive; the formal conjugation does not soften this tone in any way.\n\nIn modern Turkish, the T–V distinction is strong. Family members and friends speak to one another using the second-person singular , and adults use to address minors. In formal situations (business, customer–clerk, and colleague relationships, or meeting people for the first time) the plural second-person is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, the double plural second-person may be used to address a much-respected person. Rarely, the third-person plural form of the verb (but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. Additionally, if there are two or more person or could be used. For example, or have same meaning that \"You have been chosen\". However, are not certain whether plural or singular. It changes; formal speaking specifies one person or more but informal speaking it specifies only two or more person. In the imperative, there are four forms: second person singular for informal, second person plural for formal, and second person double plural for very formal situations: (second person singular, informal), (second person plural, formal), and (double second person plural, very formal). The very formal forms are not frequently used in spoken Turkish, but is pretty common in written directives, such as manuals and warning signs.\n\nUyghur is notable for using four different forms, to distinguish both singular and plural in both formal and informal registers. The informal plural originated as a contraction of , which uses a regular plural ending. In Old Turkic, as still in modern Turkish, () was the original second-person plural. However, in modern Uyghur () has become restricted to the formal singular, requiring the plural suffix for the plurals.\n\nIn the extinct Ubykh language, the T–V distinction was most notable between a man and his mother-in-law, where the plural form supplanted the singular very frequently, possibly under the influence of Turkish. The distinction was upheld less frequently in other relationships, but did still occur.\n\nModern Standard Arabic uses the majestic plural form of the second person ( ) in respectful address. It is restricted to highly formal contexts, generally relating to politics and government. However, several varieties of Arabic have a clearer T–V distinction. The most developed is in Egyptian Arabic, which uses (literally, \"Your Grace\"), and (literally, \"Your Lordship\") as the \"V\" terms, depending on context, while is the \"T\" term. is the most usual \"V\" term, with and being reserved for situations where the addressee is of very high social standing (e.g. a high-ranking government official or a powerful businessman). Finally, the \"V\" term is used only with social superiors (including elders); unfamiliar people perceived to be of similar or lower social standing to the speaker are addressed with the \"T\" term .\n\nIn modern Hebrew, there is a T–V distinction used in a set of very formal occasions, for example, a lawyer addressing a judge, or when speaking to rabbis. The second person singular (, masculine) or (, feminine) are the usual form of address in all other situations, e.g. when addressing ministers or members of the Knesset.\n\nThe formal form of address when speaking to a person of higher authority is the third person singular using the person's title without the use of the pronoun. Thus, a rabbi could be asked: (, \"would the honorable rabbi like to eat?\") or a judge told: (, \"his honour is considering my request\").\n\nOther persons of authority are normally addressed by their title only, rather than by name, using the second person singular. For example, officers and commanders in the army are addressed as (, \"the commander\") by troops.\n\nIn non-Hebrew-speaking Jewish culture, the second-person form of address is similarly avoided in cases of higher authority (e.g., a student in a yeshiva would be far more likely to say in a classroom discussion \"yesterday the Rav told us...\" than \"yesterday you told us...\"). However, this usage is limited to more conservative (i.e. Orthodox) circles.\n\nIn Tamil, the second-person singular pronoun நீ and its derived forms are used to address children, (younger or very close) members of the family and to people who are younger than the speaker. The second person plural pronoun நீங்கள் is used to address elders (also within the extended family), teachers, people who are older than the speaker and anyone whom the speaker does not personally know, especially in formal situations.\n\nChinese culture has taken naming and forms of address very seriously, strictly regulating which people were permitted to use which terms in conversation or in writing. The extreme example is the 1777 execution of Wang Xihou and his entire family and the confiscation of their entire estate as his penalty for writing the Qianlong Emperor's personal name as part of a criticism of the Kangxi Dictionary. Many honorifics and niceties of address fell by the wayside during the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s amid Mao Zedong's campaign against the \"Four Olds\". This included an attempt to eradicate expressions of deference to teachers and to others seen as preserving \"counter-revolutionary\" modes of thought. The defeat of the Maoist Gang of Four in the late 1970s and continuing reforms since the 1980s has, however, permitted a return of such traditional and regional expressions.\n\nHistorically, the T–V distinction was observed among the Chinese by avoiding \"any\" use of common pronouns in addressing a respected audience. Instead, third-person honorifics and respectful titles were employed. One aspect of such respectful address was avoiding the use of the \"first\"-person pronoun as well, instead choosing a (typically humble) epithet in its place. The extreme of this practice occurred when Shi Huangdi abrogated the then-current first-person pronoun (\"zhèn\"); the present first-person pronoun (\"wǒ\") subsequently developed out of the habit of referring to \"this [worthless] body\", the character's original meaning. An important difference between the T–V distinction in Chinese compared with modern European languages is that Chinese culture considers the relative age of the speakers an important aspect of their social distance. This is especially strong within families: while the speakers of European languages may generally prefer forms of address such as \"father\" or \"grandpa\", Chinese speakers consider using the personal names of elders such a taboo that they may not even \"know\" the given names of grandparents who live in the same apartment. While strictures against writing the personal name of any ancestor of the last seven generations are no longer observed, it remains very uncommon to name children for any living relative: younger people using the name freely would disrespect the original bearer.\n\nIn the present day, the informal second-person pronoun is (Mandarin: \"nǐ\"; Minnan: \"lí\") and the honorific pronoun is (Mandarin: \"nín\"; Minnan: \"lín\"). Much like European languages, the honorific form developed out of an earlier second-person plural: during the Jin and Yuan dynasties, the Mandarin dialects mutated (\"nǐměi\") into (\"nǐmen\") and then into . (A similar form , \"tān\" developed for the third-person singular but is now generally unused.) It is worth noting that the T–V distinction in Mandarin does \"not\" connote a distance or lack of intimacy between the speakers (as implied, e.g., in the French \"vous\"). On the contrary, it is often noted that the respectful form contains the radical for \"heart\" (, \"xīn\"); although this is actually for phonetic reasons, the implication is that the addressee is loved and cherished by the speaker.\n\nMost southern dialects, however, do not make this distinction in speech at all. Cantonese and Shanghainese speakers learn to \"write\" both forms in school but pronounce them identically: the Cantonese as \"nei\" and the Shanghainese as \"nóng\". Formality is still respected, but their languages like Japanese and Vietnamese retain the earlier Chinese tradition of employing epithets or honorifics instead of using any pronouns at all when showing formal respect.\n\nUnder heavy Chinese influence, traditional Japanese culture eschewed the use of common pronouns in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular (, \"chin\") was arrogated to the personal use of the emperor. The formality of Japanese culture was such that its original pronouns have largely ceased to be used at all. Some linguists therefore argue that Japanese lacks \"any\" pronouns whatsoever, but although it is a larger and more complex group of words than most languages employ Japanese pronouns do exist, having developed out of the most common epithets used to express different relationships and relative degrees of social status. As in Korean, polite language encompasses not only these specific pronouns but also suffixes and vocabulary as well.\n\nMost commonly, (, \"kimi\",  \"prince\", \"lord\") is used informally as the second-person singular and (, \"anata\", \"dear one\") is the most common polite equivalent, but is also commonly used by women towards an intimate as a term of endearment. The pronoun (, \"kisama\") is illustrative of the complexity that can be involved, though, in that its literal meaning is quite flattering \"dear and honorable sir\" but its ironic use has made it a strong insult in modern Japanese. Similarly, (, \"omae\") \"(one who is) before (me)\" was traditionally a respectful pronoun used toward aristocrats and religious figureheads, but today is considered very informal and impolite, yet also commonly used by husbands towards their wives in an endearing manner.\n\nUnder heavy Chinese influence, Vietnamese culture has eschewed the use of common pronouns in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular (Vietnamese: \"trẫm\") was arrogated to the personal use of the emperor.\n\nIn modern Vietnamese, only the first-person singular \"tôi\" is in common use as a respectful pronoun; any other pronoun should be replaced with the subject's name or with an appropriate epithet, title, or relationship in polite formal speech. Similar to modern Chinese (but to a much greater extent), modern Vietnamese also frequently replaces \"informal\" pronouns with kinship terms in many situations. The somewhat insulting second-person singular \"mày\" is also frequently used in informal situations among young Vietnamese.\n\nIn Thai, first, second, and third person pronouns vary in formality according to the social standing of the speaker and the referent and the relationship between them. For a non-exhaustive list of Thai second person pronouns, see http://www.into-asia.com/thai_language/grammar/you.php.\n\nIn Indonesian, the T–V distinction is extremely important; addressing a stranger with the pronoun \"kau\" or \"kamu\" (you) is considered rude and impolite (unless the stranger is, for example, a child). When addressing a stranger or someone older, typically \"Bu\" ('ma'am') or \"Pak\" ('sir') is used. People also use \"mas\" (Javanese for 'older brother') or \"mbak\" (Javanese for 'older sister') when addressing someone that is not old enough to be called \"Bu\" or \"Pak\". There are variations in different areas. If the situation is more formal, such as in meetings or news broadcasting, \"Anda\" is always used, even if those addressed would otherwise be addressed by \"kau\" or \"kamu\" in informal situations. A more informal pronoun, written \"lu\", \"lo\", or sometimes as \"loe\" (originated from Hokkien language) is considered very impolite. This is normally used by teenagers (particularly in urban centers) to their peers. Adults can sometimes be heard using this pronoun with their close friends or when they are angry.\n\n\nSimilarly, \"kalian\" dan \"Anda\"/\"Anda sekalian\" are used.\n\nIn Tagalog, the familiar second person is \"ikáw/ka\" (in the nominative case). This is replaced by \"kayó\" (which is actually the second person plural) when the situation calls for a more polite tone. The pronoun \"kayó\" is accompanied by the particle \"pô\". This form is generally used to show respect to close, older relatives. This is also the form expected when talking with the peers of parents or grandparents.\n\nTraditionally, when a higher degree of formality is required, the third person plural (\"silá\") is used instead. It is used when addressing people of higher social rank, such as government officials and senior clergymen. It may also be used when speaking to complete strangers as a matter of courtesy, such as when answering the door or an unknown caller.\n\n\nYounger Filipinos tend to mix these forms of address, resulting in questions such as \"Sino ka pô ba?\" in an attempt to sound polite towards a total stranger. This and other nonstandard variants are very widespread, especially in the Manila dialect of Tagalog and its surrounding suburbs.\n\nBasque has two levels of formality in every dialect, which are hi and zu; Nevertheless, in some areas of Gipuzkoa and Biscay, the respectful form berori is still used by some speakers, just as the familiar xu in some areas of the Eastern Low Navarrese dialect, when addressing children and close friends. Most speakers only use the \"zu\" form (\"zuka\" level) and that is the usual one used in methods, slogans... although the \"hi\" form (\"hika\") is very common in villages.\n\nThe neutral or formal one is \"zu\", which originally used to be the plural form of the second person. The informal one is \"hi\", whose use is limited to some specific situations: among close friends, to children (children never use it when addressing their parents, neither the spouses among them), when talking to a younger person, to animals (cattle, pets...), in monologues, and when speaking angrily to somebody. Their common plural form is \"zuek\", whenever the speaker is talking to a group of listeners who would all be individually addressed with the form \"zu\", or the form \"hi\", or both (a conversation where some listeners are addressed as \"zu\" —i.e., somebody's parents, for instance— and others as \"hi\" —the speaker's siblings—).\n\nUnlike \"zu\", \"hi\" sometimes makes a distinction whether the addressed one is a male or a female. For example: \"duk\" (thou, male, hast) and \"dun\" (thou, female, hast). The use of the hika level requires the allocutive agreement (\"hitano\" or \"zeharkako hika\", i.e., indirect \"hika\") in non-subordinate sentences to mark this distinction for the first and third person verbs. Those allocutive forms are found in the Indicative and Conditional moods, but never in the Subjunctive and Imperative moods, with the one exception of \"goazemak\" (let's go, said to a male) and \"goazeman\" (said to a female) in Western dialects, opposed to \"goazen\", the neutral form. For example:\n\n\nNevertheless, if any of the allocutive sentences becomes subordinate, the formal one is used: \"aitak ikasi duelako\" (because Dad has learned it), \"aitak erosi diolako\" (because Dad bought it for him / her), and \"hona etorri nintzenean\" (when I came here).\n\nOn the other hand, in past tense verbal forms, no distinction is made when the addressee is the subject or the direct object in the sentence. For example:\n\n\nBut if the familiar second-person appears in the verb, or if the verb is an allocutive form in a non-dependent clause, the masculine and feminine forms differ. For example:\n\n\nThe friendly \"xu\" form or xuketa resembles the \"zuka\" forms of the verbs, and includes another kind of allocutive, as \"hika\": cf. \"egia erran dut\" (formal: I told the truth), \"egia erran diat\" (informal, said to a male), \"egia erran dinat\" (informal, said to a female), \"egia erran dautzut\" (in formal Eastern Low Navarrese, I told \"you\" the truth) and \"egia erran dixut\" (\"xuketa\"). It is mainly used among relatives and close friends.\n\nThe \"berori\" form or berorika is very formal, and hardly used nowadays, mainly in some areas of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, to address priests, the elderly, judges and the nobility. Verbs are inflected in their singular third form, like in Italian (\"(Lei) è molto gentile\", opposed to \"(tu) sei molto gentile\", you are very nice / thou art very nice) or the Spanish \"(usted) es muy amable\", opposed to \"(tú) eres muy amable\":\n\n\nUnlike the \"hika\" level, \"berorika\" has no allocutive forms.\n\nThe extinct dialect of Erronkari or Roncal, spoken in the easternmost area of Navarre, presented a four-levelled system:\n\n\nEsperanto is a T–V-distinguishing language, but usually \"vi\" is used for both singular and plural, just like \"you\" in modern English. An informal second person singular pronoun, \"ci\", indeed exists, but it is rarely used in practice. It is mainly intended to make the familiar/respectful distinction when translating (literature, for example) from languages that do have the T–V distinction.\n\nSome have imagined \"ci\" as an archaic term that was used before and then fell out of common usage; however, this is not true. It has appeared only sometimes in experimental language. In standard Esperanto, \"vi\" has always been used since the beginning. For example, \"ci\" appears in neither the \"Fundamenta Gramatiko\" nor the \"Unua Libro\". But, especially in some circles, people have begun to use \"ci\" in practical language, mainly as the familiar and intimate singular, reserving \"vi\" for the plural and formal singular. Others use \"ci\" as singular and \"vi\" as plural regardless of formality.\n\nIn Ido, in theory \"tu\" is limited to friends and family, whereas \"vu\" is used anywhere else. However, many users actually adapt the practice in their own mother tongue and use \"tu\" and \"vu\" accordingly. In the plural, though, the only form in use is \"vi\", which does not distinguish between formal and informal address.\n\nIn all cases, an -n is added to the original pronoun to indicate a direct object that precedes its own verb: \"Me amoras tu\" (I love you) becomes \"Tun me amoras\" if the direct object takes the first place, for example for emphatic purposes.\n\nIn High Elvish, self-named Quenya, there is a distinction between singular informal \"tyë\" and singular formal \"lyë\". The plural of both forms is \"lë\". The formal form is expected between all but family members and close friends. The appendices to \"Lord of the Rings\" state that Westron followed a similar pattern, although the dialect of Shire had largely lost the formal form.\n\nSome languages have a verb to describe the fact of using either a \"T\" or a \"V\" form. Some also have a related noun or pronoun. The English words are used to refer only to English usage in the past, not to usage in other languages. The analogous distinction may be expressed as \"to use first names\" or \"to be on familiar terms (with someone)\".\n"}

The uncountability of a set is closely related to its cardinal number: a set is uncountable if its cardinal number is larger than that of the set of all natural numbers.\n\nThere are many equivalent characterizations of uncountability. A set \"X\" is uncountable if and only if any of the following conditions hold:\n\nThe first three of these characterizations can be proven equivalent in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice, but the equivalence of the third and fourth cannot be proved without additional choice principles.\n\n\nThe best known example of an uncountable set is the set R of all real numbers; Cantor's diagonal argument shows that this set is uncountable. The diagonalization proof technique can also be used to show that several other sets are uncountable, such as the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers and the set of all subsets of the set of natural numbers. The cardinality of R is often called the cardinality of the continuum and denoted by formula_3, or formula_4, or formula_5 (beth-one).\n\nThe Cantor set is an uncountable subset of R. The Cantor set is a fractal and has Hausdorff dimension greater than zero but less than one (R has dimension one). This is an example of the following fact: any subset of R of Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than zero must be uncountable.\n\nAnother example of an uncountable set is the set of all functions from R to R. This set is even \"more uncountable\" than R in the sense that the cardinality of this set is formula_6 (beth-two), which is larger than formula_5.\n\nA more abstract example of an uncountable set is the set of all countable ordinal numbers, denoted by Ω or ω. The cardinality of Ω is denoted formula_8 (aleph-one). It can be shown, using the axiom of choice, that formula_8 is the \"smallest\" uncountable cardinal number. Thus either formula_5, the cardinality of the reals, is equal to formula_8 or it is strictly larger. Georg Cantor was the first to propose the question of whether formula_5 is equal to formula_8. In 1900, David Hilbert posed this question as the first of his 23 problems. The statement that formula_14 is now called the continuum hypothesis and is known to be independent of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory (including the axiom of choice).\n\nWithout the axiom of choice, there might exist cardinalities incomparable to formula_1 (namely, the cardinalities of Dedekind-finite infinite sets). Sets of these cardinalities satisfy the first three characterizations above but not the fourth characterization. Because these sets are not larger than the natural numbers in the sense of cardinality, some may not want to call them uncountable.\n\nIf the axiom of choice holds, the following conditions on a cardinal formula_16 are equivalent:\n\nHowever, these may all be different if the axiom of choice fails. So it is not obvious which one is the appropriate generalization of \"uncountability\" when the axiom fails. It may be best to avoid using the word in this case and specify which of these one means.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31130713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31130713", "title": "Warm-glow giving", "text": "Warm-glow giving\n\nWarm-glow giving is an economic theory describing the emotional reward of giving to others. According to the original warm-glow model developed by Andreoni (1989, 1990), people experience a sense of joy and satisfaction for \"doing their part\" to help others. This satisfaction - or \"warm glow\" - represents the selfish pleasure derived from \"doing good\", regardless of the actual impact of one's generosity. Within the warm-glow framework, people may be \"impurely altruistic\", meaning they simultaneously maintain both altruistic and egoistic (selfish) motivations for giving. Whereas \"pure altruists\" (sometimes referred to as \"perfect altruists\") are motivated solely by the desire to provide for a recipient, impure altruists are also motivated by the joy of giving (warm glow). Importantly, warm glow is distinctly non-pecuniary, meaning it arises independent of the possibility of financial reward. Therefore, the warm glow phenomenon is distinct from reciprocal altruism, which may imply a direct financial incentive. Warm-glow giving is a useful economic framework to consider public good provision, collective action problems, charitable giving, and gifting behavior. The existence of a warm glow helps to explain the absence of complete crowding-out of private giving by public grants, as predicted by classical economic models under the neutrality hypothesis. Outside of economics, warm glow has been applied to sociology, political science, environmental policy, healthcare, and business. Conceptually, warm-glow giving is related to the notion of a \"helper's high\" and appears to be resilient across cultures. \n\nWarm glow is built upon the idea of impure altruism: the blend of both altruistic and egoistic desires to help others. Philosophers have debated this idea since the time of the ancient Greeks. In the Socratic \"dialogues\", motivation may be traced to an egotistic concern for one's own welfare, thus denying the plausibility of pure altruism. Similarly, Plato's organization of motivations as responses to hunger-based desires highlights the foundational importance of egoism in all social interactions. However, in Nichomachean Ethicsand Eudemian Ethics, Aristotle considers both the possibility and necessity of altruism to fulfill high-order eudaimonic goals, thus setting the stage for an ongoing philosophical debate. Hobbes, Kant, Nietzsche, Bentham, J.S. Millargued against the possibility of pure altruismand advanced the doctrine of psychological egoism, while others (Butler, Hume, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Nagel) argued for the existence of altruistic motives. Conceptually, the warm-glow model represents a stylized compromise between these two perspectives, allowing for individuals to be purely altruistic, purely egoistic, or impurely altruistic. Warm glow is at least tangentially related to the topic of free will, as people should only reap the psychological reward of helping if they freely choose to do so.\n\nThe normative theory of Ricardian equivalence suggests that private spending should be unresponsive to fiscal policy because forward-looking individuals smooth their consumption, consistent with Modigliani's life-cycle hypothesis. Applied to the provision of charities or public goods, Ricardian equivalence and the classical assumption of pure altruism together support the neutrality hypothesis, implying perfect substitutability between private and public contributions. The neutrality hypothesis assumes rational economic agents are indifferent to whether a cause is funded by the private or public sector; only the level of funding is relevant. A consequence of neutrality under perfect altruism is that government grants should completely crowd-out private donations. That is, a dollar given by the government takes the place of a dollar that would have been given by a private citizen. To illustrate, economic agents operating under the neutrality hypothesis would give to a cause until complete provision, beyond which they would contribute nothing. This is consistent with Andreoni's conceptualization of \"pure altruism\"; however it is inconsistent with impure altruism or pure egoism. Thus, warm glow and the failure to act as purely altruistic present fundamental challenges to the neutrality hypothesis and Ricardian equivalence. In economics, violations to the neutrality hypothesis pose serious concerns for macroeconomic policies involving taxation and redistribution; and microeconomic theories for collective actionand public good provision. Several of Andreoni's contemporaries simultaneously provided evidence against neutrality-driven crowding-out effects, including Kingma (1989) and Khanna et al. (1995). Taken together, these findings offered a strong rebuke of the assumption that public grants crowd-out private donations to public goods.\nAndreoni's economic model of impure altruism considers a simplistic world with only two goods: a private good and a public good. A given individual, endowed with wealth formula_1faces the budget constraint: formula_2where formula_3represents consumption of a private good, and formula_4represents the contribution to the public good. To the extent that formula_5positively contributes to utility, it may be interpreted as the degree of warm glow.It follows that the total provision of the public good, G, is simply: formula_6and the total contributions to the public good from all other individuals is denoted as: formula_7Thus, the public good is the sum of the formula_8person's contribution formula_9along with the total contributions of all other individuals formula_10\n\n(1) formula_11where formula_12\n\nAll individuals in this naïve economy face the same utility functions, given by:\n\n(2)formula_13\n\nwhere the utility functions represent the utility for private, egoistic consumption formula_14the utility derived from the public good formula_15and the warm-glow utility of the contribution towards the public good formula_16An altruist should derive no additional utility from the act of giving: formula_17whereas a pure egoist derives pleasure only from the warm glow of giving, without care for the public good itself, hence formula_18\n\nFrom the budget constraint and utility function, one can derive the utility maximization function, formula_19which is the original utility function (2) transformed using the definition of the public good (1).\n\nAssuming a strategy of utility maximization, the model of warm glow offers many important economic predictions. Specifically, it presents three contrarian insights to those of classical economics under Ricardian equivalence. \n\nFirst, warm-glow theory predicts that income transfers will increase net giving only when income is transferred to more altruistic individuals. Second, it suggests that the provision of a public good is dependent upon the distribution of income within a population. Third, it suggests that public fund of public goods through lump-sum taxes will be more effective than relying upon altruism in the private sector. Individually and collectively, these propositions are in stark contrast to the laissez-faire doctrine of Ricardian economics. Following this original model, warm glow has conceptually evolved with new applications across disciplines to explain and encourage prosocial behavior.\nMany of the advances in warm glow research stem not from economics, but from psychology. In particular, research on motivations and affect have played a key role in defining and operationalizing warm glow for broad application. \n\n\"\"...a millionaire does not really care whether his money does good or not, provided he finds his conscience eased and his social status improved by giving it away...\" -George Bernard Shaw.\" \n\nAs illustrated in Shaw's quote, both intrinsic desires of conscience and extrinsic desires of social status may motivate giving. Warm glow has traditionally been restricted to intrinsic motivation, however this distinction is often murky. \n\nThere has been considerable inconsistency in the literature as to whether a warm glow refers to intrinsic or extrinsic motivation. According to Andreoni (2006), \"putting warm-glow into the model is, while intuitively appealing, an admittedly \"ad hoc\" fix\". Further elaborating on the topic, he and colleagues wrote that the concept was \"originally a placeholder for more specific models of individual and social motivations\". From this initial ambiguity, different authors have at times referred to the phenomenon as solely intrinsic, both intrinsic and extrinsic, or solely extrinsic. Some authors have made deliberate distinctions between prestige-seeking (extrinsic) and the intrinsic components of warm glow, but many have not. Conceptualization of warm glow as either intrinsic or extrinsic has implications for motivational crowding out, satiation effects, and expected magnitude.\nThe most common and classically \"correct\" interpretation of warm glow is as a solely intrinsic phenomenon. Language referring to the \"joy of giving\", \"the positive emotional experience from the act of helping others\", \"the moral satisfaction of helping others\" and the \"internal satisfaction of giving\" suggests an intrinsic drive. The intrinsic component of warm glow is the private emotional benefit to giving.\n\nMuch of the ambiguity surrounding the motivational processes of warm glow has arisen from the misclassification of extrinsic rewards to intrinsic processes. While intrinsic desires center upon emotional gains, extrinsic rewards may include recognition, identity signaling, and prestige. Extrinsic motivation may also take the form of punishment (negative warm glow), in the form of censure or blame. Some research has explicitly focused on extrinsic warm glow, such as \"relational warm glow\".\n\nOne area that has been frequently confused in the literature involves the classification of guilt, which is an introjected form of extrinsic motivation.\n\nThe classification of warm glow as either intrinsic or extrinsic has important ramifications for policy makers. The extensive body of literature on motivational crowding out suggests the efficacy of policies promoting altruistic behavior may be a function of whether pre-existing behavior is intrinsically or extrinsically motivated. The extent to which extrinsic incentives may be substitutes for intrinsic motivations depends upon the motivational classification of the warm glow model. Furthermore, intrinsic warm glow may be more resilient to satiation effects than extrinsic warm glow. Finally, the expected magnitude of a warm glow will be a function of how it is characterized. Models assuming a purely intrinsic warm glow should report lesser warm glows than models also including extrinsic components.\n\nThe phenomenon of warm-glow giving was originally introduced as an economic model. It its original form, the warm-glow model lacked a satisfactory explanation for the underlying psychological processes. Early studies of warm glow were deliberately vague in attributing the experience to a cause. A more recent body of research has identified several important determinants of warm glow, including social distance, vividness to the beneficiary, and guilt avoidance. Taken together, these observations suggest the warm glow may be best described as the visceral manifestation of empathy. This is consistent with the moral psychological literature of empathy, most notably as advanced by Batson. In his \"empathy-altruism hypothesis\", Batson claims that empathy (\"feeling sympathetic, compassionate, warm, softhearted, tender\") evokes a desire for other-regarding behavior.\n\nSocial distance is an important determinant of warm glow, particularly in the framework of empathy. Prior research has examined the link between emotional arousal and social distance, finding that mutual suffering and shared joy both increase as a function of social similarity. Consistent with the \"identifiable victim effect\", research has shown that people express a greater willingness to help when others are known, as opposed to statistical.\nWhile the vividness of the beneficiary is captured in social distance, the vividness to the beneficiary refers to a beneficiary's ability to perceive that kindness has been done upon them. As a determinant of warm glow, vividness to the beneficiary operates on two levels. The primary level concerns whether a beneficiary is aware that kindness has been given to them, absent any attribution of the source. The secondary level involves the identifiability of the benefactor. Warm glow should be positively impacted by both levels for vividness. \n\nRecent work has identified guilt avoidance as an important component of warm glow. Some have even compared guilt as the \"flip side\" of warm glow. Parameterizing guilt as a component of warm glow allows for deficit values of warm glow, which was originally constrained to strictly positive values in Andreoni (1989, 1990). In a recent publication, Andreoni and colleagues explain this by writing: \"Psychologists posit that giving is initiated by a stimulus that elevates sympathy or empathy in the mind of the potential giver, much as the smell of freshly baked bread can pique appetite. Resolving this feeling comes either by giving and feeling good or by not giving and feeling guilt.\" In other notable overviews of warm glow, this phenomenon has been characterized as \"personal distress\". In surveys of self-reported guilt, people experience roughly as much interpersonal and societal guilt as they do personal guilt. Furthermore, half of the survey respondents prefer to directly address and resolve their feelings of guilt. Taken together, these findings suggest a substantial component of guilt aversion.\n\nEvidence from neural imaging supports the warm-glow effect. Recent research using functional magnetic resonance imaging of subjects making donation decisions identifies the subgeneal area and the ventral striatum as regions associated with social giving. The mesolimbic rewards of giving are neurologically similar to receiving material rewards. While there is some evidence for a \"literal warm glow\" - in which an individual's perceived thermal state is elevated by the act of giving due to activation in the insula - the more general consensus across the psychological and neurobiological fields is that helping others makes people happy through the release of the oxytocin and endorphins.\n\nOne of the earliest attempts to formally model the warm glow phenomenon can be found in \"A Theory of the Calculus of Voting\" by Riker and Ordeshook (1968). Resolving the paradox by which rational individuals would never expend the effort to vote due to the statistical near-improbability of \"having their vote count\" (casting the decisive vote), Riker and Ordeshook highlighted the psychological utility of voting for one's preferred candidate. Just as an economic warm glow motivates people to willingly forego their scarce resources, the psychological utility described in early voting models serves to explain otherwise irrational behavior. The warm glow of voting continues to be an important consideration in ethical voter models.\n\nIn efforts to design effective, enduring, and efficient environmental interventions, many scholars and policy makers have focused on warm-glow effects. Because many forms of extrinsic rewards and punishments have failed to promote long-term improvements in environmentally conscious behavior, there is a growing emphasis on intrinsic warm glow. Intervention experiments offer promising results in areas such as supporting green energy, recycling and waste reduction, energy consumption, carpooling initiatives. \n\nSupporting businesses engaged in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives may give consumers a vicarious warm glow. However, recent research suggests that consumers may expect to overpay when companies engage in CSR due to perceptions of price fairness. The implication that \"doing good\" carries a financial burden for businesses leads consumers to infer general price markups. This body of research cautions that corporate warm glows may be coupled with \"cold prickles\" of extra costs.\nWarm glow can be a central element of cause marketing, in which products are paired with donations. When consumers are exposed to products with a direct cause marketing association, their appraisal of both the product and the company may improve due to warm glow. There is also evidence that product warm glows may play a role in a process called \"hedonic licensing\", in which consumers who perceive a moral surplus subsequently allow themselves more leeway to make selfish purchases.\n\nCommon phenomena such as avoiding eye contact with beggars or adjusting one's route to avoid a solicitor may be explained using the warm glow model.\n\nOne behavioral consequence of warm glow is strategic avoidance of giving opportunities. According to this hypothesis, individuals anticipate their warm glow upon identifying a future giving opportunity. Assuming a functional form that allows warm glow to be negative (driven by a \"guilt\" of not giving), people may strategically and effortfully avoid giving situations. The strategic incentive is easily understood through the utility function formula_20where the warm glow formula_21is positive for a donation (joy of giving) and negative for not giving (guilt). For an agent who would suffer a disutility of giving at their desired level formula_22because the marginal utility of private expenditure formula_23exceeds the marginal utility of warm-glow giving, they should prefer to give nothing formula_24Because giving nothing may be associated with guilt, the utility of formula_25will be negative. Therefore, for a rational agent who cannot justify giving, formula_26, can maximize their utility through avoiding a giving situation, effectively dropping the warm glow argument from their utility functions. Thus, formula_27suggests avoidance of giving opportunities is a preferred strategy for individuals who experience guilt as a negative warm glow. Economic models assign a cost of effort to avoidance, and predict that people will incur such effort whenever formula_28where formula_29is the utility of not giving, formula_30is the cost of avoidance, and formula_31is the utility of giving to a solicitor, conditional upon not avoiding. \n\nThrough this lens, avoidance can be viewed as an economic commitment device, where a person commits to avoiding a situation (being asked to give) in which they are likely to surrender to temptation (giving). Central to this avoidance hypothesis is that individuals can anticipate their behavior in high-empathy \"hot states\", while in low-empathy \"cold states\". While this model assumes a high degree of sophistication on the part of the individual, research by Andreoni, Rao, and Trachtman explores this very phenomenon by observing avoidance and donation behavior of customers entering a supermarket during the holidays. Customers often walked to a further entrance to avoid solicitors for the Salvation Army. According to their model, \"empathetically vulnerable\" individuals who are not be able to give (for budgetary reasons), faced the greatest incentive to avoid collectors because of the guilt they would experience upon saying \"no\". \n\nCharities may strategically employ categorical donor recognition. For example, a charitable organization may distinguish any gift between $500-$999.99 by a title distinct from that awarded for gifts above $1,000. As a consequence, the social signaling component of the warm-glow effect (in extrinsic operationalizations of warm glow) suggests individuals should be motivated to make the minimum donation to acquire their desired categorical status. Consistent with this hypothesis, research has indicated significant grouping behavior of donors around category minimums. \n\nA majority of those who choose to give some portion of their wealth to charity support multiple different causes. Rather than giving 100% of their cumulative donations to the same source, there exists a widespread preference to distribute funds across charities. The warm glow model explains this be recognizing that givers receive multiple warm glows by giving to multiple causes, thus supporting the preference to make many smaller contributions. As a consequence, some scholars suggest an efficiency loss due to high volumes of small donations - which are less efficient to process - rather than fewer large donations. Moral philosopher Peter Singermentions warm-glow givers in his 2015 book, \"The Most Good You Can Do\". Singer states that these types of donors \"give small amounts to many charities [and] are not so interested in whether what they are doing helps others.\" He references \"empathetic concern\" and \"personal distress\" as two distinct components of warm-glow givers.\n\nWarm glow may offer an explanation for some of the observed inefficiencies in charitable giving. For example, United States citizens directed more than 60% of their total charitable contributions to religious groups, education institutions, art organizations, and foundations in 2017; compared to under 7% in foreign aid. According to models of social justice and economic QALYs, in which human lives are treated with equal dignity and equal respect - regardless of race, gender, or place of origin - the goal of charity should be to fight global poverty. Similarly, economic models, which attempt to place a monetary value on the human life, highlight the inefficiency of all philanthropy not used to combat global poverty, which offers the highest marginal return. The warm-glow model accounts for such inefficiency because impure altruists may be insensitive to the actual cause, and more sensitive to the act of giving or size of the gift. Thus, warm-glow may generate philanthropic inefficiencies to the extent that it desensitizes potential donors to the marginal impact of a given charity. In response to this concern, Willian MacAskill and colleagues have advanced a process of philanthropic allocation called \"effective altruism\". This methodology seeks to leverage logic and responsibility to identify effective charitable opportunities, thus minimizing the effect of warm-glow in the decision-making process.\n\nA common criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it seems ad-hoc. Indeed, Andreoni, the father of the original model, stated that \"putting warm-glow into the model is, while intuitively appealing, an admittedly \"ad hoc\" fix\". As the body of research has evolved over nearly 30 years - incorporating philosophical, psychological, and physiological insights - it has become a better descriptive model of behavior. \n\nAn obscure criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it necessitates self-deception. This argument states that in order to reap the emotional reward of helping others, one must believe his actions to be motivated altruistically. Yet, the mere existence of a warm glow should then contradict the belief of pure altruism. A question arises as to whether prolonged self-delusion is sustainable and impervious to learning through self-perception. \n\nSome research has investigated the link between warm glow and the phenomenon of mere exposure, leading researchers to consider warm glow as a heuristic.\n\n"}
