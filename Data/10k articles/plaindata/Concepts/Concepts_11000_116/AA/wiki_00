This term figures prominently in the Yoga school of thought, and in Jain philosophy.\n\nAdarsana or \"adarshan\" in Sanskrit as an adjective means latent or invisible, and as a noun it means non-vision, disregard, non-appearance, neglect, latent condition disappearance, not-seeing. It also means \"agyan\" and \"avidya\". Vaidyanath Shastri citing Sl. 2.25 and Sl. 3.55 of Vyasa Bhashya writes that by understanding the non-seeing of objects that exist one understands the seeing of those objects and comes to know about the reality of them. \"Darsana\" means seeing. Therefore, Panini, in his Ashtadhyayi (Sutra 1.1.60 and 61), has given its meaning as - disappearance, invisibility, elision of an object, which fact is denoted by \"luk\", \"shlu\" and \"lup\"; \"lup\" refers to real non-seeing which already exists. In other words, Adarsana refers to the ignorance of factual existence of things. In Ayurveda, the term, \"adarsana\", means visual errors and blindness that results in not seeing the objects that already exist. In the Puranas, \"Adarsana\" is the mind-born mother it is so said because the act of seeing and the act of not seeing or non-seeing is an activity of the mind.\n\nThe term, \"adarsana\", as a technical term in Yoga referring to ignorance or absence of knowledge, figures prominently in the discussions pertaining to the \"Sadhanapada\" of Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Patanjali systemised the Yoga philosophy or Yoga- darsana propounded by Acarya Hiranyagarbha which is the practical application of Samkhya principles earlier systemised through twenty two sutras by Kapila. \"Vyasa-bhasya\" which is Vyasa’s commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali has been commented upon by Vachaspati Misra and Vigyanabhikshu. Vyasa states that liberation consists precisely in the cessation of the mind which cessation occurs by the disappearance of the cause of misconception or \"adarsana\" while adding that correct vision of reality (darsana) stops or sublates misconception which is the cause of bondage. Vyasa explains that \"adarsana\" is the particular conjunction of \"avidya\" in relation to the inward individual consciousness. Vyasa in his commentary on Sadhanapada of Yoga Sutras elaborately discusses and explains the concept of adarsana. Therefore, \"Adarsana\" or wrong conception or contrary knowledge is that contact of the Purusa with the Gunas in which the \"Gunas\" serve as objects of \"Purusa\". The modification of the mind in the shape of experience of pleasure and pain is \"adarsana\". \"Adarsana\" ceases on attainment of discriminative knowledge that gradually leads to \"Kaivalya\" or liberation. It is also known as the power which manifests as knowing (\"darsana\"), or as the characteristic of both the knower (\"Purusa\") and the knowable.\n\nThe Yoga School of Hindu Philosophy considers \"Adarsana\" as the sway i.e. proneness to \"Gunas\", which sway lasts till the \"Gunas\" are activeand that it is non-production of the primary mind. The primary mind is that which ceases to function after presenting the objects of experience and discernment to the owner, the Seer. The mind that ceases to function when right knowledge and aversion to objects of enjoyment through renunciation takes place is the primary mind. This school of thought also views \"Adarsana\" as the existence of experience and liberation in a latent state as the latency of \"Avidya\" or wrong knowledge or want of discrimination which is the cause of alliance of \"Buddhi\" and \"Purusa\" and its co-existing \"adarsana\". \"Adarsana\" is \"Pradhana\" which has a dual nature i.e. it is static and also fluctuating and it is the cognitive faculty because \"Pradhana\" has the tendency to fluctuate and which tendency is stored as potential energy, \"adarsana\". Thus, this school considers \"Adarsana\" to be the characteristic of both \"Pradhana\" and \"Purusa\" as a particular form of cognition, as all knowledge except discriminatory knowledge. Vyasa in his commentary on Yoga Sutra II.23 tells us that \"adarsana\" is the failure to see or ignorance (\"avidya\"). Patanjali in his \"Yoga Sutra\" II.24 does explain that the cause of identification (\"samyoga\") of the Atman, the experiencer, with \"Prakrti\", the object of experience, i.e. bondage, is ignorance. When \"adarsana\" ceases, the alliance of \"Buddhi\" and \"Purusa\" that causes misery ceases and there is complete cessation of bondage for all time, the state of aloofness of \"Purusa\" and non-occurrence of future contact with the \"Gunas\" ensues. \n\nBut, Dharmakirti, the Buddhist philosopher, states that pervasion cannot be founded on the observation of \"darsana\" (co-presence) or the observation of \"adarsana\" (co-absence) which is the view held also by the Caravakas and the Jains, because identity and causation are the only acceptable grounds of pervasion, unless two things are related in one of these ways, there can be no necessity and no pervasion, and non-difference implies essential identity in spite of the difference in cognitive contents of the two expressions.\n\nIn Jainism, the term, \"adarsana\", indicates the condition of mental unease and the suffering of loss of faith resulting from the failure in achieving the desired highest goal after long \"sadhana\", \"tapas\" etc., which negative feeling does not affect one who has transcended anger, violence, jealousy, waywardness, bad or evil intentions, untruth, and who is disciplined and adopting the \"Brahmacharya Dharma\" has forsaken his household or family-life, all desires for possession of things and readily donates whatever is possessed by him. The overcoming of this negative feeling is called \"Adarsana-vijay\". \n\nAccording to Baudhayana, Aryavarta lies west of Kalakavana, east of Adarsana, south of the Himalayas and north of the Vindhyas. Dharamsutra II.2.16 speaks of \"Vinasana\" as Adarsana, the western boundary of Aryavarta \n"}
{"id": "21996250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21996250", "title": "Arhat", "text": "Arhat\n\nTheravada Buddhism defines arhat (Sanskrit; Pali: arahant) as one who has gained insight into the true nature of existence and has achieved \"nirvana\". Other Buddhist traditions have used the term for people far advanced along the path of Enlightenment, but who may not have reached full Buddhahood.\n\nThe understanding of the concept has changed over the centuries, and varies between different schools of Buddhism and different regions. A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the early Buddhist schools. The Sarvāstivāda, Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, Bahuśrutīya, Prajñaptivāda, and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as imperfect in their attainments compared to buddhas.\n\nMahayana Buddhist teachings urge followers to take up the path of a bodhisattva, and to not fall back to the level of arhats and śrāvakas. The arhats, or at least the senior arhats, came to be widely regarded as \"moving beyond the state of personal freedom to join the Bodhisattva enterprise in their own way\".\n\nMahayana Buddhism regarded a group of Eighteen Arhats (with names and personalities) as awaiting the return of the Buddha as Maitreya, and other groupings of 6, 8, 16, 100, and 500 also appear in tradition and Buddhist art, especially in East Asia. They can be seen as the Buddhist equivalents of the Christian saints, apostles or early disciples and leaders of the faith.\n\nPāḷi \"arahant\" is a present participle coming from the verbal root √arh \"to deserve\", cf. \"arha\" \"meriting, deserving\"; \"arhaṇa\" \"having a claim, being entitled\"; \"arhita\" (past participle) \"honoured, worshipped\". The word is used in the \"Ṛgveda\" with this sense of \"deserving\".\n\nA common folk etymology derives the word from \"ari\" (enemy) and \"hanta\" from the root √han (cf: Hunter) \"to strike, to kill\"; hence the translation \"foe-destroyer\". Professor Richard Gombrich has argued that the present participle is \"jarring\" and seems out of place when there is an adjective from the same root (\"arha\"). Since Jains used two Prakrit forms of the word \"arahanta\" and \"arihanta\", the folk etymology may well be the correct etymology. Gombrich argues that this stems from the same metaphor as the Jain title \"jina\" \"conqueror\", whence \"jaina\" \"related to the conqueror\", i.e. Jainism.\n\nThe term \"arhat\" is often rendered in English as \"arahat\".\n\nThe term \"arhat\" was transliterated into some East Asian languages phonetically, for example, the Chinese \"āluóhàn\" (Ch. 阿羅漢), often shortened to simply \"luóhàn\" (Ch. 羅漢). This may appear in English as \"luohan\" or \"lohan\". In Japanese the pronunciation of the same Chinese characters is \"rakan\" (Ja. 羅漢) or \"arakan\" (Ja. 阿羅漢).\n\nThe Tibetan term for \"arhat\" was translated by meaning from Sanskrit. This translation, \"dgra bcom pa\", means \"one who has destroyed the foes of afflictions\". Thus the Tibetan translators also understood the meaning of \"arhat\" to be \"ari-hanta\".\n\nA range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the early Buddhist schools. The Sarvāstivāda, Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, Bahuśrutīya, Prajñaptivāda and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as being imperfect in their attainments compared to buddhas.\n\nThe Dharmaguptaka sect believed that \"the Buddha and those of the Two Vehicles, although they have one and the same liberation, have followed different noble paths.\"\n\nThe Mahīśāsaka and the Theravada regarded arhats and buddhas as being similar to one another. The 5th century Theravadin commentator Buddhaghosa regarded arhats as having completed the path to enlightenment. According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the Pāli Canon portrays the Buddha declaring himself to be an arahant. According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, \"nirvāṇa\" is \"the ultimate goal\", and one who has attained nirvana has attained arahantship: Bhikkhu Bodhi writes, \"The defining mark of an arahant is the attainment of nirvāṇa in this present life.\"\n\nThe Mahayana discerned a hierarchy of attainments, with \"samyaksambuddha\"s at the top, mahāsattvas below that, pratyekabuddhas below that and arhats further below. \"But what was it that distinguished the \"bodhisattva\" from the \"sravaka\", and ultimately the \"buddha\" from the \"arhat\"? The difference lay, more than anywhere else, in the altruistic orientation of the \"bodhisattva\".\"\n\nIn pre-Buddhist India, the term arhat, denoting a saintly person in general, was closely associated with miraculous power and asceticism. The Buddhists drew a sharp distinction between their Arhat and Indian holy men in general, in Buddhism these miraculous powers were no longer central to arhat identity or to his mission.\n\nA range of views on the relative perfection of arhats existed amongst the early Buddhist schools. In general, Mahāsāṃghikas such as the Ekavyāvahārikas, Lokottaravādins, Bahuśrutīyins, Prajñaptivādins, and Caitikas schools, advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas and the fallibility of arhats. The Caitikas, for example, advocated the ideal of the bodhisattva (\"bodhisattvayāna\") over that of the arhat (\"śrāvakayāna\"), and they viewed arhats as being fallible and still subject to ignorance.\n\nAccording to A.K. Warder, the Sarvāstivādins held the same position as the Mahāsāṃghika branch regarding arhats, considering them to be imperfect and fallible. In the Sarvāstivādin \"Nāgadatta Sūtra\", the demon Māra takes the form of Nāgadatta's father, and tries to convince Nāgadatta, who was a bhikṣuṇī, to work toward the lower stage of arhatship rather than striving to become a fully enlightened buddha (samyaksaṃbuddha).\n\nIn her reply, Nāgadatta rejects arhatship as a lower path, saying, \"A Buddha's wisdom is like empty space of the ten-quarters, which can enlighten innumerable people. But an Arhat's wisdom is inferior.\"\n\nThe Kāśyapīya school also held the doctrine that arhats were fallible and imperfect, similar to the view of the Sarvāstivādins and the various Mahāsāṃghika sects. The Kāśyapīyins believed that arhats have not fully eliminated desires, that their \"perfection\" is incomplete, and that it is possible for them to relapse.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, an arahant is a person who has eliminated all the unwholesome roots which underlie the fetters – who upon their death will not be reborn in any world, since the bonds (fetters) that bind a person to the samsara have been finally dissolved. In the Pali Canon, the word \"tathagata\" is sometimes used as a synonym for arahant, though the former usually refers to the Buddha alone.\n\nAfter attainment of Nibbana, the five aggregates (physical forms, feelings/sensations, perception, mental formations and consciousness) will continue to function, sustained by physical bodily vitality. This attainment is termed \"the nibbana element with a residue remaining\". But once the Arahant pass-away and with the disintegration of the physical body, the five aggregates will cease to function, hence ending all traces of existence in the phenomenal world and thus total release from the misery of samsara. It would then be termed \"the nibbana element without residue remaining\". Parinibbana occurs at the death of an Arahant.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism the Buddha himself is first identified as an arahant, as are his enlightened followers, because they are free from all defilements, without greed, hatred, delusion, ignorance and craving. Lacking \"assets\" which will lead to future birth, the arahant knows and sees the real here and now. This virtue shows stainless purity, true worth, and the accomplishment of the end, nibbana.\n\nIn his study of the roles of arahants, buddhas, and bodhisattvas, Nathan Katz writes that, there is a tendency in the Theravāda school to exclude laypeople from the possibility of achieving arahantship.\n\nIn the Pali canon, Ānanda states that he knows monastics to achieve nibbana in one of four ways:\n\n\nFor those that have destroyed greed and hatred (in the sensory context) with some residue of delusion, are called \"anagami\" (non-returner). Anagamis will not be reborn into the human world after death, but into the heaven of the Pure Abodes, where only anagamis live. There, they will attain full enlightenment.\n\nThe Theravadin commentator Buddhaghosa placed the \"arahant\" at the completion of the path to liberation.\n\nMahayana Buddhists see Gautama Buddha himself as the ideal towards which one should aim in one's spiritual aspirations. A hierarchy of general attainments is envisioned with the attainments of arhats and pratyekabuddhas being clearly separate and below that of samyaksambuddha or tathāgatas such as Gautama Buddha.\n\nIn contrast to the goal of becoming a fully enlightened buddha, the path of a śrāvaka in being motivated by seeking personal liberation from saṃsāra is often portrayed as selfish and undesirable. There are even some Mahāyāna texts that regard the aspiration to arhatship and personal liberation as an outside path. Instead of aspiring for arhatship, Mahayanins are urged to instead take up the path of the bodhisattva and to not fall back to the level of arhats and śrāvakas. Therefore, it is taught that an arhat must go on to become a bodhisattva eventually. If they fail to do so in the lifetime in which they reach the attainment, they will fall into a deep samādhi of emptiness, thence to be roused and taught the bodhisattva path, presumably when ready. According to the \"Lotus Sutra\", any true arhat will eventually accept the Mahāyāna path.\n\nMahāyāna teachings often consider the śrāvaka path to be motivated by fear of saṃsāra, which renders them incapable of aspiring to buddhahood, and that they therefore lack the courage and wisdom of a bodhisattva. Novice bodhisattvas are compared to śrāvakas and arhats at times. In the ', there is an account of sixty novice bodhisattvas who attain arhatship despite themselves and their efforts at the bodhisattva path because they lacked the abilities of prajnaparamita and skillful means to progress as bodhisattvas toward complete enlightenment (Skt. '). This is because they are still viewed as having innate attachment and fear of saṃsāra. The \"\" compares these people to a giant bird without wings that cannot help but plummet to the earth from the top of Sumeru.\n\nMahayan Buddhism has viewed the śrāvaka path culminating in arhatship as a lesser accomplishment than complete enlightenment, but still accords due respect to arhats for their respective achievements. Therefore, buddha-realms are depicted as populated by both śrāvakas and bodhisattvas. Far from being completely disregarded, the accomplishments of arhats are viewed as impressive, essentially because they have transcended the mundane world. Chinese Buddhism and other East Asian traditions have historically accepted this perspective, and specific groups of arhats are venerated as well, such as the Sixteen Arhats, the Eighteen Arhats, and the Five Hundred Arhats. The first famous portraits of these arhats were painted by the Chinese monk Guanxiu () in 891 CE. He donated these portraits to Shengyin Temple in Qiantang (modern Hangzhou), where they are preserved with great care and ceremonious respect.\n\nIn some respects, the path to arhatship and the path to complete enlightenment are seen as having common grounds. However, a distinctive difference is seen in the Mahāyāna doctrine pushing emotional and cognitive non-attachment to their logical consequences. Of this, Paul Williams writes that in Mahāyāna Buddhism, \"Nirvāṇa must be sought without being sought (for oneself), and practice must be done without being practiced. The discursive mode of thinking cannot serve the basic purpose of attainment without attainment.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3022", "title": "Autonomous building", "text": "Autonomous building\n\nAn autonomous building is a building designed to be operated independently from infrastructural support services such as the electric power grid, gas grid, municipal water systems, sewage treatment systems, storm drains, communication services, and in some cases, public roads.\n\nAdvocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced environmental impacts, increased security, and lower costs of ownership. Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of green building, not independence per se (see below). Off-grid buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. (Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised for some reason.)\n\nMost of the research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.\n\nBritish architects Brenda and Robert Vale have said that, as of 2002, \"It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a \"house with no bills\" for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, a group of activists and engineers calling themselves the New Alchemists believed the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. The New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional construction techniques, they designed a series of \"bioshelter\" projects, the most famous of which was the Ark Bioshelter community for Prince Edward Island. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, fish tanks raising tilapia for protein, a greenhouse watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the \"New Alchemy Institute\". The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.\n\nThe 1990s saw the development of Earthships, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by Mike Reynolds. The building material is tires filled with earth. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see earth sheltering). Berms are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally black water is recycled again for more plant watering. The cisterns are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from solar power.\n\n1990s architects such as William McDonough and Ken Yeang applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building (ING's Amsterdam headquarters) in the Netherlands was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.\n\nAs an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.\n\nAutonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.\n\nAutonomous buildings are usually energy-efficient in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.\n\nAn autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of sustainability through the use of renewable energy and other renewable resources, producing no more greenhouse gases than they consume, and other measures.\n\nFirst and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree, with many choices. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively easy. In contrast, running an efficient, reliable food source can be a chore.\n\nLiving within an autonomous shelter may also require sacrifices in lifestyle or social opportunities. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require alterations of residents' behavior. Some may not welcome the extra chores. The Vails described some clients' experiences as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.\n\nAn autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.\n\nThe Vales, among others, have shown that living off-grid can be a practical, logical lifestyle choice—under certain conditions.\n\nThis section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.\n\nThere are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.\n\nGreywater systems reuse drained wash water to flush toilets or to water lawns and gardens. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary plumbing. Some builders are installing waterless urinals and even composting toilets that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.\n\nThe classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a well. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The sono arsenic filter eliminates unhealthy arsenic in well water.\n\nHowever drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas. It can also be expensive.\n\nIn regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use rainwater harvesting, with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment. If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.\n\nMost desert and temperate climates get at least of rain per year. This means that a typical one-story house with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a cistern of . Many areas average of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as .\n\nIn many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking. To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a \"roof cleaner\" tank that diverts the first 40 liters. Cistern water is usually chlorinated, though reverse osmosis systems provide even better quality drinking water.\n\nIn the classic Roman house (\"Domus\"), household water was provided from a cistern (the \"impluvium\"), that was a decorative feature of the atrium, the house's main public space. It was fed by downspout tiles from the inward facing roof-opening (the \"compluvium\"). Often water lilies were grown in it to purify the water. Wealthy households often supplemented the rain with a small fountain fed from a city's cistern. The impluvium always had an overflow drain so it could not flood the house.\n\nModern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks. Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent. The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.\n\nReducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below per person per day, so that in a drought a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.\n\nIt can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a heat pump or air conditioning system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.\n\nSolar stills can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency multiple effect humidification designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).\n\nNew technologies, like reverse osmosis can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into potable water and brine. Atmospheric water generators extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.\n\nComposting toilets use bacteria to decompose human feces into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens as well as most of the mass of the waste. Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of \"humanure\" for growing food. The risk is microbial and viral contamination. In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months. To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.\n\nSome home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free reclaimed water can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large aquarium.\n\nElectric incinerating toilets turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.\n\nNASA's bioreactor is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned Mars mission.\n\nA big disadvantage of complex biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota may starve to death.\n\nAnother method is NASA's urine-to-water distillation system.\n\nSewage handling is essential for public health. Many diseases are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.\n\nThe standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a septic tank. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary sewage treatment. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by anaerobic digestion, and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.\n\nSeptic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a vacuum truck to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.\n\nHowever, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.\n\nComposting or packaging toilets make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.\n\nIncinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.\n\nTraditional methods of sewage handling include pit toilets, latrines, and outhouses. These can be safe, inexpensive and practical. They are still used in many regions.\n\nDrainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.\n\nTypically, elaborate, capital-intensive storm sewer networks are engineered to deal with stormwater. In some cities, such as the Victorian era London sewers or much of the old City of Toronto, the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.\n\nAutonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:\n\nIf a water absorbing swale for each yard is combined with permeable concrete streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains. One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.\n\nA green roof captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.\n\nSince electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards autonomy is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. LED lights, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient. There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the Sun Frost company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market energy star-rated refrigerator.\n\nUsing a solar roof, solar cells can provide electric power. Solar roofs can be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.\n\nHowever, many areas have long winter nights or dark cloudy days. In these climates, a solar installation might not pay for itself. In stormy or windy climates, wind generators can replace or supplement solar power. The average autonomous house needs only one small wind turbine, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100 foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.\n\nThe main advantage of wind power is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, many areas lack enough wind to make a turbine pay for itself. In the Great Plains of the United States, a 10-metre (33 foot) turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.\n\nDuring times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the electric power grid and operating the power system with net metering. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).\n\nA grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using single-wire earth return systems (for example, the MALT-system).\n\nIn areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced with a generator to recharge the batteries during energy droughts such as extended fogs. Auxiliary generators are usually run from propane, natural gas, or sometimes diesel. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.\n\nRecent advances in passively stable magnetic bearings may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a flywheel in a vacuum. Research groups like Canada's Ballard Power Systems are also working to develop a \"regenerative fuel cell\", a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.\n\nEarth batteries tap electric currents in the earth called telluric current. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power telegraphs in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.\n\nMicrobial fuel cells and thermoelectric generators allow electricity to be generated from biomass. The plant can be dried, chopped and converted or burned as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.\n\nMost autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are trombe walls and other technologies as skylights.\n\nPassive solar heating can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.\n\nThe basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the Northern Hemisphere, north in the Southern Hemisphere), and the building must incorporate thermal mass to keep it warm in the night.\n\nA recent, somewhat experimental solar heating system \"Annualized geo solar heating\" is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter. It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.\n\nIn annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from insulation, for example, straw-bale construction. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.\n\nA more modest \"daily solar\" design is very practical. For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the Passivhaus building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern krypton- or argon-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required thermal mass. Passivhaus building codes in particular bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it though a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.\n\nIn all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small heat pump, which also provides air conditioning, or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the water heater. Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.\n\nEarth sheltering and windbreaks can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from in North Dakota to , in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.\n\nRounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.\n\nAn increasing number of commercial buildings use a combined cycle with cogeneration to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas reciprocating engine, gas turbine or stirling electric generator.\n\nHouses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a wood stove, or heat and power from diesel fuel or bottled gas, regardless of their other heating mechanisms.\n\nElectric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.\n\nHot water heat recycling units recover heat from water drain lines. They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water. They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.\n\nCurrent practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater, so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.\n\nSolar water heaters can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.\n\nThe basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are vacuum- insulated, acting something like large thermos bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.\n\nCogeneration systems produce hot water from waste heat. They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.\n\nHeat recycling, cogeneration and solar pre-heating can save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used. Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.\nSome authorities advocate replacing bottled gas or natural gas with biogas. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site. The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough methane for anything more than small amounts of cooking.\n\nAnnualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.\n\nLess dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.\n\nAnother trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, perhaps with a whole-house fan and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky-facing radiators can cool below freezing.\n\nIf a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the \"dome effect.\" Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as () between the inside of the dome and the outside. Buckminster Fuller discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a grain silo, and adapted his Dymaxion house and geodesic domes to use it.\n\nRefrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an \"absorptive chiller\". The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.\n\nCogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or stirling engines powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an absorptive chiller.\n\nA truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's diesel exhaust was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic ammonia gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.\n\nA similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50 °F (28 °C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.\n\nIf enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a heat pump.\n\nFood production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.\nSkilled, intensive gardening can support an adult from as little as 100 square meters of land per person,\npossibly requiring the use of organic farming and aeroponics. Some proven intensive, low-effort food-production systems include urban gardening (indoors and outdoors). Indoor cultivation may be set up using hydroponics, while outdoor cultivation may be done using permaculture, forest gardening, no-till farming, and do nothing farming.\n\nGreenhouses are also sometimes included. Sometimes they are also outfitted with irrigation systems or heat sink-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night (when the greenhouses starts to cool down).\n\n"}

One church bell is in the possession of the 9th Infantry Regiment at Camp Red Cloud, their base in South Korea, while two others are on a former base of the 11th Infantry Regiment at F. E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The bell being kept by the 9th Infantry Regiment in South Korea had been tolled to signal a surprise attack by the Filipinos against the American troops as the latter were eating breakfast.\n\nThe recovery of the bells had been sought by various individuals representing the Catholic Church in the Philippines, the Philippine government and the residents of Balangiga since the late 1950s. These efforts however, have been met with frustration until recently. As of November 2018, all three church bells are in the process of being repatriated back to the Philippines from the United States and South Korea.\n\nOn September 28, 1901, Filipino militants from the village of Balangiga ambushed Company C of the 9th U.S. Infantry Regiment, while they were at breakfast, killing an estimated 48 and wounding 22 of the 78 men of the unit, with only four escaping unhurt. The villagers captured about 100 rifles and 25,000 rounds of ammunition. An estimated 20 to 25 of the villagers had died in the fighting, with a similar number of wounded.\n\nIn reprisal, General Jacob H. Smith ordered that Samar be turned into a \"howling wilderness\" and that any Filipino male above ten years of age capable of bearing arms be shot. From the burned-out Catholic town church, the Americans looted three bells which they took back to the United States as war booty. The 9th U.S. Infantry Regiment, however, maintains that the single bell in their possession was presented to the regiment by villagers when the unit left Balangiga on April 9, 1902. Smith and his primary subordinate, Major Littleton Waller of the United States Marine Corps were both court-martialled for illegal vengeance against the civilian population of Samar. Waller was acquitted of the charges. Smith was found guilty, admonished and retired from service, but charges were dropped shortly after. He was later hailed as a war hero.\n\nAfter Balangiga became a separate parish on September 27, 1859, the town probably took four years to raise funds to acquire its first church bell. It was cast circa-1863 and bears what was initially believed to be an Augustinian emblem; latter sources state that the bells are Franciscan. It has a mouth diameter of inches and height of 30 inches. It is inscribed with a name, R. San Francisco, who was probably the parish priest at that time.\n\nThe town may have acquired its second bell, cast circa-1889 and having a mouth diameter of inches and height of inches, in 1889 through the initiative of Fr. Agustin Delgado, whose name is inscribed on the bell.\n\nThe third and smallest bell may have been acquired in 1895, through the initiative of Fr. Bernardo Aparecio. This is the bell now kept by the 9th U.S. Infantry Regiment in Camp Red Cloud, South Korea. Estimates of its size deduce a 23–24 inch height and a mouth diameter of about 20 inches. It bears the Franciscan emblem.\n\nAfter the Balangiga incident, the town was recaptured on September 29, 1901 by 55 men of Company G, 9th Infantry. That unit departed the town the same day, and was replaced by 132 men from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry Regiment which garrisoned the town until relieved on October 18, 1901. When the 11th Infantry departed, they brought home the war trophies. These\nincluded two of the bells removed from the burnt-down Balangiga Church, and a cannon from the plaza in front of the church. The bells were taken because one had been used by the insurgents to signal the attack on Company C, 9th Infantry.\n\nThe 11th Infantry redeployed to Fort D.A. Russell in Wyoming, arriving on March 23, 1904. On May 16, 1905, the Cheyenne Daily Leader newspaper reported that the cannon had been mounted on the parade ground near the flagpole along with other relics from the Philippines \"...to include the famous bell which gave the signal for the massacre of a whole company. Two large bells three feet tall and a seven-foot cannon were proudly displayed in front of the flagpole on the parade ground of the fort\".\n\nA sign was installed over one of the bells that said;\n\nThe sign above the bell erroneously credited units of the 11th Infantry with being the first to reach Balangiga after the battle. After further research, the sign was changed in 1911 giving proper credit to Company G, 9th Infantry, for recapturing Balangiga.\n\nIn 1927, Fort Russell was renamed Fort Francis E. Warren. On 7 October 1949, it became Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. \n\nIn 1967, a curved red brick wall was constructed in the Warren AFB trophy park for the bells, with a bronze plaque on the wall between the bells telling the story of the massacre at Balangiga. , a faint inscription was visible on the back of both bells, reading:\n, a glass case housed the bells along with the 400-year-old British Falcon cannon. \n\nThe third church bell which was in the possession of the 9th U.S. Infantry Regiment is kept at the 2nd Infantry Division Museum in Camp Red Cloud, Uijeongbu. It had previously been displayed at the unit's Camp Hovey headquarters.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, during the term of Fidel Ramos as Philippine President, attempts were initiated by his government to recover one or more of the bells from Bill Clinton's administration. The United States government has been adamant that the bells are US government property, that it would take an Act of Congress to return them and that the Catholic Church has no say in the matter. For their part the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines hold the position that the bells are inappropriate as trophies of war.\n\nIn 2002, the Philippine Senate approved Senate Resolution No. 393, authored by Aquilino Pimentel Jr., urging the Arroyo administration to undertake formal negotiations with the United States for the return of the bells.\n\nIn 2005, the bishop of Borongan, Samar, Bishop Leonardo Medroso and Balangiga parish priest Saturnino Obzunar wrote an open letter addressed to President George W. Bush, the United States Congress and the Helsinki Commission, requesting them to facilitate the return of the bells. That same year, the Wyoming Veterans’ Commission favored the return of the Filipino-American War relics, however, Wyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal stated that he disagreed with the Commission and opposed returning the bells. On January 13, 2005, United States Congressman Bob Filner had introduced H.Res.313, urging the President to authorize the transfer of ownership of one of the bells to the people of the Philippines. The resolution died on January 3, 2007, with the \"sine die\" adjournment of the 109th United States Congress.\n\nOn September 26, 2006, United States Congressman Bob Filner, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and Congressman Ed Case co-sponsored House Concurrent Resolution No. 481 urging the president of the United States to authorize the return of the church bells. The resolution died on January 3, 2009, with the \"sine die\" adjournment of the 110th United States Congress.\n\nIn 2007, Napoleón Abueva, the Philippines' National Artist for sculpture, wrote American Ambassador to the Philippines Kristie Kenney asking for her help in the bells' recovery. On October 25 of the same year, during the 14th Congress of the Philippines, Senator Manny Villar filed Senate Resolution No. 177, a resolution \"expressing the sense of the Senate for the return to the Philippines of the Balangiga Bells which were taken by the US troops from the town of Balangiga, Province of Samar in 1901\".\n\nThe townspeople of Balangiga asked the United States to return their church bells after receiving relief from the U.S. military subsequent to Typhoon Haiyan hitting the town in 2013.\n\nIn his second State of the Nation Address on July 24, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte demanded the bells' return, citing ownership of the Philippines. He however did not raise the issue in a bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump held in November 2017 during the 31st ASEAN Summit.\n\nIn February 2018 two US lawmakers, Randy Hultgren and Jim McGovern, objected to the bells being returned to the Philippines due to the current human rights record established by Duterte's Philippine Drug War.\n\nIn August 2018, the US Embassy in the Philippines issued a statement that the US Department of Defense had notified the United States Congress that it plans to return the bells to the Philippines at an unspecified date. Three months later, Dr. Rolando Borrinaga of the Philippines' National Commission for Culture and the Arts stated that the two bells at the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base will be turned over to Philippine representatives on 15 November 2018. The third bell in South Korea is also ready for repatriation. The two bells in Wyoming will then be shipped to Philadelphia for restoration work before being sent to South Korea, where they will join the third bell. All three bells will then be returned to the Philippines. \n\nThe successful campaign to return the bells came about due to the support of veterans organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, according to Dr. Borrinaga. Another source cited Borrinaga, and former United States Navy officers Dennis Wright and Dan McKinnon as those who \"campaigned to have the bells repatriated\"; these same American ex-servicemen had spearheaded the recovery from West Point in 2016 of another church bell taken in 1901 from the Saints Peter and Paul Church in Bauang, La Union. The Philippine government however, declined further comment until the bells have been fully repatriated. The bells are expected to arrive in the Philippines in December 2018.\n\nA Chicago-based, Philippine-American theater company called The Pintig Cultural Group presented a musical based on the incident, \"The Bells of Balangiga.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2139191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139191", "title": "Breast pain", "text": "Breast pain\n\nBreast pain is the symptom of discomfort in the breast. Pain that involves both breasts and which occurs repeatedly before the menstrual period is generally not serious. Pain that involves only one part of a breast is more concerning. It is particular concerning if a hard mass or nipple discharge is also present.\nCauses may be related to the menstrual cycle, birth control pills, hormone therapy, or psychiatric medication. Pain may also occur in those with large breasts, during menopause, and in early pregnancy. In about 2% of cases breast pain is related to breast cancer. Diagnosis involves examination, with medical imaging if only a specific part of the breast hurts.\nIn more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment. Otherwise treatments may include paracetamol or NSAIDs. A well fitting bra may also help. In those with severe pain tamoxifen or danazol may be used. About 70% of women have breast pain at some point in time. Breast pain is one of the most common breast symptom, along with breast masses and nipple discharge.\n\nCyclical breast pain is often associated with fibrocystic breast changes or duct ectasia and thought to be caused by changes of prolactin response to thyrotropin. Some degree of cyclical breast tenderness is normal in the menstrual cycle, and is usually associated with menstruation and/or premenstrual syndrome (PMS).\n\nNoncyclical breast pain has various causes and is harder to diagnose. Noncyclical pain has frequently its root cause outside the breast. Some degree of non-cyclical breast tenderness can normally be present due to hormonal changes in puberty (both in girls and boys), in menopause and during pregnancy. After pregnancy, breast pain can be caused by breastfeeding. Other causes of non-cyclical breast pain include alcoholism with liver damage (likely due to abnormal steroid metabolism), mastitis and medications such as digitalis, methyldopa (an antihypertensive), spironolactone, certain diuretics, oxymetholone (an anabolic steroid), and chlorpromazine (a typical antipsychotic). Also, shingles can cause a painful blistering rash on the skin of the breasts.\n\nSome women who have pain in one or both breasts may fear breast cancer. However, breast pain is not a common symptom of cancer. The great majority of breast cancer cases do not present with symptoms of pain, though breast pain in older women is more likely to be associated with cancer.\n\nDiagnosis involves breast examination, with medical imaging if only a specific part of the breast hurts. Medical imaging by ultrasound is recommended for all ages, well in those over 30 it is recommended together with mammography.\n\nRuling out the other possible causes of the pain is one way to differentiate the source of the pain. Breast pain can be due to:\nMedications can be associated with breast pain and include:\n\nDiagnostic testing can be useful. Typical tests used are mammogram, excisional biopsy for solid lumps, fine-needle aspiration and biopsy, pregnancy test, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nIn more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment. Otherwise treatments may include paracetamol or NSAIDs. A well fitting bra may also help. In those with severe pain tamoxifen or danazol may be used.\n\nBromocriptine may be used aswell.\n\nSpironolactone, low dose oral contraceptives, and low-dose estrogen have helped to relieve pain. Topical anti-inflammatory medications can be used for localized pain. Vitamin E is not effective in relieving pain nor is evening primrose oil. Vitamin B and vitamin A have not been consistently found to be beneficial. Flaxseed has shown some activity in the treatment of cyclic mastalgia.\n\nPain may be relieved by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or, for more severe localized pain, by local anaesthetic. Pain may be relieved by reassurance that it does not signal a serious underlying problem, and an active life style can also effect an improvement.\n\nInformation regarding how the pain is real but not necessarily caused by disease can help to understand the problem. Learning breast self-examination helps to orient the woman to normal and expected texture and structure of the breast and nipple. Yearly breast exams may be suggested. Counseling can also be to describe changes that vary during the monthly cycle. Women on hormone replacement therapy may benefit from a dose adjustment. Another non-pharmacological measure to help relieve symptoms of pain may be to use good bra support. Breasts change during adolescence and menopause and refitting may be beneficial. Applying heat and/or ice can bring relief. Dietary changes may also help with the pain. Methylxanthines can be eliminated from the diet to see if a sensitivity is present. Some clinicians recommending a reduction in salt, though no evidence supports this practice.\n\n"}
{"id": "5318217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5318217", "title": "Chakana", "text": "Chakana\n\nThe chakana (or Inca Cross) is a stepped cross made up of an equal-armed cross indicating the cardinal points of the compass and a superimposed square. The square is suggested to represent the other two levels of existence. The three levels of existence are \"Hana Pacha\" (the upper world inhabited by the superior gods), \"Kay Pacha\", (the world of our everyday existence) and \"Ukhu\" or \"Urin Pacha\" (the underworld inhabited by spirits of the dead, the ancestors, their overlords and various deities having close contact to the Earth plane). The hole through the centre of the cross is the Axis by means of which the shaman transits the cosmic vault to the other levels. It is also said to represent Cusco, the center of the Incan empire, and the Southern Cross constellation.\n\nThe geometry of the symbol has a high degree of symmetry. The symbol can be drawn from a circle. A square is inscribed in the circle, with the corners tangent to the circle. This forms the \"middle step\" of the ladder. A smaller square (tilted 45 degrees) is made from the midpoints of the large square. Connecting the midpoints of the small square and extending the lines to the edge of the circle will form the arms of the cross, otherwise known as the \"first\" and \"last\" steps of the chakana. Lines are drawn from the points the lines exit the circle, to complete the cross. A small circle is made from the diameter of the cross lines. To proof the construction, a separate construction line is drawn from the point where the square corners with the cross rectangles to the same point on the opposite side. If the line is 27 degrees from the vertical, the chakana is properly drawn.\n\nThe mestee historian Garcilaso de la Vega, \"el Ynga\", reports about a holy cross of white and red marble or jasper, which was venerated in 16th-century Cusco. The cross had been kept in a royal house, in a sacred place or \"wak'a\", but the Incas did not worship it. They simply admired it because of its beauty. The cross was square (\"quadrada\"), measuring about two by two feet, its branches three inch wide, the edges carefully squared and the surface brightly polished.\n\nThe Incas began to venerate the holy cross, after they heard how Pedro de Candia had miraculously defied a lion and a tiger holding a cross. When the Spaniards captured the city, they transferred the cross to sacristy of the newly built cathedral, where De la Vega saw it in 1560. He was surprised that the clergy had not decorated it with gold or gems. As we know from Middle America, this may have been part of a deliberate strategy by mendicant friars, trying to adapt to indigenous cultural codes. As a rule, the veneration of the holy cross was a carefully designed ecclesiastical enterprise, incorporating native symbols and reproducing them on sacral level. Most surviving Meso-American crosses do not predate the 16th century. Ongoing stories about indigenous crosses contributed to the idea of a 'natural' religion that would have prepared the Indians for their inevitable conversion to Christianity.\n\nActually, this Andean \"cross\" has been documented in Tiwanaku architecture (Bolivia) dating back to 300 BC and AD 300. Other Andean cultures, Mapuche, whose presence in the Americas also predates Western presence and date back 600 t 500 BC.\n\nThe \"chakana\" is an invented tradition. Although the Chakana as the 'Andean cross', presented as an Inca and pre-Inca symbol bearing cultural, spiritual, or mystical interpretations as expressed in this article, has wide popularity in contemporary Andean culture, its roots are no older than the late 20th century, and the popular version, than 2003. The current Chakana mythos as it impacts the New Age belief system and the Peruvian tourist-oriented economy initiates from the 2003 publication of the book Andean Awakening, authored by Jorge Luis Delgado, and Mary Anne Male. This is the source of the myth. They are followed by such authors as Mark Torra and Roger Calverley (CHAKANA: Secret Teachings of an Ancient Andean Mystery School). The archaeoastronomer Carlos Milla Villena published his own, distinctly different speculative interpretations of the chacana as “andean, cross” in Génesis de la cultura andina,1983.\n\nMainstream scientific, scholastic, and archaeological sources do not refer to or support the word chakana as the cross-and-box design - rather, it is in Runasimi, the traditional language of the Inca peoples, (modern Quechua), derived from chaka, 'bridge', and means 'to cross over', or 'a crossing'. Among chroniclers such as the Jesuit missionary and naturalist José de Acosta, 1590, it is applied to the group of stars commonly identified as the Belt of Orion. The chroniclers do not refer to the chakana, or chacana, as the “andean cross,” or as reflecting a symbolical or semiotic tradition.\n\nThe twelve-cornered design itself occasionally appears in pre-contact artifacts such as textiles and ceramics from such cultures as the Wari, Ica, and Tiwanaku, but with no particular emphasis and no key or guide to a means of interpretation.\n\nSome Andeans and Andeanists regard the imposition of this modern “invented tradition\"” as cultural appropriation; the Peruvian author Tupaq Katari writes: “When I hear you foreigners, with ease and lightness talking of the Andean themes, this surprises me, since we here in Peru continually try to find details about our own history, which is very complex and you argue so lightness without a historical or experiential support of what are the Andes and its diversity.”\n\n\n\n"}

The corporate opportunity doctrine only applies if the opportunity was not disclosed to the corporation. If the opportunity was disclosed to the board of directors and the board declined to take the opportunity for the corporation, the fiduciary may take the opportunity for him- or herself. When the corporate opportunity doctrine applies, the corporation is entitled to all profits earned by the fiduciary from the transaction.

{"id": "411659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411659", "title": "Courtship", "text": "Courtship\n\nCourtship is the period of development towards an intimate relationship wherein a couple get to know each other and decide if there will be an engagement. A courtship may be an informal and private matter between two people or may be a public affair, or a formal arrangement with family approval. Traditionally, in the case of a formal engagement, it has been perceived that it is the role of a male to actively \"court\" or \"woo\" a female, thus encouraging her to understand him and her receptiveness to a proposal of marriage.\n\nThe average duration of courtship varies considerably throughout the world. Furthermore, there is vast individual variation between couples. Courtship may be completely omitted, as in cases of some arranged marriages where the couple do not meet before the wedding.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a poll of 3,000 engaged or married couples resulted in an average duration between first meeting and accepted proposal of marriage of 2 years and 11 months, with the women feeling ready to accept at an average of 2 years and 7 months. Regarding duration between proposal and wedding, the UK poll above gave an average of 2 years and 3 months.\n\nThe date is fairly casual in most European-influenced cultures, but in some traditional societies, courtship is a highly structured activity, with very specific formal rules.\n\nIn some societies, the parents or community propose potential partners and then allow limited dating to determine whether the parties are suited. In Japan, there is a such type of courtship called Omiai, with similar practices called \"Xiangqin\" (相親) in the Greater China Area. Parents will hire a matchmaker to provide pictures and résumés of potential mates, and if the couple agrees, there will be a formal meeting with the matchmaker and often parents in attendance. The matchmaker and parents will often exert pressure on the couple to decide whether they want to marry or not after a few dates.\n\nCourtship in the Philippines is one known complex form of courtship. Unlike what is regularly seen in other societies, it takes a far more subdued and indirect approach. It is complex in that it involves stages, and it is considered normal for courtship to last a year or longer. It is common to see the male showing off by sending love letters and love poems, singing romantic songs, and buying gifts for the female. The parents are also seen as part of the courtship practice, as their approval is commonly needed before courtship may begin or before the female gives the male an answer to his advances.\n\nIn more closed societies, courtship is virtually eliminated altogether by the practice of arranged marriages in which partners are chosen for young people, typically by their parents. Forbidding experimental and serial courtship and sanctioning only arranged matches is partly a means of guarding the chastity of young people and partly a matter of furthering family interests, which, in such cultures, may be considered more important than individual romantic preferences.\n\nThroughout history, courtship has often included traditions such as exchanging valentines, written correspondence (which was facilitated by the creation of the postal service in the nineteenth century), and similar communication-based courting. Over recent decades, though, the concept of arranged marriage has changed or simply been mixed with other forms of dating, including Eastern and Indian ones; potential couples have the opportunity to meet and date each other before one decides on whether or not to continue the relationship.\n\nIn the earlier 1800s, young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding a marriage partner, rather than for social reasons. In more traditional forms of Christianity, this concept of courtship has been retained, with John Piper defining courtship and distinguishing this concept from dating, stating that:\n\nChristian minister Patricia Bootsma delineates this distinction, writing that in contrast to the modern conception of dating, in \"courtship, time together in groups with family or friends is encouraged, and there is oversight by and accountability to parents or mentors\". She further states that with courtship, \"commitment happens before intimacy\".\n\nIn America, in the 1820s, the phrase \"date\" was most closely associated with prostitution. However, by the Jazz Age of the 1920s, dating for fun was becoming a cultural expectation, and by the 1930s, it was assumed that any popular young person would have lots of dates. This form of dating, though, was usually more chaste than is seen today, since premarital sex was not considered the norm.\n\nCourtship is used by a number of theorists to explain gendering processes and sexual identity. Scientific research into courtship began in the 1980s after which time academic researchers started to generate theories about modern dating practices and norms. Both Moore and Perper found that, contrary to popular beliefs, courtship is normally triggered and controlled by women, driven mainly by non-verbal behaviours to which men respond.\n\nThis is generally supported by other theorists who specialise in the study of body language. There are some feminist scholars, however, who regard courtship as a socially constructed (and male-led) process organised to subjugate women. Farrell reports, for example, that magazines about marriage and romantic fiction continue to attract a 98% female readership. Systematic research into courtship processes inside the workplace as well two 10-year studies examining norms in different international settings continue to support a view that courtship is a social process that socialises both sexes into accepting forms of relationship that maximise the chances of successfully raising children.\n\nCourtship in Australia is generally reserved to those with religious affiliation. As a standard rule, dating is widely accepted; along with inter-racial relationships, gay/lesbian relationships, pre-marital sex and abortion. A lot of the Australian values are derived from British courtship culture; therefore, marriage practices are much the same. Modern western culture has taken over, leading to more and more people committing to partnerships through dating. Before entering marriage, a lot of Australian couples like to live with each other to get an idea of what married life would be like. This would not happen in a courtship as both people vow to chastity and often like to keep a chaperone around.\n\nAs technology progressed the dating world followed. In a Time-line by Metro, a statistic match-making business opened in 1941, the first reality TV dating show was developed in 1965 and by the 1980s the public was introduced to video dating. Video Dating was a way for singles to sit in front of a camera and tell whomever may be watching something about themselves. The process of elimination was significant because now the viewer was able hear their voice, see their face and watch their body language to determine a physical attraction to the candidates.\n\nIn online dating, individuals create profiles where they disclose personal information, photographs, hobbies, interests, religion and expectations. Then the user can search through hundreds of thousands of accounts and connect with multiple people at once which in return, gives the user more options and more opportunity to find what meets their standards. Online dating has influenced the idea of choice. In \"\", Aziz Ansari states that one third of marriages in the United States between 2005-2012 met through online dating services. Today there are hundreds of sites to choose from and websites designed to fit specific needs such as Match, Eharmony, Okcupid, Zoosk, and Christianmingle. Mobile apps, such as Grindr and Tinder allow users to upload profiles that are then judged by others on the service; one can either swipe right on a profile (indicating interest) or swipe left (which presents another possible mate).\n\nMany animal species have mate-selection rituals also referred to as \"courtship\" anthropomorphically. Animal courtship may involve complicated dances or touching, vocalizations, or displays of beauty or fighting prowess. Most animal courtship occurs out of sight of humans and so it is often the least documented of animal behaviors. One animal whose courtship rituals are well studied is the bower bird whose male builds a \"bower\" of collected objects.\n\nFrom the scientific point of view, courtship in the animal kingdom is the process in which the different species select their partners for reproduction purposes. Generally speaking, the male initiates the courtship and the female chooses to either mate or reject the male based on his \"performance\".\n\nAll animals have different courtship rituals that reflect fitness, compatibility with others and ability to provide. Sea turtles court during a limited receptive time. During the courtship males will either\nnuzzle the females head to show affection or by gently biting the back of her\nneck. This may go on for long periods of time depending on if the female\nresponds to the male. If the female does respond, by not fleeing, the male will\nattach himself onto the back of the female’s shell using his front flippers. He\nwill stretch his long tail under the back of the females shell to begin\ncopulation.\n\nCourting can be competitive among males. The male\nthat has better endurance will win the female. To a female, endurance is a great\ntrait to be passed on to their offspring, the higher the endurance in the male\nthe higher the endurance will be in her offspring and the more likely they will\nbe to survive. Female Leatherback sea turtles will also choose many different\nmales to copulate with in order to diversify their offspring since it is known\nthat Leatherback sea turtles have female-biased offspring.\n\nHippopotamus are commonly misconceived as being\naggressive animals, when in actuality the mothers are very nurturing and\nsensitive. Mating and birth both occur in the water for hippopotamus. This\nbecause it gives them privacy when conceiving and it helps conserve energy\nduring birth. The female hippo normally averages around 5–6 years while males\nare average an age of 7-8. During mating season the male hippopotamus will find\na mate out of the herd, showing interest by smelling the female’s dorsal end. As\nlong as the male acts submissive during courting season the adults in the herd\nwill not interfere. Once the male finds the female he wants to mate with, he\nbegins provoking the female. He then will push the female into the water and\nmounts her. In order to alert the herd or other animals that may be lurking\naround the male will let a loud wheezing sound. Preceding birth the female\nexhibits aggressive behavior leaving the herd until after the birth of the\ncalf. Although hippopotamus can mate anytime of the year, the mating season\nranges from February to August. Because the energy cost is high, the female\ngenerally only has one offspring in a two years span.\n\nThe courtship behaviour of honey bees follows through two distinct types:\nApiary Vicinity Mating and Drone Assembly Mating respectively. Apiary vicinity\nmating usually takes place in weather that is cool and is more local to the\napiary from which the queen resides. The drones are in the same\napiary too but do not mean that it will lead to inbreeding. Drones assemble in\na bulb of warm air close or far from the apiary. They are alert when the queen\nhas flown out of the hive and will follow her route. This is followed by a sort\nof fast hum or buzz in the general bee population that follows an upward\ntemperature gradient. The male drone mounts on the virgin queen and inserts\nhis endophallus, ejaculating semen. The male honey bee will then pull away from the queen, but his endophallus will be ripped from his body and remain attached to the newly fertilized queen. The next male honey bee will remove the endophallus that was previously left by the other male honey bee and will eventually ejaculate and lose his own. The frequency of mating for the male\nhoney bees is seven to 10 times during a mating flight. Most of the drones die\nquickly immediately after mating, and their abdomen rips open since the\nendophallus has been removed. The few that survive are usually ejected from\ntheir nests, as they have served their sole purpose by mating .\n\nThey only attend one mating flight\nand queen stores up to 100 million sperm within her oviducts during this\nflight, but only five to six million are stored in the spermatheca of the\nqueen. Only a few of this sperm are used by the queen at a time to fertilize\nthe eggs throughout her life. New queen generations will mate and produce their\ncolonies if the queen runs out of sperm in her lifetime. The sex of the\noffspring is controlled by the honey bee queens as the eggs passing through the\noviduct can be determined whether they are fertilized or not by the queen. Research has indicated that eggs that are fertilized develop into female workers and queens while the unfertilized eggs become drone honey bees. Female workers can lay infertile eggs but do not mate. The infertile eggs become male honey bees. The eggs of the queen are laid in oval-shaped structural cells that usually stick to the nest ceiling. Royal jelly is then filled with these cells to prevent larvae from falling. Soon-to-be workers are fed royal jelly during the first two days. The future queens are given royal jelly throughout the entire larval period. Each member colony development depends on\ncaste. For proper growth from eggs to adult, the male honey bees need 24 days,\n21 for workers and only 16 for the queens.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17006332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17006332", "title": "Dashavatara", "text": "Dashavatara\n\nDashavatara (; , ) refers to the ten primary avatars of Vishnu, the Hindu god of preservation. Vishnu is said to descend in form of an avatar to restore cosmic order. The word \"Dashavatara\" derives from , meaning 'ten', and avatar (), roughly equivalent to 'incarnation'.\n\nThe list of included avatars varies across sects and regions, and no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard. However, most draw from the following set of figures, omitting at least one of those listed in parentheses: Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Balarama or Buddha, and Kalki. In traditions that omit Krishna, he often replaces Vishnu as the source of all avatars. Some traditions include a regional deity such as Vithoba or Jagannath in penultimate position, replacing Krishna or Buddha. All avatars have appeared except Kalki, who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga.\n\nThe list of avatars in the Dashavatara varies by region. The following table summarizes the position of avatars within the Dashavatara in many but not all traditions. A number in the table indicates the position of the corresponding avatar within the Dashavatara. Two or more numbers separated by commas indicate that the position of the corresponding avatar within the Dashavatara varies between traditions. Bracketed numbers indicate that the corresponding avatar is omitted in some traditions.\n\nThe word \"Dashavatara\" derives from , meaning 'ten' and avatar (), meaning 'incarnation'.\n\nNumber of occurrences of these avatars of lord Vishnu are one less than the total number of avatars in previous yuga.\n\nSatya Yuga - Had 4 (Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha)\n\nTreta Yuga - Had 3 (Vamana, Parshurama, Rama) \n\nDwapara Yuga- Had 2 (Krishna, Balarama)\n\nKali Yuga- Had 1, Yet to have 1 (Lord Buddha, Kalki)\n\n\n\nVarious versions of the list of Vishnu's avatars exist. Some lists mention Krishna as the eighth avatar and the Buddha as the ninth avatar, while others – such as the \"Yatindramatadipika\", a 17th-century summary of Srivaisnava doctrine – give Balarama as the eighth avatar and Krishna as the ninth. The latter version is followed by some Vaishnavas who don't accept the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu.\n\nThe Buddha was included as one of the avatars of Vishnu under Bhagavatism by the Gupta period between 330 and 550 CE. The mythologies of the Buddha in the Theravada tradition and of Vishnu in Hinduism share a number of structural and substantial similarities. For example, states Indologist John Holt, the Theravada cosmogony and cosmology states the Buddha covered 6,800,000 yojanas in three strides, including earth to heaven and then placed his right foot over Yugandhara – a legend that parallels that of the Vamana avatar in Hinduism. Similarly, the Buddha is claimed in the Theravada mythology to have been born when the \"dhamma\" is in decline, so as to preserve and uphold the \"dhamma\". These similarities may have contributed to the assimilation of the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu.\n\nThe adoption of Buddha as an avatar in Bhagavatism was a catalyzing factor in Buddhism's assimilation into Vaishnavism's mythic hierarchy. By the 8th century CE, the Buddha was included as an avatar of Vishnu in several Puranas. This assimilation is indicative of the Hindu ambivalence toward the Buddha and Buddhism. Conversely, Vishnu has also been assimilated into Sinhalese Buddhist culture, and Mahayana Buddhism is sometimes called \"Buddha-Bhagavatism\". By this period, the concept of Dashavatara was fully developed.\n\nIn Maharashtra and Goa, Vithoba's image replaces Buddha as the ninth avatar of Vishnu in some temple sculptures and Hindu astrological almanacs. In certain Oriya literary creations from Orissa, Jagannath has been treated as the Ninth avatar, by substituting Buddha.\n\nJayadeva, in his \"Pralaya Payodhi Jale\" from the \"Gita Govinda\", includes Balarama and Buddha where Krishna is equated with Vishnu and the source of all avatars.\n\nIn traditions that emphasize the \"Bhagavata Purana\", Krishna is the original \"Supreme Personality of Godhead\", from whom everything else emanates. Gaudiya Vaishnavas worship Krishna as Svayam Bhagavan, or source of the incarnations. The Vallabha Sampradaya and Nimbarka Sampradaya, (philosophical schools) go even further, worshiping Krishna not only as the source of other incarnations, but also Vishnu himself, related to descriptions in the \"Bhagavata Purana\". Mahanubhavas also known as the Jai Kishani Panth, considers Lord Krishna as the supreme God and don't consider the list of Dashavatara while consider another list of Panchavatara (5 Avatars). \n\nThirty-nine avatars are mentioned in the Pañcaratra including the likes of Garuda. However, despite these lists, the commonly accepted number of ten avatars for Vishnu was fixed well before the 10th century CE.\n\nSome modern interpreters sequence Vishnu's ten main avatars in a definitive order, from simple life-forms to more complex, and see the Dashavataras as a reflection, or a foreshadowing, of the modern theory of evolution. Such an interpretation was first propounded by Theosophist Helena Blavatsky in her 1877 opus \"Isis Unveiled\", in which she proposed the following ordering of the Dashavataras:\n\nBlavatsky believed that the avatara-related Hindu texts were an allegorical presentation of Darwinian evolution. Some Orientalists and reformist Hindus in India picked up this idea to rationalize Hinduism as being consistent with modern science. Keshub Chandra Sen stated in 1882,\n\nSimilarly Aurobindo regarded \"Avataric Evolutionism\" as a \"parable of evolution\", one which does not endorse evolutionism, but hints at \"transformative phases of spiritual progress\". According to Nanda, the Dashavatara concept has led to some Hindus asserting that their religion is more open to scientific theories, and has not opposed or persecuted scientists midst them like the way Christianity and Islam has. But, adds Nanda, Hinduism has many cosmological theories and even the Vaishnava one with Dashavatara concept does not explicitly teach evolution of species, rather it states an endless cycles of creationism.\n\nThe Dashavatara concept appealed to other scholars. Monier Monier-Williams wrote \"Indeed, the Hindus were ... Darwinians centuries before the birth of Darwin, and evolutionists centuries before the doctrine of evolution had been accepted by the Huxleys of our time, and before any word like evolution existed in any language of the world.\" J. B. S. Haldane suggested that Dashavatara gave a \"rough idea\" of vertebrate evolution: a fish, a tortoise, a boar, a man-lion, a dwarf and then four men (Kalki is not yet born). Nabinchandra Sen explains the Dashavatara with Darwin's evolution in his \"Raivatak\". C. D. Deshmukh also remarked on the \"striking\" similarity between Darwin's theory and the Dashavatara.\n\nSome Vaishnava Hindus reject this \"Avataric Evolutionism\" concept. For example, ISKCON's Prakashanand states that this apologeticism degrades the divine status of Rama and Krishna, unduly sequences Rama as inferior to Krishna, both to the Buddha. Rama and Krishna are supremely divine, each right and perfect for the circumstances they appeared in, states Prakashanand.\n\n\n"}

The method can be used on-the-fly in role-based security within an institution, and in batch mode for exporting data from an institution.\nOrganizations release and receive medical data with all explicit identifiers -- such as name -- removed, in the erroneous belief that patient confidentiality is maintained because the resulting data look anonymous.

{"id": "10828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10828", "title": "Fear", "text": "Fear\n\nFear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that occurs in certain types of organisms, which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a specific stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis. \nIn humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning. Thus fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a phobia.\n\nPsychologists such as John B. Watson, Robert Plutchik, and Paul Ekman have suggested that there is only a small set of basic or innate emotions and that fear is one of them. This hypothesized set includes such emotions as acute stress reaction, anger, angst, anxiety, fright, horror, joy, panic, and sadness. Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion anxiety, which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable. The fear response serves survival by generating appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution. Sociological and organizational research also suggests that individuals’ fears are not solely dependent on their nature but are also shaped by their social relations and culture, which guide their understanding of when and how much fear to feel. \n\nFear is a primeval emotion that humans have known since they were very young. Even as a child, humans typically have not experienced real fear at this age, but a child develops a fear of the monster in their closet.\n\nMany physiological changes in the body are associated with fear, summarized as the fight-or-flight response. An inborn response for coping with danger, it works by accelerating the breathing rate (hyperventilation), heart rate, vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels leading to blushing and sanskadania of the central vessels (pooling), increasing muscle tension including the muscles attached to each hair follicle to contract and causing \"goose bumps\", or more clinically, piloerection (making a cold person warmer or a frightened animal look more impressive), sweating, increased blood glucose (hyperglycemia), increased serum calcium, increase in white blood cells called neutrophilic leukocytes, alertness leading to sleep disturbance and \"butterflies in the stomach\" (dyspepsia). This primitive mechanism may help an organism survive by either running away or fighting the danger. With the series of physiological changes, the consciousness realizes an emotion of fear.\n\nPeople develop specific fears as a result of learning. This has been studied in psychology as fear conditioning, beginning with John B. Watson's Little Albert experiment in 1920, which was inspired after observing a child with an irrational fear of dogs. In this study, an 11-month-old boy was conditioned to fear a white rat in the laboratory. The fear became generalized to include other white, furry objects, such as a rabbit, dog, and even a ball of cotton.\n\nFear can be learned by experiencing or watching a frightening traumatic accident. For example, if a child falls into a well and struggles to get out, he or she may develop a fear of wells, heights (acrophobia), enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), or water (aquaphobia). There are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear. When looking at these areas (such as the amygdala), it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma, or if they have observed the fear in others. In a study completed by Andreas Olsson, Katherine I. Nearing and Elizabeth A. Phelps, the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear-provoking situation. This suggests that fear can develop in both conditions, not just simply from personal history.\n\nFear is affected by cultural and historical context. For example, in the early 20th century, many Americans feared polio, a disease that can lead to paralysis. There are consistent cross-cultural differences in how people respond to fear. Display rules affect how likely people are to show the facial expression of fear and other emotions.\n\nAlthough many fears are learned, the capacity to fear is part of human nature. Many studies have found that certain fears (e.g. animals, heights) are much more common than others (e.g. flowers, clouds). These fears are also easier to induce in the laboratory. This phenomenon is known as preparedness. Because early humans that were quick to fear dangerous situations were more likely to survive and reproduce, preparedness is theorized to be a genetic effect that is the result of natural selection.\n\nFrom an evolutionary psychology perspective, different fears may be different adaptations that have been useful in our evolutionary past. They may have developed during different time periods. Some fears, such as fear of heights, may be common to all mammals and developed during the mesozoic period. Other fears, such as fear of snakes, may be common to all simians and developed during the cenozoic time period. Still others, such as fear of mice and insects, may be unique to humans and developed during the paleolithic and neolithic time periods (when mice and insects become important carriers of infectious diseases and harmful for crops and stored foods).\n\nFear is high only if the observed risk and seriousness both are high, and it is low if risk or seriousness is low.\n\nIn a 2005 Gallup Poll (U.S.), a national sample of adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 were asked what they feared the most. The question was open-ended and participants were able to say whatever they wanted. The top ten fears were, in order: terrorist attacks, spiders, death, failure, war, criminal or gang violence, being alone, the future, and nuclear war.\n\nIn an estimate of what people fear the most, book author Bill Tancer analyzed the most frequent online queries that involved the phrase, \"fear of...\" following the assumption that people tend to seek information on the issues that concern them the most. His top ten list of fears published 2008 consisted of flying, heights, clowns, intimacy, death, rejection, people, snakes, failure, and driving.\n\nAccording to surveys, some of the most common fears are of demons and ghosts, the existence of evil powers, cockroaches, spiders, snakes, heights, Trypophobia, water, enclosed spaces, tunnels, bridges, needles, social rejection, failure, examinations, and public speaking.\n\nDeath anxiety is multidimensional; it covers \"fears related to one's own death, the death of others, fear of the unknown after death, fear of obliteration, and fear of the dying process, which includes fear of a slow death and a painful death\". Death anxiety is one's uncertainty to dying. However, there is a more severe form of having a fear of death, which is known as Thanatophobia, which is anxiety over death that becomes debilitating or keeps a person from living their life.\n\nThe Yale philosopher Shelly Kagan examined fear of death in a 2007 Yale open course by examining the following questions: Is fear of death a reasonable appropriate response? What conditions are required and what are appropriate conditions for feeling fear of death? What is meant by fear, and how much fear is appropriate? According to Kagan for fear in general to make sense, three conditions should be met:\nThe amount of fear should be appropriate to the size of \"the bad\". If the three conditions are not met, fear is an inappropriate emotion. He argues, that death does not meet the first two criteria, even if death is a \"deprivation of good things\" and even if one believes in a painful afterlife. Because death is certain, it also does not meet the third criterion, but he grants that the unpredictability of when one dies \"may\" be cause to a sense of fear.\n\nIn a 2003 study of 167 women and 121 men, aged 65–87, low self-efficacy predicted fear of the unknown after death and fear of dying for women and men better than demographics, social support, and physical health. Fear of death was measured by a \"Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale\" which included the 8 subscales Fear of Dying, Fear of the Dead, Fear of Being Destroyed, Fear for Significant Others, Fear of the Unknown, Fear of Conscious Death, Fear for the Body After Death, and Fear of Premature Death. In hierarchical multiple regression analysis the most potent predictors of death fears were low \"spiritual health efficacy\", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner strength, and low \"instrumental efficacy\", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage activities of daily living.\n\nPsychologists have tested the hypotheses that fear of death motivates religious commitment, and that assurances about an afterlife alleviate the fear; however, empirical research on this topic has been equivocal. Religiosity can be related to fear of death when the afterlife is portrayed as time of punishment. \"Intrinsic religiosity\", as opposed to mere \"formal religious involvement\", has been found to be negatively correlated with death anxiety. In a 1976 study of people of various Christian denominations, those who were most firm in their faith, who attended religious services weekly, were the least afraid of dying. The survey found a negative correlation between fear of death and \"religious concern\".\n\nIn a 2006 study of white, Christian men and women the hypothesis was tested that traditional, church-centered religiousness and de-institutionalized spiritual seeking are ways of approaching fear of death in old age. Both religiousness and spirituality were related to positive psychosocial functioning, but only church-centered religiousness protected subjects against the fear of death.\n\nFear of the unknown or irrational fear is caused by negative thinking (worry) which arises from anxiety accompanied with a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear shares a common neural pathway with other fears, a pathway that engages the nervous system to mobilize bodily resources in the face of danger or threat. Many people are scared of the \"unknown\". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. In these cases specialists use False Evidence Appearing Real as a definition, alternatively therapists use it as acronym for Feeling frightened, Expecting bad things to happen, Actions and attitudes that can help, and Rewards and results in Rx programs like Coping Cat. Such fear can create comorbidity with the anxiety disorder umbrella. Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. For example, \"continuation of scholarly education\" is perceived by many educators as a risk that may cause them fear and stress, and they would rather teach things they've been taught than go and do research. That can lead to habits such as laziness and procrastination. The ambiguity of situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety in addition to other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly, for example, in war-ridden places or in places of conflict, terrorism, abuse, etc. Poor parenting that instills fear can also debilitate a child's psyche development or personality. For example, parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment in which it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers isn't something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent's presence if required. Developing a sense of equanimity to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and as an essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.\n\nOften laboratory studies with rats are conducted to examine the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses. In 2004, researchers conditioned rats (\"Rattus norvegicus\") to fear a certain stimulus, through electric shock. The researchers were able to then cause an extinction of this conditioned fear, to a point that no medications or drugs were able to further aid in the extinction process. However the rats did show signs of avoidance learning, not fear, but simply avoiding the area that brought pain to the test rats. The avoidance learning of rats is seen as a conditioned response, and therefore the behavior can be unconditioned, as supported by the earlier research.\n\nSpecies-specific defense reactions (SSDRs) or avoidance learning in nature is the specific tendency to avoid certain threats or stimuli, it is how animals survive in the wild. Humans and animals both share these species-specific defense reactions, such as the flight-or-fight, which also include pseudo-aggression, fake or intimidating aggression and freeze response to threats, which is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. These SSDRs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species, other species, and interaction with the environment. These acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten. The animal that survives is the animal that already knows what to fear and how to avoid this threat. An example in humans is the reaction to the sight of a snake, many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they are jumping away from, and in some cases it is a stick rather than a snake.\n\nAs with many functions of the brain, there are various regions of the brain involved in deciphering fear in humans and other nonhuman species. The amygdala communicates both directions between the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, the sensory cortex, the hippocampus, thalamus, septum, and the brainstem. The amygdala plays an important role in SSDR, such as the ventral amygdalofugal, which is essential for associative learning, and SSDRs are learned through interaction with the environment and others of the same species. An emotional response is created only after the signals have been relayed between the different regions of the brain, and activating the sympathetic nervous systems; which controls the flight, fight, freeze, fright, and faint response. Often a damaged amygdala can cause impairment in the recognition of fear (like the human case of patient S.M.). This impairment can cause different species to lack the sensation of fear, and often can become overly confident, confronting larger peers, or walking up to predatory creatures.\n\nRobert C. Bolles (1970), a researcher at University of Washington, wanted to understand species-specific defense reactions and avoidance learning among animals, but found that the theories of avoidance learning and the tools that were used to measure this tendency were out of touch with the natural world. He theorized the species-specific defense reaction (SSDR). There are three forms of SSDRs: flight, fight (pseudo-aggression), or freeze. Even domesticated animals have SSDRs, and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to atavistic standards and become \"wild\" again. Dr. Bolles states that responses are often dependent on the reinforcement of a safety signal, and not the aversive conditioned stimuli. This safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change. Intrinsic feedback or information coming from within, muscle twitches, increased heart rate, are seen to be more important in SSDRs than extrinsic feedback, stimuli that comes from the external environment. Dr. Bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears, to help assure survival of the species. Rats will run away from any shocking event, and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened. The wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered species-specific defense reactions or behaviors. Bolles believed that SSDRs are conditioned through Pavlovian conditioning, and not operant conditioning; SSDRs arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events. Michael S. Fanselow conducted an experiment, to test some specific defense reactions, he observed that rats in two different shock situations responded differently, based on instinct or defensive topography, rather than contextual information.\n\nSpecies-specific defense responses are created out of fear, and are essential for survival. Rats that lack the gene stathmin show no avoidance learning, or a lack of fear, and will often walk directly up to cats and be eaten. Animals use these SSDRs to continue living, to help increase their chance of fitness, by surviving long enough to procreate. Humans and animals alike have created fear to know what should be avoided, and this fear can be learned through association with others in the community, or learned through personal experience with a creature, species, or situations that should be avoided. SSDRs are an evolutionary adaptation that has been seen in many species throughout the world including rats, chimpanzees, prairie dogs, and even humans, an adaptation created to help individual creatures survive in a hostile world.\n\nFear learning changes across the lifetime due to natural developmental changes in the brain. This includes changes in the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala.\n\n\nThe brain structures that are the center of most neurobiological events associated with fear are the two amygdalae, located behind the pituitary gland. Each amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning. They are essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, the amygdalae generate the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression. Once a response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences, the amygdalae may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness, in which they are ready to move, run, fight, etc. This defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the fight-or-flight response regulated by the hypothalamus, part of the limbic system. Once the person is in safe mode, meaning that there are no longer any potential threats surrounding them, the amygdalae will send this information to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) where it is stored for similar future situations, which is known as memory consolidation.\nSome of the hormones involved during the state of fight-or-flight include epinephrine, which regulates heart rate and metabolism as well as dilating blood vessels and air passages, norepinephrine increasing heart rate, blood flow to skeletal muscles and the release of glucose from energy stores, and cortisol which increases blood sugar, increases circulating neutrophilic leukocytes, calcium amongst other things.\n\nAfter a situation which incites fear occurs, the amygdalae and hippocampus record the event through synaptic plasticity. The stimulation to the hippocampus will cause the individual to remember many details surrounding the situation. Plasticity and memory formation in the amygdala are generated by activation of the neurons in the region. Experimental data supports the notion that synaptic plasticity of the neurons leading to the lateral amygdalae occurs with fear conditioning. In some cases, this forms permanent fear responses such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a phobia. MRI and fMRI scans have shown that the amygdalae in individuals diagnosed with such disorders including bipolar or panic disorder are larger and wired for a higher level of fear.\n\nPathogens can suppress amygdala activity. Rats infected with the toxoplasmosis parasite become less fearful of cats, sometimes even seeking out their urine-marked areas. This behavior often leads to them being eaten by cats. The parasite then reproduces within the body of the cat. There is evidence that the parasite concentrates itself in the amygdala of infected rats. In a separate experiment, rats with lesions in the amygdala did not express fear or anxiety towards unwanted stimuli. These rats pulled on levers supplying food that sometimes sent out electrical shocks. While they learned to avoid pressing on them, they did not distance themselves from these shock-inducing levers.\n\nSeveral brain structures other than the amygdalae have also been observed to be activated when individuals are presented with fearful vs. neutral faces, namely the occipitocerebellar regions including the fusiform gyrus and the inferior parietal / superior temporal gyri. Fearful eyes, brows and mouth seem to separately reproduce these brain responses. Scientists from Zurich studies show that the hormone oxytocin related to stress and sex reduces activity in your brain fear center.\n\nIn threatening situations insects, aquatic organisms, birds, reptiles, and mammals emit odorant substances, initially called alarm substances, which are chemical signals now called alarm pheromones (\"Schreckstoff\" in German). This is to defend themselves and at the same time to inform members of the same species of danger and leads to observable behavior change like freezing, defensive behavior, or dispersion depending on circumstances and species. For example, stressed rats release odorant cues that cause other rats to move away from the source of the signal.\n\nAfter the discovery of pheromones in 1959, alarm pheromones were first described in 1968 in ants and earthworms, and four years later also found in mammals, both mice and rats. Over the next two decades identification and characterization of these pheromones proceeded in all manner of insects and sea animals, including fish, but it was not until 1990 that more insight into mammalian alarm pheromones was gleaned.\n\nEarlier, in 1985, a link between odors released by stressed rats and pain perception was discovered: unstressed rats exposed to these odors developed opioid-mediated analgesia. In 1997, researchers found that bees became less responsive to pain after they had been stimulated with isoamyl acetate, a chemical smelling of banana, and a component of bee alarm pheromone. The experiment also showed that the bees' fear-induced pain tolerance was mediated by an endorphine.\n\nBy using the forced swimming test in rats as a model of fear-induction, the first mammalian \"alarm substance\" was found. In 1991, this \"alarm substance\" was shown to fulfill criteria for pheromones: well-defined behavioral effect, species specificity, minimal influence of experience and control for nonspecific arousal. Rat activity testing with the alarm pheromone, and their preference/avoidance for odors from cylinders containing the pheromone, showed that the pheromone had very low volatility.\n\nIn 1993 a connection between alarm chemosignals in mice and their immune response was found. Pheromone production in mice was found to be associated with or mediated by the pituitary gland in 1994.\n\nIn 2004, it was demonstrated that rats' alarm pheromones had different effects on the \"recipient\" rat (the rat perceiving the pheromone) depending which body region they were released from: Pheromone production from the face modified behavior in the recipient rat, e.g. caused sniffing or movement, whereas pheromone secreted from the rat's anal area induced autonomic nervous system stress responses, like an increase in core body temperature. Further experiments showed that when a rat perceived alarm pheromones, it increased its defensive and risk assessment behavior, and its acoustic startle reflex was enhanced.\n\nIt was not until 2011 that a link between severe pain, neuroinflammation and alarm pheromones release in rats was found: real time RT-PCR analysis of rat brain tissues indicated that shocking the footpad of a rat increased its production of proinflammatory cytokines in deep brain structures, namely of IL-1β, heteronuclear Corticotropin-releasing hormone and c-fos mRNA expressions in both the paraventricular nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and it increased stress hormone levels in plasma (corticosterone).\n\nThe neurocircuit for how rats perceive alarm pheromones was shown to be related to the hypothalamus, brainstem, and amygdalae, all of which are evolutionary ancient structures deep inside or in the case of the brainstem underneath the brain away from the cortex, and involved in the fight-or-flight response, as is the case in humans.\n\nAlarm pheromone-induced anxiety in rats has been used to evaluate the degree to which anxiolytics can alleviate anxiety in humans. For this the change in the acoustic startle reflex of rats with alarm pheromone-induced anxiety (i.e. reduction of defensiveness) has been measured. Pretreatment of rats with one of five anxiolytics used in clinical medicine was able to reduce their anxiety: namely midazolam, phenelzine (a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor), propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker, clonidine, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist or CP-154,526, a corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonist.\n\nFaulty development of odor discrimination impairs the perception of pheromones and pheromone-related behavior, like aggressive behavior and mating in male rats: The enzyme Mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7) has been implicated in regulating the development of the olfactory bulb and odor discrimination and it is highly expressed in developing rat brains, but absent in most regions of adult rat brains. Conditional deletion of the MAPK7gene in mouse neural stem cells impairs several pheromone-mediated behaviors, including aggression and mating in male mice. These behavior impairments were not caused by a reduction in the level of testosterone, by physical immobility, by heightened fear or anxiety or by depression. Using mouse urine as a natural pheromone-containing solution, it has been shown that the impairment was associated with defective detection of related pheromones, and with changes in their inborn preference for pheromones related to sexual and reproductive activities.\n\nLastly, alleviation of an acute fear response because a friendly peer (or in biological language: an affiliative conspecific) tends and befriends is called \"social buffering\". The term is in analogy to the 1985 \"buffering\" hypothesis in psychology, where social support has been proven to mitigate the negative health effects of alarm pheromone mediated distress. The role of a \"social pheromone\" is suggested by the recent discovery that olfactory signals are responsible in mediating the \"social buffering\" in male rats. \"Social buffering\" was also observed to mitigate the conditioned fear responses of honeybees. A bee colony exposed to an environment of high threat of predation did not show increased aggression and aggressive-like gene expression patterns in individual bees, but decreased aggression. That the bees did not simply habituate to threats is suggested by the fact that the disturbed colonies also decreased their foraging.\n\nBiologists have proposed in 2012 that fear pheromones evolved as molecules of \"keystone significance\", a term coined in analogy to keystone species. Pheromones may determine species compositions and affect rates of energy and material exchange in an ecological community. Thus pheromones generate structure in a food web and play critical roles in maintaining natural systems.\n\nEvidence of chemosensory alarm signals in humans has emerged slowly: Although alarm pheromones have not been physically isolated and their chemical structures have not been identified in humans so far, there is evidence for their presence. Androstadienone, for example, a steroidal, endogenous odorant, is a pheromone candidate found in human sweat, axillary hair and plasma. The closely related compound androstenone is involved in communicating dominance, aggression or competition; sex hormone influences on androstenone perception in humans showed a high testosterone level related to heightened androstenone sensitivity in men, a high testosterone level related to unhappiness in response to androstenone in men, and a high estradiol level related to disliking of androstenone in women.\n\nA German study from 2006 showed when anxiety-induced versus exercise-induced human sweat from a dozen people was pooled and offered to seven study participants, of five able to olfactorily distinguish exercise-induced sweat from room air, three could also distinguish exercise-induced sweat from anxiety induced sweat. The acoustic startle reflex response to a sound when sensing anxiety sweat was larger than when sensing exercise-induced sweat, as measured by electromyograph analysis of the orbital muscle, which is responsible for the eyeblink component. This showed for the first time that fear chemosignals can modulate the startle reflex in humans without emotional mediation; fear chemosignals primed the recipient's \"defensive behavior\" prior to the subjects' conscious attention on the acoustic startle reflex level.\n\nIn analogy to the social buffering of rats and honeybees in response to chemosignals, induction of empathy by \"smelling anxiety\" of another person has been found in humans.\n\nA study from 2013 provided brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender-specific. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced sweat from donors extracted it, pooled it and presented it to 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain MRI. While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced a markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since no significant differences were found in the olfactory bulb, the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.\n\nAn approach-avoidance task was set up where volunteers seeing either an angry or a happy cartoon face on a computer screen pushed away or pulled toward them a joystick as fast as possible. Volunteers smelling anandrostadienone, masked with clove oil scent responded faster, especially to angry faces, than those smelling clove oil only, which was interpreted as anandrostadienone-related activation of the fear system. A potential mechanism of action is, that androstadienone alters the \"emotional face processing\". Androstadienone is known to influence activity of the fusiform gyrus which is relevant for face recognition.\n\nA drug treatment for fear conditioning and phobias via the amygdalae is the use of glucocorticoids. In one study, glucocorticoid receptors in the central nuclei of the amygdalae were disrupted in order to better understand the mechanisms of fear and fear conditioning. The glucocorticoid receptors were inhibited using lentiviral vectors containing Cre-recombinase injected into mice. Results showed that disruption of the glucocorticoid receptors prevented conditioned fear behavior. The mice were subjected to auditory cues which caused them to freeze normally. However, a reduction of freezing was observed in the mice that had inhibited glucocorticoid receptors.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy has been successful in helping people overcome their fear. Because fear is more complex than just forgetting or deleting memories, an active and successful approach involves people repeatedly confronting their fears. By confronting their fears in a safe manner a person can suppress the \"fear-triggering memories\" or stimuli.\n\nExposure therapy has known to have helped up to 90% of people with specific phobias to significantly decrease their fear over time. \n\nAnother psychological treatment is systematic desensitization, which is a type of behavior therapy used to completely remove the fear or produce a disgusted response to this fear and replace it. The replacement that occurs will be relaxation and will occur through conditioning. Through conditioning treatments, muscle tensioning will lessen and deep breathing techniques will aid in de-tensioning. \n\nOther methods for treating or coping with one's fear was suggested by life coach Robin Sharma. A person could keep a journal in which they write down rational thoughts regarding their fears. Journal entries are a healthy method of expressing one's fears without compromising their safety or causing uncertainty. Another suggestion is a fear ladder. To create a fear ladder, one must write down all of their fears and score them on a scale of one to ten. Next, the person addresses their phobia, starting with the lowest number. \n\nFinding solace in religion is another method to cope with one's fear. Having something to answer your questions regarding your fears, such as, what happens after death or if there is an afterlife, can help mitigate one's fear of death because there is no room for uncertainty as their questions are answered. Religion offers a method of being able to understand and make sense of one's fears rather than ignore them. \n\nThe fear of the end of life and its existence is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized the lives of our ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing at the same time that social formation was changing. One can say that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.\n\nWhen people are faced with their own thoughts of death, they either accept that they are dying or will die because they have lived a full life or they will experience fear. A theory was developed in response to this, which is called the Terror Management Theory. The theory states that a person's cultural worldviews (religion, values, etc.) will mitigate the terror associated with the fear of death through avoidance. To help manage their terror, they find solace in their death-denying beliefs, such as their religion. Another way people cope with their death related fears is pushing any thoughts of death into the future or by avoiding these thoughts all together through distractions. Although there are methods for one coping with the terror associated with their fear of death, not everyone suffers from these same uncertainties. People who have lived a full life, typically do not fear death because they believe that they have lived their life to the fullest.\n\nReligions are filled with different fears that humans have had throughout many centuries. The fears aren't just metaphysical (including the problems of life and death) but are also moral. Death is seen as a boundary to another world. That world would always be different depending on how each individual lived their lives. The origins of this intangible fear are not found in the present world. In a sense we can assume that fear was a big influence on things such as morality. This assumption, however, flies in the face of concepts such as moral absolutism and moral universalism – which would hold that our morals are rooted in either the divine or natural laws of the universe, and would not be generated by any human feeling, thought or emotion. \n\nFrom a theological perspective, the word \"fear\" encompasses more than simple fear. Robert B. Strimple says that fear includes the \". . . convergence of awe, reverence, adoration. . .\". Some translations of the Bible, such as the New International Version, sometimes replace the word \"fear\" with \"reverence\".\n\nFear in religion can be seen throughout the years, however, the most prominent example would be The Crusades. Pope Urban II allowed for Christian mercenary troops to be sent on a mission in order to recover the Holy Lands from the Muslims. However, the message was misinterpreted and as a result, innocent people were slaughtered. Although the Crusades were meant to stay between the Muslims and the Christians, the hate spread onto the Jewish culture. Jewish people who feared for their lives, gave into the forced conversion of Christianity because they believed this would secure their safety. Other Jewish people feared betraying their God by conceding to a conversion, and instead, secured their own fate, which was death. It can also be argued that Christians feared their religion not being the primary religion, and this is why they committed mass murder.\n\nFear may be politically and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which would otherwise be widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be widely supported. In contexts of disasters, nation-states manage the fear not only to provide their citizens with an explanation about the event or blaming some minorities, but also to adjust their previous beliefs. \n\nFear can alter how a person thinks or reacts to situations because fear has the power to inhibit one's rational way of thinking. As a result, people who do not experience fear, are able to use fear as a tool to manipulate others. People who are experiencing fear, seek preservation through safety and can be manipulated by a person who is there to provide that safety that is being sought after. \"When we're afraid, a manipulator can talk us out of the truth we see right in front of us. Words become more real than reality\" By this, a manipulator is able to use our fear to manipulate us out the truth and instead make us believe and trust in their truth. Politicians are notorious for using fear to manipulate the people into supporting their will. Through keywords and key phrases such as, \"it is for your safety,\" or \"it is for the safety of this country,\" politicians invoke fear within people that their safety is at stake, and people will ultimately follow in line in order for their safety to be restored. \n\nFear is found and reflected in mythology and folklore as well as in works of fiction such as novels and films.\n\nWorks of dystopian and (post)apocalyptic fiction convey the fears and anxieties of societies.\n\nThe fear of the world's end is about as old as civilization itself. In a 1967 study Frank Kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Scientific and critical thought supplanting religious and mythical thought as well as a public emancipation may be the cause of eschatology becoming replaced by more realistic scenarios. Such might constructively provoke discussion and steps to be taken to prevent depicted catastrophes.\n\n\"The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was\" is a German fairy tale dealing with the topic of not knowing fear.\nMany stories also include characters who fear the antagonist of the plot. One important characteristic of historical and mythical heroes across cultures is to be fearless in the face of big and often lethal enemies.\n\nIn the world of athletics fear is often used as a means of motivation to not fail. This situation involves using fear in a way that increases the chances of a positive outcome. In this case the fear that is being created is initially a cognitive state to the receiver. This initial state is what generates the first response of the athlete, this response generates a possibility of fight or flight reaction by the athlete (receiver), which in turn will increase or decrease the possibility of success or failure in the certain situation for the athlete. The amount of time that the athlete has to determine this decision is small but it is still enough time for the receiver to make a determination through cognition. Even though the decision is made quickly, the decision is determined through past events that have been experienced by the athlete. The results of these past events will determine how the athlete will make his cognitive decision in the spilt second that he or she has.\n\nFear of failure as described above has been studied frequently in the field of sport psychology. Many scholars have tried to determine how often fear of failure is triggered within athletes. As well as what personalities of athletes most often choose to use this type of motivation. Studies have also been conducted to determine the success rate of this method of motivation.\n\nMurray's Exploration in Personal (1938) was one of the first studies that actually identified fear of failure as an actual motive to avoid failure or to achieve success. His studies suggested that inavoidance, the need to avoid failure, was found in many college-aged men during the time of his research in 1938. This was a monumental finding in the field of psychology because it allowed other researchers to better clarify how fear of failure can actually be a determinant of creating achievement goals as well as how it could be used in the actual act of achievement.\n\nIn the context of sport, a model was created by R.S. Lazarus in 1991 that uses the cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion.\nAnother study was done in 2001 by Conroy, Poczwardowski, and Henschen that created five aversive consequences of failing that have been repeated over time. The five categories include (a) experiencing shame and embarrassment, (b) devaluing one's self-estimate, (c) having an uncertain future, (d) important others losing interest, (e) upsetting important others. These five categories can help one infer the possibility of an individual to associate failure with one of these threat categories, which will lead them to experiencing fear of failure.\n\nIn summary, the two studies that were done above created a more precise definition of fear of failure, which is \"a dispositional tendency to experience apprehension and anxiety in evaluative situations because individuals have learned that failure is associated with aversive consequences\".\n\nPeople who have damage to their amygdalae, which can be caused by a rare genetic disease known as Urbach–Wiethe disease, are unable to experience fear. The disease destroys both amygdalae in late childhood. Since the discovery of the disease, there have only been 400 recorded cases. This is not debilitating; however, a lack of fear can allow someone to get into a dangerous situation they otherwise would have avoided. For example, people who possess a lack of fear would approach a known venomous snake while those who possess fear, would typically try to avoid it. Fear is an important aspect of a human being's development.\n\nAnother possibility of a lack of fear could be Antisocial Personality Disorder or more commonly known as sociopathy, which is a mental health condition where people often manipulate others. People who suffer from this disorder lack a physiological response and are capable of lying or not experiencing fear. When a person is approached by something they fear or has a phobia, the body will react in a way that conveys this fear. For example, a person who possesses Arachnophobia, or a fear of spiders, would experience a physical response such as, nausea, dizziness, or even shaking when approached by a spider. However, a person with Antisocial Personality Disorder lacks this capability and would not activate their \"fight or flight\" response to such fear. They also disregard the safety of others and will often put them at harm or in the way of harm. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "41499924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41499924", "title": "Geometric mechanics", "text": "Geometric mechanics\n\nGeometric mechanics is a branch of mathematics applying particular geometric methods to many areas of mechanics, from mechanics of particles and rigid bodies to fluid mechanics to control theory.\n\nGeometric mechanics applies principally to systems for which the configuration space is a Lie group, or a group of diffeomorphisms, or more generally where some aspect of the configuration space has this group structure. For example, the configuration space of a rigid body such as a satellite is the group of Euclidean motions (translations and rotations in space), while the configuration space for a liquid crystal is the group of diffeomorphisms coupled with an internal state (gauge symmetry or order parameter).\n\nOne of the principal ideas of geometric mechanics is \"reduction\", which goes back to Jacobi's elimination of the node in the 3-body problem, but in its modern form is due to K. Meyer (1973) and independently J.E. Marsden and A. Weinstein (1974), both inspired by the work of Smale (1970). Symmetry of a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian system gives rise to conserved quantities, by Noether's theorem, and these conserved quantities are the components of the momentum map J. If \"P\" is the phase space and \"G\" the symmetry group, the momentum map is a map formula_1, and the reduced spaces are quotients of the level sets of J by the subgroup of \"G\" preserving the level set in question: for formula_2 one defines formula_3, and this reduced space is a symplectic manifold if formula_4 is a regular value of \"J\".\n\n\nOne of the important developments arising from the geometric approach to mechanics is the incorporation of the geometry into numerical methods.\nIn particular symplectic and variational integrators are proving particularly accurate for long-term integration of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems.\n\nAs a modern subject, geometric mechanics has its roots in four works written in the 1960s. These were by Vladimir Arnold (1966), Stephen Smale (1970) and Jean-Marie Souriau (1970), and the first edition of Abraham and Marsden's \"Foundation of Mechanics\" (1967). Arnold's fundamental work showed that Euler's equations for the free rigid body are the equations for geodesic flow on the rotation group SO(3) and carried this geometric insight over to the dynamics of ideal fluids, where the rotation group is replaced by the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. Smale's paper on Topology and Mechanics investigates the conserved quantities arising from Noether's theorem when a Lie group of symmetries acts on a mechanical system, and defines what is now called the momentum map (which Smale calls angular momentum), and he raises questions about the topology of the energy-momentum level surfaces and the effect on the dynamics. In his book, Souriau also considers the conserved quantities arising from the action of a group of symmetries, but he concentrates more on the geometric structures involved (for example the equivariance properties of this momentum for a wide class of symmetries), and less on questions of dynamics.\n\nThese ideas, and particularly those of Smale were central in the second edition of \"Foundations of Mechanics\" (Abraham and Marsden, 1978).\n\n"}

Causal events are related as the subsequent event(s) are understood to be a consequence of the prior event(s).\nMeaning represents the purpose or significance of something.\n\nFour categories are causality, coincidence, serendipity, and synchronicity.\n\nCausality represents causal events grouped without meaning. These are common events.\n\nCoincidence represents acausal events grouped without meaning. These are less common events.\n\nSerendipity represents causal events grouped by meaning. These are rare events.\n\nSynchronicity represents acausal events grouped by meaning. These events are unlikely to occur by chance and may represent an outlier effect.\n\nA causality example is to strike a cue ball with a pool stick to make it move. The result is expected and has no meaning.\n\nA coincidence example is two friends from the same town finding each other at the same time in the town's library without any planning. The result is unexpected, yet has no meaning (significance).\n\nA serendipity example is finding something useful while looking for something else, such as finding the cue ball while looking for the pool stick. The find was caused by the search, and because the find was useful, the event has meaning.\n\nA sychronicity example is two friends who rarely visit libraries, without any planning, finding each other in a library on one day; and again without any planning, finding each other in a distant library on a later date. Not only is the result unexpected, the friends find the event to have meaning (significance), because of the remote chance of the event.\n\nDeterminism theory argues against acausal events. However, the idea of causal determinism can neither be argued for nor against based on the scientific knoweldge at this point in time .\n\nCausality appears to us to be reasonably objective to determine on the macroscopic scale. (But not on the quantum scale, where random chance prevails.) However, even large-scale physical causality is a somewhat mysterious notion; there is no general theory of causality in physics, and most events in physics are theoretically reversible in time . However, the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which states that entropy always increases with time, in any closed system) can be regarded as providing a direction for the \"arrow of time\" and thus entropy may be related to the physically mysterious notion of causality. (See Causality (physics).)\n\nUnlike causality, the concept of meaning is purely subjective except in symbol systems such as language/grammar and mathematics - both systems which depend on prior agreement on the arbitrary assignment of specific meanings to specific symbols or symbol groups .\n\nThe outlier effect can be used to explain events that are unlikely to occur by chance. Littlewood's Law states that individuals can statistically expect a significant event to happen for them at a frequency of about once per month. Littlewood assumes a significant event frequency at one in a million with a duration of one second, and that an individual is alert to significant events for eight hours per day.\n\nThe 1993 book, The Celestine Prophecy, by James Redfield encouraged its readers to seek meaning from grouped events. From the book's First Insight: \"In each of our lives occurs mysterious coincidences - sudden, synchronistic events that, once interpreted, lead us into our true destiny'. The book was a 1996 best seller, spent 165 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller list, and has now sold over 20 million copies.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1280581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1280581", "title": "Hamartia", "text": "Hamartia\n\nThe term hamartia derives from the Greek ἁμαρτία, from ἁμαρτάνειν \"hamartánein\", which means \"to miss the mark\" or \"to err\". It is most often associated with Greek tragedy, although it is also used in Christian theology. \n\n\"Hamartia\" as it pertains to dramatic literature was first used by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\". In tragedy, \"hamartia\" is commonly understood to refer to the protagonist’s error or tragic flaw that leads to a chain of plot actions culminating in a reversal of their good fortune to bad. \n\nWhat qualifies as the error or flaw can include an error resulting from ignorance, an error of judgement, a flaw in character, or a wrongdoing. The spectrum of meanings has invited debate among critics and scholars and different interpretations among dramatists.\n\nHamartia is first described in the subject of literary criticism by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\". The source of \"hamartia\" is at the juncture between character and the character's actions or behaviors as described by Aristotle.\n\nIn his introduction to the S. H. Butcher translation of \"Poetics\", Francis Fergusson describes \"hamartia\" as the inner quality that initiates, as in Dante's words, a \"movement of spirit\" within the protagonist to commit actions which drive the plot towards its tragic end, inspiring in the audience a build of pity and fear that leads to a purgation of those emotions, or catharsis.\n\nJules Brody, however, argues that \"it is the height of irony that the idea of the tragic flaw should have had its origin in the Aristotelian notion of \"hamartia\". Whatever this problematic word may be taken to mean, it has nothing to do with such ideas as fault, vice, guilt, moral deficiency, or the like. \"Hamartia\" is a morally neutral non-normative term, derived from the verb \"hamartano\", meaning 'to miss the mark', 'to fall short of an objective'. And by extension: to reach one destination rather than the intended one; to make a mistake, not in the sense of a moral failure, but in the nonjudgmental sense of taking one thing for another, taking something for its opposite. \"Hamartia\" may betoken an error of discernment due to ignorance, to the lack of an essential piece of information. Finally, \"hamartia\" may be viewed simply as an act which, for whatever reason, ends in failure rather than success.\"\n\nIn a Greek tragedy, for a story to be \"of adequate magnitude\" it involves characters of high rank, prestige, or good fortune. If the protagonist is too worthy of esteem, or too wicked, his/her change of fortune will not evoke the ideal proportion of pity and fear necessary for catharsis. Here Aristotle describes \"hamartia\" as the quality of a tragic hero that generates that optimal balance.\n\n\"Hamartia\" is also used in Christian theology because of its use in the Septuagint and New Testament. The Hebrew (\"chatá\") and its Greek equivalent (\"àµaρtίa\"/\"hamartia\") both mean \"missing the mark\" or \"off the mark\". \n\nThere are four basic usages for \"hamartia\": \n\nAristotle mentions \"hamartia\" in \"Poetics\". He argues that it is a powerful device to have a story begin with a rich and powerful hero, neither exceptionally virtuous nor villainous, who then falls into misfortune by a mistake or error (\"hamartia\"). Discussion among scholars centers mainly on the degree to which hamartia is defined as \"tragic flaw\" or \"tragic error\".\n\nPoetic justice describes an obligation of the dramatic poet, along with philosophers and priests, to see that their work promotes moral behavior. 18th-century French dramatic style honored that obligation with the use of \"hamartia\" as a vice to be punished \"Phèdre\", Racine's adaptation of Euripides' \"Hippolytus\", is an example of French Neoclassical use of \"hamartia\" as a means of punishing vice. Jean Racine says in his Preface to \"Phèdre\", as translated by R.C. Knight:\n\nThe play is a tragic story about a royal family. The main characters' respective vices—rage, lust and envy—lead them to their tragic downfall.\n\nIn her 1963 \"Modern Language Review\" article, \"The Tragic Flaw: Is it a Tragic Error?\", Isabel Hyde traces the twentieth-century history of \"hamartia\" as tragic flaw, which she argues is an incorrect interpretation. Hyde draws upon the language in Butcher's interpretation of \"Poetics\" regarding \"hamartia\" as both error and \"defect in character\". Hyde points out a footnote in which Butcher qualifies his second definition by saying it is not a \"natural\" expression to describe a flaw in behavior. Hyde calls upon another description from A.C. Bradley's \"Shakespearean Tragedy\" of 1904 which she contends is misleading:\n\nHyde goes on to elucidate interpretive pitfalls of treating \"hamartia\" as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well-known tragedies including \"Hamlet\" and \"Oedipus the King\". \n\nHyde observes that students often state \"thinking too much\" as Hamlet's tragic flaw upon which his death in the story depends. That idea does not, however, offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently. It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests he ought to have murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy, which Hyde asserts is problematic. \n\nIn \"Oedipus the King,\" she observes that the ideas of Oedipus' hasty behavior at the crossroads or his trust in his intellect as being the qualities upon which the change of fortune relies is incomplete. Instead, to focus on his ignorance of the true identity of his parents as the foundation of his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end. Rather than a flaw in character, error, in Oedipus' case based upon lack of information, is the more complete interpretation. \nIn his 1978 \"Classical World\" article \"Hamartia, Atë, and Oedipus\", Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place \"hamartia's\" definition along a spectrum connecting the moral, flaw, and the intellectual, error. His goal is to revisit the role, if any, Atë, or divine intervention, plays in \"hamartia\". The Butcher translation of \"Poetics\" references \"hamartia\" as both a \"single great error\", and \"a single great defect in character\", prompting critics to raise arguments. \n\nMid-twentieth-century scholar Phillip W. Harsh sees \"hamartia\" as tragic flaw, observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads. Van Braam, on the other hand, notes of Oedipus' \"hamartia\", \"no specific sin attaching to him as an individual, but the universally human one of blindly following the light of one's own intellect.\" He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be the agent of his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part in order to create a tragic irony. \n\nO. Hey's observations fall into this camp as well. He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist, but as he has been deprived of key pieces of information, the action brings disastrous results. J.M. Bremer also conducted a thorough study of \"hamartia\" in Greek thought, focusing on its usage in Aristotle and Homer. His findings lead him, like Hyde, to cite \"hamartia\" as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing.\n\nJ.M. Bremer and Dawe both conclude that the will of the gods may factor into Aristotelian \"hamartia\". Golden disagrees. Bremer observes that the Messenger in \"Oedipus Rex\" says, \"He was raging - one of the dark powers pointing the way, ...someone, something leading him on - he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber,\". Bremer cites Sophocles' mention of Oedipus being possessed by \"dark powers\" as evidence of guidance from either divine or daemonic force. \n\nDawe's argument centers around tragic dramatists' four areas from which a protagonist's demise can originate. The first is fate, the second is wrath of an angry god, the third comes from a human enemy, and the last is the protagonist's frailty or error. Dawe contends that the tragic \"dénouement\" can be the result of a divine plan as long as plot action begets plot action in accordance with Aristotle. \n\nGolden cites Van Braam's notion of Oedipus committing a tragic error by trusting his own intellect in spite of Tiresias' warning as the argument for human error over divine manipulation. Golden concludes that \"hamartia\" principally refers to a matter of intellect, although it may include elements of morality. What his study asserts is separate from \"hamartia\", in a view that conflicts with Dawe's and Bremer's, is the concept of divine retribution.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "255447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255447", "title": "Helmholtz free energy", "text": "Helmholtz free energy\n\nIn thermodynamics, the Helmholtz free energy is a thermodynamic potential that measures the useful work obtainable from a closed thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and volume. The negative of the change in the Helmholtz energy during a process is equal to the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process in which volume is held constant. If the volume were not held constant, part of this work would be performed as boundary work. This makes the Helmholtz energy useful for systems held at constant volume. Furthermore, at constant temperature, the Helmholtz energy is minimized at equilibrium.\n\nIn contrast, the Gibbs free energy or free enthalpy is most commonly used as a measure of thermodynamic potential (especially in chemistry) when it is inconvenient for applications that do not occur at constant pressure. For example, in explosives research Helmholtz free energy is often used, since explosive reactions by their nature induce pressure changes. It is also frequently used to define fundamental equations of state of pure substances.\n\nThe concept of free energy was developed by Hermann von Helmholtz, a German physician and physicist, and first presented in 1882 in a lecture called \"On the thermodynamics of chemical processes\". From the German word \"Arbeit\" (work), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends the symbol \"A\" and the name \"Helmholtz energy\". In physics, the symbol \"F\" is also used in reference to \"free energy\" or \"Helmholtz function\".\n\nThe Helmholtz energy is defined as\n\nwhere\n\nThe Helmholtz energy is the Legendre transformation of the internal energy \"U\", in which temperature replaces entropy as the independent variable.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics in a closed system provides\nwhere formula_3 is the internal energy, formula_4 is the energy added as heat, and formula_5 is the work done on the system. The second law of thermodynamics for a reversible process yields formula_6. In case of a reversible change, the work done can be expressed as formula_7 (ignoring electrical and other non-\"PV\" work):\n\nApplying the product rule for differentiation to d(\"TS\") = \"T\" d\"S\" + \"S\" d\"T\", it follows\nand\n\nThe definition of \"A\" = \"U\" − \"TS\" enables to rewrite this as \n\nBecause \"A\" is a thermodynamic function of state, this relation is also valid for a process (without electrical work or composition change) that is not reversible, as long as the system pressure and temperature are uniform.\n\nThe laws of thermodynamics are most easily applicable to systems undergoing reversible processes or processes that begin and end in thermal equilibrium, although irreversible quasistatic processes or spontaneous processes in systems with uniform temperature and pressure (u\"PT\" processes) can also be analyzed based on the fundamental thermodynamic relation as shown further below. First, if we wish to describe phenomena like chemical reactions, it may be convenient to consider suitably chosen initial and final states in which the system is in (metastable) thermal equilibrium. If the system is kept at fixed volume and is in contact with a heat bath at some constant temperature, then we can reason as follows.\n\nSince the thermodynamical variables of the system are well defined in the initial state and the final state, the internal energy increase formula_12, the entropy increase formula_13, and the total amount of work that can be extracted, performed by the system, formula_14, are well defined quantities. Conservation of energy implies\n\nThe volume of the system is kept constant. This means that the volume of the heat bath does not change either, and we can conclude that the heat bath does not perform any work. This implies that the amount of heat that flows into the heat bath is given by\n\nThe heat bath remains in thermal equilibrium at temperature \"T\" no matter what the system does. Therefore, the entropy change of the heat bath is\n\nThe total entropy change is thus given by\n\nSince the system is in thermal equilibrium with the heat bath in the initial and the final states, \"T\" is also the temperature of the system in these states. The fact that the system's temperature does not change allows us to express the numerator as the free energy change of the system:\n\nSince the total change in entropy must always be larger or equal to zero, we obtain the inequality\n\nWe see that the total amount of work that can be extracted in an isothermal process is limited by the free-energy decrease, and that increasing the free energy in a reversible process requires work to be done on the system. If no work is extracted from the system, then\n\nand thus for a system kept at constant temperature and volume and not capable of performing electrical or other non-\"PV\" work, the total free energy during a spontaneous change can only decrease.\n\nThis result seems to contradict the equation d\"A\" = −\"S\" d\"T\" − \"P\" d\"V\", as keeping \"T\" and \"V\" constant seems to imply d\"A\" = 0, and hence \"A\" = constant. In reality there is no contradiction: In a simple one-component system, to which the validity of the equation d\"A\" = −\"S\" d\"T\" − \"P\" d\"V\" is restricted, no process can occur at constant \"T\" and \"V\", since there is a unique \"P\"(\"T\", \"V\") relation, and thus \"T\", \"V\", and \"P\" are all fixed. To allow for spontaneous processes at constant \"T\" and \"V\", one needs to enlarge the thermodynamical state space of the system. In case of a chemical reaction, one must allow for changes in the numbers \"N\" of particles of each type \"j\". The differential of the free energy then generalizes to\n\nwhere the formula_23 are the numbers of particles of type \"j\", and the formula_24 are the corresponding chemical potentials. This equation is then again valid for both reversible and non-reversible u\"PT\" changes. In case of a spontaneous change at constant \"T\" and \"V\" without electrical work, the last term will thus be negative.\n\nIn case there are other external parameters, the above relation further generalizes to\n\nHere the formula_26 are the external variables, and the formula_27 the corresponding generalized forces.\n\nA system kept at constant volume, temperature, and particle number is described by the canonical ensemble. The probability to find the system in some energy eigenstate \"r\" is given by\n\nwhere\n\n\"Z\" is called the partition function of the system. The fact that the system does not have a unique energy means that the various thermodynamical quantities must be defined as expectation values. In the thermodynamical limit of infinite system size, the relative fluctuations in these averages will go to zero.\n\nThe average internal energy of the system is the expectation value of the energy and can be expressed in terms of \"Z\" as follows:\n\nIf the system is in state \"r\", then the generalized force corresponding to an external variable \"x\" is given by\n\nThe thermal average of this can be written as\n\nSuppose that the system has one external variable formula_35. Then changing the system's temperature parameter by formula_36 and the external variable by formula_37 will lead to a change in formula_38:\n\nIf we write formula_40 as\n\nwe get\n\nThis means that the change in the internal energy is given by\n\nIn the thermodynamic limit, the fundamental thermodynamic relation should hold:\n\nThis then implies that the entropy of the system is given by\n\nwhere \"c\" is some constant. The value of \"c\" can be determined by considering the limit \"T\" → 0. In this limit the entropy becomes formula_46, where formula_47 is the ground-state degeneracy. The partition function in this limit is formula_48, where formula_49 is the ground-state energy. Thus, we see that formula_50 and that\n\nCombining the definition of Helmholtz free energy\n\nalong with the fundamental thermodynamic relation\n\nformula_53\n\none can find expressions for entropy, pressure and chemical potential:\n\nThese three equations, along with the free energy in terms of the partition function,\n\nallow an efficient way of calculating thermodynamic variables of interest given the partition function and are often used in density of state calculations. One can also do Legendre transformations for different systems. For example, for a system with a magnetic field or potential, it is true that\n\nComputing the free energy is an intractable problem for all but the simplest models in statistical physics. A powerful approximation method is mean-field theory, which is a variational method based on the Bogoliubov inequality. This inequality can be formulated as follows.\n\nSuppose we replace the real Hamiltonian formula_57 of the model by a trial Hamiltonian formula_58, which has different interactions and may depend on extra parameters that are not present in the original model. If we choose this trial Hamiltonian such that\n\nwhere both averages are taken with respect to the canonical distribution defined by the trial Hamiltonian formula_58, then\n\nwhere formula_62 is the free energy of the original Hamiltonian, and formula_63 is the free energy of the trial Hamiltonian. By including a large number of parameters in the trial Hamiltonian and minimizing the free energy, we can expect to get a close approximation to the exact free energy.\n\nThe Bogoliubov inequality is often formulated in a slightly different but equivalent way. If we write the Hamiltonian as\n\nwhere formula_65 is exactly solvable, then we can apply the above inequality by defining\n\nHere we have defined formula_67 to be the average of \"X\" over the canonical ensemble defined by formula_65. Since formula_58 defined this way differs from formula_65 by a constant, we have in general\n\nTherefore,\n\nand thus the inequality\n\nholds. The free energy formula_63 is the free energy of the model defined by formula_65 plus formula_76. This means that\n\nand thus\n\nFor a classical model we can prove the Bogoliubov inequality as follows. We denote the canonical probability distributions for the Hamiltonian and the trial Hamiltonian by formula_79 and formula_80, respectively. From Gibbs' inequality we know that:\n\nholds. To see this, consider the difference between the left hand side and the right hand side. We can write this as:\n\nSince\n\nit follows that:\n\nwhere in the last step we have used that both probability distributions are normalized to 1.\n\nWe can write the inequality as:\n\nwhere the averages are taken with respect to formula_80. If we now substitute in here the expressions for the probability distributions:\n\nand\n\nwe get:\n\nSince the averages of formula_57 and formula_58 are, by assumption, identical we have:\n\nHere we have used that the partition functions are constants with respect to taking averages and that the free energy is proportional to minus the logarithm of the partition function.\n\nWe can easily generalize this proof to the case of quantum mechanical models. We denote the eigenstates of formula_58 by formula_94. We denote the diagonal components of the density matrices for the canonical distributions for formula_57 and formula_58 in this basis as:\n\nand\n\nwhere the formula_99 are the eigenvalues of formula_58\n\nWe assume again that the averages of H and formula_58 in the canonical ensemble defined by formula_58 are the same:\n\nwhere\n\nThe inequality\n\nstill holds as both the formula_79 and the formula_80 sum to 1. On the l.h.s. we can replace:\n\nOn the right-hand side we can use the inequality\n\nwhere we have introduced the notation\n\nfor the expectation value of the operator Y in the state r. See here for a proof. Taking the logarithm of this inequality gives:\n\nThis allows us to write:\n\nThe fact that the averages of H and formula_58 are the same then leads to the same conclusion as in the classical case:\n\nIn the more general case, the mechanical term (\"p\" d\"V\") must be replaced by the product of volume, stress, and an infinitesimal strain:\n\nwhere formula_116 is the stress tensor, and formula_117 is the strain tensor. In the case of linear elastic materials that obey Hooke's law, the stress is related to the strain by\n\nwhere we are now using Einstein notation for the tensors, in which repeated indices in a product are summed. We may integrate the expression for formula_119 to obtain the Helmholtz energy:\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy function for a pure substance (together with its partial derivatives) can be used to determine all other thermodynamic properties for the substance. See, for example, the equations of state for water, as given by the IAPWS in their IAPWS-95 release.\n\nHinton and Zelem \"derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle\". \"The description length of an input vector using a particular code is the sum of the code cost and reconstruction cost.

In this way, the document \"intentionally steers\ntoward flexibility rather than legal precision\" as the words \"in particular\" indicate that the list of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, \"global statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence.\" Thus, despite the non-exhaustive reasons of internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but name is often applied to IDPs.\n\nIt is very difficult to get accurate figures for internally displaced persons because populations aren't constant. IDPs may be returning home while others are fleeing, others may periodically return to IDP camps to take advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur, western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to larger towns and cities. It is necessary in many instances to supplement official figures with additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground. Thus, the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate. Additionally, most official figures only include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters. Development-induced IDPs often are not included in assessments. It has been estimated that between 70 and 80% of all IDPs are women and children.\n\n50% of internally displaced people and refugees were thought to be in urban areas in 2010, many of them in protracted displacement with little likelihood of ever returning home. A 2013 study found that these protracted urban displacements had not been given due weight by international aid and governance as historically they had focused on rural cam displacement responses. The study argues that this protracted urban displacement needs a fundamental change in the approach to those who are displaced and their host societies. They note that re-framing responses to urban displacement will also involve human rights and development actors and local and national governments. They call for a change in the narrative around the issue is needed to reflect ingenuity and fortitude displayed by displaced populations, the opportunities for self-sufficiency and safety represented by urban areas, and that the displaced can make a contribution to their host societies.\nAn updated country by country breakdown can be found online.\n\n\nThe problem of protecting and assisting IDPs is not a new issue. In international law it is the responsibility of the government concerned to provide assistance and protection for the IDPs in their country. However, as many of the displaced are a result of civil conflict and violence or where the authority of the central state is in doubt, there is no local authority willing to provide assistance and protection. It has been estimated that some 5 million IDPs in 11 countries are \"without any significant humanitarian assistance from their governments.\" Under these circumstances rehabilitation policies on humanitarian grounds should be aimed at reducing inequality of opportunity among these vulnerable groups by integrating them into local social services and allowing them access to jobs, education, and healthcare opportunities; otherwise new conflicts might break out.\n\nUnlike the case of refugees, there is no international humanitarian institution which has the overall responsibility of protecting and assisting the refugees as well as the internally displaced. A number of organizations have stepped into the breach in specific circumstances.\n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was mandated by General Assembly Resolution 428 (V) of 14 December 1950 to \"lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection\nof refugees and the resolution of refugee problems...guided by the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.\" The UNHCR has traditionally argued that it does not have a \"general competence for IDPs\" even though at least since 1972 it had relief and rehabillatation programs for those displaced within a country. However, in cases where there is a specific request by the UN Secretary General and with the consent of the State concerned it has been willing to respond by assisting IDPs in a given instance. In 2005 it was helping some 5.6 million IDPs (out of over 25 million), but only about 1.1 million in Africa. \nIn 2005, the UNHCR signed an agreement with other humanitarian agencies. \"Under this agreement, UNHCR will assume the lead responsibility for protection, emergency shelter and camp management for internally displaced people.\"\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross has a mandate of ensuring the application of International Humanitarian Law as it affects civilians in the midst of armed conflict. They have traditionally not distinguished between civilians who are internally displaced and those who remain in their homes. In a 2006 policy statement, the ICRC stated: \nThe ICRC's overall objective is to alleviate the suffering of people who are caught up in armed conflict and other situations of violence. To that end, the organization strives to provide effective and efficient assistance and protection for such persons, be they displaced or not, while taking into consideration the action of other humanitarian organizations.\nOn the basis of its long experience in different parts of the world, the ICRC has defined an operational approach towards the civilian population as a whole that is designed to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs of both displaced persons and local and host communities.\nHowever, its Director of Operations has earlier recognized that IDPs \"deprived of shelter and their habitual sources of food, water, medicine and money, they have different, and often more urgent, material needs.\"\n\nThe previous system set up internationally to address the needs of IDPs was referred to as the collaborative approach as the responsibility for protecting and assisting IDPs was shared among the UN agencies, i.e. UNHCR, Unicef, WFP, UNDP, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the International Organization for Migration IOM, the ICRC and International NGOs. Coordination is the responsibility of the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Humanitarian Coordinator in the country concerned. They are assisted by the Inter-Agency Displacement Division, which was created in 2004 and is housed in the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nThe original collaborative approach has come under increasing criticism. Roberta Cohen reports: \nNearly every UN and independent evaluation has found the collaborative approach deficient when it comes to IDPs. To begin with, there is no real focus of responsibility in the field for assisting and protecting...There is also no predictability of action, as the different agencies are free to pick and choose the situations in which they wish to become involved on the basis of their respective mandates, resources, and interests. In every new emergency, no one knows for sure which agency or combination thereof will become involved.In 2005 there was an attempt to fix the problem by giving sectoral responsibilities to different humanitarian agencies, most notably with the UNHCR taking on the responsibility for protection and the management of camps and emergency shelters. The \"Forced Migration Review\" stated that the \"abnegation of responsibility is possible because there is no formal responsibility apportioned to agencies under the Collaborative Response, and thus no accountability when agencies renege on their promises.\"\n\nThe cluster approach designates individual agencies as ‘sector leaders’ to coordinate operations in specific areas to try to plug those newly identified gaps. The cluster approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland called for strengthening leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of \"clusters\" at different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)’.\n\nThe cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key ‘gap’ areas by developing better surge capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as ‘providers of last resort’, which represents the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nThe clusters were originally concentrated on nine areas: \n\nIASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education, led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO.\n\nThe original nine clusters were later expanded to include agriculture and education.\n\nUnlike the case of refugees, there is no international universal treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Only a regional treaty for African countries has been established (see Kampala Convention). Some other countries have advocated re-thinking the definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to fruition. Recognizing the gap, the UN Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali appointed Francis Deng in 1992 as his representative for internally displaced persons. Besides acting as an advocate for IDPs, Deng set out in 1994, at the request of the UN General Assembly to examine and bring together existing international laws which relating to the protection of IDPs. The result of this work was the document, \"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\".\n\nThe Guiding Principles lay out the responsibilities of states before displacement – that is, to prevent displacement – during and after displacement. They have been endorsed by the UN General Assembly, the African Commission on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) and by the signatories to the 2006 Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region, which include Sudan, DRC and Uganda.\n\nThe Guiding Principles, however, are non-binding. As Bahame Tom Nyanduga, Special Rapporteur on Refugees, IDPs and Asylum Seekers in Africa for the ACHPR has stated, \"the absence of a binding international legal regime on internal displacement is a grave lacuna in international law.\"\n\nIn September 2004 the Secretary-General of the UN showed the continuing concern of his office by appointing Walter Kälin as his Representative on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons. Part of his mandate includes the promoting of the Guiding Principles.\n\nIn so-called \"post-conflict\" situations, there has traditionally been an emphasis in the international community to seek to return to the pre-war status-quo. However, opinions are gradually changing, because violent conflict destroys political, economic and social structures and new structures develop as a result, quite often irreversibly. Furthermore, returning to the pre-war status-quo may actually be undesirable if pre-war structures led to the conflict in the first place, or prevented its early resolution. IDPs' and refugees' right of return can represent one of the most complex aspects of this issue.\n\nNormally, pressure is applied by the international community and humanitarian organization to ensure displaced people are able to return to their areas of origin and the same property. The UN Principles for Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and IDPs, otherwise known as the Pinheiro Principles, provides guidance on the management of the technical and legal aspects of housing, land and property (HLP) restitution. Restitution rights are of key importance to IDPs and refugees around the world, and important to try preventing aggressors benefiting from conflict. However, without a clear understanding of each local context, full restitution rights can be unworkable and fail to protect the people it is designed to protect for the following reasons, refugees and IDPs:\n\nResearchers at the Overseas Development Institute stress the need for humanitarian organization to develop a greater expertise in these issues, using experts who have a knowledge in both humanitarian and land and property issues and so provide better advice to state actors seeking to resolve these issues. The ODI calls on humanitarian agencies to develop an awareness of sustainable reintegration as part of their emphasis on returning IDPs and refugees home. Legal advice needs to be provided to all parties involved even if a framework is created in which to resolve these issues.\n\n\n\n"}

Leveling is highly associated with existential philosopher Søren Kierkegaard.\n\nFor Kierkegaard, leveling was the process of suppressing individuality to a point where the individual's uniqueness becomes non-existent and nothing meaningful in his existence can be affirmed:\n\nHowever, Kierkegaard's idea of leveling wasn't one of making life meaningless but of making life equal because every single individual has equal access to the grace and gifts of God. He wasn't concerned with earthly and material goods.\n\nGerman philosopher Martin Heidegger wrote of leveling: \"by averageness and leveling down, everything gets obscured, and what has thus been covered up gets passed off as something familiar and accessible to everyone. ...by virtue of an insensitivity to all distinctions in level and genuineness, and in providing average intelligibility, opens up a standard world in which all distinctions between the unique and the general, the superior and the average, the important and the trivial have been leveled\".\n\nHeidegger's view of important things becoming mundane and non-specific points towards Nietzsche's concept of master–slave morality, in which the weak and disenfranchised reframe the positive traits of the strong and powerful as not worth pursuing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "579400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=579400", "title": "Levinthal's paradox", "text": "Levinthal's paradox\n\nLevinthal's paradox is a thought experiment, also constituting a self-reference in the theory of protein folding. In 1969, Cyrus Levinthal noted that, because of the very large number of degrees of freedom in an unfolded polypeptide chain, the molecule has an astronomical number of possible conformations. An estimate of 3 or 10 was made in one of his papers (often incorrectly cited as a 1968 paper). For example, a polypeptide of 100 residues will have 99 peptide bonds, and therefore 198 different phi and psi bond angles. If each of these bond angles can be in one of three stable conformations, the protein may misfold into a maximum of 3 different conformations (including any possible folding redundancy). Therefore, if a protein were to attain its correctly folded configuration by sequentially sampling all the possible conformations, it would require a time longer than the age of the universe to arrive at its correct native conformation. This is true even if conformations are sampled at rapid (nanosecond or picosecond) rates. The \"paradox\" is that most small proteins fold spontaneously on a millisecond or even microsecond time scale. The solution to this paradox has been established by computational approaches to protein structure prediction.\n\nLevinthal himself was aware that proteins fold spontaneously and on short timescales. He suggested that the paradox can be resolved if \"protein folding is sped up and guided by the rapid formation of local interactions which then determine the further folding of the peptide; this suggests local amino acid sequences which form stable interactions and serve as nucleation points in the folding process\". Indeed, the protein folding intermediates and the partially folded transition states were experimentally detected, which explains the fast protein folding. This is also described as protein folding directed within funnel-like energy landscapes Some computational approaches to protein structure prediction have sought to identify and simulate the mechanism of protein folding.\n\nLevinthal also suggested that the native structure might have a higher energy, if the lowest energy was not kinetically accessible. An analogy is a rock tumbling down a hillside that lodges in a gully rather than reaching the base.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "382395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382395", "title": "Lifestyle disease", "text": "Lifestyle disease\n\nLifestyle diseases are defined as diseases linked with the way people live their life. This is commonly caused by alcohol, drug and smoking abuse as well as lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. Diseases that impact on our lifestyle are heart disease, stroke, obesity and type II diabetes. The diseases that appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer can include Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, atherosclerosis, asthma, cancer, chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic renal failure, osteoporosis, stroke, depression, obesity and vascular dementia. In the UK the death rate is four times higher from respiratory disease caused by an unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nSome commenters maintain a distinction between diseases of longevity and diseases of civilization or diseases of affluence. Certain diseases, such as diabetes, dental caries and asthma, appear at greater rates in young populations living in the \"western\" way; their increased incidence is not related to age, so the terms cannot accurately be used interchangeably for all diseases.\n\nDiet and lifestyle are major factors thought to influence susceptibility to many diseases. Drug abuse, tobacco smoking, and alcohol drinking, as well as a lack of or too much exercise may also increase the risk of developing certain diseases, especially later in life. Between 1995 and 2005 813,000 Australians were hospitalised due to alcohol.\n\nIn many Western countries, people began to consume more meat, dairy products, vegetable oils, tobacco, sugary foods, Coca-Cola, and alcoholic beverages during the latter half of the 20th century. People also developed sedentary lifestyles and greater rates of obesity. In 2014 11.2 million Australians were overweight or obese Rates of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer and lung cancer started increasing after this dietary change. People in developing countries, whose diets still depend largely on low-sugar starchy foods with little meat or fat have lower rates of these cancers. Causes are not just from smoking and alcohol abuse. Adults can develop lifestyle diseases through behavioural factors that impact on them. These can be unemployment, unsafe life, poor social environment, working conditions, stress and home life can change a person’s lifestyle to increase their risk of developing one of these diseases.\n\nIn 2013 there were 147,678 deaths within Australia mostly from lifestyle diseases including smoking of tobacco, alcohol use and other drugs, violence and unhealthy weight have impacted on Australians' death rate. The leading cause of death of Australian males was heart disease with 11,016 deaths, followed by lung cancer with 4,995 deaths, and chronic pulmonary disease killing 3,572. All these conditions were mainly attributed to smoking, alcohol abuse or unhealthy lifestyle. In 2013 coronary heart disease was the leading cause of death in 8,750 women, mainly as a result of their lifestyle. Dementia and Alzheimer disease came second, affecting 7,277 females and thirdly, cerebrovascular disease, killing 6,368. These top three causes of deaths could be minimized through lifestyle changes within the Australian population.\n\nTable Shows that ages of people dying and the top five diseases of which they are dying.\n\nIn 1900, the top three causes of death in the United States were pneumonia/influenza, tuberculosis, and diarrhea/enteritis. Communicable diseases accounted for about 60 percent of all deaths. In 1900, heart disease and cancer were ranked number four and eight respectively. Since the 1940s, the majority of deaths in the United States have resulted from heart disease, cancer, and other degenerative diseases. And, by the late 1990s, degenerative diseases accounted for more than 60 percent of all deaths.\n\nLifestyle diseases have their onset later in an individual's life; they appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer. This suggests that the life expectancy at birth of 49.24 years in 1900 \nwas too short for degenerative diseases to occur, compared to a life expectancy at birth of 77.8 years in 2004. Also, survivorship to the age of 50 was 58.5% in 1900, and 93.7% in 2007.\n\nPrevention is remedies or activities that aim to reduce the likelihood of a disease or disorder affecting people. Lifestyle diseases are preventable for children if parents set them on the correct path, as early life decisions and influences can impact people later on in life. Lifestyle diseases can be prevented through reduction in smoking of tobacco the Australian Government has started this by introducing plain packaging for all tobacco products and increasing the prices of tobacco production. Overweightness and obesity can be prevented through a well balanced lifestyle through healthy eating and exercise. Prevention can come about by a person undertaking 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily or by doing 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week. Examples of moderate exercise includes a brisk walk, swim, bike ride or it can also be everyday life activities like mowing the lawn or house cleaning. In addition, animals studies have suggested that early life exercise can reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases in adulthood. All causes of lifestyle disease can be prevented through giving up smoking and other drugs, reducing ones intake of alcohol, processed meats (like bacon and sausages), red meats (like pork, beef and lamb), fatty foods and by engaging in daily exercise.\n\n"}

{"id": "43668140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43668140", "title": "Motivational intensity", "text": "Motivational intensity\n\nMotivational intensity is defined as the strength of the tendency to either approach a positive situation or event or to move away from a negative situation or event. For more information, see the motivational intensity and cognitive scope subheading under Affect (psychology).\n\nIn psychology, the term \"valence\" is used to describe stimuli, events, situations and emotional states that are intrinsically attractive (positively valenced) or intrinsically aversive (negatively valenced). The valence of a stimulus or event tells us whether we are likely to approach or avoid it. Valence, however provides no information about the strength of this tendency as it is either positive or negative. Instead, the strength of this association is quantified as the Motivational Intensity. By analogy, the valence of a stimulus or event is like the sign of a correlation coefficient and its motivational intensity is like the coefficient magnitude.\n\nIt has been suggested that valence ratings in normative data sets such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) might be used as proxies for motivational intensity. However, valence and motivational intensity do not always go hand in hand with one another. For example, viewing a positively valenced picture of a cute cat is associated with low motivational intensity because participants like it but are not intrinsically driven towards it. In contrast, viewing a positively valenced picture of a dessert is associated with high motivational intensity because participants want and desire it. Valence and motivational intensity can be at odds with one another with negatively valenced stimuli as well.\n\nMotivational intensity and arousal are related, but are considered to be separate ideas; arousal has implications for action, but motivational intensity does not and it is possible to experience high levels of arousal, but not experience motivational intensity (e.g., laughing). Gable and Harmon-Jones asked participants’ to view pictures and then complete an attention task. Half of the participants pedaled on a stationary bicycle (to induce high arousal), while others did not. Results demonstrated that there was no difference in performance on the attention task with high or low levels of arousal, but pictures high in motivational intensity narrowed attention, compared to pictures that were low in motivational intensity.\n\nAccording to motivational intensity theory, high approach motivational intensity will narrow attention and conversely, low motivational intensity will broaden attention. This theory is at odds with a more traditional explanation of the effects of affect on cognitive scope, which suggest that positive affect broadens attention and negative affect narrows attention, respectively.\n\nMotivational intensity has been experimentally measured and manipulated in a variety of contexts as highlighted below.\n\nGable and Harmon-Jones examined the effects of high and low motivational intensity on the scope of attention. Motivational intensity was manipulated using film clips. Half of the participants watched a film showing cats to induce low motivational intensity. Half of participants watched a film showing appetizing desserts to induce high motivational intensity. After watching the film, participants completed a Kimchi and Palmer task to measure their scope of attention. Results showed that participants experienced narrowing attention following the high, but not the low motivational intensity film.\n\nHart and Gable examined the effect of low and high motivational intensity on positive affect. Participants were either asked to write about a positive event where someone was kind to them to induce low motivational intensity, write down a goal they want to accomplish and the steps it will take to accomplish it to induce high motivational intensity, or write about a typical day in their life, as a neutral control condition. Results indicated that high motivational intensity positive affect lead to more successful goal pursuit and occurred only when task goals were explicitly stated. No effect occurred in the neutral condition, which suggests that motivational intensity alone did not impact goal pursuit.\n\nGable and Harmon-Jones have manipulated motivational intensity using a delayed monetary incentive paradigm. Gable and Harmon-Jones asked participants to respond to shapes that were presented on a computer screen. Half of the participants were told that participants could gain money when circles, but not squares appeared on the screen (pre-goal; high motivational intensity). Half of the participants were not given this instruction. Next, neutral words were presented either centrally or peripherally on the screen. Participants then completed a goal-related flanker task, where they were told that if they were faster than average on each trial, they could gain money on that trial (post-goal; low motivational intensity). Finally, participants’ memory for the words was tested. Results suggested that compared to the neutral condition, high motivational intensity (i.e., pre-goal) lead to better memory for centrally presented information and low motivational intensity (i.e., post-goal) lead to better memory for peripherally presented information. In Experiment 2, these effects were replicated using desirable (e.g., desserts) and neutral pictures.\n\nPictures varying in high and low motivational intensity have been used in a variety of different studies including time perception. Poole & Gable asked participants to judge if pictures that were either high or low motivational intensity, appeared for long or short amount of time. Pictures were high (e.g., pictures of desserts), or low (e.g., pictures of flowers) in motivational intensity or neutral images (e.g., geometric shapes) and have been used in previous experiments to induce motivational intensity. Results demonstrated that participants’ perception of time was shorter when high motivational intensity pictures were presented compared to low motivational intensity or neutral pictures.\n\nGable and Harmon-Jones (Experiment 2) used a neutral picture (e.g. rocks) or a high motivational intensity picture (e.g., dessert) appeared followed by the Navon letter task to measure attentional scope. Results indicted that participants’ attention was narrowed following the high motivational intensity pictures, compared to the low motivational intensity pictures.\n\nGable and Harmon-Jones (Experiment 3) first measured overall approach motivation of participants using Carver and White’s (1994) Behavioral Inhibition Scale and Behavioral Activation Scales. Participants were presented with the dessert pictures used in Experiment 2 to induce high motivational intensity and baby pictures to induce low motivational intensity. Results showed that participants with higher Behavioral Activation scores in the beginning of the experiment showed more evidence of attentional narrowing following high motivational intensity pictures of desserts.\n\nGable and Harmon-Jones (Experiment 4) manipulated motivational intensity using pictures and participant’s expectancy to act. Participant’s viewed high motivational intensity pictures (e.g., desserts) or neutral pictures (e.g., paper plates) and half of the participants who viewed the high motivational intensity pictures of desserts were given the expectation that they would eat the desserts later, while the other half were not. Following the viewing of the pictures, participants completed the Navon letters task to measure the scope of attention. Results suggested that participant’s attention narrowed the most when they viewed high motivational intensity pictures and were expected to consume them. This expectancy to consume the desserts showed further narrowing of attention than viewing high motivational intensity pictures alone.\n\nGable and Harmon-Jones induced motivational intensity using photos from the International Affective Picture System. Pictures were negative or neutral. One picture was presented followed by one trial of the Navon letters task to measure scope of attention. Results showed participants attention was broadened following low motivational intensity pictures, compared to the neutral picture. Experiment 2 was identical to experiment 1, but pictures high motivational intensity negative pictures were used. Results showed a narrowing of attention following these type of pictures.\n\nLiu and Wang used the same high and low motivational intensity pictures used in previous studies along with neutral pictures to examine the effects of motivational intensity on cognitive flexibility. Results showed that low motivational intensity increased cognitive flexibility and high motivational intensity reduced flexibility.\n\nNeuropsychological measures have been used in previous research to measure participant’s neurological responses while they view high and low motivational intensity pictures\n\n"}

It refers to the process by which a prospective donor is moved from cultivation to solicitation. “Moves” are the actions an organization takes to bring in donors, establish relationships, and renew contributions. David Dunlop, the Cornell University senior development officer who developed the concept of moves management, described the idea as “changing people’s attitudes so they want to give.”\n\nAn organization implementing moves management should have a system of policies, procedures, and practices that direct the actions of the organization towards bringing in donors, forging relationships, and generating major gifts. These systems should be focused on donors, rather than donations. They should also emphasize documenting the relationship between the donor and the organization.\n\nMoves management requires a baseline of personally identifiable information for each donor. Because moves management attempts to leverage personal relationships with donors, an organization should be tracking the following:\n\n\nUsing this data and any other additional information in your information tracking system is the foundation for enhancing donor communication and improving solicitation strategies under the moves management philosophy.\n\nMoves management’s heavy focus on donor relationships has led to social data transforming the way organizations are able to interact with donors. Organizations have primarily begun incorporating social data into their moves management strategies in two ways: prospecting and engagement.\n\nThe donor prospecting phase has been enhanced through the ability of constituent relationship management (CRM) technology to import social data. This data also helps inform solicitation strategies, pipeline management, and overall outreach execution for the entire organization.\n\nDonor engagement has benefitted from the use of social data by providing development officers with additional methods of communication. The variety of ways that social media is disseminated has created. CRM software is commonly used to parse the large quantities of social data to turn it into something that is actionable for development officers who are reaching out and nurturing donor relationships.\n"}

The term often connotes an attempt to impress others; it is usually regarded negatively, and under certain circumstances may constitute a breach of professional ethics. When used as part of a logical argument it can be an example of the false authority fallacy.\n\nA 'shout-out' can be regarded as a type of name-dropping where someone's name, or a list of names, is spoken out in order to direct attention towards these groups or individuals, often as a means of expressing kudos or making a referral.\n\nName-dropping is used to position oneself within a social hierarchy. It is often used to create a sense of superiority by raising one's status. By implying (or directly asserting) a connection to people of high status, the name-dropper hopes to raise his or her own social status to a level closer to that of those whose names he or she has dropped, and thus elevate himself or herself above, or into, present company.\n\nName-dropping can also be used to identify people with a common bond. By indicating the names of people one knows, one makes known his or her social circle, providing an opportunity for others with similar connections to relate.\n\nAs a form of appeal to authority, name-dropping can be an important form of informal argumentation, as long as the name being dropped is of someone who is an expert on the subject of the argument and that person's views are accurately represented.\n\nUse of the first name may be effective, as in the case of \"Kingsley\" for Kingsley Amis.\n\nName-dropping is also sometimes used in works of fiction to place a story in a certain historical timeframe, or to imply the involvement of a historical figure in the action (for example, in a story set during World War II, mentioning Adolf Hitler or Winston Churchill). \n\n\n"}

The office liaises with the Business and Information Law Branch, part of the Civil Law Division within the Civil Justice and Legal Services Group of the Attorney-General's Department. However, the office is an independent agency and reports directly to the Parliament of Australia, not to the Attorney-General.\n\nThe first Australian Privacy Commissioner was appointed in 1989 to the former Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which was the national privacy regulatory body until 2010. Major changes to federal freedom of information (FOI) law made in 2010 established the present office as the body responsible for FOI, privacy, and information policy. The \"Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010\" was passed in May 2010, and came into effect from November 2010. This Act introduced fundamental changes to the way information held by government is managed and accessed by members of the public (see Freedom of Information).\n\nThe Office of the Privacy Commissioner was integrated into the office at this time.\n\nThe office is headed by the Australian Information Commissioner. Despite their titles, all commissioners can exercise the privacy and freedom of information (FOI) functions. However, only the Information Commissioner may exercise the information policy functions.\n\nThe office’s responsibilities include:\n\nThe office has freedom of information functions, including the oversight of the operation of the FOI Act and review of decisions made by agencies and ministers under that Act. If a person is dissatisfied with the result of an FOI request, they may seek review by the office. A person may also complain to the office if they are unhappy with the manner in which their request was handled by an agency.\n\nThe FOI Act has been a feature of Australia's legislative landscape since 1982. The purpose of the FOI Act was to open government activity to public scrutiny, so as to enhance accountability and encourage citizen engagement with public administration. In 2010, the Australian Parliament implemented wide-ranging open government reforms — the most significant FOI reforms in thirty years. The office was established and substantial changes were made to the FOI Act. These reforms simplified the process for accessing government information, tightened the exemptions to information release, strengthened independent oversight and review of FOI administration, promoted proactive publication of government information, and clearly stated the open government object of the FOI Act.\n\nThe object of the Act is 'to increase recognition that information held by the Government is to be managed for public purposes, and is a national resource'. The Reform Act introduced a new scheme for the proactive publication of government information called the Information Publication Scheme, under which government agencies are required to provide certain operational information on their websites.\n\nThe office may initiate an own motion investigation (OMI). The office can also provide information and advice on FOI to individuals and agencies, via the OAIC enquiries line.\n\nPrivacy is one of three broad functions conferred on the office. The legislative basis of these privacy functions is drawn primarily from the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act regulates how an individual's personal information is handled. For example, it covers: \n\nThe Act also covers more specific matters, such as: \n\nThe office has a range of responsibilities under other laws, including laws relating to data matching, eHealth, spent convictions and tax file numbers. The office provides information and advice on privacy to individuals, businesses and agencies via the OAIC enquiries line.\n\nUnder the Privacy Act a person can make a complaint to the office about the handling of their personal information by Australian, ACT and Norfolk Island government agencies and private sector organisations covered by the Privacy Act. In some circumstances, the office may also initiate an OMI.\n\nThe office has the power to conduct privacy audits of Australian and ACT Government agencies, as well as some other organisations in certain circumstances.\n\nThe Privacy Advisory Committee (PAC) provides strategic advice on privacy, from a broad range of perspectives, to the Australian Information Commissioner. PAC was established under section 82 of the Privacy Act. All members except the Commissioner are appointed by Her Excellency the Governor-General. PAC consists of no more than six members and is convened by the Australian Information Commissioner.\n\nThe Information Commissioner reports to the Attorney-General on matters relating to Australian Government information management policy and practice, including FOI and privacy.\n\nThe Information Commissioner is assisted in this regard by an Information Advisory Committee (IAC), comprising senior officers from key agencies and people from outside government who have suitable qualifications or experience.\n\nThe office has released a set of \"Principles on open public sector information\" and an accompanying report. The principles are based on the premise that public sector information is to be managed for public purposes as a national resource.\n\nThe office encourages agencies to embed the principles in their internal policies and procedures on information management. The intention is that by doing so they will help build a culture of proactive information disclosure and community engagement.\n\n"}

This article will be concerned solely with the three-dimensional case.\n\nThere are two approaches to defining the \"plane at infinity\" which depend on whether one starts with a projective 3-space or an affine 3-space.\n\nIf a projective 3-space is given, the \"plane at infinity\" is any distinguished projective plane of the space. This point of view emphasizes the fact that this plane is not geometrically different than any other plane. On the other hand, given an affine 3-space, the \"plane at infinity\" is a projective plane which is added to the affine 3-space in order to give it closure of incidence properties. Meaning that the points of the \"plane at infinity\" are the points where parallel lines of the affine 3-space will meet, and the lines are the lines where parallel planes of the affine 3-space will meet. The result of the addition is the projective 3-space, formula_1. This point of view emphasizes the internal structure of the plane at infinity, but does make it look \"special\" in comparison to the other planes of the space.\n\nIf the affine 3-space is real, formula_2, then the addition of a real projective plane formula_3 at infinity produces the real projective 3-space formula_4.\n\nSince any two projective planes in a projective 3-space are equivalent, we can choose a homogeneous coordinate system so that any point on the plane at infinity is represented as (\"X\":\"Y\":\"Z\":0).\nAny point in the affine 3-space will then be represented as (\"X\":\"Y\":\"Z\":1). The points on the plane at infinity seem to have three degrees of freedom, but homogeneous coordinates are equivalent up to any rescaling:\n\nso that the coordinates (\"X\":\"Y\":\"Z\":0) can be normalized, thus reducing the degrees of freedom to two (thus, a surface, namely a projective plane).\n\n\"Proposition\": Any line which passes through the origin (0:0:0:1) and through a point (\"X\":\"Y\":\"Z\":1) will intersect the plane at infinity at the point (\"X\":\"Y\":\"Z\":0).\n\n\"Proof\": A line which passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (\"X\":\"Y\":\"Z\":1) will consist of points which are linear combinations of the two given points:\nFor such a point to lie on the plane at infinity we must have, formula_7. So, by choosing formula_8, we obtain the point \nformula_9, as required. Q.E.D.\n\nAny pair of parallel lines in 3-space will intersect each other at a point on the plane at infinity. Also, every line in 3-space intersects the plane at infinity at a unique point. This point is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the line. To determine this point, consider a line parallel to the given line, but passing through the origin, if the line does not already pass through the origin. Then choose any point, other than the origin, on this second line. If the homogeneous coordinates of this point are (\"X\":\"Y\":\"Z\":1), then the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity through which the first and second line both pass is (\"X\":\"Y\":\"Z\":0).\n\n\"Example\": Consider a line passing through the points (0:0:1:1) and (3:0:1:1). A parallel line passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (3:0:0:1). This second line intersects the plane at infinity at the point (3:0:0:0). But the first line also passes through this point:\nwhen formula_13. ■\n\nAny pair of parallel planes in affine 3-space will intersect each other in a projective line (a line at infinity) in the plane at infinity. Also, every plane in the affine 3-space intersects the plane at infinity in a unique line. This line is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the plane.\n\nSince the plane at infinity is a projective plane, it is homeomorphic to the surface of a \"sphere modulo antipodes\", i.e. a sphere in which antipodal points are equivalent: S/{1,-1} where the quotient is understood as a quotient by a group action (see quotient space). \n\n"}
{"id": "1660577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1660577", "title": "Police power (United States constitutional law)", "text": "Police power (United States constitutional law)\n\nIn United States constitutional law, police power is the capacity of the states to regulate behavior and enforce order within their territory for the betterment of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of their inhabitants. Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the states or to the people. This implies that the Federal Government does not possess all possible powers, because most of these are reserved to the State governments, and others are reserved to the people.\n\nPolice power is exercised by the legislative and executive branches of the various states through the enactment and enforcement of laws. States have the power to compel obedience to these laws through whatever measures they see fit, provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the United States Constitution or in the various state constitutions, and are not unreasonably arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include legal sanctions, physical means, and other forms of coercion and inducement. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms.\n\nThe authority for use of police power under American Constitutional law has its roots in English and European common law traditions. Even more fundamentally, use of police power draws on two (Latin) principles, \"sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas\" (\"use that which is yours so as not to injure others\"), and \"salus populi suprema lex esto\" (\"the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law\"), to justify restriction of individual liberties in order to protect the general welfare. The concept of police power in America was further expanded in a series of notable court cases in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, including the landmark 1851 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case Commonwealth v. Alger, and the 1905 Supreme Court case Jacobson v. Massachusetts.\n\nDue to the nebulous definition of the police power, restrictions on its use are few and far between. In Commonwealth v. Alger, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw wrote that \"It is much easier to perceive and realize the existence and sources of [the police power] than to mark its boundaries, or prescribe limits to exercise.\" However, according to historian Michael Willrich, \"Shaw recognized certain constitutional restraints on police power, but they were few. Laws must apply equally to all under like circumstances... government interferences with individual rights must be 'reasonable' – they must have a clear relation to some legitimate legislative purpose. Beyond those outer limits... most courts stayed out of the way of state police power.\" Later court cases have expanded somewhat on these restrictions by limiting the ability of states to infringe upon implied constitutional rights and by demanding a stricter standard of reasonability, but regulation of police power remains fairly minimal.\n\nThe police power is the basis for land-use planning authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and municipalities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the power of eminent domain. If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of the police power, the private property owner isn't typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the power of eminent domain. The court decision in the case Commonwealth v. Alger was related to land use planning and dealt with the construction of a wharf on privately owned tidelands around Boston Harbor.\n\n"}
{"id": "11175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11175", "title": "Political freedom", "text": "Political freedom\n\nPolitical freedom (also known as political autonomy or political agency) is a central concept in history and political thought and one of the most important features of democratic societies. Political freedom was described as freedom from oppression or coercion, the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, or the absence of life conditions of compulsion, e.g. economic compulsion, in a society. Although political freedom is often interpreted negatively as the freedom from unreasonable external constraints on action, it can also refer to the positive exercise of rights, capacities and possibilities for action and the exercise of social or group rights. The concept can also include freedom from internal constraints on political action or speech (e.g. social conformity, consistency, or inauthentic behaviour). The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of civil liberties and human rights, which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the state.\n\nVarious groups along the political spectrum naturally differ on what they believe constitutes true political freedom.\n\nLeft-wing political philosophy generally couples the notion of freedom with that of positive liberty, or the enabling of a group or individual to determine their own life or realize their own potential. In this sense, freedom may include freedom from poverty, starvation, treatable disease and oppression as well as freedom from force and coercion, from whomever they may issue.\n\nClassical liberal Friedrich Hayek criticized this as a misconception of freedom: [T]he use of \"liberty\" to describe the physical \"ability to do what I want\", the power to satisfy our wishes, or the extent of the choice of alternatives open to us [...] has been deliberately fostered as part of the socialist argument[.] [T]he notion of collective power over circumstances has been substituted for that of individual liberty.\n\nAnarcho-socialists see negative and positive liberty as complementary concepts of freedom. Such a view of rights may require utilitarian trade-offs, such as sacrificing the right to the product of one's labor or freedom of association for less racial discrimination or more subsidies for housing. Social anarchists describe the negative liberty-centric view endorsed by capitalism as \"selfish freedom\".\n\nAnarcho-capitalists see negative rights as a consistent system. Ayn Rand described it as \"a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context\". To such libertarians, positive liberty is contradictory since so-called rights must be traded off against each other, debasing legitimate rights which by definition trump other moral considerations. Any alleged right which calls for an end result (e.g. housing, education, medical services and so on) produced by people is in effect a purported right to enslave others.\n\nSome notable philosophers, such as Alasdair MacIntyre, have theorized freedom in terms of our social interdependence with other people.\n\nIn his book \"Capitalism and Freedom\", American economist Milton Friedman argues that there are two types of freedom, namely political freedom and economic freedom. Friedman asserted that without economic freedom there cannot be political freedom. This idea was contested by Robin Hahnel in his article \"Why the Market Subverts Democracy\". Hahnel points out a set of issues with Friedman’s understanding of economic freedom, i.e. that there will in fact be infringements on the freedom of others whenever anyone exercises their own economic freedom and that such infringements can only be avoided if there is a precisely defined property rights system—which Friedman fails to provide or specify directly. \n\nAccording to political philosopher Nikolas Kompridis, the pursuit of freedom in the modern era can be broadly divided into two motivating ideals, namely freedom as autonomy or independence and freedom as the ability to cooperatively initiate a new beginning.\n\nPolitical freedom has also been theorized in its opposition to and a condition of power relations, or the power of action upon actions, by Michel Foucault. It has also been closely identified with certain kinds of artistic and cultural practice by Cornelius Castoriadis, Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, Jacques Rancière and Theodor Adorno.\n\nEnvironmentalists often argue that political freedoms should include some constraint on use of ecosystems. They maintain there is no such thing, for instance, as freedom to pollute or freedom to deforest given that such activities create negative externalities, which violates other groups' liberty to not be exposed to pollution. The popularity of SUVs, golf and urban sprawl has been used as evidence that some ideas of freedom and ecological conservation can clash. This leads at times to serious confrontations and clashes of values reflected in advertising campaigns, e.g. that of PETA regarding fur.\n\nJohn Dalberg-Acton stated: \"The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities\".\n\nGerald C. MacCallum Jr. spoke of a compromise between positive and negative freedoms, saying that an agent must have full autonomy over themselves. It is triadic in relation to each other because it is about three things, namely the agent, the constraints they need to be free from and the goal they are aspiring to.\n\nHannah Arendt traces freedom's conceptual origins to ancient Greek politics. According to her study, the concept of freedom was historically inseparable from political action. Politics could only be practiced by those who had freed themselves from the necessities of life so that they could participate in the realm of political affairs. According to Arendt, the concept of freedom became associated with the Christian notion of freedom of the will, or inner freedom, around the 5th century CE and since then freedom as a form of political action has been neglected even though, as she says, freedom is \"the raison d'être of politics\".\n\nArendt says that political freedom is historically opposed to sovereignty or will-power since in ancient Greece and Rome the concept of freedom was inseparable from performance and did not arise as a conflict between the will and the self. Similarly, the idea of freedom as freedom from politics is a notion that developed in modern times. This is opposed to the idea of freedom as the capacity to \"begin anew\", which Arendt sees as a corollary to the innate human condition of natality, or our nature as \"new beginnings and hence beginners\".\n\nIn Arendt's view, political action is an interruption of automatic process, either natural or historical. The freedom to begin anew is thus an extension of \"the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given, not even as an object of cognition or imagination, and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known\".\n\n"}

Finally leaving her husband in 2008 and facing an uncertain future, she succeeds in re-building much of her life, seeking refuge at a women's shelter and forming deep friendships with other victims. \n\nDetailing the problems dealt with by the multi-disciplinary anti-abuse effort known as the \"Duluth model\", it has received a variety of supportive critical reviews from publications such as the \"City Pages\" and \"The Minnesota Post\".\n\nAs stated before, the film looks at the film of Kim Mosher and her suffering at the hands of both physical and emotional abuse. The Wabasha, Minnesota mother wanted to keep her ten-year marriage and family together, yet, once her husband began to physically abuse their children as well, she left her home with her children in 2008 for the Safe Haven battered women's shelter in Duluth where she began to build a new life for them as well as her. The film shows her struggles as she searches for a job, seeks child care services, looks out for affordable housing, and otherwise attempts to raise her children safely.\n\nThe documentary specifically explores the 'Domestic Abuse Intervention Project', often called the 'Duluth model', which was the first multi-disciplinary program designed to coordinate the actions of a variety of agencies in Duluth, Minnesota dealing with domestic violence for a more effective outcome. This organizational effort has become a test case looked at for programs in many other U.S. jurisdictions. A nationwide study published in 2002, sponsored by the federal government, found that batterers who complete programs based on the model are less likely to repeat acts of domestic violence than those who do not complete any batterers intervention program.\n\nThe movie made its world premiere at the 'Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival' in April 2010. Upon wide release, it has received critical praise from several publications. For example, \"City Pages\" writer Ira Booker found the film a \"stark reminder that this kind of violence is all around us.\" \"The Minnesota Post\" ran an article referring to it as \"a purely harrowing story\" and \"highly recommended.” As well, the Buffalo, NY web-project \"Educational Media Reviews Online\" endorsed the film.\n\n\n"}

She is the first Indian-American woman to serve in the House of Representatives. The district's first female member of Congress, she is also the first Asian-American to represent Washington in Congress.\n\nBefore entering electoral politics, Jayapal was a Seattle-based civil rights activist, serving until 2012 as the executive director of OneAmerica, a pro-immigrant advocacy group. Jayapal founded the organization, originally called Hate Free Zone, following the 2001 September 11 attacks. The organization successfully sued the Bush Administration's Immigration and Naturalization Services to prevent the deportation of over 4,000 Somalis across the country.\n\nDescribed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as \"a rising star in the Democratic caucus\", Jayapal currently serves as the First Vice Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and serves on both the Judiciary and Budget committees.\n\nJayapal was born in Chennai, India, to a Malayali-Indian family and was raised in Indonesia and Singapore. She immigrated to the United States in 1982, at the age of 16, to attend college. She earned her bachelor's degree from Georgetown University, and an MBA from Northwestern University.\n\nJayapal worked with PaineWebber as a financial analyst after graduating from Northwestern. In her time at PaineWebber, Jayapal developed a desire to apply her financial prowess to the good of society, and began spending time working on development projects from Chicago to Thailand. After this occupation, Jayapal briefly worked in sales and marketing with a medical company before ultimately moving into the public sector in 1991.\n\nJayapal founded Hate Free Zone after the 2001 September 11 attacks as an advocacy group for immigrant groups. Hate Free Zone registered new American citizens to vote and lobbied on immigration reform and related issues. They successfully sued the Bush Administration's Immigration and Naturalization Services to prevent the deportation of over 4,000 Somalis across the country. The group changed its name to OneAmerica in 2008. Jayapal stepped down from her leadership position in May 2012. In 2013 she was recognized by the White House as a \"Champion of Change.\"\n\nOn June 29, 2018, Jayapal participated in Women Disobey and the sit-in at the Hart Senate Office Building to protest the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” approach to illegal immigration. The protest resulted in the arrest of over 500 people, including Jayapal. She said she was \"proud to have been arrested\" for protesting the administration’s \"inhumane and cruel\" policy.\n\nJayapal served on the Mayoral Advisory Committee that negotiated Seattle's $15 minimum wage, and co-chaired the Mayor's police chief search committee, which resulted in the unanimous selection of the city's first woman police chief.\n\nAfter State Senator Adam Kline announced his retirement in early 2014, Jayapal entered the race to succeed him. She was endorsed by Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and won more than 51% of the vote in the August 5 primary, out of a field of six candidates. She went on to defeat fellow Democrat Louis Watanabe in November 2014.\n\nIn the Washington State Senate, Jayapal was the primary sponsor of SB 5863, which directs the Washington State Department of Transportation to administer a pre-apprenticeship program targeting women and people of color; the bill passed into law in July 2015. She co-sponsored a bill to test and track thousands of police department rape kits.\n\nJayapal endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn January 2016, Jayapal declared her candidacy for Congress in Washington's 7th congressional district, after Congressman Jim McDermott announced his retirement. In April, she received an endorsement from Bernie Sanders. On August 2, 2016, Jayapal finished first in the top-two primary, alongside state representative Brady Walkinshaw, also a Democrat. This was the first time in the state's history that a federal seat was contested by two Democrats. In the final weeks of the race, Jayapal and her supporters contested claims from Walkinshaw that she had not advanced enough legislation. Jayapal won the general election with 56 percent of the vote.\n\nJayapal is a co-sponsor of legislation intended to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for most families and to significantly reduce student debt. She and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) introduced the Trump Transparency Package, a series of bills aimed at promoting transparency and eliminating conflicts of interest in the Trump White House. Jayapal and her fellow co-chairs of the United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force also introduced a package of Environmental Justice bills to fight the impact of climate change on frontline communities. Jayapal is a supporter of universal healthcare and co-sponsor of Expanded and Improved Medicare For All Act. On April 16, 2018, Jayapal joined Justice Democrats.\n\nDuring the inauguration of President Donald Trump, Jayapal met with constituents in her congressional district instead of attending the ceremony. \"The Nation\" called her \"a leader of the resistance,\" quoting Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calling Jayapal \"a rising star in the Democratic caucus.\" In September, Rep.

It is the methods that systemically advance the teaching, research, and practice of a given scholarly or academic field of study through rigorous inquiry. Scholarship is noted by its significance to its particular profession, and is creative, can be documented, can be replicated or elaborated, and can be and is peer-reviewed through various methods.\n\nOriginally started to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval theology, scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on dialectical reasoning. The primary purpose of scholasticism is to find the answer to a question or to resolve a contradiction. It was once well known for its application in medieval theology but was eventually applied to classical philosophy and many other fields of study.\n\nThe historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. The question of the nature, and indeed the possibility, of sound historical method is raised in the philosophy of history, as a question of epistemology. History guidelines commonly used by historians in their work require external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis.\n\nThe empirical method is generally taken to mean the collection of data on which to base a hypothesis or derive a conclusion in science. It is part of the scientific method, but is often mistakenly assumed to be synonymous with other methods. The empirical method is not sharply defined and is often contrasted with the precision of experiments, where data is derived from the systematic manipulation of variables. The experimental method investigates causal relationships among variables. An experiment is a cornerstone of the empirical approach to acquiring data about the world and is used in both natural sciences and social sciences. An experiment can be used to help solve practical problems and to support or negate theoretical assumptions.\n\nThe scientific method refers to a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable, empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. A scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses.\n"}
{"id": "1816895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816895", "title": "Self-fashioning", "text": "Self-fashioning\n\nSelf-fashioning, a term introduced by Stephen Greenblatt (\"Renaissance Self-Fashioning\", 1980), is used to describe the process of constructing one's identity and public persona according to a set of socially acceptable standards. Greenblatt described the process in the Renaissance era where a noble man was instructed to dress in the finest clothing he could afford, to be well versed and educated in art, literature, sports, and other culturally determined noble exercises, and to generally compose himself in a carefully intended manner. Additionally, the relationship between self-fashioning and the aesthetic mediums was a reciprocal one. Just as the art of creating oneself was highly influenced by the art and literature of the time, such as conduct books and religious iconography, such a concern for one's outwardly projected image was reflected in the portraiture of the time.\n\nAccording to Greenblatt, during the Renaissance the upper class practiced self-fashioning. Prescribed attire and behavior was created for the noblemen and women, and were represented through portraits. The ideological traits portraying masculinity were symbols of authority and power. Male rulers depicted themselves in armor or with weapons. The most important characteristic attributed to women was beauty. Beauty represents the concepts of purity, virtue and modesty. In portraits, women performed these traits through idealized features, fancy dresses, and elaborate jewelry. The iconography of portraits displays the gender-specific qualities prescribed during the Renaissance through visual devices.\n\n\"The Book of the Courtier\", by Baldassare Castiglione, is one of the first texts that depicted behaviors which individuals were expected to adopt in society. As an informal book of conduct, \"The Courtier\" included instructions on how people of the noble class were to dress and speak, as well as general rules of interaction to follow in social situations. In his article \"The Semiotics of Masculinity in Renaissance England\", David Kuchta discusses the role of \"The Courtier\" concerning its influence on the self-fashioning of Renaissance England. Men of the noble class were to \"create\" themselves as works of art, according to the conventions of dress and manner as set forth by the monarchs. Characteristics of this Renaissance self-fashioning involve the use of \"feminine\" aspects of dress and conduct. A man was to conduct and dress in a way that reflected his position in society. He was not supposed to act in an affected manner, but present naturalness and nonchalance, or sprezzatura. In addition to, \"The Courtier\" puts emphasis on the importance of not only trying to resemble one's master, but actually trying to transform himself into his master in a way that exercises sprezzatura. This presents a key theme in self-fashioning: the conscious effort to strive to imitate a praised model in society.\n\nFor women, one of the most popular figures to imitate was the Virgin Mary. Margaret R. Miles provides a thorough analysis of this influence-through-images of iconography and art in her article \"The Virgin's One Bare Breast\". The bare breast symbolized nourishment in a time of famine. Depicting the Virgin Mary nursing the infant Christ encouraged women to aspire to provide the same nourishment for their own families and community. Miles goes on to explain that, although women were encouraged to strive to emulate the many virtues of the Virgin, they must also be aware that one could never fully achieve such a standard. Similarly, men were taught that they should follow in the image of Christ, which was believed to be more attainable.\n\nGreenblatt's theories are influenced by the French sociologist and historian Michel Foucault.\n\nSelf-fashioning has implications and applications outside of Renaissance studies. Waleska Schwandt applies the theory to Oscar Wilde in a chapter of the book \"The Importance of Reinventing Oscar: Versions of Wilde during the Last 100 Years\", edited by Uwe Boker et al. (New York and Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2002). Alvina E. Quintana uses the theory to analyse twentieth century Chicano literature (see \"Ana Castillo's \"The Mixquiahuala Leters\"\", in \"Criticism in the Borderlands: Studies in Chicano Literature, Culture and Ideology\", Hector Calderon and Jose David Saldivar (eds), Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1991, pp. 72–83). Jack Chen applies the concept to the writings of Emperor Taizong in a book titled \"the Poetics of Sovereignty: on Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty,\" (Boston, Mass: Harvard University Asia Center, 2011).\n"}
{"id": "1989668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989668", "title": "Social position", "text": "Social position\n\nSocial position is the position of an individual in a given society and culture. A given position (for example, the occupation of \"priest\") may belong to many individuals. Social position influences social status.\n\nSocial positions an individual may hold fall into the categories of occupation (medical doctor, academic lecturer), profession (member of associations and organisations), family (parent, sibling, etc.), hobby (member of various clubs and organisations), among others. An individual is likely to create a personal hierarchy of such positions, where one will be a central position while the rest are peripheral positions.\n\nSocial positions are \"visible\" if they require an individual to wear a uniform or some other kind of identifying mark. Often individual clothes or other attributes will advertise what social position one has at the moment. Non-visible social positions are called \"hidden\". A position that is deemed the most important to a given individual is called \"central\", others are \"peripheral\". If a \"sequence of positions\" is required to obtain a given position, it can be defined as a career, and a change of position in this context is a promotion or demotion. Some social positions may make it easier for a given person to obtain others; in other cases, some positions may be restricted to individuals meeting specific criteria.\n\nSocial position together with social role determines an individual's place in the social environment and social organisation. A group of social positions will create a social class and a social circle.\n\nA social conflict caused by interference between social positions is called a \"position conflict\".\n\nThe sociological term for social position is a way of identifying a person's position within the social hierarchy in a society.\n\nSubjective social position refers to an individual's perceived social position in a social hierarchy. According to Kristina Lindemann the individual objective characteristics like education, occupation and income are related with the subjective social position. In addition, the culture and society that a person lives and grows in, heavily impacts an individual’s subjective social position. \"An individual's subjective social position status depends not only on the objective characteristics but also on how people experience society, the way they perceive their position in comparison with others,and what they imagine their position would be in the future.\" Lindemann divides objective characteristics into two groups, ascribed and achieved characteristics. Ascribed characteristics are things like age, gender, and ethnicity. Achieved characteristics are things like the education level, occupation, or income. Studies have indicated a significant relevance of these characteristics to an individual’s subjective social position.\n\nOn the other hand, some theories expect that objective characteristics do not have influence on subjective social position. The reference group theory mentioned by Lindemann in her essay states that people see the world as an enlarged version of their reference group. People base their social position upon the people around them. Typically people’s family, friends, and co-workers are usually very similar, and in general, most people see themselves as average and unexceptional. The status maximizing process also mentioned by Lindemann means that subjective social position reflects also person prospects and hopes for future societal attainment.\n\nLindemann’s empirical study focuses on Estonian society. Age is considered an impactful characteristic on people when identifying with their social position in Estonia. Young people give higher estimation to their social position, which is a tendency also found in other Eastern European countries. Gender and ethnicity, are also considerable characteristics in identifying social position. In general, the subjective social position of men and women is not significantly different in western countries. Ethnicity impacts social position differently from country to country. More importantly the influence of ethnicity is closely related to the extent ethnic minorities are accepted by the overall society.\n\nDifferent studies have shown that the effect of income on class identification in particular has increased during the last decades in Western countries. In Estonia, the income is the most important determinant that shapes people opinion of their social position. The increased influence of income on the subjective social position can be explained by the rise of consumer society values. In her studies Lindemann also found that occupation and education influence significantly the subjective social position. As expected, managers and professionals and higher educated people identify with the middle or higher strata, while unskilled workers and low educated people relate with the lower positions in social hierarchy.\n\nIn several studies, researchers have assessed Individuals' perceived social position using the single-item MacArthur scale of subjective social status. The MacArthur scale of subjective social status is a drawing of a ten-rung ladder presented as the distribution of individuals in a social hierarchy. People with the highest salaries, best ranked jobs and highest education levels are depicted as standing on the upper rungs of the ladder, whereas those with the lowest salaries, poorest jobs, and lowest education levels are those who stand at the bottom of the ladder.\n\nA social class (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes.\n\nClass is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and social historians. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of \"class\", and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term \"social class\" is usually synonymous with \"socio-economic class\", defined as \"people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status\", e.g., \"the working class\"; \"an emerging professional class\". However, academics distinguish social class and socioeconomic status, with the former referring to one’s relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter referring to one’s current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time.\n\nThe precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time. Karl Marx thought \"class\" was defined by one's relationship to the means of production (their relations of production). His simple understanding of classes in modern capitalist society, are the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production; and the bourgeoisie, those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist Max Weber, who argued \"class\" is determined by economic position, in contrast to \"social status\" or \"Stand\" which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.\n\nThe term \"class\" is etymologically derived from the Latin \"classis\", which was used by census takers to categorize citizens by wealth, in order to determine military service obligations.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the term \"class\" began to replace classifications such as estates, rank, and orders as the primary means of organizing society into hierarchical divisions. This corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics, and increase in the significance of wealth and income as indicators of position in the social hierarchy.\n\nOne way to change one's social position is to increase human capital. The human capital theory suggest that people having more job-relevant resources, such as education and training, should receive more organizational rewards i.e. promotions than people with fewer of these resources. Human capital alone can affect social position to a certain extent. An individual has to have social skills and build social networks to help promote their social position.\n\nAnother way to effectively increase one's chance of obtaining or sustaining social position is by increasing social capital. The social capital theory posits that certain qualities in workplace relationships are beneficial for receiving organizational rewards, and employees whose relationships are not characterized by these qualities are at a disadvantage. In other words, people who have social relationships with upper management might get to know about a promotion possibility before someone lacking in the social capital infrastructure that relays that sort of information.\n\nErika James finds through studies and analysis that in general blacks have been promoted at a slower pace than whites. This workplace discrimination occurred most likely because of unequal human/social capital between the two races. Clearly this is not a justification for the actions to occur. The issue of race still exists as a statistically proven factor in American job markets.\n\nFor an individual to hold a social position thoroughly and knowledgeably they must be trusted in the market and reflect it in their behavior. Paul S. Adler says that a review of trends in employment relations, interdivisional relations, and interfirm relations finds evidence suggesting that the effect of growing knowledge-intensity may indeed be a trend toward greater reliance on trust. He believes the form of trust that is most effective in this context is of a distinctively modern kind - \"reflective trust\" - as opposed to traditionalistic, \"blind\" trust.\n\nThe values at work in modern trust are those of the scientific community: \"universalism, communism, disinterestedness, organized skepticism\" (Merton 1973, p. 270). Modern trust is inclusive and open. The author concludes that the efficacy of trust for knowledge management and the likelihood of its growth over time are maximized if:\n\n\nThere is an element of trust necessary within society and for identifying with a particular social position - especially relevant to particular community positions where one's actions weigh heavily on one's social position.\n\n"}

The term was coined by Keith Baker and Adriana de Kanter in a 1983 recommendation to schools to make use of Canada's successful French immersion programs. The Canadian model was developed to encourage bilingualism through immersing Anglophones in the minority language and replaced many English-only laws in various Canadian provinces before the 1960s, while in the United States the same approach was advocated to force minority speakers to adopt English.\n\nMore recently, SEI has been defined as a methodology in which English language learners (ELLs) learn English through structured and sequential lessons. Specially developed for ELLs, these lessons are based, to a large degree, on the mainstream curricula. (Haver, Johanna J., \"Structured English Immersion,\" Corwin Press, 2002)\n\nIn the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Horne v. Flores, the majority opinion stated, \"Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI is significantly more effective than bilingual education. Findings of the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004 strongly support this conclusion.\" The chairman of the Center for Equal Opportunity, Linda Chavez, praised the Supreme Court ruling, noting \"the failure of bilingual education in performing the number-one job of our public schools, which is to teach children English so they can succeed in 21st century America.\" SEI is mandatory in California, Arizona and Massachusetts where voter initiatives opted to restrict the use of bilingual education in preference for SEI.\n\nOnly Arizona mandates that its public schools implement SEI models as follows:\n\nIn Arizona, where SEI is required of all schools in the state, all textbooks, materials, and assessments used in an SEI classroom must be aligned to the Arizona K-12 English Language Learner Proficiency Standards and the Discrete Skills Inventory.

{"id": "3153535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3153535", "title": "Swim lane", "text": "Swim lane\n\nA swim lane (or swim lane diagram) is used in process flow diagrams, or flowcharts, that visually distinguishes job sharing and responsibilities for sub-processes of a business process. Swim lanes may be arranged either horizontally or vertically. \nThe swim lane flowchart differs from other flowcharts in that processes and decisions are grouped visually by placing them in \"lanes\". Parallel lines divide the chart into lanes, with one lane for each person, group or sub process. Lanes are labelled to show how the chart is organized.\n\nIn the accompanying example, the vertical direction represents the sequence of events in the overall process, while the horizontal divisions depict what sub-process is performing that step. Arrows between the lanes represent how information or material is passed between the sub processes.\n\nAlternately, the flow can be rotated so that the sequence reads horizontally from left to right, with the roles involved being shown at the left edge. This can be easier to read and design, since computer screens are typically wider than they are tall, which gives an improved view of the flow.\n\nUse of standard symbols enables clear linkage to be shown between related flow charts when charting flows with complex relationships.\n\nWhen used to diagram a business process that involves more than one department, swimlanes often serve to clarify not only the steps and who is responsible for each one, but also how delays, mistakes or cheating are most likely to occur.\n\nMany process modeling methodologies utilize the concept of swim lanes, as a mechanism to organize activities into separate visual categories in order to illustrate different functional capabilities or responsibilities (organisational roles). Swim lanes are used in Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and Unified Modeling Language activity diagram modeling methodologies.\n\nA swim lane may also be referred to as a functional band (as it is in Microsoft Visio 2007) and is used in the same way, to create a cross functional flowchart to map a process within the functional units of a business. The term functional band precedes the use of swim lane and is seemingly in decline as the preferred term.\n\nSwim lane diagrams first appeared in the 1940s as a variation of the flow process chart called multi-column charts. They were called Swim Lane diagrams by Geary Rummler and Alan Brache in their book Improving Performance (1990). Swim lanes are also known as \"Rummler-Brache Diagrams\".\nAnother possible origin of the term swim lane is as part of the JBoss jBPM jPDL (Process Definition Language) graphical process designer a part of the JBoss jBPM framework for process languages.\n\nThe Swim Lane presentation was developed in the early 1980s by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Binner as part of his doctoral thesis on the requirements of the IT and CIM concept at the Institute for Factory Facilities at Prof. Wiendahl at TU-Hannover.\n\nA process model was developed in which the role-based process analysis and modeling was the starting point for the IT-based IT solution or, in the case, the CIM solution with which the development of an IT-CIM concept was possible.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "622760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=622760", "title": "The Most Dangerous Game", "text": "The Most Dangerous Game\n\n\"The Most Dangerous Game\", also published as \"The Hounds of Zaroff\", is a short story by Richard Connell, first published in \"Collier's\" on January 19, 1924. The story features a big-game hunter from New York City who falls off a yacht and swims to what seems to be an abandoned and isolated island in the Caribbean, where he is hunted by a Russian aristocrat. The story is inspired by the big-game hunting safaris in Africa and South America that were particularly fashionable among wealthy Americans in the 1920s.\n\nThe story has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the 1932 RKO Pictures film \"The Most Dangerous Game\", starring Joel McCrea and Leslie Banks, and for a 1943 episode of the CBS Radio series \"Suspense\", starring Orson Welles.\n\nSanger Rainsford and his friend, Whitney, are traveling to the Amazon rainforest to hunt the region's big cat: the jaguar. After a discussion about how they are \"the hunters\" instead of \"the hunted\", Whitney goes to bed and Rainsford hears gunshots. He climbs onto the yacht's rail and accidentally falls overboard, swimming to Ship-Trap Island, which is notorious for shipwrecks. On the island, he finds a palatial chateau inhabited by two Cossacks: the owner, General Zaroff, and his gigantic deaf-mute servant, Ivan.\n\nZaroff, another big-game hunter, knows of Rainsford from his published account of hunting snow leopards in Tibet. After inviting him to dinner, General Zaroff tells Rainsford he is bored of hunting because it no longer challenges him; he has moved to Ship-Trap in order to capture shipwrecked sailors. Any captives who can elude Zaroff, Ivan, and a pack of hunting dogs for three days are set free. Zaroff reveals that no one has lasted that long, although a couple of sailors had come close. Zaroff also says that he offers sailors a \"choice\"; should they decline to be hunted they will be handed over to Ivan, who had once been official knouter for The Great White Czar. Rainsford denounces this as barbarism. Zaroff reacts in a cosmopolitan manner that \"life is for the strong\". Realizing he has no way out, Rainsford reluctantly agrees to be hunted.\n\nDuring his three-hour head start, Rainsford lays an intricate trail in the forest and then climbs a tree. Zaroff finds him easily, but decides to play with him like a cat would a mouse, standing underneath the tree Rainsford is hiding in, smoking a cigarette, and then abruptly departing. After the failed attempt at eluding Zaroff, Rainsford builds a Malay man-catcher, a weighted log attached to a trigger. This contraption injures Zaroff's shoulder, causing him to return home for the night. The next day Rainsford creates a Burmese tiger pit, which kills one of Zaroff's hounds. He sacrifices his knife and ties it to a sapling to make a Ugandan knife trap; Ivan is killed when he stumbles into this trap and the knife plunges into his heart. To escape Zaroff and his approaching hounds, Rainsford dives off a cliff into the sea; Zaroff, disappointed at Rainsford's suicide, returns home. \n\nZaroff locks himself in his bedroom and turns on the lights only to find Rainsford waiting for him; he had swum around the island in order to sneak into the chateau without the dogs finding him. Zaroff congratulates him on winning the \"game\", but Rainsford decides to fight him, saying he is still a beast-at-bay and that the original hunt is not over. Accepting the challenge, Zaroff says that the loser will be fed to the dogs, while the winner will sleep in his bed. Though the ensuing fight is not described, the story ends with Rainsford observing that \"he had never slept in a better bed\"—implying that he defeated and killed Zaroff.\n\n\"The Most Dangerous Game\" is a popular read within middle and high school curricula due to the strength of the themes within the story. The first and foremost question that the story bears is that of justifiable murder. Rainsford justifies his hunting of animals because he believes that man is superior to animals because animals do not feel. To contradict, General Zaroff believes that men are superior because they are able to reason. Zaroff uses his reasoning to explain why men are the most interesting game to hunt; men can reason, and thus provide a challenge that no animal can contend with. The story simultaneously highlights through the experience of Rainsford, as he is hunted, the fears that animals must experience while being hunted.\n\nZaroff himself is a contradiction because his exquisite manners are juxtaposed with his heartless brutality in killing men. The idea of a man who is proper in all aspects, but still contains a desire to kill, is a suggestion by Connell that men possess murderous instincts that can only be subdued by the presence of society and law. Zaroff is only able to partake in his \"hobby\" because he does not live within a civilization.\n\nThe ending of the story bears questions about the true nature of Rainsford, who is implied to have killed Zaroff in order to secure his own safety. By killing Zaroff, he thus took part in the \"game\" that Zaroff wanted him to play.\n\nThis story has been adapted to film numerous times. The most significant of these adaptations—and the only film to use the original characters—was RKO Pictures' film released in 1932, \"The Most Dangerous Game\". Joel McCrea stars as Rainsford; Leslie Banks portrays Zaroff. The adaptation by James Ashmore Creelman adds two other principal characters, brother-and-sister pair Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray) and Martin Trowbridge (Robert Armstrong), who are castaways from a shipwreck. \"The Most Dangerous Game\" was co-directed by Ernest B. Schoedsack and Irving Pichel; also with a score by Max Steiner, the film was a favorite project of producer Merian C. Cooper. The production shared several sets with \"King Kong\" (1933), a simultaneous RKO project that also involved Schoedsack, Cooper, Wray, Armstrong, Creelman, and Steiner. \"The Most Dangerous Game\" was a modest success.\n\nRKO produced a remake titled \"A Game of Death\" (1945), directed by Robert Wise, from a screenplay Norman Houston wrote. This film stars John Loder and Audrey Long, with Edgar Barrier as the mad hunter. In order to keep with events of that time, \"A Game of Death\" changed Zaroff into \"Erich Kreiger\", a Nazi, and was set in the aftermath of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1956, United Artists released another film adaptation, \"Run for the Sun\", starring Richard Widmark, Trevor Howard and Jane Greer.\n\nIn 1961, the film \"Bloodlust!\" was released, directed by Ralph Brooke and starring Wilton Graff as the Zaroff-type character, and Robert Reed as the leader of a band of youths who become stranded on the island.\n\n1972's \"The Woman Hunt\" starring John Ashley and Sid Haig made for Roger Corman's New World Pictures is an unofficial remake of the story. \n\nThe Australian film \"Turkey Shoot\" has similar elements.\n\nJohn Woo's first Hollywood directorial effort, the Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller \"Hard Target\" (1993), was loosely based on the same story. The locale was shifted to 1990s New Orleans, with homeless Vietnam war veterans voluntarily serving (in return for potential payment from a shady businessman) as human prey.\n\nIn \"Surviving the Game\" (1994), a homeless man is hired as a survival guide for a group of wealthy businessmen on a hunting trip in the mountains. He is unaware that they are killers who hunt humans for sport, and that he is their new prey. Directed by Ernest R. Dickerson, the film stars Rutger Hauer, Ice-T, and Charles S. Dutton.\n\n\"The Pest\" (1997) is a comedic parody of the story, with German huntsman Gustav Shank accidentally bringing Puerto Rican teenage hustler Pestario \"Pest\" Vargas to his island instead of the skilled man he had intended to hunt, only to decide to hunt the Pest anyway due to his sheer obnoxiousness. Shank's ambition is to have a head of a warrior of every ethnicity in his Trophy Room. He also rigs the \"game\" by having his prey unknowingly drink a slow-acting poison before the hunt, making sure that they die even if they escape him. \n\nIn \" The Eliminator\" (2004), seven captured people are hunted at night for sport on an island as a betting game for the wealthy.\n\n\"The Most Dangerous Game\" was presented four times as a radio play. \n\n\"The Outer Limits\" episode \"The Hunt\" is a story in which the hunting of animals has been banned by environmentalists, and black market hunting of obsolete androids takes its place.\n\nIn \"The Wild Wild West\" episode, 1/3 \"The Night of Sudden Death\", Jim West and a circus girl are trapped inside a Africa Reserve wild animal Park in Colorado and are hunted by a insane big Game Hunter Warren (Robert Loggia).\n\nIn the \"Get Smart\" episode, \"Island of the Darned\", Agents 86 and 99 are trapped on an island with a mad KAOS killer, Hans Hunter (Harold Gould).\n\nThis trope was used in the season 3 (1968), episode 22 of \"I Spy\", \"The Name of the Game\".\n\nIn the \"Gilligan's Island\" episode \"The Hunter\", big-game hunter Jonathan Kincaid (Rory Calhoun) turned his sights on Gilligan when he realized there were no wild animals on the island.\n\nIn the series finale of \"Bonanza\", entitled \"The Hunter\", a deranged killer, Corporal Bill Tanner (Tom Skerritt), who was formerly a tracker for the United States Army, hunts Little Joe (Michael Landon).\n\nIn the 1974 TV movie \"Savages\" after a young man accidentally witness a murder, he must survive both the desert and being hunted by the killer (Andy Griffith)\n\nIn the 1977 pilot episode of \"Fantasy Island\", a big-game hunter comes to the island to be hunted by a man, an interesting twist on the usual version in which the hunted participates against his will.\n\nThe Canadian series \"Relic Hunter\" had an episode called \"Run Sydney Run\" that was very closely based on \"The Most Dangerous Game\", with Peter Stebbings acting as General Tsarlov.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" Halloween special \"Treehouse of Horror XVI\" contained a segment \"Survival of the Fattest\" which parodied the story closely. In this segment Mr. Burns invited much of the cast to his hunting lodge on a private island only to reveal that he intended to hunt them all for sport. Another episode makes a reference to \"The Most Dangerous Game\" when Rainier Wolfcastle says that he bought a YMCA to demolish it and install a hunting ground dedicated to \"hunt the most dangerous animal of all...

Percival on \"The law of thought\". Its basic premise is that thinking creates karma or destiny. The book shows how to perfect our thinking and learn how to think without creating thoughts.\n\nThe book is based on what Percival called “The law of thought.” It was produced over a period of 34 years and has 14 chapters, each with sections. Percival also provides succinct definitions of many words, from Accident and Alcoholism to Wrong, as they are used in his book. In \"Thinking and Destiny\" he offers a complete cosmology of the universe, with ideas such as the universe having nature and intelligent sides. Percival defines the nature side of the universe, in part, as an unintelligent mechanism through which units that are conscious only as their functions become self-conscious intelligences by means of what he termed “The Eternal Order of Progression.”\n\nIn \"Thinking and Destiny\", Percival explains how all of life’s lessons are the result of our own thinking and can be used to learn what to do and what not to do, and that we can perfect our thinking and learn how to think without creating thoughts. Thinking without creating thoughts is said to be the way to stop creating karma or destiny. Thinking is shown to be the cause and solution to reincarnation, otherwise known as the wheel of birth, life and death. Percival leaves it to the reader to choose what to do with the often startling information provided and assures that the lessons will be learned eventually.\n\nIn his Foreword to the book, the author explained that his experiences of being “conscious of Consciousness” allowed him to focus the Conscious Light within on subjects to see their essence. He further stated that the book was dictated because it was difficult to do this kind of thinking and write at the same time. While the contents of \"Thinking and Destiny\" are from no other book or body of authority, he indicated that the authority for the truth in the book is in the reader who can judge the statements by the truth that is in him or her. To be able to think in this concentrated way and to be “conscious of Consciousness” are shown to be potentially within the grasp of all humans.\n\nIn a postscript to \"Thinking and Destiny\" it is stated that the most one person can do for another is to tell him or her that there is the Great Way, as shown in the book. The Great Way is how and where the human body is transformed into an immortal body. The author offers specific information for the few who really want it, and shows why each person must do the work in life, not after death. The individual will embrace the ideas or put them off, but death remains the cost of life until conscious immortality is attained. The truth is faced as a matter of honesty and courage.\n\nIn 1950 Harold W. Percival established The Word Foundation, Inc., a non-profit organization, to keep \"Thinking and Destiny\" and all of his other works in print and to share with the people of the world what he called “the royal good news” about the doer said to be indwelling in every human body. Three of his other books expanded on themes from \"Thinking and Destiny\". They are: \"Man and Woman and Child, Democracy Is Self-Government, and Masonry and Its Symbols.\"\n\n\n\"Thinking and Destiny\", by Harold W. Percival, was originally published by The Word Publishing Company, New York in 1946 and is now in its fourteenth printing. Its subtitle is: “With a Brief Account of the Descent of Man into this Human World, and, How He Will Return to the Eternal Order of Progression.” To support the text, Percival included sections for Symbols, Illustrations and Charts and Definitions of Terms and Phrases as they are used in the book.\n\nPercival’s works were noted as a major influence upon Richard Matheson, the famous author and screenwriter. He said that his book The Path was based largely on \"Thinking and Destiny\".\n\nIn the book, \"The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Exalted Self\", 1999, by Owen Slight, the author states that Harold W. Percival’s \"Thinking and Destiny\", like the Bhagavad Gita, reveals relevant, instructive and long lasting lessons regarding the higher self and the human plight—long lost lessons of everlasting truth contained both in the Sanskrit \"Bhagavad Gita\" and \"Thinking and Destiny\". Both books contain complete systems of knowledge. The plight of Arjuna is shown by Percival to be our own.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15204099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15204099", "title": "Tweedie distribution", "text": "Tweedie distribution\n\nIn probability and statistics, the Tweedie distributions are a family of probability distributions which include the purely continuous normal and gamma distributions, the purely discrete scaled Poisson distribution, and the class of mixed compound Poisson–gamma distributions which have positive mass at zero, but are otherwise continuous. For any random variable \"Y\" that obeys a Tweedie distribution, the variance var(\"Y\") relates to the mean E(\"Y\") by the power law,\n\nwhere \"a\" and \"p\" are positive constants.\n\nThe Tweedie distributions were named by Bent Jørgensen after Maurice Tweedie, a statistician and medical physicist at the University of Liverpool, UK, who presented the first thorough study of these distributions in 1984.\n\nThe Tweedie distributions include a number of familiar distributions as well as some unusual ones, each being specified by the domain of the index parameter. We have the \n\nFor 0 < \"p\" < 1 no Tweedie model exists.\n\nTweedie distributions are a special case of exponential dispersion models, a class of models used to describe error distributions for the generalized linear model. The term \"exponential dispersion model\" refers to the exponential form that these models take, evident from the canonical equation used to describe the distribution \"P\" of the random variable \"Z\" on the measurable sets \"A\",\n\nwith the interrelated measures \"ν\". \"θ\" is the canonical parameter; the cumulant function is\n\n\"λ\" is the index parameter; and \"z\" the canonical statistic. This equation represents a family of exponential dispersion models ED(\"θ\",\"λ\") that are completely determined by the parameters \"θ\" and \"λ\" and the cumulant function.\n\nThe models just described are additive models with the property that the distribution of the sum of independent random variables,\n\nfor which \"Z\" ~ ED(\"θ\",\"λ\") with fixed \"θ\" and various \"λ\" are members of the family of distributions with the same \"θ\",\n\nA second class of exponential dispersion models exists designated by the random variable\n\nwhere \"σ\" = 1/\"λ\", known as reproductive exponential dispersion models. They have the property that for \"n\" independent random variables \"Y\" ~ ED(\"μ\",\"σ\"/\"w\"), with weighting factors \"w\" and\n\na weighted average of the variables gives,\n\nFor reproductive models the weighted average of independent random variables with fixed \"μ\" and \"σ\" and various values for \"w\" is a member of the family of distributions with same \"μ\" and \"σ\".\n\nThe Tweedie exponential dispersion models are both additive and reproductive; we thus have the \"duality transformation\"\n\nA third property of the Tweedie models is that they are scale invariant: For a reproductive exponential dispersion model ED(\"μ\",\"σ\") and any positive constant \"c\" we have the property of closure under scale transformation,\n\nwhere the index parameter \"p\" is a real-valued unitless constant. With this transformation the new variable \"Y’\" = \"cY\" belongs to the family of distributions with fixed \"μ\" and \"σ\" but different values of \"c\".\n\nTo define the variance function for exponential dispersion models we make use of the mean value mapping, the relationship between the canonical parameter \"θ\" and the mean \"μ\". It is defined by the function\n\nThe variance function \"V\"(\"μ\") is constructed from the mean value mapping,\n\nHere the minus exponent in \"τ\"(\"μ\") denotes an inverse function rather than a reciprocal. The mean and variance of an additive random variable is then E(\"Z\") = \"λμ\" and var(\"Z\")=λV(\"μ\").\n\nScale invariance implies that the variance function obeys the relationship \n\"V\"(\"μ\") = \"μ\".\n\nThe properties of exponential dispersion models give us two differential equations. The first relates the mean value mapping and the variance function to each other,\n\nThe second shows how the mean value mapping is related to the cumulant function,\n\nThese equations can be solved to obtain the cumulant function for different cases of the Tweedie models. A cumulant generating function (CGF) may then be obtained from the cumulant function. The additive CGF is generally specified by the equation\n\nand the reproductive CGF by\n\nwhere \"s\" is the generating function variable.\n\nThe cumulant functions for specific values of the index parameter \"p\" are\n\nwhere \"α\" is the Tweedie exponent\n\nFor the additive Tweedie models the CGFs take the form,\n\nand for the reproductive models,\n\nThe additive and reproductive Tweedie models are conventionally denoted by the symbols \"Tw\"(\"θ\",\"λ\") and \"Tw\"(\"θ\",\"σ\"), respectively.\n\nThe first and second derivatives of the CGFs, with \"s\" = 0, yields the mean and variance, respectively. One can thus confirm that for the additive models the variance relates to the mean by the power law,\n\nThe Tweedie exponential dispersion models are fundamental in statistical theory consequent to their roles as foci of convergence for a wide range of statistical processes. Jørgensen \"et al\" proved a theorem that specifies the asymptotic behaviour of variance functions known as the Tweedie convergence theorem\". This theorem, in technical terms, is stated thus: The unit variance function is regular of order \"p\" at zero (or infinity) provided that \"V\"(\"μ\") ~ \"c\"\"μ\" for \"μ\" as it approaches zero (or infinity) for all real values of \"p\" and \"c\" > 0. Then for a unit variance function regular of order \"p\" at either zero or infinity and for\n\nfor any formula_23, and formula_24 we have\n\nas formula_26 or formula_27, respectively, where the convergence is through values of \"c\" such that \"cμ\" is in the domain of \"θ\" and \"c\"/\"σ\" is in the domain of \"λ\". The model must be infinitely divisible as \"c\" approaches infinity.\n\nIn nontechnical terms this theorem implies that any exponential dispersion model that asymptotically manifests a variance-to-mean power law is required to have a variance function that comes within the domain of attraction of a Tweedie model. Almost all distribution functions with finite cumulant generating functions qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form. Hence many probability distributions have variance functions that express this asymptotic behavior, and the Tweedie distributions become foci of convergence for a wide range of data types.\n\nTaylor's law is an empirical law in ecology that relates the variance of the number of individuals of a species per unit area of habitat to the corresponding mean by a power-law relationship. For the population count \"Y\" with mean \"µ\" and variance var(\"Y\"), Taylor’s law is written,\n\nwhere \"a\" and \"p\" are both positive constants. Since L. R. Taylor described this law in 1961 there have been many different explanations offered to explain it, ranging from animal behavior, a random walk model, a stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model, to a consequence of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. No consensus exists as to an explanation for this model.\n\nSince Taylor’s law is mathematically identical to the variance-to-mean power law that characterizes the Tweedie models, it seemed reasonable to use these models and the Tweedie convergence theorem to explain the observed clustering of animals and plants associated with Taylor’s law. The majority of the observed values for the power-law exponent \"p\" have fallen in the interval (1,2) and so the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution would seem applicable. Comparison of the empirical distribution function to the theoretical compound Poisson–gamma distribution has provided a means to verify consistency of this hypothesis.\n\nWhereas conventional models for Taylor’s law have tended to involve \"ad hoc\" animal behavioral or population dynamic assumptions, the Tweedie convergence theorem would imply that Taylor’s law results from a general mathematical convergence effect much as how the central limit theorem governs the convergence behavior of certain types of random data. Indeed, any mathematical model, approximation or simulation that is designed to yield Taylor’s law (on the basis of this theorem) is required to converge to the form of the Tweedie models.\n\nPink noise, or 1/\"f\" noise, refers to a pattern of noise characterized by a power-law relationship between its intensities \"S\"(\"f\") at different frequencies \"f\",\n\nwhere the dimensionless exponent \"γ\" ∈ [0,1]. It is found within a diverse number of natural processes. Many different explanations for 1/\"f\" noise exist, a widely held hypothesis is based on Self-organized criticality where dynamical systems close to a critical point are thought to manifest scale-invariant spatial and/or temporal behavior.\n\nIn this subsection a mathematical connection between 1/\"f\" noise and the Tweedie variance-to-mean power law will be described. To begin, we first need to introduce self-similar processes: For the sequence of numbers\n\nwith mean\n\ndeviations\n\nvariance\n\nand autocorrelation function\n\nwith lag \"k\", if the autocorrelation of this sequence has the long range behavior\n\nas \"k\" and where \"L\"(\"k\") is a slowly varying function at large values of \"k\", this sequence is called a self-similar process.\n\nThe method of expanding bins can be used to analyze self-similar processes. Consider a set of equal-sized non-overlapping bins that divides the original sequence of \"N\" elements into groups of \"m\" equal-sized segments (\"N/m\" is integer) so that new reproductive sequences, based on the mean values, can be defined:\n\nThe variance determined from this sequence will scale as the bin size changes such that\n\nif and only if the autocorrelation has the limiting form\n\nOne can also construct a set of corresponding additive sequences\n\nbased on the expanding bins,\n\nProvided the autocorrelation function exhibits the same behavior, the additive sequences will obey the relationship\n\nSince formula_42 and formula_43 are constants this relationship constitutes a variance-to-mean power law, with \"p\" = 2 - \"d\".\n\nThe biconditional relationship above between the variance-to-mean power law and power law autocorrelation function, and the Wiener–Khinchin theorem imply that any sequence that exhibits a variance-to-mean power law by the method of expanding bins will also manifest 1/\"f\" noise, and vice versa. Moreover, the Tweedie convergence theorem, by virtue of its central limit-like effect of generating distributions that manifest variance-to-mean power functions, will also generate processes that manifest 1/\"f\" noise. The Tweedie convergence theorem thus provides an alternative explanation for the origin of 1/\"f\" noise, based its central limit-like effect.\n\nMuch as the central limit theorem requires certain kinds of random processes to have as a focus of their convergence the Gaussian distribution and thus express white noise, the Tweedie convergence theorem requires certain non-Gaussian processes to have as a focus of convergence the Tweedie distributions that express 1/\"f\" noise.\n\nFrom the properties of self-similar processes, the power-law exponent \"p\" = 2 - \"d\" is related to the Hurst exponent \"H\" and the fractal dimension \"D\" by\n\nA one-dimensional data sequence of self-similar data may demonstrate a variance-to-mean power law with local variations in the value of \"p\" and hence in the value of \"D\". When fractal structures manifest local variations in fractal dimension, they are said to be multifractals. Examples of data sequences that exhibit local variations in \"p\" like this include the eigenvalue deviations of the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary Ensembles. The Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution has served to model multifractality based on local variations in the Tweedie exponent \"α\". Consequently, in conjunction with the variation of \"α\", the Tweedie convergence theorem can be viewed as having a role in the genesis of such multifractals.\n\nThe variation of \"α\" has been found to obey the asymmetric Laplace distribution in certain cases. This distribution has been shown to be a member of the family of geometric Tweedie models, that manifest as limiting distributions in a convergence theorem for geometric dispersion models.\n\nRegional organ blood flow has been traditionally assessed by the injection of radiolabelled polyethylene microspheres into the arterial circulation of animals, of a size that they become entrapped within the microcirculation of organs. The organ to be assessed is then divided into equal-sized cubes and the amount of radiolabel within each cube is evaluated by liquid scintillation counting and recorded. The amount of radioactivity within each cube is taken to reflect the blood flow through that sample at the time of injection. It is possible to evaluate adjacent cubes from an organ in order to additively determine the blood flow through larger regions. Through the work of J B Bassingthwaighte and others an empirical power law has been derived between the relative dispersion of blood flow of tissue samples (\"RD\" = standard deviation/mean) of mass \"m\" relative to reference-sized samples:\n\nThis power law exponent \"D\" has been called a fractal dimension. Bassingthwaighte’s power law can be shown to directly relate to the variance-to-mean power law. Regional organ blood flow can thus be modelled by the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution., In this model tissue sample could be considered to contain a random (Poisson) distributed number of entrapment sites, each with gamma distributed blood flow. Blood flow at this microcirculatory level has been observed to obey a gamma distribution, thus providing support for this hypothesis.\n\nThe \"experimental cancer metastasis assay\" has some resemblance to the above method to measure regional blood flow. Groups of syngeneic and age matched mice are given intravenous injections of equal-sized aliquots of suspensions of cloned cancer cells and then after a set period of time their lungs are removed and the number of cancer metastases enumerated within each pair of lungs. If other groups of mice are injected with different cancer cell clones then the number of metastases per group will differ in accordance with the metastatic potentials of the clones. It has been long recognized that there can be considerable intraclonal variation in the numbers of metastases per mouse despite the best attempts to keep the experimental conditions within each clonal group uniform. This variation is larger than would be expected on the basis of a Poisson distribution of numbers of metastases per mouse in each clone and when the variance of the number of metastases per mouse was plotted against the corresponding mean a power law was found.\n\nThe variance-to-mean power law for metastases was found to also hold for spontaneous murine metastases and for cases series of human metastases. \nSince hematogenous metastasis occurs in direct relationship to regional blood flow and videomicroscopic studies indicate that the passage and entrapment of cancer cells within the circulation appears analogous to the microsphere experiments it seemed plausible to propose that the variation in numbers of hematogenous metastases could reflect heterogeneity in regional organ blood flow. \nThe blood flow model was based on the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution, a distribution governing a continuous random variable. For that reason in the metastasis model it was assumed that blood flow was governed by that distribution and that the number of regional metastases occurred as a Poisson process for which the intensity was directly proportional to blood flow. This led to the description of the Poisson negative binomial (PNB) distribution as a discrete equivalent to the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution. The probability generating function for the PNB distribution is\n\nThe relationship between the mean and variance of the PNB distribution is then\n\nwhich, in the range of many experimental metastasis assays, would be indistinguishable from the variance-to-mean power law. For sparse data, however, this discrete variance-to-mean relationship would behave more like that of a Poisson distribution where the variance equaled the mean.\n\nThe local density of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within the human genome, as well as that of genes, appears to cluster in accord with the variance-to-mean power law and the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution. In the case of SNPs their observed density reflects the assessment techniques, the availability of genomic sequences for analysis, and the nucleotide heterozygosity. The first two factors reflect ascertainment errors inherent to the collection methods, the latter factor reflects an intrinsic property of the genome.\n\nIn the coalescent model of population genetics each genetic locus has its own unique history. Within the evolution of a population from some species some genetic loci could presumably be traced back to a relatively recent common ancestor whereas other loci might have more ancient genealogies. More ancient genomic segments would have had more time to accumulate SNPs and to experience recombination. R R Hudson has proposed a model where recombination could cause variation in the time to most common recent ancestor for different genomic segments. A high recombination rate could cause a chromosome to contain a large number of small segments with less correlated genealogies.\n\nAssuming a constant background rate of mutation the number of SNPs per genomic segment would accumulate proportionately to the time to the most recent common ancestor. Current population genetic theory would indicate that these times would be gamma distributed, on average. The Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution would suggest a model whereby the SNP map would consist of multiple small genomic segments with the mean number of SNPs per segment would be gamma distributed as per Hudson’s model.\n\nThe distribution of genes within the human genome also demonstrated a variance-to-mean power law, when the method of expanding bins was used to determine the corresponding variances and means. Similarly the number of genes per enumerative bin was found to obey a Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution. This probability distribution was deemed compatible with two different biological models: the microarrangement model where the number of genes per unit genomic length was determined by the sum of a random number of smaller genomic segments derived by random breakage and reconstruction of protochormosomes. These smaller segments would be assumed to carry on average a gamma distributed number of genes.\n\nIn the alternative gene cluster model, genes would be distributed randomly within the protochromosomes. Over large evolutionary timescales there would occur tandem duplication, mutations, insertions, deletions and rearrangements that could affect the genes through a stochastic birth, death and immigration process to yield the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution.\n\nBoth these mechanisms would implicate neutral evolutionary processes that would result in regional clustering of genes.\n\nThe Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) consists of complex Hermitian matrices that are invariant under unitary transformations whereas the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) consists of real symmetric matrices invariant under orthogonal transformations. The ranked eigenvalues \"E\" from these random matrices obey Wigner’s semicircular distribution: For a \"N\"×\"N\" matrix the average density for eigenvalues of size \"E\" will be\n\nas \"E\". Integration of the semicircular rule provides the number of eigenvalues on average less than \"E\",\n\nThe ranked eigenvalues can be unfolded, or renormalized, with the equation\n\nThis removes the trend of the sequence from the fluctuating portion. If we look at the absolute value of the difference between the actual and expected cumulative number of eigenvalues\n\nwe obtain a sequence of eigenvalue fluctuations which, using the method of expanding bins, reveals a variance-to-mean power law.\nThe eigenvalue fluctuations of both the GUE and the GOE manifest this power law with the power law exponents ranging between 1 and 2, and they similarly manifest 1/\"f\" noise spectra. These eigenvalue fluctuations also correspond to the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution and they exhibit multifractality.\n\nThe second Chebyshev function \"ψ\"(\"x\") is given by,\n\nwhere the summation extends over all prime powers formula_53 not exceeding \"x\", \"x\" runs over the positive real numbers, and formula_54 is the von Mangoldt function. The function \"ψ\"(\"x\") is related to the prime-counting function \"π\"(\"x\"), and as such provides information with regards to the distribution of prime numbers amongst the real numbers. It is asymptotic to \"x\", a statement equivalent to the prime number theorem and it can also be shown to be related to the zeros of the Riemann zeta function located on the critical strip ρ, where the real part of the zeta zero ρ is between 0 and 1. Then ψ expressed for \"x\" greater than one can be written:\n\nwhere\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis states that the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function all have real part ½. These zeta function zeros are related to the distribution of prime numbers. Schoenfeld has shown that if the Riemann hypothesis is true then\n\nfor all formula_58. If we analyze the Chebyshev deviations Δ(\"n\") on the integers \"n\" using the method of expanding bins and plot the variance versus the mean a variance to mean power law can be demonstrated. Moreover, these deviations correspond to the Tweedie compound Poisson-gamma distribution and they exhibit 1/\"f\" noise.\n\nApplications of Tweedie distributions include:\n\n"}

Points are spent on Attributes, Skills, Qualities and Metaphysics. Drawbacks can be used to gain extra points.\n\nAttributes represent the character's main six abilities, which in this case are three physical attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution; and three mental attributes: Intelligence, Perception, Willpower. Characters also have a variety of Skills, Qualities and Drawbacks to give the character added perks or faults (respectively). Other Qualities and Drawbacks are of a Supernatural sort and are used to designate a character as a particular type of character (be it a Gifted human, a Vampyre, a Spirit, and so on) or detail what sort of magic they can do.\n\nActions are resolved by adding together the character's relevant Attribute, the applicable Skill, and a ten-sided die roll, plus any modifiers for difficulty; if the total is nine or greater, the action succeeds. Gamemasters (called \"Chroniclers\" in \"Classic\", and \"Directors\" in \"Cinematic Unisystem\") are also given tables of successes: characters that get a higher roll than the required nine have bonuses on their final outcome; this table describes how successful they turn out to be, and gives guidelines to figure out the resulting bonuses.\n\n\"Unisystem\" can be divided into two sub-systems: \"Classic\" and \"Cinematic\".\n\"Classic Unisystem\" was developed first and is featured in \"All Flesh Must Be Eaten\", \"\", \"Conspiracy X 2.0\", \"Terra Primate\" and \"WitchCraft\".

This can be proved using the distributive law and the axiom that 1 is the multiplicative identity: for \"x\" real, we have\n\nwhere we used the fact that any real \"x\" times 0 equals 0, implied by cancellation from the equation\n\nIn other words,\n\nso (−1) · \"x\", or −\"x\", is the arithmetic inverse of \"x\".\n\nThe square of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. As a consequence, a product of two negative real numbers is positive.\n\nFor an algebraic proof of this result, start with the equation\n\nThe first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1: it is precisely that number that when added to 1 gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that\n\nThe second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation implies\n\nThe above arguments hold in any ring, a concept of abstract algebra generalizing integers and real numbers.\n\nAlthough there are no real square roots of -1, the complex number \"i\" satisfies \"i\" = −1, and as such can be considered as a square root of −1. The only other complex number who's square is 1 is −\"i\". In the algebra of quaternions, which contain the complex plane, the equation \"x\" = −1 has infinite solutions.\n\nExponentiation of a non-zero real number can be extended to negative integers. We make the definition that \"x\" = , meaning that we define raising a number to the power −1 to have the same effect as taking its reciprocal. This definition is then extended to negative integers preserves the exponential law \"x\"\"x\" = \"x\" for real numbers \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nExponentiation to negative integers can be extended to invertible elements of a ring, by defining \"x\" as the multiplicative inverse of \"x\".\n\n−1 that appears next to functions or matrices does not mean raising them to the power −1 but their inverse functions or inverse matrices. For example, \"f\"(\"x\") is the inverse of \"f\"(\"x\"), or sin(\"x\") is a notation of arcsine function.\n\nMost computer systems represent negative integers using two's complement. In such systems, −1 is represented using a bit pattern of all ones. For example, an 8-bit signed integer using two's complement would represent −1 as the bitstring \"11111111\", or \"FF\" in hexadecimal (base 16). If interpreted as an unsigned integer, the same bitstring of \"n\" ones represents 2 − 1, the largest possible value that \"n\" bits can hold. For example, the 8-bit string \"11111111\" above represents 2 − 1 = 255.\n\nIn some programming languages, when used to index some data types (such as an array), then -1 can be used to identify the very last (or 2nd last) item, depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.\nIf the first item is indexed by 0, then -1 identifies the last item.\nIf the first item is indexed by 1, then -1 identifies the second-to-last item.\n"}
