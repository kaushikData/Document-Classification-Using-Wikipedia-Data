This was the second Hawaii Bowl, and the first time Hawaii and Houston played each other. The game was sponsored by Sheraton Hotels and Resorts.\n\nHouston scored first with a 34-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Kevin Kolb to wide receiver Chad McCullar. David Bell kicked a 21-yard field goal to increase Houston's lead to 10-0. Hawaii got its first points of the game at the end of the first quarter on a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Timmy Chang found wide receiver Clifton Herbert for a 49-yard touchdown pass to make the score 10-10.\n\nRunning back Jackie Battle scored on a 2-yard touchdown run for Houston, as they increased their lead to 17-10. David Bell later kicked a field goal to increase the lead to 20-10. A Hawaii field goal before half time cut the lead to 20-13.\n\nIn the third quarter, running back Michael Brewster Jr. ran in for a touchdown tying the game at 20. Timmy Chang then threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jason Rivers, and Hawaii claimed its first lead of the game at 27-20. Jackie Battle scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and the score was 27-27. Jason Rivers caught a 4-yard touchdown pass to give Hawaii a 34-27 lead. In the fourth quarter, wide receiver Vincent Marshall caught an 81-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 34. The game headed into overtime.\n\nIn overtime, Timmy Chang found Britton Komine for an 11-yard touchdown and a 41-34 Hawaii lead. Houston answered with an Anthony Evans touchdown run. After one overtime period the score was 41-41. On Houston's next possession, Jackie Battle got the handoff, and rushed 4Â yards for a touchdown. The score was now 48-41 Houston. Jason Rivers tied it for Hawaii, by catching a 19-yard touchdown pass. In the third overtime period, Michael Brewster ran in for an 8-yard touchdown. The two-point conversion attempt failed leaving the score 54-48 Hawaii, and giving Houston a chance to win. Houston couldn't score, and that ended up being the final margin.\n\nThe game is also memorable for a fight between both teams that occurred after the game was over. Players from each team got into shouting matches and punches were thrown. Play-by-play announcer Dave Barnett called the ending sad and surprising.\n\n"}

Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic theologians have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the theology of the Eucharist, particularly the transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood. In this example, the bread and wine are considered accidents, since at transubstantiation, they become incidental to the essential substance of body and blood. \n\nIn modern philosophy, an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: property and contingency. Non-essentialism argues that every property is an accident. Modal necessitarianism argues that all properties are essential and no property is an accident.\n\nAristotle made a distinction between the essential and accidental properties of a thing. For example, a chair can be made of wood or metal, but this is accidental to its being a chair: that is, it is still a chair regardless of the material from which it is made. To put this in technical terms, an accident is a property which has no necessary connection to the essence of the thing being described.\n\nTo take another example, all bachelors are unmarried: this is a necessary or essential property of what it means to be a bachelor. A particular bachelor may have brown hair, but this would be a property particular to that individual, and with respect to his bachelorhood it would be an accidental property. And this distinction is independent of experimental verification: even if for some reason all the unmarried men with non-brown hair were killed, and every single existent bachelor had brown hair, the property of having brown hair would still be accidental, since it would still be logically possible for a bachelor to have hair of another color.\n\nThe nine kinds of accidents according to Aristotle are quantity, quality, relation, habitus, time, location, situation (or position), action, and passion (\"being acted on\"). Together with \"substance\", these nine kinds of accidents constitute the ten fundamental categories of Aristotle's ontology.\n\nCatholic theologians such as Thomas Aquinas have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the theology of the Eucharist, particularly the transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood. According to this tradition, the accidents (or \"species\") of the appearance of bread and wine do not change, but the substance changes from bread and wine to the Body and Blood of Christ.\n\nIn modern philosophy, an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: property and contingency. In relation to the first, an accidental property (Greek \"symbebekos\") is at its most basic level a \"property\". The color \"yellow\", \"high value\", \"Atomic Number 79\" are all properties, and are therefore candidates for being accidental. On the other hand, \"gold\", \"platinum\", and \"electrum\" are not properties, and are therefore not classified as accidents.\n\nThere are two opposed philosophical positions that also impact the meaning of this term:\n\n"}

Addresses posted on webpages, Usenet or chat rooms are particularly vulnerable to this. Private e-mail sent between individuals is highly unlikely to be collected, but e-mail sent to a mailing list that is archived and made available via the web, or passed onto a Usenet news server and made public, may eventually be scanned and collected.\n\nDisguising addresses makes it more difficult for people to send e-mail to each other. Many see it as an attempt to fix a symptom rather than solving the real problem of e-mail spam, at the expense of causing problems for innocent users. In addition, there are e-mail address harvesters who have found ways to read the munged email addresses.\n\nThe use of address munging on Usenet is contrary to the recommendations of RFC 1036 governing the format of Usenet posts, which requires a valid e-mail address be supplied in the From: field of the post. In practice, few people follow this recommendation strictly.\n\nDisguising e-mail addresses in a systematic manner (for example, user[at]domain[dot]com) offers little protection. For example, such addresses can be revealed through a simple Google Search.\n\nAny impediment reduces the user's willingness to take the extra trouble to email the user. In contrast, well-maintained e-mail filtering on the user's end does not drive away potential correspondents. No spam filter is 100 percent immune to false positives, however, and the same potential correspondent that would have been deterred by address munging may instead end up wasting time on long letters that will merely disappear into junk mail folders.\n\nFor commercial entities, maintaining contact forms on web pages rather than publicizing e-mail addresses may be one way to ensure that incoming messages are relatively spam-free yet do not get lost. In conjunction with CAPTCHA fields, spam on such comment fields can be reduced to effectively zero, except that non-accessibility of CAPTCHAs bring exactly the same deterrent problems as address munging itself.\n\nAs an alternative to address munging, there are several \"transparent\" techniques that allow people to post a valid e-mail address, but still make it difficult for automated recognition and collection of the address:\n\n\nAn example of munging \"<nowiki>user@example.com</nowiki>\" via client-side scripting would be:\n\nThe use of images and scripts for address obfuscation can cause problems for people using screen readers and users with disabilities,\nand ignores users of text browsers like lynx and w3m, although being transparent means they don't disadvantage non-English speakers that cannot understand the plain text bound to a single language that is part of non-transparent munged addresses or instructions that accompany them.\n\nAccording to a 2003 study by the Center for Democracy and Technology, even the simplest \"transparent name mangling\" of e-mail addresses can be effective.\n\nCommon methods of disguising addresses include:\n\nThe reserved top-level domain .invalid is appended to ensure that a real e-mail address is not inadvertently generated.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3354802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3354802", "title": "Antifeminism", "text": "Antifeminism\n\nAntifeminism (also spelt anti-feminism) is broadly defined as opposition to some or all forms of feminism. This opposition has taken various forms across time and cultures. For example, antifeminists in the late 19th century and early 20th century resisted women's suffrage, while antifeminists in the late 20th century in the United States opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. Others, particularly in the 21st century, see antifeminism as a response to an ideology rooted in hostility towards men.\n\nSociologist Michael Flood argues that an antifeminist ideology rejects at least one of the following general principles of feminism:\n\n\nCanadian sociologists Melissa Blais and Francis Dupuis-DÃ©ri write that antifeminist thought has primarily taken the form of an extreme version of masculinism, in which \"men are in crisis because of the feminization of society\".\n\nThe term \"antifeminist\" is also used to describe public female figures, some of whom (such as Naomi Wolf, Camille Paglia, and Kate Roiphe) define themselves as feminists, based on their opposition to some or all elements of feminist movements. Other feminists label writers such as Christina Hoff Sommers, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Katie Roiphe and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese with this term because of their positions regarding oppression and lines of thought within feminism.\n\nThe meaning of antifeminism has varied across time and cultures, and antifeminism attracts both men and women. Some women, like those in the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League, campaigned against women's suffrage.\n\nMen's studies scholar Michael Kimmel defines antifeminism as \"the opposition to women's equality\". He says that antifeminists oppose \"women's entry into the public sphere, the re-organization of the private sphere, women's control of their bodies, and women's rights generally.\" Kimmel further writes that antifeminist argumentation relies on \"religious and cultural norms\" while proponents of antifeminism advance their cause as a means of \"'saving' masculinity from pollution and invasion\". He argues that antifeminists consider the \"traditional gender division of labor as natural and inevitable, perhaps also divinely sanctioned.\"\n\nSome antifeminists view feminism as a denial of innate differences between the genders, and an attempt to reprogram people against their biological tendencies. Antifeminists also frequently argue that feminism, despite claiming to espouse equality, ignores rights issues unique to men. Some believe that the feminist movement has achieved its aims and now seeks higher status for women than for men via special rights and exemptions, such as female-only scholarships, affirmative action, and gender quotas.\n\nSome antifeminists have argued that feminism has resulted in changes to society's previous norms relating to sexuality, which they see as detrimental to traditional values or conservative religious beliefs. For example, the ubiquity of casual sex and the decline of marriage are mentioned as negative consequences of feminism. Some of these traditionalists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families. Antifeminists argue that a change of women's roles is a destructive force that endangers the family, or is contrary to religious morals. For example, Paul Gottfried maintains that the change of women's roles \"has been a social disaster that continues to take its toll on the family\" and contributed to a \"descent by increasingly disconnected individuals into social chaos\".\n\nThe \"women's movement\" began in 1848, most famously articulated by Elizabeth Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, asking for voting rights and many other rights, such as education, job liberties, marital and property rights, and the right to choose whether to be a mother or not. However, by the end of the century, a cultural counter movement had begun. Janet Chafetz identified in a study 32 first-wave antifeminist movements, including those in the 19th century and early 20th century movements. These countermovements were in response to some women's growing demands, which were perceived as threatening to the standard way of life. Though men were not the only antifeminists, men experienced what some have called a \"crisis of masculinity\" in response to traditional gender roles being challenged. Men's responses to increased feminism varied. Some men even subscribed to feminist ideology, but others went the other direction and became decidedly antifeminist. The men who believed in this model cited religious models and natural law to emphasize women's need to return to the private sphere, in order to separate men and women to keep women from outwardly challenging men in public.\n\nIn the 19th century, one of the major focal points of antifeminism was opposition to women's suffrage, which began as a grassroots movement in 1848 and spanned for 72 years. Opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. In \"Sex in Education: or, a Fair Chance for the Girls\" (1873), Harvard professor Edward Clarke predicted that if women went to college, their brains would grow bigger and heavier, and their wombs would atrophy. Other antifeminists opposed women's entry into the labor force, their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.\n\nThe pro-family movement appeared in the late 19th century, by about 1870. This movement was intended to halt the rising divorce rate and reinforce traditional family values. The National League for the Protection of the Family, formerly known as the Divorce Reform League, took over the movement in 1881. Samuel Dike was one of the founders of the League, and was considered an early expert on divorce. Through his efforts, the League garnered attention from pro-family advocates. It underwent a shift from fighting against divorce to promoting marriage and traditional family. Speaking on behalf of the League in an 1887 address to the Evangelical Alliance Conference, Samuel Dike described the ideal family as having \"one man and one woman, united in wedlock, together with their children\". This movement built the foundation for many pro-family arguments in contemporary antifeminism.\n\nWomen's suffrage was achieved in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working under the influence of male forces. Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves. Arguments employed by antisuffragists at the turn of the century had less to do with a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society. What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.\n\nThere were two reasons antisuffragists opposed women participating in the political realm. Some argued that women were already overburdened. The majority of them, however, argued that a woman's participation in the political realm would hinder her participation in social and civic duties. If they won the right to vote, women would consequently have to align with a particular party, which would destroy her ability to be politically neutral. Antisuffragists feared this would, in fact, hinder their influence with legislative authorities.\n\nIn 1951, two journalists published \"Washington Confidential.\" The novel claimed that Communist leaders used their men and women to recruit a variety of minorities in the nation's capital, such as females, colored males, and homosexual males. The vast popularity of the book caused such a buzz that the Civil Service Commission had to create a \"publicity campaign to improve the image of federal employees\" in hopes to save their federal employees from losing their jobs. This ploy failed once the journalists linked feminism to communism in their novel and ultimately reinforced antifeminism by implying that defending the \"white, Christian, heterosexual, patriarchal family\" was the only way to oppose communism.\n\nThe Equal Rights Amendment is a perennially proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would grant equal rights and opportunities to every citizen of the United States, regardless of his or her sex. In 1950 and 1953, ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as \"the Hayden rider\", making it unacceptable to ERA supporters. The Hayden rider was included to keep special protections for women. A new section to the ERA was added, stating: \"The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex.\" That is, women could keep their existing and future special protections that men did not have. By 1972, the amendment was supported by both major parties and was immensely popular. However, it was defeated in Congress when it failed to get the vote of thirty-eight legislatures by 1982. Supporters of an unaltered ERA rejected the Hayden rider, believing an ERA containing the rider did not provide for equality.\n\nJerome Himmelstein identified two main theories about the appeal of antifeminism and its role in opposition to the ERA. One theory is that it was a clash between upper-class liberal voters and the older, more conservative lower-class rural voters who often serve as the center for right-wing movements; in other words, this theory identifies particular social classes as more inherently friendly to antifeminism. Another theory holds that women who feel vulnerable and dependent on men are likely to oppose anything that threatens that tenuous stability; under this view, while educated, independent career women may support feminism, housewives who lack such resources are more drawn to antifeminism. Himmelstein, however, says both views are at least partially wrong, arguing that the primary dividing line between feminists and antifeminists is cultural rather than stemming from differences in economic and social status. There are, in fact, similarities between income between activists on both sides of the ERA debate. As it turned out, the most indicative factors when predicting ERA position, especially among women, were race, marital status, age, and education. ERA opposition was much higher among white, married, older, and less educated citizens. Women who opposed the ERA tended to fit characteristics consistent with the Religious Right.\n\nVal Burris, meanwhile, says that high-income men opposed the amendment because they would gain the least with it being passed; that those men had the most to lose, since the ratification of the ERA would mean more competition for their jobs and possibly a lowered self-esteem. Because of the support of antifeminism from conservatives and the constant \"conservative reactions to liberal social politics\", such as the New Deal attacks, the attack on the ERA has been called a \"right-wing backlash\". Their methods include actions such as \"insults proffered in emails or on the telephone, systematic denigration of feminism in the media, Internet disclosure of confidential information (e.g. addresses) on resources for battered women\" and more.\n\nAbortion remains one of the most controversial topics in the United States. \"Roe v. Wade\" was passed in 1973, and abortion was utilized by many antifeminists to rally supporters. Antiabortion views helped further several right-wing movements, including explicit antifeminism, and helped right-wing politicians rise to power. Antiabortion writings, as well as conservative commentary in the late 20th century criticized the selfishness and self-centeredness of the feminist movement regarding abortions.\n\nSome current antifeminist practices can be traced back to the rise of the religious right in the late 1970s. BBC and \"Time\", among others, have covered the 2014 social media trend #WomenAgainstFeminism. These antifeminists contend that feminism demonizes men (misandry) and that women are not oppressed in 21st century Western countries.\n\nBritish newspaper \"The Guardian\" and the website Jezebel have also reported on an increasing number of women and female celebrities rejecting feminism and instead subscribing to humanism. As a response to a pro-feminism speech by Australian Labor Senator Penny Wong, several women who identify as being humanist and antifeminist argued in an article for the \"Guardian\" that feminism is a discriminatory ideology and continues to portray women as victims.\n\nIn response to the social media trend, modern day feminists also began to upload similar pictures to websites such as Twitter and Tumblr. Most used the same hashtag, \"womenagainstfeminism\", but instead made satirical and bluntly parodic comments. In November 2014, \"Time\" magazine included \"feminist\" on its annual list of proposed banished words. After initially receiving the majority of votes (51%), a \"Time\" editor apologized for including the word in the poll and removed it from the results.\n\nFounded in the U.S. by Phyllis Schlafly in 1972, Stop ERA, now known as \"Eagle Forum\", lobbied successfully to block the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment in the U.S. It was also Schlafly who forged links between Stop ERA and other conservative organizations, as well as single-issue groups against abortion, pornography, gun control, and unions. By integrating Stop ERA with the thus-dubbed \"new right\", she was able to leverage a wider range of technological, organizational and political resources, successfully targeting pro-feminist candidates for defeat.\n\nIn India, the Save Indian Family Foundation is an antifeminist organization opposed to a number of laws that they claim to have been used against men.\n\nThe Concerned Women of America (CWA) are also an antifeminist organization. Like other conservative women's groups, they oppose abortion and same-sex marriage and make appeals for maternalism and biological differences between women and men.\n\nThe Independent Women's Forum (IWF) is another antifeminist, conservative, women-oriented group. It's younger and less established than the CWA, though the two organizations are often discussed in relation to each other. It was founded to take on the \"old feminist establishment\". Both of these organizations pride themselves on rallying women who do not identify with feminist rhetoric together. These organizations frame themselves as being by women, for women, in order to fight the idea that feminism is the only women-oriented ideology. These organizations chastise feminists for presuming to universally speak for all women. The IWF claims to be \"the voice of \"reasonable\" women with important ideas who embrace common sense over divisive ideology\".\n\nThe alt-right movement is antifeminist.\n\nAccording to Amherst College sociology professor Jerome L. Himmelstein, antifeminism is rooted in social stigmas against feminism and is thus a purely reactionary movement. Himmelstein identifies two prevailing theories that seek to explain the origins of antifeminism: the first theory, proposed by Himmelstein, is that conservative opposition in the abortion and Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) debates has created a climate of hostility toward the entire feminist movement. The second theory Himmelstein identifies states that the female antifeminists who lead the movement are largely married, low education, and low personal income women who embody the \"insecure housewife scenario\" and seek to perpetuate their own situation in which women depend on men for fiscal support. However, numerous studies have failed to correlate the aforementioned demographic factors with support for antifeminism, and only religiosity correlates positively with antifeminist alignment. Thus, Himmelstein concludes that antifeminism is a conservative religious reaction against the progress of modern feminism.\n\nAuthors Janet Saltzman Chafetz and Anthony Gary Dworkin, writing for \"Gender and Society\", argue that the organizations most likely to formally organize against feminism are religious. This is because women's movements may demand access to male-dominated positions within the religious sector, like the clergy, and women's movements threaten male-oriented values of some religions. The more successful a feminist movement is in challenging the authority of male-dominated groups, the more these groups will organize a countermovement.\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago sociology professor Danielle Giffort argues that the stigma against feminism created by antifeminists has resulted in organizations that practice \"implicit feminism\", which she defines as the \"strategy practiced by feminist activists within organizations that are operating in an anti- and post-feminist environment in which they conceal feminist identities and ideas while emphasizing the more socially acceptable angles of their efforts\". Due to the stigma against feminism, some activists, such as those involved with Girls Rock, may take the principles of feminism as a foundation of thought and teach girls and women independence and self-reliance without explicitly labeling it with the stigmatized brand of feminism. Thus, most women continue to practice feminism in terms of seeking equality and independence for women, yet avoid the label.\n\nAntifeminism might be motivated by the belief that feminist theories of patriarchy and disadvantages suffered by women in society are incorrect or exaggerated; that feminism as a movement encourages misandry and results in harm or oppression of men; or driven by general opposition towards women's rights.\n\nIn a study of 126 American students, antifeminist men were found to value their own power more than nonfeminist or feminist men did. Antifeminist women were not found to have the same difference from other women, suggesting some men may oppose feminism because they fear losing their power or sense of power in society.\n\n\n"}

The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a line graph.\n\nA bar graph shows comparisons among discrete categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one, showing the values of more than one measured variable.\n\nMany sources consider William Playfair (1759-1824) to have invented the bar chart and the \"Exports and Imports of Scotland to and from different parts for one Year from Christmas 1780 to Christmas 1781\" graph from his \"The Commercial and Political Atlas\" to be the first bar chart in history. Diagrams of the velocity of a constantly accelerating object against time published in \"The Latitude of Forms\" (attributed to Jacobus de Sancto Martino or, perhaps, to Nicole Oresme) about 300 years before can be interpreted as \"proto bar charts\".\n\nBar charts have a discrete domain of categories, and are usually scaled so that all the data can fit on the chart. When there is no natural ordering of the categories being compared, bars on the chart may be arranged in any order. Bar charts arranged from highest to lowest incidence are called Pareto charts. \nBar graphs/charts provide a visual presentation of categorical data. Categorical data is a grouping of data into discrete groups, such as months of the year, age group, shoe sizes, and animals. These categories are usually qualitative. In a column bar chart, the categories appear along the horizontal axis; the height of the bar corresponds to the value of each category.\n\nBar graphs can also be used for more complex comparisons of data with grouped bar charts and stacked bar charts. In a grouped bar chart, for each categorical group there are two or more bars. These bars are color-coded to represent a particular grouping. For example, a business owner with two stores might make a grouped bar chart with different colored bars to represent each store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical axis would show the revenue. \nAlternatively, a stacked bar chart could be used. The stacked bar chart stacks bars that represent different groups on top of each other. The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of the groups. However, stacked bar charts are not suited to datasets where some groups have negative values. In such cases, grouped bar chart are preferable.\n\nGrouped bar graphs usually present the information in the same order in each grouping. Stacked bar graphs present the information in the same sequence on each bar.\n\n\n"}

It was first coined in 1853 by Daniel Deniehy who made a speech lambasting the attempt by William Wentworth to establish a titled aristocracy in the New South Wales government. This speech came to be known as the \"Bunyip Aristocracy speech\".\n\nDeniehy made speeches opposing the new self-titled Australian aristocracy in the Victorian theatre and on the soapbox at Circular Quay.\n\nIn response to Wentworth's proposal to create a hereditary peerage in New South Wales, Deniehy's satirical comments included: \"\"Here, we all know the common water mole was transferred into the duck-billed platypus, and in some distant emulation of this degeneration, I suppose we are to be favoured with a \"bunyip aristocracy.\"\" (The bunyip is an Ancestral Being of Aboriginal Dreaming.) Deniehy's ridicule caused the idea to be dropped.\n\nAmong those singled out in his speech by Deniehy was James MacArthur (1798â1867), the son of John MacArthur, who had been nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1839 and was later (1859) elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (the lower house was only created in 1856): \"Next came the native aristocrat James MacArthur, he would he supposed, aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of Camden, and he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green, and emblazoned on this field should be a rum keg of a New South Wales order of chivalry.\"\n\nThe strong popular support for Deniehy's views caused the abandonment of the proposal to which he was responding. It probably also delayed the introduction of an Australian honours system. The Order of Australia was not introduced until 1975. Until that time Australians were awarded British honours.\n\n'Bunyip aristocracy' is now a pejorative term for those Australians who consider themselves to be aristocrats.\n\n\"Note: Deniehy had a habit of writing speeches and articles that addressed himself in the third person\"\n\nA Committee, consisting of Messrs.

The Bill was reported 28 July 1853. It was almost universally condemned by the people and a large public meeting was called to oppose it. In the advertisement convening the meeting were the following paragraphs :\nThe meeting was addressed by Sir Henry Parkes and other Liberals, and the result of the agitation was that the most objectionable clause, to create an hereditary colonial peerage, was struck out.\n\n"}

Freud himself wrote of \"interest (Besetzung)\", in an early letter to Ernest Jones.\n\nPeter Gay objected that Strachey's use of cathexis was an unnecessarily esoteric replacement for Freud's use of \"Besetzung\" â \"a word from common German speech rich in suggestive meanings, among them 'occupation' (by troops) and 'charge' (of electricity)\".\n\nFreud defined cathexis as an investment of libido, pointing out for example how dream thoughts were cathected with different amounts of affect. A cathexis or emotional charge might be positive or negative, leading some of his followers to speak as well of a cathexis of mortido. Freud called a group of cathected ideas a complex.\n\nFreud frequently described the functioning of psychosexual energies in quasi-physical terms, representing frustration of libidinal desires, for example, as a blockage of (cathected) energies which would eventually build up and require release in alternative ways. This release could occur, for example, by way of regression and the \"re-cathecting\" of former positions or fixations, or the autoerotic enjoyment (in phantasy) of former sexual objects: \"object-cathexes\".\n\nFreud used the term \"anti-cathexis\" or counter-charge to describe how the ego blocks such regressive efforts to discharge one's cathexis: that is, when the ego wishes to repress such desires. Like a steam engine, the libido's cathexis then builds up until it finds alternative outlets, which can lead to sublimation, reaction formation, or the construction of (sometimes disabling) symptoms.\n\nM. Scott Peck distinguishes between love and cathexis, with cathexis being the initial in-love phase of a relationship, and love being the ongoing commitment of care.\n\nFreud saw the early cathexis of objects with libidinal energy as a central aspect of human development. In describing the withdrawal of cathexes which accompanied the mourning process, Freud provided his major contribution to the foundation of object relations theory.\n\nFreud saw thinking as an experimental process involving minimal amounts of cathexis, âin the same way as a general shifts small figures about on a mapâ.\n\nIn delusions, it was the hypercathexis (or over-charging) of ideas previously dismissed as odd or eccentric which he saw as causing the subsequent pathology.\n\nEric Berne raised the possibility that child art often represented the intensity of cathexis invested in an object, rather than its objective form.\n\nCritics charge that the term provides a potentially misleading neurophysiological analogy, which might be applicable to the cathexis of ideas but certainly not of objects.\n\nFurther ambiguity in Freud's usage emerges in the contrast between cathexis as a measurable load of (undifferentiated) libido, and as a qualitatively distinct type of affect â as in a \"cathexis of longing\".\n\n"}

She developed an alternative theory of evolution which acquired a cult following among prominent writers and scientists in the London of the 1970s. They, without exception, remained ignorant of her true identity until after her death.\n\nHajdu was born near Budapest in 1920. In the wake of World War II he moved to England and in 1948 began to use the name Baron Carl Hajdu. In 1956 he collected money for Hungarian freedom fighters resisting the then Soviet occupation. \"The People\", which specialised in lurid exposÃ©s, alleged that Hajdu had pocketed the proceeds. He was found guilty of fraud in 1957, and was forced into bankruptcy.\n\nHajdu then adopted the persona of writer and society hypnotherapist Michel Karoly. He rented an apartment in Mayfair. He began to acquire a following in polite society, and wrote an agony uncle column in a mass-selling magazine of the day. Karoly continued in this role until 1965, when both his wife and stepson suddenly died. He was declared bankrupt again, and in 1966 was sentenced to two months in gaol for acquiring a loan whilst bankrupt.\n\nBy her own account, the sudden deaths had precipitated a profound identity crisis.\n\nIn 1968, Hajdu adopted the new identity of Dr Charlotte Bach, a supposed former lecturer at Budapest's EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University, whose alumni included the philosophers Michael and Karl Polanyi and the mathematician John von Neumann.\n\n'Dr Bach' would openly tell lecture audiences how at first, putting ads in the windows of local newsagents, she had worked as a dominatrix. This experience had provided invaluable research data, she said, for the purpose of compiling a dictionary of psychology. These researches had in turn led to the all-embracing theory.\n\nShe lived full-time as Charlotte Bach until she died. She was thus what is sometimes referred to as a \"non-op trans woman\".\n\nIn 1971 Bach unveiled her transformative, as she would insist, theory of evolution. Among other things, she argued, it correctly displaced Darwinism in favour of Lamarckism. Drawing heavily on the work of animal ethologists such as Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz, she argued that humans experience in varying degrees a pull towards becoming the opposite sex. This urge could either be denied or \"asseverated\": gays and femme lesbians, for example, are women in menâs bodies or vice versa, but transvestites and butch lesbians are not. This gave rise to eight possible permutations.\n\nThis deep-seated and ineradicable phenomenon, she argued, was the true engine of evolutionary change. It was also the key to the proper understanding of cultureâincluding science, politics and religion. Upon such reasoning, backed up by a polymathic accumulation of supporting evidence and a forceful lecturing style, she elaborated what she called the science of Human Ethology.\nEminent scientists who sought to engage with the apparent challenges of Bach's theory included the biologist Brian Goodwin and W. Grey Walter, a pioneer of cybernetics and former head of the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol.\n\nBach attracted the interest in particular of the English writer Colin Wilson, as well as of a number of eminent British scientists and academics. Wilson began to write about her theory. Bach became a cult figure. A small group of followers who would gather at her home at Holly Lodge in Highgate, while weekly lectures would take place elsewhere. An Institute of Human Ethology was set up to promote her ideas and stimulate further research. Her literary executors included the then professor of educational technology at Britain's Open University. She was invited to speak at Sussex University and at Darwin College, Cambridge, named in honour of the man most of whose ideas she wished to consign to the dustbin.\n\nIn due course, leading members of London's then burgeoning Gay Liberation movementâequally ignorant of Bach's true identityâtook up human ethology and started publishing pamphlets of their own, much attracted by the tantalising notion of homosexuals as the vanguard of evolutionary change.\n\nBach continued to elaborate upon her original thesis up to the time of her death in 1981.\n\n\n"}

The earliest \"direct\" evidence of life on Earth are microfossils of microorganisms permineralized in 3.465-billion-year-old Australian Apex chert rocks.\n\nA life form, or lifeform, is an entity or being that is living.\n\nCurrently, Earth remains the only place in the universe known to harbor life forms.\n\nMore than 99% of all species of life forms, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.\n\nSome estimates on the number of Earth's current species of life forms range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described. However, a May 2016 scientific report estimates that 1 trillion species are currently on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described. The total number of DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10 with a weight of 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon.

{"id": "379051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379051", "title": "Equivalence of categories", "text": "Equivalence of categories\n\nIn category theory, an abstract branch of mathematics, an equivalence of categories is a relation between two categories that establishes that these categories are \"essentially the same\". There are numerous examples of categorical equivalences from many areas of mathematics. Establishing an equivalence involves demonstrating strong similarities between the mathematical structures concerned. In some cases, these structures may appear to be unrelated at a superficial or intuitive level, making the notion fairly powerful: it creates the opportunity to \"translate\" theorems between different kinds of mathematical structures, knowing that the essential meaning of those theorems is preserved under the translation.\n\nIf a category is equivalent to the opposite (or dual) of another category then one speaks of\na duality of categories, and says that the two categories are dually equivalent.\n\nAn equivalence of categories consists of a functor between the involved categories, which is required to have an \"inverse\" functor. However, in contrast to the situation common for isomorphisms in an algebraic setting, the composition of the functor and its \"inverse\" is not necessarily the identity mapping. Instead it is sufficient that each object be \"naturally isomorphic\" to its image under this composition. Thus one may describe the functors as being \"inverse up to isomorphism\". There is indeed a concept of isomorphism of categories where a strict form of inverse functor is required, but this is of much less practical use than the \"equivalence\" concept.\n\nFormally, given two categories \"C\" and \"D\", an \"equivalence of categories\" consists of a functor \"F\" : \"C\" â \"D\", a functor \"G\" : \"D\" â \"C\", and two natural isomorphisms Îµ: \"FG\"âI and Î· : Iâ\"GF\". Here \"FG\": \"D\"â\"D\" and \"GF\": \"C\"â\"C\", denote the respective compositions of \"F\" and \"G\", and I: \"C\"â\"C\" and I: \"D\"â\"D\" denote the \"identity functors\" on \"C\" and \"D\", assigning each object and morphism to itself. If \"F\" and \"G\" are contravariant functors one speaks of a \"duality of categories\" instead.\n\nOne often does not specify all the above data. For instance, we say that the categories \"C\" and \"D\" are \"equivalent\" (respectively \"dually equivalent\") if there exists an equivalence (respectively duality) between them. Furthermore, we say that \"F\" \"is\" an equivalence of categories if an inverse functor \"G\" and natural isomorphisms as above exist. Note however that knowledge of \"F\" is usually not enough to reconstruct \"G\" and the natural isomorphisms: there may be many choices (see example below).\n\nA functor \"F\" : \"C\" â \"D\" yields an equivalence of categories if and only if it is simultaneously:\nThis is a quite useful and commonly applied criterion, because one does not have to explicitly construct the \"inverse\" \"G\" and the natural isomorphisms between \"FG\", \"GF\" and the identity functors. On the other hand, though the above properties guarantee the \"existence\" of a categorical equivalence (given a sufficiently strong version of the axiom of choice in the underlying set theory), the missing data is not completely specified, and often there are many choices. It is a good idea to specify the missing constructions explicitly whenever possible.\nDue to this circumstance, a functor with these properties is sometimes called a weak equivalence of categories. (Unfortunately this conflicts with terminology from homotopy type theory.)\n\nThere is also a close relation to the concept of adjoint functors. The following statements are equivalent for functors \"F\" : \"C\" â \"D\" and \"G\" : \"D\" â \"C\":\nOne may therefore view an adjointness relation between two functors as a \"very weak form of equivalence\". Assuming that the natural transformations for the adjunctions are given, all of these formulations allow for an explicit construction of the necessary data, and no choice principles are needed. The key property that one has to prove here is that the \"counit\" of an adjunction is an isomorphism if and only if the right adjoint is a full and faithful functor.\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, an equivalence of categories preserves all \"categorical\" concepts and properties. If \"F\" : \"C\" â \"D\" is an equivalence, then the following statements are all true:\n\nDualities \"turn all concepts around\": they turn initial objects into terminal objects, monomorphisms into epimorphisms, kernels into cokernels, limits into colimits etc.\n\nIf \"F\" : \"C\" â \"D\" is an equivalence of categories, and \"G\" and \"G\" are two inverses of \"F\", then \"G\" and \"G\" are naturally isomorphic.\n\nIf \"F\" : \"C\" â \"D\" is an equivalence of categories, and if \"C\" is a preadditive category (or additive category, or abelian category), then \"D\" may be turned into a preadditive category (or additive category, or abelian category) in such a way that \"F\" becomes an additive functor. On the other hand, any equivalence between additive categories is necessarily additive. (Note that the latter statement is not true for equivalences between preadditive categories.)\n\nAn auto-equivalence of a category \"C\" is an equivalence \"F\" : \"C\" â \"C\". The auto-equivalences of \"C\" form a group under composition if we consider two auto-equivalences that are naturally isomorphic to be identical. This group captures the essential \"symmetries\" of \"C\". (One caveat: if \"C\" is not a small category, then the auto-equivalences of \"C\" may form a proper class rather than a set.)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "178362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178362", "title": "Ethical code", "text": "Ethical code\n\nEthical codes are adopted by organizations to assist members in understanding the difference between 'right' and 'wrong' and in applying that understanding to their decisions. An ethical code generally implies documents at three levels: codes of business ethics, codes of conduct for employees, and codes of professional practice.\n\nMany companies use the phrases \"ethical code\" and \"code of conduct\" interchangeably but it may be useful to make a distinction. A code of ethics will start by setting out the values that underpin the code and will describe a company's obligation to its stakeholders. The code is publicly available and addressed to anyone with an interest in the company's activities and the way it does business. It will include details of how the company plans to implement its values and vision, as well as guidance to staff on ethical standards and how to achieve them. However, a code of conduct is generally addressed to and intended for employees alone. It usually sets out restrictions on behavior, and will be far more compliance or rules focused than value or principle focused.\n\nA code of practice is adopted by a profession or by a governmental or non-governmental organization to regulate that profession. A code of practice may be styled as a code of professional responsibility, which will discuss difficult issues, difficult decisions that will often need to be made, and provide a clear account of what behavior is considered \"ethical\" or \"correct\" or \"right\" in the circumstances. In a membership context, failure to comply with a code of practice can result in expulsion from the professional organization. In its 2007 International Good Practice Guidance, \"Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations\", the International Federation of Accountants provided the following working definition:\n\"Principles, values, standards, or rules of behavior that guide the decisions, procedures and systems of an organization in a way that (a) contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and (b) respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations.\"\n\nListed below are a few example statements from the professional codes of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) and the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ):\n\nEthical codes are often adopted by management, not to promote a particular moral theory, but rather because they are seen as pragmatic necessities for running an organization in a complex society in which moral concepts play an important part.\n\nThey are distinct from moral codes that may apply to the culture, education, and religion of a whole society. It is debated whether the politicians should apply a code of ethics, or whether it is a profession entirely discretionary, just subject to compliance with the law: however, recently codes of practice have been approved in this field.\n\nOften, acts that violate ethical codes may also violate a law or regulation and can be punishable at law or by government agency remedies.\n\nEven organizations and communities that may be considered criminal in nature may have ethical codes of conduct, official or unofficial. Examples could include hacker communities, bands of thieves, and street gangs.\n\nThe Jewish Written Torah and Oral Torah comprise the earliest and best preserved ethical code. Adapted to every field of actual day-to-day life for thousands of years, Jewish Halakha is the oldest collective body of religious laws, laws and jurisdictions still in use.\n\nCodes seek to define and delineate the difference between conduct and behavior that is malum in se, malum prohibitum, and good practice. Sometimes ethical codes include sections that are meant to give firm rules, but some offer general guidance, and sometimes the words are merely aspirational.\n\nIn sum, a code of ethics is an attempt to codify \"good and bad behavior\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13705176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13705176", "title": "Evolution of morality", "text": "Evolution of morality\n\nThe evolution of morality refers to the emergence of human moral behavior over the course of human evolution. Morality can be defined as a system of ideas about right and wrong conduct. In everyday life, morality is typically associated with human behavior, and not much thought is given to the social conducts of other creatures. The emerging fields of evolutionary biology and in particular sociobiology have argued that, though human social behaviors are complex, the precursors of human morality can be traced to the behaviors of many other social animals. Sociobiological explanations of human behavior are still controversial. The traditional view of social scientists has been that morality is a construct, and is thus culturally relative, although others argue that there is a science of morality.\n\nThough other animals may not possess what humans may perceive as moral behavior, all social animals have had to modify or restrain their behaviors for group living to be worthwhile. Typical examples of behavioral modification can be found in the societies of ants, bees and termites. Ant colonies may possess millions of individuals. E. O. Wilson argues that the single most important factor that leads to the success of ant colonies is the existence of a sterile worker caste. This caste of females are subservient to the needs of their mother, the queen, and in so doing, have given up their own reproduction in order to raise brothers and sisters. The existence of sterile castes among these social insects significantly restricts the competition for mating and in the process fosters cooperation within a colony. Cooperation among ants is vital, because a solitary ant has an improbable chance of long-term survival and reproduction. However, as part of a group, colonies can thrive for decades. As a consequence, ants are one of the most successful families of species on the planet, accounting for a biomass that rivals that of the human species.\n\nThe basic reason that social animals live in groups is that opportunities for survival and reproduction are much better in groups than living alone. The social behaviors of mammals are more familiar to humans. Highly social mammals such as primates and elephants have been known to exhibit traits that were once thought to be uniquely human, like empathy and altruism.\n\nHumanityâs closest living relatives are common chimpanzees and bonobos. These primates share a common ancestor with humans who lived four to six million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor. Barbara King argues that while primates may not possess morality in the human sense, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of morality. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for symbolic communication, a sense of social norms, realization of \"self\", and a concept of continuity.\nFrans de Waal and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality.\nMany social animals such as primates, dolphins, and whales have shown to exhibit what Michael Shermer refers to as premoral sentiments. According to Shermer, the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes:\n\nShermer argues that these premoral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that hunt in packs to take down large or dangerous prey.\n\nAll social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place. Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of reciprocity. Chimpanzees remember who did them favors and who did them wrong. For example, chimpanzees are more likely to share food with individuals who have previously groomed them. Vampire bats also demonstrate a sense of reciprocity and altruism. They share blood by regurgitation, but do not share randomly. They are most likely to share with other bats who have shared with them in the past or who are in dire need of feeding.\n\nAnimals such as Capuchin monkeys and dogs also display an understanding of fairness, refusing to co-operate when presented unequal rewards for the same behaviors.\n\nChimpanzees live in fission-fusion groups that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of extant hunter gatherer societies, recent paleolithic hominids lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of social control, conflict resolution and group solidarity. This numerical limit is theorized to be hard coded in our genes since even modern humans have difficulty maintaining stable social relationships with more than 100â200 people. According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Humans enforce their society's moral codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and reputation building. People also apply a degree of judgment and reason not seen in the animal kingdom.\n\nWhile groups may benefit from avoiding certain behaviors, those harmful behaviors have the same effect regardless of whether the offending individuals are aware of them or not. Since the individuals themselves can increase their reproductive success by doing many of them, any characteristics that entail impunity are positively selected by evolution. Specifically punishing individuals aware of their breach of rules would select against the ability to be aware of it, precluding any coevolution of both conscious choice and a sense of it being the basis for moral and penal liability in the same species.\n\nThe social brain hypothesis, detailed by R.I.M Dunbar in the article \"The Social Brain Hypothesis and Its Implications for Social Evolution\", supports the fact that the brain originally evolved to process factual information. The brain allows an individual to recognize patterns, perceive speech, develop strategies to circumvent ecologically-based problems such as foraging for food, and also permits the phenomenon of color vision. Furthermore, having a large brain is a reflection of the large cognitive demands of complex social systems. It is said that in humans and primates the neocortex is responsible for reasoning and consciousness. Therefore, in social animals, the neocortex came under intense selection to increase in size to improve social cognitive abilities. Social animals, such as humans are capable of two important concepts, coalition formation, or group living, and tactical deception, which is a tactic of presenting false information to others. The fundamental importance of animal social skills lies within the ability to manage relationships and in turn, the ability to not just commit information to memory, but manipulate it as well. An adaptive response to the challenges of social interaction and living is theory of mind. Theory of mind as defined by M. Brune, is the ability to infer another individual's mental states or emotions. Having a strong theory of mind is tied closely with possessing advanced social intelligence. Collectively, group living requires cooperation and generates conflict. Social living puts strong evolutionary selection pressures on acquiring social intelligence due to the fact that living in groups has advantages. Advantages to group living include protection from predators and the fact that groups in general outperform the sum of an individualâs performance. But, from an objective point of view, group living also has disadvantages, such as, competition from within the group for resources and mates. This sets the stage for something of an evolutionary arms race from within the species.\n\nWithin populations of social animals, altruism, or acts of behavior that are disadvantageous to one individual while benefiting other group members has evolved. This notion seems to be contradictory to evolutionary thought, due to the fact that an organism's fitness and success is defined by its ability to pass genes on to the next generation. According to E. Fehr, in the article, \"The Nature of Human Altruism\", the evolution of altruism can be accounted for when kin selection and inclusive fitness are taken into account; meaning reproductive success is not just dependent on the number of offspring an individual produces, but also the number of offspring that related individuals produce. Outside of familial relationships altruism is also seen, but in a different manner typically defined by the prisoner's dilemma, theorized by John Nash. The prisoner's dilemma serves to define cooperation and defecting with and against individuals driven by incentive, or in Nash's proposed case, years in jail. In evolutionary terms, the best strategy to use for the prisoner's dilemma is tit-for-tat. In the tit-for-tat strategy, an individual should cooperate as long others are cooperating, and not defect until another individual defects against them. At their core, complex social interactions are driven by the need to distinguish sincere cooperation and defection.\n\nBrune details that theory of mind has been traced back to primates, but it is not observed to the extent that it is in the modern human. The emergence of this unique trait is perhaps where the divergence of the modern human begins, along with our acquisition of language. Humans use metaphors and imply much of what we say. Phrases such as, \"You know what I mean?\" are not uncommon and are direct results of the sophistication of the human theory of mind. Failure to understand another's intentions and emotions can yield inappropriate social responses and are often associated with human mental conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, some forms of dementia, and psychopathy. This is especially true for autism spectrum disorders, where social disconnect is evident, but non-social intelligence can be preserved or even in some cases augmented, such as in the case of a savant. The need for social intelligence surrounding theory of mind is a possible answer to the question as to why morality has evolved as a part of human behavior.\n\nPsychologist Matt J. Rossano muses that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include supernatural agents. By including ever watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups. The adaptive value of religion would have enhanced group survival.\n\nIn an experiment where subjects must demonstrate abstract, complex reasoning, researchers have found that humans (as has been seen in other animals) have a strong innate ability to reason about social exchanges. This ability is believed to be intuitive, since the logical rules do not seem to be accessible to the individuals for use in situations without moral overtones.\n\nDisgust, one of the basic emotions, may have an important role in certain forms of morality. Disgust is argued to be a specific response to certain things or behaviors that are dangerous or undesirable from an evolutionary perspective. One example is things that increase the risk of an infectious disease such as spoiled foods, dead bodies, other forms of microbiological decomposition, a physical appearance suggesting sickness or poor hygiene, and various body fluids such as feces, vomit, phlegm, and blood. Another example is disgust against evolutionary disadvantageous mating such as incest (the incest taboo) or unwanted sexual advances. Still another example are behaviors that may threaten group cohesion or cooperation such as cheating, lying, and stealing. MRI studies have found that such situations activate areas in the brain associated with disgust.\n\n\n"}

Formosan black bears are endemic to Taiwan. In 2001, they were voted the most representative wildlife of Taiwan in a half-year-long countrywide voting campaign. They are also the largest land animals and the only native bears (\"Ursidae\") in Taiwan.\n\nBecause of severe exploitation and habitat degradation in recent decades, populations of wild Formosan black bears have been declining. This species was listed as \"endangered\" under Taiwan's Wildlife Conservation Act (Traditional Chinese: éçåç©ä¿è²æ³) in 1989. Their geographic distribution is restricted to remote, rugged areas at elevations of .\n\nThe Formosan black bear is sturdily built and has a round head, short neck, small eyes, and long snout. Its head measures 26â35Â cm in length and 40â60Â cm in circumference. Its ears are 8â12Â cm long. Its snout resembles a dog's, hence its nickname is \"dog bear\". Its tail is inconspicuous and short â usually less than 10Â cm long. Its body is well covered with rough, glossy, black hair, which can grow over 10Â cm long around the neck. The tip of its chin is white. On the chest, there is a distinctive yellowish or white mark that is shaped like a \"V\" character or a crescent moon. This earns it another nickname â \"moon bear\".\n\nThey feed primarily on leaves, buds, fruits, roots, although they also eat insects, small animals, and carrion. Diets of bears monitored in Yushan National Park include succulent vegetation in spring, soft fruits rich in carbohydrate in summer, and fat-loaded hard mast (e.g., acorn and walnut) in fall/winter.\n\nThe Formosan bear lives in the mountainous forests in the eastern two-thirds of Taiwan at elevations of . In the winter, rather than hibernating like Asiatic black bears in temperate areas, they move to lower elevations to find food. They are active for 54â57% of daylight hours, and more active during summer (60%) and fall/winter (60%) than spring (47%). They are primarily active during the day in the spring and summer; and increasingly active at night in the fall/winter when acorns are abundant. They are solitary and usually move around extensively except during the mating season or when caring for cubs. Formosan bears are also the only bears on the planet that make temporary nests.\n\nAlthough they look clumsy and slow, Formosan black bears can easily outrun humans, reaching speeds of 30â40Â km per hour. They are skilled at swimming and climbing, as well. Because of their endangered species status and their habit of avoiding humans, Formosan black bears are rarely seen in the wild. In most encounters the bear retreats and runs away from humans. Even though bears can be aggressive, they rarely attack humans without provocation.\n\nAs solitary animals, Formosan black bears do not stay in fixed shelters, except for females during their breeding period. The bear's courtship period is very brief. A male trails after a female for a few days. After mating, they return to their solitary lives. Females reach sexual maturity at age 3â4 and males reach sexual maturity at age 4â5, usually one year later than females. Mating is usually from June to August and pregnancy lasts for 6â7 months. Thus, wild females usually give birth between December and the following February.\n\nEach birth produces 1â3 cubs. Cubs will be nursed by mother for about six months. When they are strong enough to leave the den, bear cubs will remain with the mother for approximately two years, until the mother enters the next cycle of estrus and drives the cubs off. This forms the 2-year reproductive cycle of Formosan black bears.\n\nFormosan black bears (å°ç£é»ç) and Formosan clouded leopards (å°ç£é²è±¹) â two of the most powerful land animals on the island of Taiwan â used to roam over the ranges and mountains of Taiwan. However, while the leopard is now extinct, the bear, though endangered, has survived. According to research by the Institute of Wildlife Conservation, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, this may be due to the myths and traditional taboos of Taiwanese aborigines.\n\nBunun people call black bears \"Aguman\" or \"Duman\" which means the devil. If a Bunun hunter's trap accidentally traps a bear, he has to build a cottage in the mountains and burn the body of the bear there. He also has to stay in the cottage alone away from the village until the millet harvest is finished. Rukai and Paiwan people are allowed to hunt bears, but the hunters have to pay the price of carrying the ancient curse in return. Rukai people believe hunting bears can result in disease. Also, not every one is allowed to eat bear meat, and children are strictly forbidden to do so. In Taroko (Truku) legend, Formosan black bears are respectful âkings of the forestâ whose white marks on their chests represent the moon. The Taroko people believe that killing black bears results in family disaster. In general, among these hunting tribes, hunters of boars are respected as heroes, while hunters of bears are considered losers.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2000, 15 Formosan black bears were captured and radio collared in Yushan National Park. Reported bear sightings are very infrequent and no one knows exactly how many bears still exist. The species has been legally protected since 1989 but illegal hunting continues and such poaching continues to threaten Formosan black bear populations. For example, eight of fifteen bears captured in the above survey had missing toes or paws, caused by illegal traps.\n\nSince 1989, Formosan black bears have been listed as endangered animals and protected by Taiwan's \"Cultural Heritage Preservation Law\" (Traditional Chinese: æåè³ç¢ä¿å­æ³). Internationally, this species is listed on Appendix I of CITES. CITES bans all international trade of any products from this species. The Formosan black bear is also on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) which declares that these bears are vulnerable to extinction.\n\nAn indigenous Bunun hunter once said, \"If there were no bears in the mountains, the forest would look empty and I would feel lonely.\" Mei-Hsiu Hwang of Institute of Wildlife Conservation, a campaigner for black-bear preservation, also said: \"We do not wish to lose this soul of Taiwan's mountains. We do not wish our offspring to see them only in the zoo or in history books.\"\n\nThere is still hope for the Formosan black bear. In 2009, Lin Yuan-Yuan (a member of Yushan National Park's black bear conservation group) recorded footage showing a mother bear attempting to help her two cubs cross a rapid near Batongguan Historic Trail (å«ééå¤é) in the eastern section of Tafen (å¡è¬).\n\n\n"}

Oersted's law and the oersted (Oe) are named after him.\n\nA leader of the Danish Golden Age, Ãrsted was a close friend of Hans Christian Andersen and the brother of politician and jurist Anders SandÃ¸e Ãrsted, who served as Prime Minister of Denmark from 1853 to 1854.\n\nÃrsted was born in RudkÃ¸bing in 1777. As a young boy he developed an interest in science while working for his father, who owned a pharmacy. He and his brother Anders received most of their early education through self-study at home, going to Copenhagen in 1793 to take entrance exams for the University of Copenhagen, where both brothers excelled academically. By 1796 Ãrsted had been awarded honors for his papers in both aesthetics and physics. He earned his doctorate in 1799 for a dissertation based on the works of Kant entitled \"The Architectonics of Natural Metaphysics\".\n\nIn 1800, Alessandro Volta reported his invention of the voltaic pile, which inspired Ãrsted to investigate the nature of electricity and to conduct his first electrical experiments. In 1801 Ãrsted received a travel scholarship and public grant which enabled him to spend three years traveling across Europe. He toured science headquarters throughout the continent, including in Berlin and Paris.\n\nIn Germany Ãrsted met Johann Wilhelm Ritter, a physicist who believed there was a connection between electricity and magnetism. This idea made sense to Ãrsted as he subscribed to Kantian thought regarding the unity of nature. Ãrsted's conversations with Ritter drew him into the study of physics. He became a professor at the University of Copenhagen in 1806 and continued research on electric currents and acoustics. Under his guidance the university developed a comprehensive physics and chemistry program and established new laboratories.\n\nÃrsted welcomed William Christopher Zeise to his family home in autumn 1806. He granted Zeise a position as his lecturing assistant and took the young chemist under his tutelage. In 1812 Ãrsted again visited Germany and France after publishing \"Videnskaben om Naturens Almindelige Love\" and \"FÃ¸rste Indledning til den Almindelige NaturlÃ¦re\" (1811).\n\nÃrsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the thought experiment. He used the Latin-German term \"Gedankenexperiment\" circa 1812 and the German term \"Gedankenversuch\" in 1820. \n\nOn 21 April 1820, during a lecture, Ãrsted noticed a compass needle deflected from magnetic north when an electric current from a battery was switched on and off, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.\n\nHis initial interpretation was that magnetic effects radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, as do light and heat. Three months later he began more intensive investigations and soon thereafter published his findings, showing that an electric current produces a circular magnetic field as it flows through a wire. For his discovery, the Royal Society of London awarded Ãrsted the Copley Medal in 1820 and the French Academy granted him 3,000 francs.\n\nÃrsted's findings stirred much research into electrodynamics throughout the scientific community, influencing French physicist AndrÃ©-Marie AmpÃ¨re's developments of a single mathematical formula to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ãrsted's work also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.\n\nÃrsted was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1822 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849.\n\nHe founded Selskabet for NaturlÃ¦rens Udbredelse (SNU), a society to disseminate knowledge of the natural sciences, in 1824. He was also the founder of predecessor organizations which eventually became the Danish Meteorological Institute and the Danish Patent and Trademark Office.\nIn 1829, Ãrsted founded Den Polytekniske LÃ¦reanstalt ('College of Advanced Technology') which was later renamed the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).\n\nIn 1825, Ãrsted made a significant contribution to chemistry by producing aluminium for the first time. While an aluminium-iron alloy had previously been developed by Humphry Davy, Ãrsted was the first to isolate the element via a reduction of aluminium chloride.\n\nÃrsted died in Copenhagen in 1851, aged 73, and was buried in the Assistens Cemetery.\n\nThe centimetre-gram-second system (CGS) unit of magnetic induction (oersted) is named for his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.\n\nThe Ãrsted Park in Copenhagen was named after Ãrsted in 1879. The streets H.C. Ãrsteds Vej in Frederiksberg and H. C. Ãrsteds AllÃ© in Galten are also named after him.\n\nThe buildings that are home to the Department of Chemistry and the Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen's North Campus are named the \"H.C. Ãrsted Institute\", after him. A dormitory named H. C. Ãrsted Kollegiet is located in Odense.\n\nThe first Danish satellite, launched 1999, was named after Ãrsted.\n\nA statue of Hans Christian Ãrsted was installed in the Ãrsted Park in 1880. A commemorative plaque is located above the gate on the building in StudiestrÃ¦de where he lived and worked. The 100 danske kroner note issued from 1950 to 1970 carried an engraving of Ãrsted.\n\nTwo medals are awarded in Ãrsted's name: the Oersted Medal for notable contributions in the teaching of physics in America, awarded by American Association of Physics Teachers, along with the H. C. Ãrsted Medal for Danish scientists, awarded by the Danish \"Selskabet for NaturlÃ¦rens Udbredelse\" (Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science), founded by Ãrsted. \n\nThe H.C. Ãrsted Lectureship is awarded to two prominent researchers annually.\n\nHere is a list of some of the previous H.C. Ãrsted lecturers:\n\n\nÃrsted was a published writer and poet. His poetry series \"Luftskibet\" (\"The Airship\") was inspired by the balloon flights of fellow physicist and stage magician Ãtienne-Gaspard Robert. Shortly before his death, he submitted a collection of articles for publication under the title \"The Soul in Nature\". The book presents Ãrsted's life philosophy and views on a wide variety of issues.\n\n\n\n"}

Beliefs that are \"held come what may\" are beliefs one is unwilling to give up, regardless of any evidence with which one might be presented. Quine held (on a perhaps simplistic construal) that there are no beliefs that one ought to hold come what mayâin other words, that all beliefs are rationally revisable (\"no statement is immune to revision\"), and compared this to the simplification of quantum mechanics.\n\nMany philosophers argue to the contrary, believing that, for example, the laws of thought cannot be revised and may be \"held come what may\". Quine believed that all beliefs are linked by a web of beliefs, in which a belief is linked to another belief by supporting relations, but if one belief is found untrue, there is ground to find the linked beliefs also untrue.\n\nA closely related concept is hold more stubbornly at least, also popularized by Quine. Some beliefs may be more useful than others, or may be implied by a large number of beliefs. Examples might be laws of logic, or the belief in an external world of physical objects. Altering such central portions of the web of beliefs would have immense, ramifying consequences, and affect many other beliefs. It is better to alter auxiliary beliefs around the edges of the web of beliefs (considered to be sense beliefs, rather than main beliefs) in the face of new evidence unfriendly to one's central principles. Thus, while one might agree that there is no belief one can hold come what may, there are some for which there is ample practical ground to \"hold more stubbornly at least\".\n"}

Inspired by the idea of the fortune cookie, the project was created to permit different users to share their thoughts and create a new kind of social ties. It is an interactive kiosk that issues short texts written by anonymous users on the Kortunefookie website that resemble the messages found in the fortune cookies, but each fortune from the Kortunefookie is different, unlike mass-produced fortunes in regular fortune cookies. Kortunefookie's Web site suggest users to send an innermost secret, a smarmiest wisecrack, a private prayer, or an outlandish prediction.\n\nKortunefookie has two parts: one that utilizes the Web 2.0 to gather the texts from the public, and the other that consists of an interactive sculptural installation (the interactive kiosk). The fortunes are submitted by the public via the projectâs website then stored into an XML database. Once moderated, these texts are uploaded on the computer's custom application housed inside the interactive wooden kiosk. This sculptural kiosk is weather proof and designed to be installed just about anywhere outdoors. Anyone visiting the on-site interactive sculpture can push a button and receive a small paper that contains a printed original message. These fortunes are printed using a thermal receipt printer, a type of paper that resembles a retail receipt.\n\nCreated in 2008 as part of a research creation project funded by the University of Quebec in Outaouais, the creative team included professor Jean-FranÃ§ois Lacombe from the Multidisciplinary Image School and Christian Desjardins, his research assistant and student at the time. The project's ambition was to allow different users to interact and post messages on the public realm. From the beginning, the endeavour intended to be a multidisciplinary creation that would act both as an art installation and as an interactive medium to communicate. A challenge for the team was to render the complex technology used invisible, letting the experience generated by the device dominate (as describe by John Maeda, in his book The Laws of Simplicity, MIT Press, 2006). As the team wanted a seamless operation and to facilitate the use of the interactive sculpture, a familiar image had to be associated to the new device. After a period of research and development, the team came up with the idea to utilize the image of the fortune cookies.\n\nShortly after finalizing the usage design, the construction of the interactive kiosk prototype and then development of the application began simultaneously. The prototype was made with slabs of pink Styrofoam that measured one and a half inches thick. Once the desired form and scale had been achieved, the model was dismantled so that each Styrofoam layer could be reproduced in wood in the same dimensions. It was then just a matter of assembling all the layers of wood to form the hollow sculpture. Francis Boivin, then a visual arts student at the University of Quebec in Outaouais, greatly contributed to the making of the wooden sculpture. The final fortune cookie sculpture is made entirely from salvaged Western red cedar logs that were once telephone poles. \n\nThe customized application that prints the fortune was built on a Mac Mini (1.83Â GHz Core 2 Duo/1GB/80GB/Combo) with the programming interface Cocoa (API) and development tools Apple Xcode and Interface Builder. It was mainly programmed by Justin McKillican. Lastly, speakers were installed inside the fortune cookie so that a 10-second synthesized melody could be heard each time the button was pressed. This also allowed to manage the intervals between each text so that it was impossible for a continuous cascade of paper to be printed.\n\nFinally, using the CMS SPIP, the Web site was conceived to act both as a promotional tool as well as the text collecting interface. In this project, the Web was the obvious âdrop pointâ for messages as it allowed anyone anywhere to participate in the creation of the fortunes. It also permits for the sent messages to be filtered out. Specifically those that were distasteful, promotional, or aimed at specific individuals.\n\nStatistics for the texts so far are:\n\nFor its first showing at the Arts Under The Bridge Festival in New York City (organized by Brooklyn artist-run centre DAC), the project was entitled SensGoodKarma. However, this title restricted the editorial line as well as the publicâs scope for intervention. Several brainstorming sessions to find a new name proved fruitless until, one evening in 2009, Chris Zeke Hand exclaimed, â\"Kortunefookie!\"â, inspiring the permanent name of the project.\n\nMain collaborators for the project include Christian Desjardins, Justin McKillican and Francis Boivin. Funding provided by the institutional fund for research creation development (FIRC). A book about the project, called \"Kortunefookie, tale of an interactive cookie\", has been published in summer 2011. Limited to 100 numbered editions, this publication includes texts, photographs, and illustrations by Jean-FranÃ§ois Lacombe, FranÃ§ois Chalifour, Christian Desjardins, Mamoru Kobayakawa, and Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne Leblanc.\n\nThe objective of the project, as stated by its creator, was the establishment of a communication tool that would act as an \"intermediary\" between the publicâs imagination and that of its users. Kortunefookie was a kind of a contemporary divination device, allowing thousands of users to share and come in contact with an intimate thought of someone else. This necessity for communication, or the intimacy of communication as proposed by Kortunefookie, is reiterated by FranÃ§ois Chalifour :\nÂ«Isolation is unattractive, it bothers us. It holds up traffic. To correct the situation, we must fill the space that separates things, beings. Communication, for as long as it has existed, has proved to be a privileged means of closing this chasm: attract attention, open the channels of communication, exchange the message. In all sorts of ways, Lacombeâs odd-looking box, lying by the side of the road outside an art gallery, speaks to us of a trend whose results remain, to this day, ambiguous. Have we bridged the gap, have we filled the void, have we crossed the gulf that separates us? Jean-FranÃ§ois Lacombe is working on it.Â»\n\nExcerpt taken from the article \"Kortunefookie, Horro Vacui\", written by FranÃ§ois Chalifour, previously published in the magazine \"Espace Sculpture 90\", Hiver 2009/2010. translation: Sarah Knight.\n"}

It appears in the scientific fields of electron microscopy, cathode ray tubes, accelerator physics, nuclear physics, Auger electron spectroscopy, cosmology and mass spectrometry. The importance of the mass-to-charge ratio, according to classical electrodynamics, is that two particles with the same mass-to-charge ratio move in the same path in a vacuum , when subjected to the same electric and magnetic fields. Its SI units are kg/C. In rare occasions the thomson has been used as its unit in the field of mass spectrometry.\n\nSome fields use the charge-to-mass ratio (\"Q\"/\"m\") instead, which is the multiplicative inverse of the mass-to-charge ratio. The 2014 CODATA recommended value for an electron is = .\n\nWhen charged particles move in electric and magnetic fields the following two laws apply:\n\nwhere F is the force applied to the ion, \"m\" is the mass of the particle, a is the acceleration, \"Q\" is the electric charge, E is the electric field, and v Ã B is the cross product of the ion's velocity and the magnetic flux density.\n\nThis differential equation is the classic equation of motion for charged particles. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it completely determines the particle's motion in space and time in terms of \"m\"/\"Q\". Thus mass spectrometers could be thought of as \"mass-to-charge spectrometers\". When presenting data in a mass spectrum, it is common to use the dimensionless \"m\"/\"z\", which denotes the dimensionless quantity formed by dividing the mass number of the ion by its charge number.\n\nCombining the two previous equations yields:\n\nThis differential equation is the classic equation of motion of a charged particle in vacuum. Together with the particle's initial conditions it determines the particle's motion in space and time. It immediately reveals that two particles with the same \"m\"/\"Q\" ratio behave in the same way. This is why the mass-to-charge ratio is an important physical quantity in those scientific fields where charged particles interact with magnetic or electric fields.\n\nThere are non-classical effects that derive from quantum mechanics, such as the SternâGerlach effect that can diverge the path of ions of identical \"m\"/\"Q\".\n\nThe IUPAC recommended symbol for mass and charge are \"m\" and \"Q\", respectively, however using a lowercase \"q\" for charge is also very common. Charge is a scalar property, meaning that it can be either positive (+) or negative (â). The Coulomb (C) is the SI unit of charge; however, other units can be used, such as expressing charge in terms of the elementary charge (e). The SI unit of the physical quantity \"m\"/\"Q\" is kilogram per coulomb.\n\nThe units and notation above are used when dealing with the physics of mass spectrometry; however, the \"m\"/\"z\" notation is used for the independent variable in a mass spectrum. This notation eases data interpretation since it is numerically more related to the unified atomic mass unit. The \"m\" refers to the molecular or atomic mass number and \"z\" to the charge number of the ion; however, the quantity of \"m\"/\"z\" is dimensionless by definition. An ion of 100 atomic mass units (\"m\" = 100) carrying two charges (\"z\" = 2) will be observed at \"m\"/\"z\" = 50.\n\nIn the 19th century, the mass-to-charge ratios of some ions were measured by electrochemical methods. In 1897, the mass-to-charge ratio of the electron was first measured by J. J. Thomson. By doing this, he showed that the electron was in fact a particle with a mass and a charge, and that its mass-to-charge ratio was much smaller than that of the hydrogen ion H. In 1898, Wilhelm Wien separated ions (canal rays) according to their mass-to-charge ratio with an ion optical device with superimposed electric and magnetic fields (Wien filter). In 1901 Walter Kaufman measured the increase of electromagnetic mass of fast electrons (KaufmannâBuchererâNeumann experiments), or relativistic mass increase in modern terms. In 1913, Thomson measured the mass-to-charge ratio of ions with an instrument he called a parabola spectrograph. Today, an instrument that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles is called a mass spectrometer.\n\nThe charge-to-mass ratio (\"Q\"/\"m\") of an object is, as its name implies, the charge of an object divided by the mass of the same object. This quantity is generally useful only for objects that may be treated as particles. For extended objects, total charge, charge density, total mass, and mass density are often more useful.\n\nDerivation:\n\nformula_2 or formula_3 (1)\n\nSince formula_4,\n\nformula_5 or formula_6 (2)\n\nEquations (1) and (2) yield\n\nformula_7\n\nIn some experiments, the charge-to-mass ratio is the only quantity that can be measured directly. Often, the charge can be inferred from theoretical considerations, so that the charge-to-mass ratio provides a way to calculate the mass of a particle.\n\nOften, the charge-to-mass ratio can be determined from observing the deflection of a charged particle in an external magnetic field. The cyclotron equation, combined with other information such as the kinetic energy of the particle, will give the charge-to-mass ratio. One application of this principle is the mass spectrometer. The same principle can be used to extract information in experiments involving the cloud chamber.\n\nThe ratio of electrostatic to gravitational forces between two particles will be proportional to the product of their charge-to-mass ratios. It turns out that gravitational forces are negligible on the subatomic level, due to the extremely small masses of subatomic particles.\n\nThe elementary charge-to-electron mass quotient, formula_8, is a quantity in experimental physics. It bears significance because the electron mass \"m\" is difficult to measure directly, and is instead derived from measurements of the elementary charge e and formula_8. It also has historical significance; the \"Q\"/\"m\" ratio of the electron was successfully calculated by J. J. Thomson in 1897âand more successfully by Dunnington, which involves the angular momentum and deflection due to a perpendicular magnetic field. Thomson's measurement convinced him that cathode rays were particles, which were later identified as electrons, and he is generally credited with their discovery.\n\nThe 2014 CODATA recommended value is formula_8 = . CODATA refers to this as the electron charge-to-mass quotient, but ratio is still commonly used.\n\nThere are two other common ways of measuring the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron, apart from Thomson and Dunnington's methods.\n\n\nThe charge-to-mass ratio of an electron may also be measured with the Zeeman effect, which gives rise to energy splittings in the presence of a magnetic field \"B\":\n\nHere \"m\" are quantum integer values ranging from -\"j\" to \"j\", with \"j\" as the eigenvalue of the total angular momentum operator J, with\nwhere S is the spin operator with eigenvalue \"s\" and L is the angular momentum operator with eigenvalue \"l\". \"g\" is the LandÃ© g-factor, calculated as\n\nThe shift in energy is also given in terms of frequency \"Î½\" and wavelength \"Î»\" as\n\nMeasurements of the Zeeman effect commonly involve the use of a FabryâPÃ©rot interferometer, with light from a source (placed in a magnetic field) being passed between two mirrors of the interferometer. If \"Î´D\" is the change in mirror separation required to bring the \"m\"-order ring of wavelength \"Î»\" + \"ÎÎ»\" into coincidence with that of wavelength \"Î»\", and \"ÎD\" brings the (\"m\" + 1) ring of wavelength \"Î»\" into coincidence with the \"m\"-order ring, then\n\nIt follows then that\n\nRearranging, it is possible to solve for the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron as\n\n\n\n"}

Generally, there are two different types: clean and dirty materials recovery facilities.\n\nA \"clean MRF\" accepts recyclable comingled materials that have already been separated at the source from municipal solid waste generated by either residential or commercial sources. There are a variety of clean MRFs. The most common are single stream where all recyclable material is mixed, or dual stream MRFs, where source-separated recyclables are delivered in a mixed container stream (typically glass, ferrous metal, aluminum and other non-ferrous metals, PET [No.1] and HDPE [No.2] plastics) and a mixed paper stream including corrugated cardboard boxes, newspapers, magazines, office paper and junk mail. Material is sorted to specifications, then baled, shredded, crushed, compacted, or otherwise prepared for shipment to market.\n\nA mixed-waste processing system, sometimes referred to as a dirty MRF, accepts a mixed solid waste stream and then proceeds to separate out designated recyclable materials through a combination of manual and mechanical sorting. The sorted recyclable materials may undergo further processing required to meet technical specifications established by end-markets while the balance of the mixed waste stream is sent to a disposal facility such as a landfill. Today, MWPFs are attracting renewed interest as a way to address low participation rates for source-separated recycling collection systems and prepare fuel products and/or feedstocks for conversion technologies. MWPFs can give communities the opportunity to recycle at much higher rates than has been demonstrated by curbside or other waste collection systems. Advances in technology make todayâs MWPF different and, in many respects better, than older versions. \n\nThe percentage of residuals (unrecoverable recyclable or non-program materials) from a properly operated clean MRF supported by an effective public outreach and education program should not exceed 10% by weight of the total delivered stream and in many cases it can be significantly below 5%. A dirty MRF recovers between 5% and 45% of the incoming material as recyclables, then the remainder is landfilled or otherwise disposed. A dirty MRF can be capable of higher recovery rates than a clean MRF, since it ensures that 100% of the waste stream is subjected to the sorting process, and can target a greater number of materials for recovery than can usually be accommodated by sorting at the source. However, the dirty MRF process results in greater contamination of recyclables, especially of paper. Furthermore, a facility that accepts mixed solid waste is usually more challenging and more expensive to site. Operational costs can be higher because it is more labor-intensive.\n\nAround 2004, new mechanical biological treatment technologies were beginning to utilise \"wet MRFs\". These combine a dirty MRF with water, which acts to densify, separate and clean the output streams. It also hydrocrushes and dissolves biodegradable organics in solution to make them suitable for anaerobic digestion.\n\nIn the United States, modern MRF's began in the 1970s. Peter Karter established Resource Recovery Systems, Inc. in Branford, Connecticut, the \"first materials recovery facility (MRF)\" in the US. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "7803345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7803345", "title": "Mental reservation", "text": "Mental reservation\n\nThe doctrine of mental reservation, or of mental equivocation, was a special branch of casuistry (case-based reasoning) developed in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and most often associated with the Jesuits.\n\nMental reservation is a form of deception which is not an outright lie. It was argued for in moral theology, and now in ethics, as a way to fulfill obligations both to tell the truth and to keep secrets from those not entitled to know them (for example, because of the seal of the confessional or other clauses of confidentiality). Mental reservation, however, is regarded as unjustifiable without grave reason for withholding the truth. This condition was necessary to preserve a general idea of truth in social relations.\n\nIn wide mental reservation, equivocations and amphibologies are used to imply an untruth that is not actually stated. In strict mental reservation, the speaker mentally adds some qualification to the words which they utter, and the words together with the mental qualification make a true assertion in accordance with fact.\n\nA frequently cited example of equivocation is a well-known incident from the life of Athanasius of Alexandria. When Julian the Apostate was seeking Athanasius's death, Athanasius fled Alexandria and was pursued up the Nile. Seeing the imperial officers were gaining on him, Athanasius took advantage of a bend in the river that hid his boat from its pursuers and ordered his boat turned around. When the two boats crossed paths, the Roman officers shouted out, asking if anyone had seen Athanasius. As instructed by Athanasius, his followers shouted back, \"Yes, he is not very far off.\" The pursuing boat hastily continued up the river, while Athanasius returned to Alexandria, where he remained in hiding until the end of the persecution.\n\nAnother anecdote often used to illustrate equivocation concerns Francis of Assisi. He once saw a man fleeing from a murderer. When the murderer then came upon Francis, he demanded to know if his quarry had passed that way. Francis answered, \"He did not pass this way,\" sliding his forefinger into the sleeve of his cassock, thus misleading the murderer and saving a life. A variant of this anecdote is cited by the canonist Martin de Azpilcueta to illustrate his doctrine of a mixed speech (\"oratoria mixta\") combining speech and gestural communication.\n\nThe Bible contains a good example of equivocation. Abraham was married to Sarah/Sarai, his half-sister by a different mother. Fearing that as he traveled people would covet his beautiful wife and as a result kill him to take her, he counselled her to agree with him when he would say that \"she is my sister.\" This happened on two occasions, first with the Pharaoh of Egypt, told in Genesis 12:11-13, and second, with a king called Abimelech in Gen 20:12.\n\nThe 16th-century Spanish theologian Martin de Azpilcueta (often called \"Navarrus\" because he was born in the Kingdom of Navarre) wrote at length about the doctrine of \"mentalis restrictio\" or mental reservation. Navarrus held that mental reservation involved truths \"expressed partly in speech and partly in the mind,\" relying upon the idea that God hears what is in one's mind while human beings hear only what one speaks. Therefore, the Christian's moral duty was to tell the truth to God. Reserving some of that truth from the ears of human hearers was moral if it served a greater good. This is the doctrine of strict mental reservation. A user of the doctrine could reply aloud \"I know not\" to a human interlocutor, and \"to tell you\" silently to God, and still be telling the truth (\"stricte mentalis\").\n\nTraditionally, the doctrine of mental reservation was intimately linked with the concept of equivocation, which allowed the speaker to employ double meanings of words to tell the \"literal\" truth while concealing a deeper meaning. Navarrus, however, went beyond this, giving the doctrine of mental reservation a far broader and more liberal interpretation than had anyone up to that time. Although some other Catholic theological thinkers and writers took up the argument in favor of strict mental reservation, the concept remained controversial within the Roman Catholic Church, which never officially endorsed or upheld the doctrine and eventually condemned it.\n\nThe linked doctrines of mental reservation and equivocation became notorious in England during the Elizabethan era and the Jacobean era, when Jesuits who had entered England to minister to the spiritual needs of Catholics were captured by the authorities. The Jesuits Robert Southwell (c. 1561â1595) (who was also a poet of note) and Henry Garnet (1555â1606) both wrote treatises on the topic, which was of far more than academic interest to them. Both risked their lives bringing the sacraments to recusant CatholicsÂ â and not only \"their\" lives, since sheltering a priest was a capital offence. In 1586, Margaret Clitherow had been pressed to death for refusing to enter a plea on the charge of harbouring two priests at York. When caught, tortured and interrogated, Southwell and Garnet practiced mental reservation not to save themselvesÂ â their deaths were a foregone conclusionÂ â but to protect their fellow believers.\n\nSouthwell, who was arrested in 1592, was accused at his trial of having told a witness that even if she was forced by the authorities to swear under oath, it was permissible to lie to conceal the whereabouts of a priest. Southwell replied that that was not what he had said. He had said that \"to an oath were required justice, judgement and truth\", but the rest of his answer goes unrecorded because one of the judges angrily shouted him down. Convicted in 1595, Southwell was hanged, drawn and quartered. More famous in his own era was Henry Garnet, who wrote a defense of Southwell in 1598; Garnet was captured by the authorities in 1606 due to his alleged involvement in the Gunpowder Plot. Facing the same accusations as Southwell, his attempts to defend himself met with no better result: later that year Garnet was executed in the same fashion.\n\nThe Protestants considered these doctrines as mere justifications for lies. Catholic ethicists also voiced objections: the Jansenist \"Blaise Pascal...attacked the Jesuits in the seventeenth century for what he saw as their moral laxity.\" \"By 1679, the doctrine of strict mental reservation put forward by Navarrus had become such a scandal that Pope Innocent XI officially condemned it.\" Other casuists justifying mental reservation included Thomas Sanchez, who was criticized by Pascal in his \"Provincial Letters\"Â â although Sanchez added various restrictions (it should not be used in ordinary circumstances, when one is interrogated by competent magistrates, when a creed is requested, even for heretics, etc.), which were ignored by Pascal. Of the 26 theses condemned by Pope Innocent XI, several were in Sanchez's works (see op. mor. in prÃ¦c. Decalogi, III, vi, n. 15). One of them stated:\n\nThis type of equivocation was famously mocked in the porter's speech in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", in which the porter directly alludes to the practice of deceiving under oath by means of equivocation.\n\nSee, for example Robert Southwell and Henry Garnet, author of \"A Treatise of Equivocation\" (published secretly c. 1595)âto whom, it is supposed, Shakespeare was specifically referring. Shakespeare made the reference to priests because the religious use of equivocation was well known in those periods of early modern England (e.g. under James VI/I) when it was a capital offence for a Roman Catholic priest to enter England. A Jesuit priest would equivocate in order to protect himself from the secular authorities without (in his eyes) committing the sin of lying. For example, he could use the ambiguity of the word \"a\" (meaning \"any\" or \"one\") to say \"I swear I am not a priest\", because he could have a particular priest in mind who he was not. That is, in his mind, he was saying \"I swear I am not one priest\" (e.g. \"I am not Father Brown\".)\n\nAccording to Malloch and Huntley (1966), this doctrine of permissible \"equivocation\" did not originate with the Jesuits. They cite a short treatise, \"\", that had been written by Martin Azpilcueta (also known as Doctor Navarrus), an Augustinian who was serving as a consultant to the Apostolic Penitentiary. It was published in Rome in 1584. The first Jesuit influence upon this doctrine was not until 1609, \"when Suarez rejected Azpilcueta's basic proof and supplied another\" (speaking of Francisco SuÃ¡rez).\n\nFollowing Innocent XI's condemnation of strict mental reservation, equivocation (or wide mental reservation) was still considered orthodox, and was revived and defended by Alphonsus Liguori. The Jesuit Gabriel Daniel wrote in 1694 \"Entretiens de Cleanthe et d'Eudoxe sur les lettres provinciales\", a reply to Pascal's \"Provincial Letters\" in which he accused Pascal of lying, or even of having himself used mental reservation, by not mentioning all the restrictions imposed by Sanchez on the use of this form of deception.\n\nThis type of untruth was condemned by Kant in \"On a supposed 'right to lieâ\". Kant was debating against Benjamin Constant, who had claimed, from a consequentialist stance opposed to Kant's categorical imperative, that:\nOn the other hand, Kant asserted, in the \"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\", that lying, or deception of any kind, would be forbidden under any interpretation and in any circumstance. In \"Groundwork\", Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty) because it would logically contradict the reliability of language. If it is universally acceptable to lie, then no one would believe anyone and all truths would be assumed to be lies (this last clause was accepted by casuists, hence the reasons for restrictions given to the cases where deception was authorized). The right to deceive could also not be claimed because it would deny the status of the person deceived as an end in himself. And the theft would be incompatible with a possible kingdom of ends. Therefore, Kant denied the right to lie or deceive for any reason, regardless of context or anticipated consequences. However, it was permissible to remain silent or say no more than needed (such as in the infamous example of a murderer asking to know where someone is).\n\nThe doctrines have also been criticized by Sissela Bok and by Paul Ekman, who defines lies by omission as the main form of lyingÂ â though larger and more complex moral and ethical issues of lying and truth-telling extend far beyond these specific doctrines. Ekman, however, does not consider cases of deception where \"it is improper to question\" the truth as real form of deceptionsÂ â this sort of case, where communication of truth is not to be expected and so deception is justified, was included by casuists.\n\nBill Clinton famously equivocated, during his trial during the Lewinsky scandal, \"It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is.\"\n\nSocial psychologists have advanced cases where the actor is confronted with an avoidance-avoidance conflict, in which he both doesn't want to say the truth and doesn't want to make an outright lie; in such circumstances, equivocal statements are generally preferred. This type of equivocation has been defined as ânonstraightforward communication...ambiguous, contradictory, tangential, obscure or even evasive.â People typically equivocate when posed a question to which all of the possible replies have potentially negative consequences, yet a reply is still expected (the situational theory of communicative conflict).\n\nThe Irish Catholic Church allegedly misused the concept of mental reservation when dealing with situations relating to clerical child sexual abuse, by disregarding the restrictions placed on its employment by moral theologians and treating it as a method that \"allows clerics (to) mislead people...without being guilty of lying\", for example when dealing with the police, victims, civil authorities and media. In the Murphy Report into the Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin, Cardinal Desmond Connell describes it thus:\n\nCathleen Kaveny, writing in the Catholic magazine \"Commonweal\", notes that Henry Garnet in his treatise on the topic took pains to argue that no form of mental reservation was justifiedÂ â and might even be a mortal sinÂ â if it would run contrary to the requirements of faith, charity or justice. But according to the Murphy Report:\n\nKaveny concludes: \"The truths of faith are illuminated by the lives of the martyrs. Southwell and Garnet practiced mental reservation to save innocent victims while sacrificing themselves. The Irish prelates practiced mental reservation to save themselves while sacrificing innocent victims. And that difference makes all the difference.\"\n\n\n"}

These elements are: Prithvi/Bhudevi (Hindi: à¤ªà¥à¤¥à¥à¤µà¥, Earth), Apas/Varuna/Jal (Hindi: à¤à¤ªà¥, Water), Agni (Hindi: à¤à¤à¥à¤¨à¤¿, Fire), Vayu (Hindi: à¤µà¤¾à¤¯à¥, Air), Aakash/Dyaus (Hindi: à¤à¤à¤¾à¤¶, Aether). These elements have different characteristics and these also account for different faculties of human experience. In \"ayurveda\" and Indian philosophy, the human body is considered to be made of these five elements. However, CÄrvÄka did not accept \"Akash\" as basic element as it is not tangible and according to him, there are only four basic elements. Buddhism also accepts four basic elements and \"Akash\" is left out. These five elements of Indian cosmological system are similar but not identical to five element theory used in East Asia.\n\nThe \"pancha bhoota\" are associated with a sense which is perceived by sense organ in human being. Below table gives details of associated sense, sense organ, and other attributes of elements.\n\nAccording to ayurveda and Yoga, \"Pancha Bhoota\" are associated with overall health of human being. Any disorder in human body indicates imbalance of one or more of these elements. \"Yoga Tattva Mudra Vijnana\" relates these five elements to five fingers of human being. Different \"Mudra\" were developed to balance these in human body which form the \"Hasta Mudra\" in yogic tradition and are used in Naturopathy.\n\nThe three \"dosha\"- three intrinsic tendencies, which, according to ayurveda are intrinsic in every human being, are representation of combination of these five elements in human body. The three \"Dosha\" have subtle positive essences which control the mind and body function.\n\nAccording to \"Yoga\", the aim of \"sadhana\" is to have mastery over oneself. This mastery can be achieved by mastering all the basic elements. The process of gaining mastery over these elements and purifying them is called \"Bhuta Shuddhi\".\n\"Pancha Bhoota Stalam\" is representation of \"pancha bhoota\" for yogic practice. People used to move from one temple\nto another and do \"sadhana\" on particular basic element.\n\nThe seven \"Chakra\" in human body are associated with these five elements. \n\n\"Hasta Mudra\" or hand posture is based on the \"panch bhootas\". The basic assumption is that all the five elements can be represented by five different fingers in human body as shown in the table below.\n\nVastu shastra emphasizes on the placement of five elements in specified direction and the balance of these elements determines the condition of the associated structure.\n\nThat is why, in an ideal home, the home itself is placed so that maximum load and weight is in the southwest area of the plot. Thus, there is maximum open space in the North, Northeast and East side of the plot (satisfying Vayu / Air and Akasha / Space)\n\nThe entrance to the plot (Main Gate), the Verandah (visitors lounge), and the Main Door is in the Northeast, for the cosmic benefits of Akasha and the purifying benefits of fresh air enter the house in abundance.\n\nTo the south of the Verandah is the Living Room, and to its south is 1 or 2 bedrooms (with / without bathrooms)\n\nTo the south or southwest of the room is the storeroom (for benefits of Prithvi / Bhumi), and in the Southeast corner of the home is the Kitchen (for here is the perfect balance of Akash (Space) and Agni (Fire)\n\nTo the south of the Kitchen is the backyard (but care should be taken to ensure there is NO DOOR in the south to the backyard, it will lead to loss of Vasthu energy)\n\nTo the west of the kitchen should be the Master bedroom (and care should be taken to ensure that bathroom IS NOT in the Southwest corner of the room)\n\nTo the north of the master bedroom will be the pooja room, and to its north will be a utility area / common bathroom or staircase room to the first floor etc\n\nCombination of pancha bhoota is associated with six human tastes as below.\n\n"}
{"id": "191892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191892", "title": "Pansexuality", "text": "Pansexuality\n\nPansexuality, or omnisexuality, is the sexual, romantic or emotional attraction towards people regardless of their sex or gender identity. Pansexual people may refer to themselves as gender-blind, asserting that gender and sex are not determining factors in their romantic or sexual attraction to others.\n\nPansexuality may be considered a sexual orientation in its own right or a branch of bisexuality, to indicate an alternative sexual identity. Because pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women, and pansexuality therefore rejects the gender binary, it is often considered a more inclusive term than \"bisexual\". To what extent the term \"bisexual\" is inclusive when compared with the term \"pansexual\" is debated within the LGBT community, especially the bisexual community.\n\nThe prefix \"pan-\" comes from the Ancient Greek word for \"all, every\", \"Ïá¾¶Î½\"; \"omni-\" comes from the Latin word for \"all\", \"omnis\". The hybrid words \"pansexual\" and \"pansexualism\" were first attested in 1917, denoting the idea \"that the sex instinct plays the primary part in all human activity, mental and physical\", a reproach (credited to Sigmund Freud) levelled at early psychology.\n\nA literal dictionary definition of \"bisexuality\", due to the prefix \"bi-\", is sexual or romantic attraction to two sexes (males and females), or to two genders (men and women). Pansexuality, however, composed with the prefix \"pan-\", is the sexual attraction to a person of any sex or gender. Using these definitions, pansexuality is defined differently by explicitly including people who are intersex or outside the gender binary.\n\nGo Ask Alice! states that pansexuals can be attracted to cisgender, transgender, intersex and androgynous people, and that the term \"pansexual\" \"is generally considered a more inclusive term than \"bisexual.\"\" Volume 2 of Cavendish's \"Sex and Society\", however, states that \"although the term's literal meaning can be interpreted as 'attracted to everything,' people who identify as pansexual do not usually include paraphilias, such as bestiality, pedophilia, and necrophilia, in their definition\" and that they \"stress that the term pansexuality describes only consensual adult sexual behaviors.\"\n\nThe definition of pansexuality can encourage the belief that it is the only sexual identity that covers individuals who do not cleanly fit into the categories of male or man, or female or woman. However, bisexual-identified people and scholars may object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since \"bisexual\" is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses attraction to different genders as well, it includes attraction to more than two genders. Gender is considered more complex than the state of one's sex, as gender includes genetic, hormonal, environmental and social factors. Furthermore, the term \"bisexual\" is sometimes defined as the romantic or sexual attraction to multiple genders. The Bisexual Resource Center, for example, defines bisexuality as \"an umbrella term for people who recognize and honor their potential for sexual and emotional attraction to more than one gender,\" while the American Institute of Bisexuality states that the term \"bisexual\" \"is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions\" and that \"the scientific classification \"bisexual\" only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation.\" According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, 25% of American transgender people identify as bisexual.\n\nScholar Shiri Eisner states that terms such as \"pansexual,\" \"omnisexual,\" \"polysexual,\" \"queer\", etc. are being used in place of the term \"bisexual\" because \"bisexuality, it's been claimed, is a gender binary, and therefore oppressive, word\" and that \"the great debate is being perpetuated and developed by bisexual-identified transgender and genderqueer people on the one hand, and non-bi-identified transgender and genderqueer people on the other.\" Eisner argues that \"the allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality's actual attributes or bisexual people's behavior in real life\" and that the allegations are a political method to keep the bisexual and transgender movements separated, because of those who believe that bisexuality ignores or erases the visibility of transgender and genderqueer people.\n\nThe American Institute of Bisexuality argues that \"terms like \"pansexual\", \"polysexual\", \"omnisexual\", and \"ambisexual\" also describe a person with homosexual and heterosexual attractions, and therefore people with those labels are also bisexual\" and that \"by replacing the prefix bi â (two, both) with pan- (all), poly- (many), omni- (all), ambi- (both, and implying ambiguity in this case), people who adopt these labels seek to clearly express the fact that gender does not factor into their own sexuality,\" but \"this does not mean, however, that people who identify as bisexual are fixated on gender.\" The institute believes that the notion that if a person identifies as bisexual, then it is a reinforcement of a false gender binary is a notion that \"has its roots in the anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world\" and that \"while it is true that our society's language and terminology do not necessarily reflect the full spectrum of human gender diversity, that is hardly the fault of people who choose to identify as bi. ... The Latin prefix bi- does indeed indicate two or both, however the 'both' indicated in the word bisexual are merely \"homosexual\" (lit. same sex) and \"heterosexual\" (lit. different sex).\" The institute argues that heterosexuality and homosexuality, by contrast,\" are defined by the boundary of two sexes/genders. Given those fundamental facts, any criticism of bisexuality as reinforcing a gender binary is misplaced. Over time, our society's concept of human sex and gender may well change.\"\n\nThe term \"pansexuality\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"bisexuality\", and, similarly, people who identify as bisexual may \"feel that gender, biological sex, and sexual orientation should not be a focal point in potential [romantic/sexual] relationships.\" In one study analyzing sexual identities described as alternative terms for bisexual or bi-self labels, \"half of all bisexual and bisexual-identified respondents also chose alternative self-labels such as \"queer\", \"pansexual\", \"pansensual,\" \"polyfidelitous,\" \"ambisexual,\" \"polysexual,\" or personalized identities such as 'byke' or 'biphilic'\". Polysexuality is similar to pansexuality in definition, meaning \"encompassing more than one sexuality,\" but not necessarily encompassing all sexualities. This is distinct from polyamory, which means more than one intimate relationship at the same time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. American Institute of Bisexuality stated, \"The term \"fluid\" expresses the fact that the balance of a person's homosexual and heterosexual attractions exists in a state of flux and changes over time.\"\n\n\n"}

In 2015, there were 205 pawn shops in Hong Kong, with the number increasing slightly over the five previous years.\n\nPawnbroking sprang up in Hong Kong as it developed into an entrepÃ´t. Jeun Yun Aat (ææºæ¼) was the first pawn shop in Hong Kong. In 1926, the Hong Kong government strengthened its regulations on pawn shops and promulgated pawn legislation. Since then, pawnbrokers are required to be licensed establishments. These regulations allowed the industry to become more and more popular.\n\nThe activities of the pawnbrokers were limited by the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in the Second World War. They flourished again after the war in 1945 as a consequence of post-war inflation and a shortage of resources. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With the support of government, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on Hong Kong Island, particularly Central, and Kowloon. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items. Items are under strict verification and registration. Pawn shops must keep digital records of all exchanges. If any suspicious items are found in the pawn shop, the pawn shop is to immediately notify the police.\n\nOn 12 March 2013, the first \"Pawn Shop Stocks\", Oi Wah Pawnshop Credit Holdings Limited (01319.HK), was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This novel sort of pawn shop can cooperate with the market instead of going with the set square to constitute a special private credit market in Hong Kong.\n\nA dong zung is a large rectangular wooden screen, similar to a pair of doors, located right behind the entrance of the pawn shop. The screen is tall enough to block passersby from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid embarrassment. \n\nThe counter of the pawn shop, which is behind the tall board, is typically higher than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to give their mortgaged properties upward to the pawning counter. This design shows the higher status of the pawnbrokers. Prices seem to be lower due to the psychological effect caused by this design. Another reason for setting a high counter is for security. It is hard for passersby and clients to see the environment and workers inside the pawn shop.\n\nPawn shops are a traditional industry in China. The majority of the shops use names including words meaning harmonious (for example 'tung' (å), 'wo' (å)) and/or prosperous (for example 'chang' (æ), 'fat' (ç¼), 'fung' (è±)). The idea behind such a name is an entreaty and hope for having glorious and flourishing business development. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "8998939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8998939", "title": "People-first language", "text": "People-first language\n\nPeople-first language (PFL), also called person-first language (PFL), is a type of linguistic prescription to avoid marginalization or dehumanization (either conscious or subconscious) when discussing people with a health issue or disability. It can be a type of disability etiquette but more often is applied to any group that would otherwise be defined or mentally categorized by a condition or trait (for example, disease, age, disability, or appearance) rather than as a group of people who \"have\" that condition or trait. Rather than using a label or an adjective to define someone, person-first language puts the person before the diagnosis and describes what the person \"has\" (for example, \"a person with diabetes\" or \"a person with alcoholism\"), not an assertion of what the person \"is\" (for example, \"a diabetic\" or \"an alcoholic\"). Thus a person is foremost a person and secondly a person with some trait. Advocates of person-first language point out that failing to mentally separate the person from the trait tends to reinforce a sense (even if only subconsciously) that both the trait and the person are inherently bad or inferior and thus tends to marginalize or even dehumanize the person. It also tends to implicitly reinforce a sense of permanency even regarding issues that are temporary; for example, a person with a substance use disorder has a fair chance of achieving long-term remissionâmany years in which he is healthy and productiveâbut calling him a \"substance abuser\" reinforces an unspoken sense that he is inherently and permanently tainted and casts too much doubt on maintenance of remission.\n\nPeople-first language is a type of linguistic prescription in English. It aims to avoid perceived and subconscious dehumanization when discussing people with disabilities and is sometimes referred to as a type of disability etiquette. People-first language can also be applied to any group that is defined by a condition rather than as a people: for example, \"those that are homeless\" rather than \"the homeless\".\n\nRather than using labels to define individuals with a health issue, it is more appropriate to use terminology, which describes individuals as being diagnosed with an illness or disorder. People first language puts the person before the diagnosis and describes what the person has not what the person is.\n\nThe basic idea is to use a sentence structure that names the person first and the condition second, for example, \"people with disabilities\" rather than \"disabled people\" or \"disabled,\" in order to emphasize that \"they are people first.\" Because it is a common practice in English to place an adjective before a noun, the adjective might be replaced with a relative clause, e.g., from \"an asthmatic person\" to \"a person who has asthma\". Furthermore, the use of \"to be\" is deprecated in favor of using \"to have\".\n\nBy using such a sentence structure, the speaker articulates the idea of a disability as a secondary attribute, not a characteristic of a person's identity.\n\nThe term \"people-first language\" first appeared in 1988 as recommended by advocacy groups in the United States. The usage has been widely adopted by speech-language pathologists and researchers, with \"person who stutters\" (PWS) replacing \"stutterer\"\nAlthough it is believed that People-first language originated in the mental health community, its origin dates back to the Denver Principles (1983), which states, \"We condemn attempts to label us as \"victims,\" a term which implies defeat, and we are only occasionally \"patients,\" a term which implies passivity, helplessness, and dependence upon the care of others. We are \"People With AIDS.\"\n\nUse has been recommended in other increasingly common chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. Non-profit organizations, such as the Obesity Action Coalition have expanded advocacy for People-First Language to obesity. As of 2017, 5 U.S. medical societies had pledged for it, and use it in their communications: the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, The Obesity Society, American Society of Bariatric Physicians, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeon.\n\nThe most common alternative to person-first language is usually called identity-first language, as it places the identifying condition before the personal term. For example, while someone who prefers person-first language might ask to be called a \"person with autism\", someone who prefers identity-first language would ask to be called an \"autistic person\". There is no common term for use of identifying conditions as nouns, but it is not usually preferred apart from select communities, such as dwarfs. Others have proposed \"person-centered language\", which, instead of being a replacement linguistic rule, promotes prioritizing the preferences of those who are being referred to and argues for greater nuance in the language used to describe people and groups of people.\n\nThe SapirâWhorf hypothesis is the basis for ideologically motivated linguistic prescriptivism. The hypothesis states that language use significantly shapes perceptions of the world and forms ideological preconceptions.\n\nIn people-first language, preconceptions judged to be negative arise from placing the name of the condition before the term \"person\" or \"people\", such as \"white person\" or \"Jewish people\". Proponents of people-first language argue that this places an undue focus on the condition which distracts from the humanity of the members of the community of people with the condition.\n\nIn a 2008 publication about an experiment on teen's perception of people with disabilities, scientists gathered evidence to prove why people-first language, or word order, matters. the scientists divided teenagers from a summer camp into two groups; one group was asked questions using the term \"people with epilepsy\" and the other group was asked using the term \"epileptics\". They asked the teenagers questions such as \"Do you think that people with epilepsy/epileptics have more difficulties at school?\" and \"Do you have prejudice toward people with epilepsy/epileptics?\" The studied showed that the teenagers had a higher \"stigma perception\" on the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy when it came to \"epileptics\", as opposed to \"people with epilepsy\".\n\nSome U.S. organizations like the United Spinal Association have published disability etiquette guides, which prescribe people-first language. The 2007 \"For Dummies\" guide to etiquette prescribed people-first language.\n\nAs of 2017, the rules of people-first language have become normative in US governmental institutions on the federal (e.g. CDC) and on state levels in the heath departments' Developmental Disabilities Councils e.g. Michigan West Virginia Idaho, Missouri Georgia, or Texas.\n\nAs of 2017, it has been a requirement in AMA Manual of Style for academic journals.\n\nCritics have objected that people-first language is awkward, repetitive and makes for tiresome writing and reading. C. Edwin Vaughan, a sociologist and longtime activist for the blind, argues that since \"in common usage positive pronouns usually precede nouns\", \"the awkwardness of the preferred language focuses on the disability in a new and potentially negative way\". According to Vaughan, it only serves to \"focus on disability in an ungainly new way\" and \"calls attention to a person as having some type of 'marred identity in terms of Erving Goffman's theory of identity.\n\nIn 1993, the National Federation of the Blind adopted a resolution condemning people-first language. The resolution dismissed the notion that \"the word 'person' must invariably precede the word 'blind' to emphasize the fact that a blind person is first and foremost a person\" as \"totally unacceptable and pernicious\" and resulting in the exact opposite of its purported aim, since \"it is overly defensive, implies shame instead of true equality, and portrays the blind as touchy and belligerent\".\n\nIn deaf culture, person-first language has long been rejected. Instead, deaf culture uses deaf-first language since being culturally deaf is a source of positive identity and pride. Correct terms to use for this group would be \"Deaf person\" or \"hard of hearing person\". The phrase \"hearing impaired\" is not acceptable to most Deaf or hard of hearing people because it emphasizes what they cannot do.\n\nAutism activist Jim Sinclair rejects person-first language, on the grounds that saying \"person with autism\" suggests that autism can be separated from the person. Other advocacy groups and organizations such as Autism Speaks, The Arc and Disability Is Natural support using people-first language.\n\nHowever, identity-first language is preferred by many autistic people and organizations run by them. One of those organizations, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, has this to say on the issue:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1562201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1562201", "title": "Personalism", "text": "Personalism\n\nPersonalism is a philosophical school of thought searching to describe the uniqueness of 1) God as Supreme Person or 2) a human person in the world of nature, specifically in relation to animals. One of the main points of interest of personalism is human subjectivity or self-consciousness, experienced in a person's own acts and inner happeningsâin \"everything in the human being that is internal, whereby each human being is an eyewitness of its own self\".\n\nOther principles:\nAccording to idealism there is one more principle\n\nWriting in the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", noted scholar Thomas D. Williams cites a plurality of \"schools\" holding to a \"personalist\" ethic and \"Weltanschauung\", arguing:\nThus, according to Williams, one ought to keep in mind that although there may be dozens of theorists and social activists in the West adhering to the rubric \"personalism,\" their particular foci may, in fact, be asymptotic, and even diverge at material junctures.\n\nNikolai Alexandrovich Berdyaev (1874â1948) was a Russian religious and political philosopher who emphasized human freedom, subjectivity and creativity.\n\nIn France, philosopher Emmanuel Mounier (1905â1950) was the leading proponent of personalism, around which he founded the review \"Esprit\", which exists to this day. Under Jean-Marie Domenach's direction, it criticized the use of torture during the Algerian War. Personalism was seen as an alternative to both Liberalism and Marxism, which respected human rights and the human personality without indulging in excessive collectivism. Mounier's personalism had an important influence in France, including in political movements, such as Marc Sangnier's \"Ligue de la jeune RÃ©publique\" (Young Republic League) founded in 1912.\n\nA Jewish anti-fascist, Zeev Sternhell, has identified personalism with fascism in a very controversial manner, claiming that Mounier's personalism movement \"shared ideas and political reflexes with fascism\". He argued that Mounier's \"revolt against individualism and materialism\" would have led him to share the ideology of fascism.\n\nFollowing on the writings of Dorothy Day, a distinctively Christian personalism developed in the 20th century. Its main theorist was the Polish philosopher Karol WojtyÅa (later Pope John Paul II). In his work, \"Love and Responsibility\", first published in 1960, WojtyÅa proposed what he termed 'the personalistic norm':\nThis brand of personalism has come to be known as \"Thomistic\" because of its efforts to square modern notions regarding the person with the teachings of Thomas Aquinas. WojtyÅa was influenced by the ethical personalism of German phenomenologist Max Scheler.\n\nA first principle of Christian personalism is that persons are not to be used, but to be respected and loved. In \"Gaudium et spes\", the Second Vatican Council formulated what has come to be considered the key expression of this personalism: \"man is the only creature on earth that God willed for its own sake and he cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself\".\n\nThis formula for self-fulfillment offers a key for overcoming the dichotomy frequently felt between personal \"realization\" and the needs or demands of social life. Personalism also implies inter-personalism, as Benedict XVI stresses in \"Caritas in Veritate\":\nPersonalism flourished in the early 20th century at Boston University in a movement known as Boston personalism led by theologian Borden Parker Bowne. Bowne emphasized the person as the fundamental category for explaining reality and asserted that only persons are real. He stood in opposition to certain forms of materialism which would describe persons as mere particles of matter. For example, against the argument that persons are insignificant specks of dust in the vast universe, Bowne would say that it is impossible for the entire universe to exist apart from a person to experience it. Ontologically speaking, the person is âlargerâ than the universe because the universe is but one small aspect of the person who experiences it. Personalism affirms the existence of the soul. Most personalists assert that God is real and that God is a person (or as in Christian trinitarianism, three 'persons', although it is important to note that the nonstandard meaning of the word 'person' in this theological context is significantly different from Bowne's usage).\n\nBowne also held that persons have value (see axiology, value theory, and ethics). In declaring the absolute value of personhood, he stood firmly against certain forms of philosophical naturalism (including social Darwinism) which sought to reduce the value of persons. He also stood against certain forms of positivism which sought to render ethical and theological discourse meaningless and dismiss talk of God \"a priori\".\n\nGeorgia Harkness was a major Boston personalist theologian. Francis John McConnell was a major second-generation advocate of Boston personalism who sought to apply the philosophy to social problems of his time.\n\nGeorge Holmes Howison taught a metaphysical theory called personal idealism or California personalism. Howison maintained that both impersonal, monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the moral freedom experienced by persons. To deny the freedom to pursue the ideals of truth, beauty, and \"benignant love\" is to undermine every profound human venture, including science, morality, and philosophy. Thus, even the Personalistic Idealism of Borden Parker Bowne and Edgar S. Brightman and the Realistic Personal Theism of Thomas Aquinas are inadequate, for they make finite persons dependent for their existence upon an infinite Person and support this view by an unintelligible doctrine of creatio ex nihilo.\n\nThe Personal Idealism of Howison was explained in his book \"The Limits of Evolution and Other Essays Illustrating the Metaphysical Theory of Personal Idealism\". Howison created a radically democratic notion of personal idealism that extended all the way to God, who was no more the ultimate monarch, no longer the only ruler and creator of the universe, but the ultimate democrat in eternal relation to other eternal persons. Howison found few disciples among the religious, for whom his thought was heretical; the non-religious, on the other hand, considered his proposals too religious; only J. M. E. McTaggart's idealist atheism or Thomas Davidson's apeirotheism seem to resemble Howison's personal idealism.\n\nPhilosopher Immanuel Kant, though not formally considered a personalist, made an important contribution to the personalist cause by declaring that a person is not to be valued merely as a means to the ends of other people, but that he possesses dignity (an absolute inner worth) and is to be valued as an end in himself.\n\nCatholic philosopher and theologian John Henry Newman, has been posited as a main proponent of personalism by John Crosby of Franciscan University in his book \"Personalist Papers\". Crosby notes Newman's personal approach to faith, as outlined in \"Grammar of Assent\" as a main source of Newman's personalism.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was greatly influenced by personalism in his studies at Boston University. King came to agree with the position that only personality is real. It solidified his understanding of God as a personal god. It also gave him a metaphysical basis for his belief that all human personality has dignity and worth.\n\nPaul RicÅur explicitly sought to support personalist movement by developing its theoretical foundation and expanding it with a new personalist social ethic. However, he later had significant disagreements with Mournier and criticized other personalist writers for insufficient conceptual clarity. RicÅur also disagreed with the other personalists in asserting the signfiicance of justice as a value in its own right and gave this primary in the public sphere, whereas Mournier characterized all relationships including public and political ones in terms of love and friendship.\n\nPope John Paul II was also influenced by the personalism advocated by Christian existentialist philosopher SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard. Before his election to the Roman papacy, he wrote \"Person and Act\" (sometimes mistranslated as \"The Acting Person\"), a philosophical work suffused with personalism. Though he remained well within the traditional stream of Catholic social and individual morality, his explanation of the origins of moral norms, as expressed in his encyclicals on economics and on sexual morality, for instance, was largely drawn from a personalist perspective. His writings as Roman pontiff, of course, influenced a generation of Catholic theologians since who have taken up personalist perspectives on the theology of the family and social order.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22116815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22116815", "title": "Rights-based approach to development", "text": "Rights-based approach to development\n\nRights-based approach to development is an approach to development promoted by many development agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to achieve a positive transformation of power relations among the various development actors. This practice blurs the distinction between human rights and economic development. There are two stakeholder groups in rights-based developmentâthe rights holders (who do not experience full rights) and the duty bearers (the institutions obligated to fulfill the holders' rights). Rights-based approaches aim at strengthening the capacity of duty bearers and empower the rights holders.\n\nHuman rights came into global discourse after the United Nations passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. This was the first global recognition that all humans are inherente United Nations endorsement of democracy had little to do with the UN's stance on development. Human rights became one of the major debates between the West and Communist states during the Cold War. Cold War dichotomy of right versus left defined power of the state and of the individual in aspects of society based on political affiliation. The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet bloc left Western values and ideas, which remains one of the main ideologies of the world.\n\nHuman rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, used to focus primarily on documenting human rights violations on the civil and political level. No longer do these organizations focus solely on human rights violations, but also on social, economic, and cultural rights. The evolution of human rights organizations and development organizations and the western idea that rights are asserted through responsibilities, duties, transparency, trust, and accountability have led to the development of the rights-based approach. In 1993 the UN held the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna; during this conference they developed the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, where they linked democracy, human rights, sustainability and development. This made the Cold War division of Civil and Political Rights and Economic Social and Cultural rights interdependent. This further led to the linkage between human rights and development and enabled policy makers and developers to incorporate a rights-based approach into their policies.\n\nIn 1997, the Secretary General to the United Nations called to mainstream human rights into all work of the United Nations. Then in 2003, various organizations and agencies met to develop a \"Common Understanding\" of a human rights-based approach. Giving six main principles:\n\nThe United Nations developed this guide to address the significant changes occurring in the international development community with the adoption of human rights in development work. Since the UN published their standards and steps to a rights-based approach to development, many bilateral donor agencies, such as CIDA and DFID, and international NGOs such as CARE and Oxfam have taken similar steps.\n\nThe welfare model has been rooted into Western developmental practices since the 20th century. In the welfare model, poverty is defined as the absence of a public good or knowledge. If the state or another vehicle, such as an NGO, provides the absent good, then poverty can be alleviated and development will occur. Billions of dollars have been poured into this approach, however despite some achievements there has not been success with this model. The gap between the rich and poor is widening and according to the \"World Development Report\", nearly half of the world's population live on less than $2 a day.\n\nThis model lacks a way to hold governments accountable for their actions or inaction. It fails to address governments' inability to fulfill their citizens' rights either because of funding or knowledge. It also constructs the poor as objects of charity, predetermining their roles in civic society.\n\nDue to the failures of the welfare model, NGOs reevaluated and transitioned more towards a rights-based approach to development. In this model, instead of the poor being constructed as charity they would be constructed as actors or rights holders. The NGOs' role is to help the poor overcome obstacles blocking their rights and give governments the tools and training to provide these rights.\n\nThe inclusion of human rights into development discourse has also brought along a certain language of rights. This brings a moral resonance to development rhetoric and makes it hard to avoid in today's discourse. Rights are defined as entitlements that belong to all human beings regardless of race, ethnicity, or socio-economic class; all humans, therefore, are rights holders, and it is someoneâs duty to provide these rights. Who is responsible to give these rights, in other words the duty bearers, has been largely debated. In rights-based approach it is the personâs government that assumes the duty bearer position, but most of the time the said government does not have the resources to fulfill this role. This is where the NGOs come and try to help these governments fulfill their roles and duties to their people by giving them resources. These resources can be monetary or more sustainable such as training to government officials.\n\nCurrently there is an under-fulfillment of human rights, which has been directly linked with poverty. Poverty includes the assessment of standard of living, health, and well being. These are social and economic human rights,which have just recently been included in development discourse. First generation rights, or civil and political rights, have dominated public policy in the past. However, with poverty on the rise and public policy failing, social and economic rights are becoming increasingly important in development of policies.\n\nAffluent or rich countries feel they should help the poor out of charity or humanity. Rights-based approach works to shift the paradigm away from charity and towards moral duty imposed on the world through the international consensus of human rights. NGOs are adopting the âfull spectrumâ of human rights into their development policies. Using human rights as their driving force they are using rhetoric to develop a modus operandi that made political human rights effective.\n\nCapacity building is the ability of individuals, institutions, and societies to perform functions and solve problems. A goal of rights-based approach to development is to increase the capacity of both the duty bearers and the rights holders.\n\nKey principles to increase capacity are sought to build upon existing capacities, ensure national engagement and ownership, and adjust to countries' needs as development occurs. In this method, the duty bearers and the rights holders both have an active role in development. The duty bearers are accountable for respecting, protecting, and fulfilling human rights; while the rights holders need to ask what they should do to help promote and defend their freedoms. This action keeps their governments accountable for creating sustainability.\n\nCapacity building is an ongoing process, and is often intangible. This is why many nonprofit organizations have not been able to engage or transition more towards capacity building. Donors like to see tangible results or they like to see where their money is going. Also the success of nonprofit and NGOs is shown through tangible results, leading organizations more toward service delivery than capacity building.\n\nThe international recognition of human rights has been largely debated; there is acknowledgment but not institutional enforcement. NGOs that use a rights-based approach in policy decisions have a large problem with gaining legal status or enforcement of the human rights they are defending. They rely on publicly criticizing countries who make these violations.\n\nThere have been many international legal documents developed by the United Nations on behalf of human rights issues that all members of the UN have to abide by.\n\n\nSince the 1948 adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the international community has developed a legally binding framework for the protection of human rights. These legal documents have created norms and standards internationally.\n\nThe social contract theory proclaims that rights such as life, liberty, and property belong to the individuals and not to society. These rights existed before individuals entered civil society and by entering civil society, one is agreeing to a social contract. In this contract, the state has the right to enforce natural rights. The state breaks this contract if the rights of the people are broken or not secured. Today, social contracts come in the form of national constitutions, which provide rules explaining and protecting individual rights.\n\nThese rights are inherent, they are not granted by authority or any overriding principle. Human rights are recognized by all people making it universal and fundamental.\n\nWithin the realm of rights-based approach there is a theoretical relation to downward accountability in relation to development. This theory states what the rights are, who deserves the rights and what actors are responsible for ensuring these rights are secured. In development there is a focus on the responsibility of actors. Therefore, in relation to downward accountability it creates a power dynamic in development aid. NGDOs (non-governmental development organizations) focus on downward accountability to ensure the intended beneficiaries are being allowed their rights.\n\nSince the mid-1990s there has been a trend for NGOs and development donor agencies to combine the idea of development and human rights into the human rights-based approach to development. Although there has been an undertone of development within the association with human rights earlier than this time; it has been since the end of the 20th century when there were known links of combining development and human rights into the same efforts. This practice includes NGOs that are geared towards development as well as human rights. The donor agencies are now helping to fund this combination of human rights with development to become as effective as possible. Even human rights-based approach to development theories were involved with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). MDGs are the goals set forth by the UN member states to work for the alleviation of extreme poverty, fighting of disease, and other global problems.\n\nThere have been 3 growing trends in relation to NGOs and the rights-based approach to development that have been implemented into practice. The first trend is focusing attention onto a rights-based approach to development. The second trend is the joint advocacy by development NGOs and human rights NGOs to work together towards a common goal. The third trend is to expand the attention to economic and social rights as well. The Human Rights ideal imparts the international benchmark that states can have related and common ideas. To have internationally understood human rights allows NGOs, governments, and corporations to be held accountable for their actions. This change in focus on human rights-based approach to development challenges the market-dominated view that was popular during the 1980s into a view focused on the relationship between human rights and development.\n\nThese new trends have a significant impact and a possible paradigm shift. From looking at development as a gift turning to development as a human right puts the responsibility on the government. However, this is not just the home country, the responsibility of development resides in the hands of wealthy countries as well. To switch to a rights-based approach to development would then lead to using internationally agreed upon human rights as a responsibility of governments to provide. Within this theory development will no longer be viewed as a gift or a need, but rather a right that states and governments are held accountable for.\n\nNGOs that have implemented rights-based approach to development have done so with four main principles to follow. These principles are human rights-based approach design of their programs, education about rights-based approach, rights to participation, and accountability. Human rights-based approach design of their programs begins with analysis of the unfulfilled human rights. It then commits programs and funds to fulfill these missing human rights. The design of these programs also stresses that the donations are not a gift but rather that the people are finally receiving the human rights treatment they deserve. Education of human rights and the programs that are being implemented is important. The education is to inform the beneficiaries of their human rights as well as the ways in which NGOs and other organizations are attempting to increase their human rights. Education is also to inform the governments, international organizations and donor agencies that are dealing with human rights their roles and responsibilities. Then there is the principle of rights to participation. This deals with the idea that beneficiaries should be included when implementing programs on their behalf. Organizations should include the beneficiaries to help empower. Then there is the principle of accountability which is designed to have standards of human rights and development. It is also designed for NGOs, international organizations, donor agencies and governments to be held to a higher standard of responsibility.\n\nAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch are two NGOs that have been involved traditionally with advocacy in relation to human rights. These NGOs have expanded from traditional political rights to expand to ESC rights, which includes economic and social rights as well.\n\nOxfam is an NGO that has adopted the rights-based approach to development. Oxfam vowed to continue to provide relief while also addressing the structural causes of poverty and injustice. This approach combines poverty, human rights, development and trade all within the same realm. Oxfam focuses a broad approach to the causes of poverty and injustice. This NGO also would like to put economic and social justice at the top of the world agenda.\n\nThe shift towards a rights-based approach to development forced Oxfam to reexamine its funding, a deeper examination into the state's role as a duty bearer, and using civil society as a vehicle for citizens to empowered to stand up for their rights. Oxfam also had to evaluate their development practices and business model.\n\nThere has been a shift from focusing upon civil human rights to human rights of social and economic areas. There are many NGOs that are now focusing upon the ESC (economic and social rights) while creating and implementing programs. Human Rights Watch is one of these NGOs that has implemented a focus on ESC rights. These rights focus on alleviating poverty and implementing equal social and economic rights in all levels of society.\n\nNGOs that have implemented these ESC rights are focusing much of their attention on increasing the standard of living to be healthy and safe. This includes ideas of water rights in areas that lack clean drinking water and health rights that include availability of medicine and doctors. This would increase the impoverished peoples' standard of living by increasing basic living needs and access.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s when rights-based approach to development began to be a popular discourse many aid donor agencies began to support this view towards development. Their intentions are to implement support for programs to incorporate both development and human rights in an interdisciplinary fashion.\n\nMajor donor agencies that have adopted the rights-based approach to development include UNICEF, UNDP (United Nations Development Program), UNFPA, ILO, Swedish Sida, Norwegian NOrad, British DFID, and the Australian aid agency. Other UN programs have also adopted the rights-based approach to development. This new development framework leads to moral legitimacy and social justice.\n\nUNDP The United Nations Development Program began in the late 1990s to raise awareness about this new rights-based approach viewpoint to development. UNDP specifically focused upon the interactions of social and economic rights. Their focus was to help develop policy decisions related to social and economic rights in association with development. In 2000 UNDP published \"Human Rights and Human Development\" a document that provided their intentions and strategies based on their implementation of rights-based approach to development. UNDP was also present at UN- sponsored conferences in relation to rights-based approach to development that included the UN Millennium Summit. UNDP also provides tools for governments and donor agencies to support the rights-based approach to development.\n\nUNICEF is another donor agency that has implemented the rights-based approach to development and its ideas. UNICEF has a more narrow focus on women's and children's rights. However, it has still implemented rights-based approach strategies with the programs UNICEF is helping to fund.\n\nNGOs transitioning to rights-based approach have to redefine missions, test new methodologies, reallocate funding, and train staff. To do this there are a few steps NGOs have to take in developing programs and campaigns around rights-based approach.\n\nFirst, NGOs need to create program ideas. These are created based on an analysis of rights within a certain country. The analysis is necessary to identify and give priority to the most deprived in society. It is then the goal of a rights-based approach to empower those people. This step also identifies and reviews the capacity of the duty-bearers. It also tries to understand the relationship between the rights holders and the duty bearers.\n\nThe next step is to educate both the rights holders and the duty bearers by articulating the rights of citizens and duty of the government. This is an important step so both parties are knowledgeable about their individual rights, responsibilities, and roles in society. This enables effective communication necessary between rights holders and duty bearers.\n\nAfter an extensive situation analysis, a project or program is developed. The program needs to address human rights deficits related to certain groups, communities, or countries facing abuses or discrimination. Baselines and benchmarks are set, which create transparency and accountability in the project. Goals are also created during this step in order to analyze the program's effectiveness in a human rights context at the end of the project. Finally, NGOs encourage control over the project by the affected peoples, utilizing the Right to Participate principle.\n\nTo determine the effectiveness of a project, it is essential all inputs, outputs, goals, and outcomes are assessed through a human rights lens. The results should then be organized in a logframe, to show the clear results of the project.\n\nThis new development theory of rights-based approach has been met with positive feedback as well as criticism. There are thoughts that incorporating the language of human rights with development is just a change of terminology and doesnât change the programs being implemented. The ability for a state to implement public policy has been hindered due to the need to comply with economic and social rights (ESC rights). Development practices without combining them with human rights has been more effective in implementing and monitoring programs. Therefore, the need to combine human rights with development is not necessary for the beneficiaries.\n\nWhile there still is more positive feedback when dealing with rights-based approach to development there are still criticisms surrounding the focus on combining human rights with development. These criticisms stem from the idea that changing the terminology will not increase NGOs' productivity or even necessarily the NGOs' programs that are being implemented. Just by stating that the government and corporations should now be responsible for development as an issue of human rights does not mean that any changes in procedures will occur.\n\nAnother criticism that has been brought up is that there have been many NGOs that have combined the ideas of human rights along with development before the term \"rights-based approach to development\" was coined. There has been a natural linkage between development and rights and there has frequently been pressure on states and governments to be involved with issues of human rights as well as development. Therefore, in many cases, changing the terminology will not increase the effectiveness of the state.\n\nThere have been other criticisms of the rights-based approach to development because the ideas and theories have not been narrowed. Rights-based approach is a vague term that doesn't clearly represent a set of ideas. There is a multiplicity of explanations about rights-based approach that poses problems when discussing how NGOs, donor agencies or UN programs will try to implement these ideas into their programs.\n\nOne example of implementation is within the realm of Gender and Development. Women's rights have long been fighting for equal rights and by implementing rights-based approach to development it changes some of the ways women's equal rights were being implemented effectively into society. There have been two main paths relating to inequalities of gender; these include human rights organizations that focus on women's equal rights and organizations focused on gender and development. By converging these two different ideas it can create problems with the experts and the way the programs are being implemented.\n\nThere is also disparity between NGOs in the north and NGOs in the south between their viewpoints and ideas in which to implement programs in relation to development and human rights separately. By trying to combine these two discourses across the globe can create problems of fragmentation of ideas and programs. If fragmentation were to occur it would be the opposite intention of the NGOs that were trying to combine human rights and development into similar programs.\n\n"}
{"id": "5341555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5341555", "title": "Scienter", "text": "Scienter\n\nFor example, if a man sells a car with brakes that do not work to his friend, but the seller does not know about the brake problem, the seller then has no \"scienter\". If he sells the car and knew of the problem before he sold the car, he has \"scienter\".\n\nThe word has the same root as \"science\", the Latin \"scienter\" (knowingly), from \"scire\" (to know, to separate one thing from another).\n\nThe scienter action is a category within tort law in some common law jurisdictions that deals with the damage done by an animal directly to a human. It had a long history in English law until it was abolished by the Animals Act 1971. An action in the common law jurisdictions in which it has not been extinguished by statute is in addition to the torts of negligence and nuisance or more bespoke torts like cattle trespass. If an animal is known to behave in a certain way and is expressed on a person causing injury, an action can be taken in this tort, which also is not available in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia or New Zealand. In those jurisdictions, the actions involving animals need to be in nuisance or negligence. \n\nTo be successful, the plaintiff needs to take action against the person in control of the animal. It is strict liability, requiring no more than proof of injury, the animal's having a problematic trait, and the knowledge of the person in control about the trait in the animal. Strict liability means that there is no need to argue fault in the form of wilful intent or negligence on the part of the animal or its controller. The only defence is if it can be proved the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of injury by their actions, or if the plaintiff was the cause of the injury. \n\nIt is common to distinguish between harmless animals and wild animals, as no scienter is needed for wild animals. Animals are classed as wild or harmless on the basis of species or kind, not on the basis of being a tame individual. An elephant is considered wild regardless of its use. The scienter action is referred to in \"Rylands v. Fletcher\" in that one who keeps a wild thing \"must keep it at his peril\" to make reference to part of Justice Colin Blackburn's comment.\n\nScienter is generally used as a necessary condition of certain causes of civil action and as a standard for civil liability or criminal guilt. For instance, Section 1960 of Title 18 of the United States Code provides a \"scienter\" condition, requiring that the accused \"knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns\" a prohibited type of business.\n\nThe concept of scienter is uniformly expressed in the text of the U.S. Code as the word \"know\", appearing as \"knowingly\", \"actual knowledge\", \"known\", \"knowledge fairly implied\", etc. The word \"scienter\" is not used in the text of the U.S. Code, although it appears once in a section title. This use reflects the development of American law speaking plainly instead of employing Latin phrases of legal English.\n\n\"Scienter\" is also an element of the contract law cause of action for breach of contract in which the aggrieved party alleges some destruction of the meeting of the minds, also known as mutual assent, because of fraud, misrepresentation or duress per minas.\n\n\"Scienter\" can also be used as a defense to a breach of contract lawsuit.\n\nIn the United States, to prevail in a securities fraud claim under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendant acted with \"scienter\".\n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 added the requirement that a plaintiff must plead facts giving rise to a \"strong inference\" of \"scienter\". The meaning of \"scienter\" under the 1995 law has been very controversial since its enactment. The United States Supreme Court issued a decision that clarified what was to be understood as a \"strong inference.\" In \"Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, LTD\" (21 June 2007), an 8-1 ruling of the Court defined the standard that the plaintiff had to meet to proceed with a securities fraud litigation. A complaint must show \"cogent and compelling evidence\" of \"scienter\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1986011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986011", "title": "Simply typed lambda calculus", "text": "Simply typed lambda calculus\n\nThe simply typed lambda calculus (formula_1), a form\nof type theory, is a typed interpretation of the lambda calculus with only one type constructor: formula_2 that builds function types. It is the canonical and simplest example of a typed lambda calculus. The simply typed lambda calculus was originally introduced by Alonzo Church in 1940 as an attempt to avoid paradoxical uses of the untyped lambda calculus, and it exhibits many desirable and interesting properties.\n\nThe term \"simple type\" is also used to refer to extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus such as products, coproducts or natural numbers (System T) or even full recursion (like PCF). In contrast, systems which introduce polymorphic types (like System F) or dependent types (like the Logical Framework) are not considered \"simply typed\". The former, except full recursion, are still considered \"simple\" because the Church encodings of such structures can be done using only formula_2 and suitable type variables, while polymorphism and dependency cannot.\n\nIn this article, we use formula_4 and formula_5 to range over types. Informally, the \"function type\" formula_6 refers to the type of functions that, given an input of type formula_4, produce an output of type formula_5.\nBy convention, formula_2 associates to the right: we read formula_10 as formula_11.\n\nTo define the types, we begin by fixing a set of \"base types\", formula_12. These are sometimes called \"atomic types\" or \"type constants\". With this fixed, the syntax of types is:\n\nFor example, formula_14, generates an infinite set of types starting with formula_15formula_16formula_17formula_18formula_19formula_20\n\nWe also fix a set of \"term constants\" for the base types. For example, we might assume a base type nat, and the term constants could be the natural numbers. In the original presentation, Church used only two base types: formula_21 for \"the type of propositions\" and formula_22 for \"the type of individuals\". The type formula_21 has no term constants, whereas formula_22 has one term constant. Frequently the calculus with only one base type, usually formula_21, is considered.\n\nThe syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus is essentially that of the lambda calculus itself. We write formula_26 to denote that the variable formula_27 is of type formula_5. The term syntax, in BNF, is then:\n\nwhere formula_30 is a term constant.\n\nThat is, \"variable reference\", \"abstractions\", \"application\", and \"constant\". A variable reference formula_27 is \"bound\" if it is inside of an abstraction binding formula_27. A term is \"closed\" if there are no unbound variables.\n\nCompare this to the syntax of untyped lambda calculus:\n\nWe see that in typed lambda calculus every function (\"abstraction\") must specify the type of its argument.\n\nTo define the set of well typed lambda terms of a given type, we will define a typing relation between terms and types. First, we introduce \"typing contexts\" or \"typing environments\" formula_34, which are sets of typing assumptions. A \"typing assumption\" has the form formula_35, meaning formula_27 has type formula_4.\n\nThe \"typing relation\" formula_38 indicates that formula_39 is a term of type formula_4 in context formula_41. In this case formula_39 is said to be \"well-typed\" (having type formula_4). Instances of the typing relation are called \"typing judgements\". The validity of a typing judgement is shown by providing a \"typing derivation\", constructed using typing rules (wherein the premises above the line allow us to derive the conclusion below the line). Simply-typed lambda calculus uses these rules:\n\nIn words,\n\nExamples of closed terms, \"i.e.\" terms typable in the empty context, are:\nThese are the typed lambda calculus representations of the basic combinators of combinatory logic.\n\nEach type formula_5 is assigned an order, a number formula_68. For base types, formula_69; for function types, formula_70. That is, the order of a type measures the depth of the most left-nested arrow. Hence:\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two different ways of assigning meaning to the simply typed lambda calculus, as to typed languages more generally, sometimes called \"intrinsic\" vs. \"extrinsic\", or \"Church-style\" vs. \"Curry-style\".\nAn intrinsic/Church-style semantics only assigns meaning to well-typed terms, or more precisely, assigns meaning directly to typing derivations. This has the effect that terms differing only by type annotations can nonetheless be assigned different meanings. For example, the identity term formula_73 on integers and the identity term formula_74 on booleans may mean different things. (The classic intended interpretations\nare the identity function on integers and the identity function on boolean values.)\nIn contrast, an extrinsic/Curry-style semantics assigns meaning to terms regardless of typing, as they would be interpreted in an untyped language. In this view, formula_73 and formula_74 mean the same thing (\"i.e.\", the same thing as formula_77).\n\nThe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic semantics is sometimes associated with the presence or absence of annotations on lambda abstractions, but strictly speaking this usage is imprecise. It is possible to define a Curry-style semantics on annotated terms simply by ignoring the types (\"i.e.\", through type erasure), as it is possible to give a Church-style semantics on unannotated terms when the types can be deduced from context (\"i.e.\", through type inference). The essential difference between intrinsic and extrinsic approaches is just whether the typing rules are viewed as defining the language, or as a formalism for verifying properties of a more primitive underlying language. Most of the different semantic interpretations discussed below can be seen through either a Church or Curry perspective.\n\nThe simply typed lambda calculus has the same equational theory of Î²Î·-equivalence as untyped lambda calculus, but subject to type restrictions. The equation for beta reduction\nholds in context formula_41 whenever formula_80 and formula_81, while the equation for eta reduction\nholds whenever formula_83 and formula_27 does not appear free in formula_85.\n\nLikewise, the operational semantics of simply typed lambda calculus can be fixed as for the untyped lambda calculus, using call by name, call by value, or other evaluation strategies. As for any typed language, type safety is a fundamental property of all of these evaluation strategies. Additionally, the strong normalization property described below implies that any evaluation strategy will terminate on all simply typed terms.\n\nThe simply typed lambda calculus (with formula_86-equivalence) is the internal language of Cartesian closed categories (CCCs), as was first observed by Lambek. Given any specific CCC, the basic types of the corresponding lambda calculus are just the objects, and the terms are the morphisms. Conversely, every simply typed lambda calculus gives a CCC whose objects are the types, and morphisms are equivalence classes of terms.\n\nTo make the correspondence clear, a type constructor for the Cartesian product is typically added to the above. To preserve the categoricity of the Cartesian product, one adds type rules for \"pairing\", \"projection\", and a \"unit term\". Given two terms formula_87 and formula_88, the term formula_89 has type formula_90. Likewise, if one has a term formula_91, then there are terms formula_92 and formula_93 where the formula_94 correspond to the projections of the Cartesian product. The \"unit term\", of type 1, is written as formula_95 and vocalized as 'nil', is the final object. The equational theory is extended likewise, so that one has\nThis last is read as \"if t has type 1, then it reduces to nil\".\n\nThe above can then be turned into a category by taking the types as the objects. The morphisms formula_100 are equivalence classes of pairs formula_101 where \"x\" is a variable (of type formula_4) and \"t\" is a term (of type formula_5), having no free variables in it, except for (optionally) \"x\". Closure is obtained from currying and application, as usual.\n\nMore precisely, there exist functors between the category of Cartesian closed categories, and the category of simply-typed lambda theories.\n\nIt is common to extend this case to closed symmetric monoidal categories by using a linear type system. The reason for this is that the CCC is a special case of the closed symmetric monoidal category, which is typically taken to be the category of sets. This is fine for laying the foundations of set theory, but the more general topos seems to provide a superior foundation.\n\nThe simply typed lambda calculus is closely related to the implicational fragment of propositional intuitionistic logic, i.e., minimal logic, via the CurryâHoward isomorphism: terms correspond precisely to proofs in natural deduction, and inhabited types are exactly the tautologies of minimal logic.\n\nThe presentation given above is not the only way of defining the syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus. One alternative is to remove type annotations entirely (so that the syntax is identical to the untyped lambda calculus), while ensuring that terms are well-typed via HindleyâMilner type inference. The inference algorithm is terminating, sound, and complete: whenever a term is typable, the algorithm computes its type. More precisely, it computes the term's principal type, since often an unannotated term (such as formula_77) may have more than one type (formula_105, formula_106, etc., which are all instances of the principal type formula_107).\n\nAnother alternative presentation of simply typed lambda calculus is based on bidirectional type checking, which requires more type annotations than HindleyâMilner inference but is easier to describe. The type system is divided into two judgments, representing both \"checking\" and \"synthesis\", written formula_108 and formula_109 respectively. Operationally, the three components formula_41, formula_39, and formula_5 are all \"inputs\" to the checking judgment formula_108, whereas the synthesis judgment formula_109 only takes formula_41 and formula_39 as inputs, producing the type formula_5 as output. These judgments are derived via the following rules:\n\nObserve that rules [1]â[4] are nearly identical to rules (1)â(4) above, except for the careful choice of checking or synthesis judgments. These choices can be explained like so:\nObserve that the rules for synthesis are read top-to-bottom, whereas the rules for checking are read bottom-to-top. Note in particular that we do not need any annotation on the lambda abstraction in rule [3], because the type of the bound variable can be deduced from the type at which we check the function. Finally, we explain rules [5] and [6] as follows:\n\nBecause of these last two rules coercing between synthesis and checking, it is easy to see that any well-typed but unannotated term can be checked in the bidirectional system, so long as we insert \"enough\" type annotations. And in fact, annotations are needed only at Î²-redexes.\n\nGiven the standard semantics, the simply typed lambda calculus is strongly normalizing: that is, well-typed terms always reduce to a value, i.e., a formula_132 abstraction. This is because recursion is not allowed by the typing rules: it is impossible to find types for fixed-point combinators and the looping term formula_133. Recursion can be added to the language by either having a special operator formula_134of type formula_135 or adding general recursive types, though both eliminate strong normalization.\n\nSince it is strongly normalising, it is decidable whether or not a simply typed lambda calculus program halts: in fact, it \"always\" halts. We can therefore conclude that the language is \"not\" Turing complete.\n\n\n\n"}

For example, the set {0} is a singleton.\n\nThe term is also used for a 1-tuple (a sequence with one member).\n\nWithin the framework of ZermeloâFraenkel set theory, the axiom of regularity guarantees that no set is an element of itself. This implies that a singleton is necessarily distinct from the element it contains, thus 1 and {1} are not the same thing, and the empty set is distinct from the set containing only the empty set. A set such as <nowiki></nowiki> is a singleton as it contains a single element (which itself is a set, however, not a singleton).\n\nA set is a singleton if and only if its cardinality is . In von Neumann's set-theoretic construction of the natural numbers, the number 1 is \"defined\" as the singleton {0}.\n\nIn axiomatic set theory, the existence of singletons is a consequence of the axiom of pairing: for any set \"A\", the axiom applied to \"A\" and \"A\" asserts the existence of {\"A\", \"A\"}, which is the same as the singleton {\"A\"} (since it contains \"A\", and no other set, as an element).\n\nIf \"A\" is any set and \"S\" is any singleton, then there exists precisely one function from \"A\" to \"S\", the function sending every element of \"A\" to the single element of \"S\". Thus every singleton is a terminal object in the category of sets.\n\nA singleton has the property that every function from it to any arbitrary set is injective. The only non-singleton set with this property is the empty set.\n\nThe Bell number integer sequence counts the number of partitions of a set (), if singletons are excluded then the numbers are smaller ().\n\nStructures built on singletons often serve as terminal objects or zero objects of various categories:\n\nLet formula_1 be a class defined by an indicator function \nThen formula_1 is called a \"singleton\" if and only if there is some such that for all , \n\nThe following definition was introduced by Whitehead and Russell \nThe symbol formula_5âformula_8 denotes the singleton formula_9 and formula_10 denotes the class of objects identical with formula_8 aka formula_12. \nThis occurs as a definition in the introduction, which, in places, simplifies the argument in the main text, where it occurs as proposition 51.01 (p.357 ibid.).\nThe proposition is subsequently used to define the cardinal number 1 as\nThat is, 1 is the class of singletons.

It was first described in 1638 by Galileo Galilei in his \"Two New Sciences\" as the \"...ratio of two volumes is greater than the ratio of their surfaces\".\n\nThis principle states that, as a shape grows in size, its volume grows faster than its surface area. When applied to the real world this principle has many implications which are important in fields ranging from mechanical engineering to biomechanics. It helps explain phenomena including why large mammals like elephants have a harder time cooling themselves than small ones like mice, and why building taller and taller skyscrapers is increasingly difficult.\n\nThe squareâcube law can be stated as follows:\n\nRepresented mathematically:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the original surface area and formula_3 is the new surface area.\n\nwhere formula_5 is the original volume, formula_6 is the new volume, formula_7 is the original length and formula_8 is the new length.\n\nFor example, a cube with a side length of 1 meter has a surface area of 6Â m and a volume of 1Â m. If the dimensions of the cube were multiplied by 2, its surface area would be multiplied by the \"square\" of 2 and become 24Â m.

The larger (2m sides) cube has a surface area to volume ratio of (24/8) 3:1. As the dimensions increase, the volume will continue to grow faster than the surface area. Thus the squareâcube law. This principle applies to all solids.\n\nWhen a physical object maintains the same density and is scaled up, its volume and mass are increased by the cube of the multiplier while its surface area increases only by the square of said multiplier. This would mean that when the larger version of the object is accelerated at the same rate as the original, more pressure would be exerted on the surface of the larger object.\n\nConsider a simple example of a body of mass, M, having an acceleration, a, and surface area, A, of the surface upon which the accelerating force is acting. The force due to acceleration, formula_9 and the thrust pressure, formula_10.\n\nNow, consider the object be exaggerated by a multiplier factor = x so that it has a new mass, formula_11, and the surface upon which the force is acting has a new surface area, formula_12.\n\nThe new force due to acceleration formula_13 and the resulting thrust pressure,\n\nThus, just scaling up the size of an object, keeping the same material of construction (density), and same acceleration, would increase the thrust by the same scaling factor. This would indicate that the object would have less ability to resist stress and would be more prone to collapse while accelerating.\n\nThis is why large vehicles perform poorly in crash tests and why there are limits to how high buildings can be built. Similarly, the larger an object is, the less other objects would resist its motion, causing its deceleration.\n\n\n\nIf an animal were isometrically scaled up by a considerable amount, its relative muscular strength would be severely reduced, since the cross section of its muscles would increase by the \"square\" of the scaling factor while its mass would increase by the \"cube\" of the scaling factor. As a result of this, cardiovascular and respiratory functions would be severely burdened.\n\nIn the case of flying animals, the wing loading would be increased if they were isometrically scaled up, and they would therefore have to fly faster to gain the same amount of lift. Air resistance per unit mass is also higher for smaller animals, which is why a small animal like an ant cannot be seriously injured from impact with the ground after being dropped from any height.\n\nAs stated by J. B. S. Haldane, large animals do not look like small animals: an elephant cannot be mistaken for a mouse scaled up in size. This is due to allometric scaling: the bones of an elephant are necessarily proportionately much larger than the bones of a mouse, because they must carry proportionately higher weight. Haldane illustrates this in his seminal 1928 essay \"On Being the Right Size\" in referring to allegorical giants: \"...consider a man 60 feet high...Giant Pope and Giant Pagan in the illustrated \"Pilgrim's Progress:\" ...These monsters...weighed 1000 times as much as Christian. Every square inch of a giant bone had to support 10 times the weight borne by a square inch of human bone. As the average human thigh-bone breaks under about 10 times the human weight, Pope and Pagan would have broken their thighs every time they took a step.\" Consequently, most animals show allometric scaling with increased size, both among species and within a species. The giant creatures seen in monster movies (e.g., Godzilla or King Kong) are also unrealistic, as their sheer size would force them to collapse.\n\nHowever, the buoyancy of water negates to some extent the effects of gravity. Therefore, sea creatures can grow to very large sizes without the same musculoskeletal structures that would be required of similarly sized land creatures, and it is no coincidence that the largest animals to ever exist on earth are aquatic animals.\n\nThe metabolic rate of animals scales with a mathematical principle named quarter-power scaling according to the metabolic theory of ecology.\n\nMass transfer such as diffusion to smaller objects such as living cells is faster than diffusion to larger objects such as entire animals. Thus, in chemical processes that take place on a surface - rather than in the bulk - finer-divided material is more active. For example, the activity of a heterogeneous catalyst is higher when it is divided into finer particles.\n\nHeat production from a chemical process scales with the cube of the linear dimension (height, width) of the vessel, but the vessel surface area scales with only the square of the linear dimension. Consequently, larger vessels are much more difficult to cool. Also, large-scale piping for transferring hot fluids is difficult to simulate in small scale, because heat is transferred faster out from smaller pipes. Failure to take this into account in process design may lead to catastrophic thermal runaway.\n\n"}

Substantial forms are the source of properties, order, unity, identity, and information about objects.\n\nThe idea of substantial forms dominates ancient Greek philosophy and medieval philosophy, but has fallen out of favour in modern philosophy.\nThe idea of substantial forms has been abandoned for a mechanical, or \"bottom-up\" theory of organization. However, such mechanistic treatments have been criticized for the same reasons atomism has received criticism, viz., for merely denying the existence of certain kinds of substantial forms in favor of others (here, that of atoms, which are then thought to be arranged into things possessing accidental forms) and not denying substantial forms as such, an impossible move.\n\nPlato maintains in the \"Phaedo\" regarding our knowledge of equals:<br>\n\nAristotle was the first to distinguish between matter (\"hyle\") and form (\"morphe\"). For Aristotle, matter is the undifferentiated primal element: it is rather that from which things develop than a thing in itself. The development of particular things from this germinal matter consists in differentiation, the acquiring of particular forms of which the knowable universe consists (cf. Formal cause). The perfection of the form of a thing is its entelechy in virtue of which it attains its fullest realization of function (De anima, ii. 2). Thus the entelechy of the body is the soul. The origin of the differentiation process is to be sought in a prime mover, i.e. pure form entirely separate from all matter, eternal, unchangeable, operating not by its own activity but by the impulse which its own absolute existence excites in matter.\n\nBoth Platonic and Aristotelian forms appear in medieval philosophy.\n\nMedieval theologians, newly exposed to Aristotle's philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christianity, such as to the transubstantiation of the Eucharist's bread and wine to the body and blood of Jesus. Theologians such as Duns Scotus developed Christian applications of hylomorphism.\n\nThe Aristotelian conception of form was adopted by the Scholastics, to whom, however, its origin in the observation of the physical universe was an entirely foreign idea. The most remarkable adaptation is probably that of Aquinas, who distinguished the spiritual world with its subsistent forms (formae separatae) from the material with its inherent forms which exist only in combination with matter.\n\nDescartes, referring to substantial forms, says:\n\"\"[...] They were introduced by philosophers solely to account for the proper action of natural things, of which they were supposed to be the principles and bases ... But no natural action at all can be explained by these substantial forms, since their defenders admit that they are occult, and that they do not understand them themselves. If they say that some action proceeds from a substantial form, it is as if they said it proceeds from something they do not understand; which explains nothing. [...]\"\"\n\nLeibniz made efforts to return to forms. Substantial forms, in the strictest sense for Leibniz, are primitive active forces and are required for his metaphysics.\nIn the \"Discourse on Metaphysics\" (Â§10): \"[...] the belief in substantial forms has a certain basis in fact, but that these forms effect no changes in the phenomena and must not be employed for the explanation of particular events.

{"id": "1488056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1488056", "title": "Toubon Law", "text": "Toubon Law\n\nThe Toubon Law (full name: \"law 94-665 of 4 August 1994 relating to usage of the French language\") is a law of the French government mandating the use of the French language in official government publications, in all advertisements, in all workplaces, in commercial contracts, in some other commercial communication contexts, in all government-financed schools, and some other contexts.\n\nThe law does not concern private, non-commercial communications, such as non-commercial web publications by private bodies. It does not concern books, films, public speeches, and other forms of communications not constituting commercial activity. However, the law mandates the use of the French language in all broadcast audiovisual programs, with exceptions for musical works and \"original version\" films. Broadcast musical works are subject to quota rules under a related law whereby a minimum percentage of the songs on radio and television must be in the French language. \n\nThe law takes its common name from Jacques Toubon, who was Minister of Culture when it was passed, and who proposed the law to the National Assembly of France. A nickname is \"Loi Allgood\" â \"Allgood\" is a morpheme-for-morpheme translation of \"Toubon\" into English (\"All Good\" being a translation of \"Tout bon\") â as the law can largely be considered to have been enacted in reaction to the increasing usage of English in advertisements and other areas in France. As the law sought to strengthen French as the dominant language within the countries and her territories, the law also âcame under considerable attack from the European Commission which regarded its provisions as particularly offensive to the concept of free competition across national borders.â \n\nOne broad provision of the law applying to workplaces is that \"any document that contains obligations for the employee or provisions whose knowledge is necessary for the performance of one's work must be written in French.\" Among other things, this means that computer software developed outside France must have its user interface and instruction manuals translated into French to be legally used by companies in France. The law includes an exception that \"these provisions do not apply to documents coming from abroad\", but this exception has been interpreted narrowly by the appellate courts. For example, in 2006 a French subsidiary of a US company was given a hefty fine for delivering certain highly technical documents and software interfaces to its employees in the English language only, and this was upheld by the appellate court.\n\nAnother broad provision of the law is that it makes it mandatory for commercial advertisements and public announcements to be given in French. This does not rule out advertisements made in a foreign language: it is sufficient to provide a translation in a footnote. This was justified as a measure for the protection of the consumer. Additionally, product packaging must be in French, though, again, translation in multiple languages can be provided.\n\nA similar restrictionâthough implemented by primary legislation regulations and not as application of the Loi Toubonâapplies to product labeling: product labels should be intelligible and in French, though additional languages may be present. Some linguistic restrictions on product labeling were found to be incompatible with European law, particularly the directives concerning the freedom of movement of goods within the European Union. The French government then issued interpretation notes and amended regulations in order to comply.\n\nIn another provision, the law specifies obligations for public legal persons (government administrations, et al.), mandating the use of French in publications, or at least in summaries of publications. In France, it is a constitutional requirement that the public should be informed of the action of the government. Since the official language of France is French, it follows that the French public should be able to get official information in French.\n\nUnder the Toubon law, schools that do not use French as the medium of instruction are ineligible for government funding. This excludes the Breton language schools of Brittany.\n\nOther restrictions concern the use of French in academic conferences. These are largely ignored by many public institutions, especially in the \"hard\" scientific fields. The original restrictions on colloquia also applied to private bodies, but that was found unconstitutional prior to enactment, on grounds that they violated freedom of speech, and the final form of the law was modified accordingly.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, soon after the Toubon Law came into force, two French lobbying groupsâthe \"Association pour la DÃ©fense de la Langue FranÃ§aise\" and the \"L'Avenir de la Langue FranÃ§aise\"âfiled a complaint against Georgia Tech Lorraine, the Metz campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology. At the time of the complaint, all classes at this Lorraine school were conducted in English, and all course descriptions on its French Internet web site were in English only. The complaint invoked the Toubon Law to demand that the school's web site must be in French because the web site was effectively a commercial advertisement for the school's courses. Although the case was dismissed by the court on a minor legal technicality, and the lobbying groups chose to drop the matter, the school was moved to offer its French website in the French language in addition to English, although classes continued to be in English only.\n\nIn 2006, the French subsidiary of the US company General Electric Medical Systems was fined â¬500,000 plus an ongoing fine of â¬20,000 per day for not complying with the Toubon law.\n\n\n"}

Some philosophers pursued trichotomies.\n\nImportant trichotomies discussed by Aquinas include the causal principles (agent, patient, act), the potencies for the intellect (imagination, cogitative power, and memory and reminiscence), and the acts of the intellect (concept, judgment, reasoning), with all of those rooted in Aristotle; also the transcendentals of being (unity, truth, goodness) and the requisites of the beautiful (wholeness, harmony, radiance).\n\nKant expounded a table of judgments involving four three-way alternatives, in regard to (1) Quantity, (2) Quality, (3) Relation, (4) Modality, and, based thereupon, a table of four categories, named by the terms just listed, and each with three subcategories. Kant also adapted the Thomistic acts of intellect in his trichotomy of higher cognitionâ(a) understanding, (b) judgment, (c) reasonâwhich he correlated with his adaptation in the soul's capacitiesâ(a) cognitive faculties, (b) feeling of pleasure or displeasure, and (c) faculty of desireâof Tetens's trichotomy of feeling, understanding, will.\n\nHegel held that a thing's or idea's internal contradiction leads in a dialectical process to a new synthesis that makes better sense of the contradiction. The process is sometimes described as thesis, antithesis, synthesis. It is instanced across a pattern of trichotomies (e.g. being-nothingness-becoming, immediate-mediate-concrete, abstract-negative-concrete); such trichotomies are not just three-way classificatory divisions; they involve trios of elements functionally interrelated in a process. They are often called triads (but 'triad' does not have that as a fixed sense in philosophy generally).\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce built his philosophy on trichotomies and triadic relations and processes, and framed the \"Reduction Thesis\" that every predicate is essentially either monadic (quality), dyadic (relation of reaction or resistance), or triadic (representational relation), and never genuinely and irreducibly tetradic or larger.\n\n"}
{"id": "11774990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11774990", "title": "Upcycling", "text": "Upcycling\n\nUpcycling, also known as creative reuse, is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless, or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.\n\nUpcycling is the opposite of downcycling, which is the other face of the recycling process. Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials of lesser quality. Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material.\n\nThe term \"downcycling\" was first used in print in an article in SalvoNEWS by Thornton Kay quoting Reiner Pilz and published in 1994. \n\"Upsizing\" was the title of the German edition of a book about upcycling first published in English in 1998 by Gunter Pauli and given the revised title of \"Upcycling\" in 1999. The German edition was adapted to the German language and culture by Johannes F. Hartkemeyer, then Director of the Volkshochschule in OsnabrÃ¼ck. The concept was later incorporated by William McDonough and Michael Braungart in their 2002 book \"\". They state that the goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new raw materials when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, air pollution, water pollution and even greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThis is a significant step towards regenerative design culture where the end products are cleaner, healthier, and usually have a better value than the material inputs.\n\nFor example, during the recycling process of plastics other than those used to create bottles, many different types of plastics are mixed, resulting in a hybrid. This hybrid is used in the manufacturing of plastic lumber applications. However, unlike the engineered polymer ABS which hold properties of several plastics well, recycled plastics suffer phase-separation that causes structural weakness in the final product.\n\nIn 2009, Belinda Smith from Reuters wrote that upcycling had increased in the rich countries but observed that upcycling was a necessity in poorer ones: Supporters of the environmentally friendly practice of upcycling say people in developing countries have effectively been upcycling for years, using old packaging and clothing in new ways, although more out of need than for the environment. But upcycling is now taking off in other countries, reflecting an increased interest in eco-friendly products, particularly ones that are priced at an affordable level and proving profitable for the manufacturers. \"If upcycling is going to become mainstream, then the corporate world needs to see that it can be profitable,\" said Albe Zakes, spokesman of U.S. company TerraCycle which specializes in finding new uses for discarded packaging. A growing number of companies are focusing on upcycling although the trend is still in its infancy with industry-wide figures yet to be produced.\n\nUpcycling has shown significant growth across the United States. For example, the number of products on Etsy or Pinterest tagged with the word \"upcycled\" increased from about 7,900 in January 2010 to nearly 30,000 a year laterâan increase of 275%. , that number stood at 263,685, an additional increase of 879%.\n\nMaterial downcycling occurs when it is not economic to restore materials to their original quality, for example, when wrought aluminium alloys are melted to produce lower-grade casting alloys. Material \"upcycling\", in the thermodynamic sense, is only possible if even more energy is added to upgrade the material quality. Two guiding questions to ask when assessing recovering for waste materials or products are: How much energy is required to restore the recovered material back to the desired material or product?, and, How does this quantity compare with obtaining the desired material or product from virgin or primary sources? In some cases, little energy is required to reuse a discarded product, for example, secondhand clothing. In other cases, the energy required to recover the materials is more than the energy required to process virgin material. In the last case, \"upcycling\" may be considered worst for environmental emissions strategies if energy comes from fossil fuels.\n\nThe tradition of reusing found objects (\"objet trouvÃ©\") in mainstream art came of age sporadically through the 20th century, although it has long been a means of production in folk art. The Amish quilt, for example, came about through reapplication of salvaged fabric. Simon Rodia's Watts Towers (1921â1954) in Los Angeles exemplifies upcycling of scrap metal, pottery and broken glass on a grand scale; it consists of 17 structures, the tallest reaching over 30 meters into the Watts skyline.\n\nIntellectually, upcycling bears some resemblance to the ready-made art of Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists. Duchamp's \"Bicycle Wheel\" (1913), a front wheel and fork attached to a common stool, is among the earliest of these works, while \"Fountain\" (1917), a common urinal purchased at a hardware store, is arguably his best-known work. Pablo Picasso's \"Bull's Head\" (1942), a sculpture made from a discarded bicycle saddle and handlebars, is the Spanish painter's sly nod to the Dadaists.\n\nThroughout the mid-century the artist Joseph Cornell fabricated collages and boxed assemblage works from old books, found objects and ephemera. Robert Rauschenberg collected trash and disused objects, first in Morocco and later on the streets of New York, to incorporate into his art works.\n\nThe idea of consciously raising the inherent value of recycled objects as a political statement, however, rather than presenting recycled objects as a reflection or outcome from the means of production, is largely a late 20th century concept. Romuald HazoumÃ©, an artist from the West African BÃ©nin, was heralded in 2007 for his use of discarded plastic gasoline and fuel canisters to resemble traditional African masks at Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany. HazoumÃ© has said of these works, \"I send back to the West that which belongs to them, that is to say, the refuse of consumer society that invades us every day.\"\n\nJeff Wassmann, an American artist who has lived in Australia for the past 25 years, uses items found on beaches and junk stores in his travels to create the early Modern works of a fictional German relative, Johann Dieter Wassmann (1841â1898). In \"\"Vorwarts\" (Go Forward)\" (pictured), Wassmann uses four simple objects to depict a vision of modern man on the precarious eave of the 20th century: an early optometry chart as background, a clock spring as eye, a 19th-century Chinese bone opium spoon from the Australian gold fields as nose and an upper set of dentures found on an Australian beach as mouth. Wassmann is unusual among artists in that he does not sell his work, rather they are presented as gifts; by not allowing these works to re-enter the consumer cycle, he averts the commodification of his end product.\n\nMax Zorn is a Dutch tape artist who creates artwork from ordinary brown packaging tape and hangs pieces on street lamps as a new form of street art at night. By adding and subtracting layers of tape on acrylic glass with a surgical scalpel, the artwork can only be visible when light is placed behind it, mimicking the effects similar to stained glass window methods. His technique with pioneering upcycling with street art has been featured at Frei-Cycle 2013, the first design fair for recycling and upcycling in Freiburg, Germany.\nA prominent example is the Recycled Orchestra of Cateura in Paraguay, created in 2006 by the program Sounds of the Earth, directed by Luis Szaran. The instruments of the orchestra are made from materials taken from the landfill of AsunciÃ³n, whose name comes from the Cateura lagoon in the area. A limited part of its real history is narrated in the film \"Landfill Harmonic\", according to the version of Favio Chavez, ex-coordinator of \"Sounds of the Earth\".\n\nIn May 2016, an original member of the orchestra and two members of the parents' association, who helped build the current building of the Cateura music school; filed a complaint with the Office of the Prosecutor against the director's administration, for alleged lack of transparency. The complaint is backed by three senators from Paraguay.\n\nMany industrial processes, like plastic and electronic fabrication, rely on the consumption of finite resources. Furthermore, the waste may have an environmental impact and can affect human health. Within this context, upcycling describes the use of available and future technologies to reduce waste and resource consumption by creating a product with a higher value from waste or byproduct streams.\nINDUSTRIAL UPCYCLING is new complex methodology for waste prevention. In late 2015 on logistics conference LOGISTICS RIDE, Ostrava, Czech Republic, it was named for the first time INDUSTRY 5.0. It consist of tools and methods streamlining the production surplus from one process or factory to next one. The originator of the complex methodology is Michael Rada, who started successful implementation within Czech republic industrial environment and expand to other locations.\n\nIn consumer electronics, the process of re-manufacturing or refurbishment of second-hand products can be seen as upcycling because of the reduced energy and material consumption in contrast to new manufacturing. The re-manufactured product has a higher value than disposing or downcycling it.\n\nThe use of Brewer's spent grain, a waste product of brewing processes, as a substrate in biogas processes eliminates the need for disposal and can generate significant profit to the overall brewing process. Depending on the substrate's price, a profit of approximately 20% of the operational costs is possible. In this process, the biogas plant acts as an \"upcycler\".\n\nAs libraries are becoming more than just bricks, mortar and their collections, modern librarians are increasing their programming efforts. Upcycle programs or classes/clubs are becoming more and more popular, especially with the help of Pinterest. The Titusville Public Library has an upcycle class that started out by making roses.\n\nAn organization called ScrapDC led Upcycle classes at the District of Columbia Public Library, more specifically their Southeast Neighborhood Library. One of their more popular projects was turning old books into boxes.\n\nThe Jerry Falwell Library at Liberty University holds an annual Creative Upcycling Contest for their students. The first contest had 44 submissions of âArt Made from Booksâ. These submissions were three-dimensional upcycles.\n\nBillions of pounds of food are wasted every year around the world, but there are good ways that people reuse the food and find a way to upcycle. A way that is used very often is to feed it to animals because a lot of animals, such as a pig, will eat all the scraps given. Food waste can be donated and restaurants can save all the food customers don't eat. Donations can also be made by contacting local agricultural extension offices to find out where to donate food waste and telling them how often and how much you can donate.\n\nAnother form of upcycling food would be to break it down and use it as energy. Engineers have found a way to break the food down into a reusable bio-fuel by pressure cooking it and then they are able to make methane out of the remains which can be used to produce a lot of electricity and heat.\n\nWhen the food isn't used in those ways, another way is to just break it down and use it in compost, which will improve the soil. Pretty much any type of food waste, such as fruits, vegetables, egg shells, nuts, and nut shells, can be used in compost to make it richer soil.\n\nTonnes of wastes are produced every day in our cities, and some educators are attempting to raise citizens' awareness, especially the youth. To redefine the concept of recycling previously confined to trash categorization, groups of young designers have attempted to transform \"trash\" into potentially marketable products such as backpacks made of waste plastic bags and area rugs created by reusing hides. One relevant book published by Community Museum Project in Hong Kong in 2010, was the first experiment on upcycling systems design. Spanning across material collecting, upcycling design, local production and public dissemination, it provides proposals towards a sustainable system that will cast impact on our strategies of waste handling and energy saving.\n\nHong Kong local inventor Gary Chan is actively involved in designing and making 'upcycling' bikes by making use of waste materials as parts for his bikes. He invented at least 8 bikes using wastes as a majority of the materials. Gary and his partners at Wheel Thing Makers regularly collect useful wastes such as leather skin from sofas, hardwood plates of wardrobes, or rubber tires from vehicle repair stores in the waste collection station on streets. Similar concepts evolve allover the world to tackle issue of rising excess of waste through creation of circular economies within the communities.\n\nThe worldwide plastic production was 280 million tons in 2011 and production levels are growing every year. Its haphazard disposal causes severe environmental damage such as the creation of the Great Pacific garbage patch. In order to solve this problem, the employment of modern technologies and processes to reuse the waste plastic as a cheap substrate is under research. The goal is to bring this material from the waste stream back into the mainstream by developing processes which will create an economic demand for them.\n\nOne approach in the field involves the conversion of waste plastics (like LDPE, PET, and HDPE) into paramagnetic, conducting microspheres or into carbon nanomaterials by applying high temperatures and chemical vapor deposition.\n\nOn a molecular level, the treatment of polymers like polypropylene or thermoplastics with electron beams (doses around 150 kGy) can increase material properties like bending strength and elasticity and provides an eco-friendly and sustainable way to upcycle them.\n\nActive research is being carried out for the biotransformation upcycling of plastic waste (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane) into PHA bioplastic using bacteria.\n\nPET could be converted into the biodegradable PHA by using a combination of temperature and microbial treatment. First it gets pyrolized at 450Â Â°C and the resulting terephthalic acid is used as a substrate for microorganisms, which convert it finally into PHA. Similar to the aforementioned approach is the combination of nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes with powdered orange peel as a composite material. This might be used to remove synthetic dyes from wastewater.\n\nBiotechnology companies have recently shifted focus towards the conversion of agricultural waste, or biomass, to different chemicals or commodities. One company in particular, BioTork, has signed an agreement with the State of Hawaii and the USDA to convert the unmarketable papayas in Hawaii into fish feed. As part of this Zero Waste Initiative put forth by the State of Hawaii, BioTork will upcycle the otherwise wasted biomass into a high quality, omega-rich fish feed.\nDesigners have begun to use both industrial textile waste and existing clothing as base material for creating new fashions. Upcycling has been known to use either pre-consumer or post-consumer waste or possibly a combination of the two. Pre-consumer waste is made while in the factory, such as fabric remnants left over from cutting out patterns. post-consumer waste refers to the finished product when itâs no longer useful to the owner, such as donated clothes .\nOften, we practice linear economy where we are content to buy, use then throw away. This system contributes to millions of kilos of textile waste being thrown away and makes fashion is the second-most polluting industry after oil . while most textiles produced are recyclable, around 85% end-up in landï¬lls in the USA alone . Fast fashion companies are huge contributors to these problems as their whole purpose is to mass produce cheap clothing.\nTo live a sustainable life we need other clothing options that demonstrates the opposite to the throw away attitude fast fashion has lead us to. Upcycling can help us with this as it puts into practice a more circular economy model. A Circular Economy is where resources are used for as long as possible, getting the most value out of them while in use, then restored and repurposed when their use is over. Popularized by McDonough and Braungartâs this has also been known as the cradle-to-cradle principle. This principle states a product should be designed either to have multiple life cycles or be biodegradable . Not only does upcycling help environmentally but there are also economic benefits. By reusing materials that others may not find as desirable there are huge savings that can be made on buying supplies for business or personal use. At schools or university upcycling for art, craft and design can be an easy and cheap way to prototype or finish a student project. The can also be an economic benefit with the final product. By it definition upcycling means increasing value to the original product and this can be done by changing/adding your own spin to the design or improving material quality or fixing broken clothes.\n\n"}

She was one of the first scholars to bring quantitative evidence to bear on this socio-economic topic. Her research not only illuminated the changing roles of women in society, but she also wrote and lectured on concrete social and political changes that would help facilitate these new roles.\n\nViola Klein was born in Vienna in 1908 to a Jewish family. As a young student she moved to Prague with her family owing to political circumstances after studying one year at the Sorbonne University in Paris and a short period at the University of Vienna. She continued her studies at the University in Prague and graduated in fields of psychology and philosophy. During her studies in Prague she worked as an assistant editor. Besides psychology and philosophy, she was also interested in French literature. Her first doctoral thesis was about the linguistic style of the modernist French author Louis-Ferdinand Celine (Lyon 2007, p.Â 831). Because of her interest in the woman question she visited the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Inspired by this visit she wrote several articles in British magazines about âdouble speakâ (Lyon 2007, p.Â 832). It represented the new role of women in society, marriage and the family.\nIn 1938 she and her brother migrated to England. Shortly after fleeing, Viola's parents died in a Nazi concentration camp.\n\nAs Jewish refugees, Viola and her brother had problems finding work in England. For a short period of time she worked as a domestic servant until she finally received a scholarship from the Czech government operating in exile (Lyon 2007, p.Â 832). This enabled her to enroll in the London School of Economics and to work on her second doctorate diploma. During her studies in London she met the well-known sociologist Karl Mannheim, who became her supervisor. Because of their similar cultural background they were interested in similar social issues, literature and art. Both of them were collecting information and ideas relating to her thesis while traveling across the country between different universities. In 1946 Viola Klein published her second thesis, one of her best known publications - The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology. This publication was criticized because of its ostensibly militant feminism which departed from the traditional views and values. Her encouragement of women to work if they so desired, was perceived by critics as a destructive social force, provoking destabilization and family problems.\n\nViola worked in relatively lower status positions as editor, translator and teacher. However, she continued her research working on female employment in Great Britain (Lyon, 2007, p.Â 834). Starting in 1951 she collaborated with the Swedish sociologist Alva Myrdal and together they eventually published the book Women's Two Roles: Home and Work. This publication helped her to increase her involvement in international research activities. In 1964 she was offered her first academic post as lecturer in the Sociology department at the University of Reading in Great Britain. After 3 years she was promoted to senior lecturer and in 1971 to reader.\n\nIn 1973, shortly after her retirement she died at the age of 65.\n\nViola Klein's thoughts were constructed around the meaning of a femininity concept and the social creation of a feminine character. In her first important work: The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology, she claimed that attitudes in society considered as feminine are not factual observations but preconceptions and particular subjective interpretations (Klein, Correspondence, May 30, 1942, Klein papers). Providing a question about sources of the knowledge about womanhood and examining studies from the beginning of the 19th century, she wanted to prove that âwhat we think of specific perspectives are not guaranteed truths but the ideas subject to the influence of surrounding culture and personal biasâ (Terrant 2006, p.Â 134). With her work Klein wanted to demonstrate that scientists, whose assumptions result from particular branches of knowledge, are not free from the social, cultural and historical climates of their time (Klein 1946, p.Â 30). She observed that scientific objective studies about femininity are full of stereotypes and repeat particular traits like âpassivity, emotionally, lack of abstract interests, greater intensity of personal relationships and, an instinctive tenderness for babiesâ (Klein 1946, p.Â 164). Therefore, she wanted to define a feminine nature, using notions of social and cultural expectations (Klein 1946, p.Â 171) âKlein sought to isolate psychological influences on sex difference by excluding sex-related traits that could be attributed to social function, historic tradition and prevailing ideologyâ (Klein, 1946, p.Â 129).\n\nFor a long time before the concept of gender was used in scientific discourse (e.g. Butler 1990; Bornstein 1995), Viola Klein considered Role Theory in her research on what is feminine (Terrant 2006, p.Â 148; Klein 1946). Pointing out that every individual in society occupies various social positions; Klein wrote that each position includes particular patterns of roles and behaviors (Klein 1946, p.Â 136). According to Klein, the process of becoming an adult is the action of learning appropriate role patterns like mother's role, teacher's role, school girl's role (Terrant 2006) and within every particular society these patterns are understood differently (Klein 1946, p.Â 136). âMale and female roles are thought to be the new members of the social group in innumerable and subtle ways almost from birth. They are reinforced by experience, example, innuendos and the various others means by which social control is usually exercisedâ (Klein 1946, p.Â 136).Starting from stereotypes about womanhood and sex-role prejudices, Klein explained that the framework in which individuals develop and which shapes the way individuals adapt is full of common belief, social opinion, and tradition (Klein 1946, p.Â 1).\n\nWhat Klein started in her research supervised by Mannheim and known as an ideology of feminine character (Klein 1946) came to be known as psychosocial orientation after 1975 and eventually subsumed into the nexus that we know today as gender. (Butler 1990). As Shira Terrant claimed, Klein's research about femininity conceptualized within Mannheim methodology - underestimated by the second-wave of feminists - in fact gave roots to this concept (Terrant 2006). Contrary to Parsonsâ functionalistic understanding of Role Theory and sex-roles division, Klein understood the concept more broadly, that femininity and masculinity should include also personal traits that can be more or less assigned to the opposite sex's character (Terrant 2006, p.Â 150) a concept later solidified in transgender and queer theory (e.g. Butler 1990; Bornstein 1995).\n\nWithin Mannheim's sociology of knowledge framework (Wikipedia outline: The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies) and its standpoint to understand how âindividuals give meaning to their ongoing reality within context [that is] structured by specific institutions [and how] social values structure our perception, give legitimacy to certain ways of seeing the world, and give moral credence to particular patterns of relationshipsâ (Farganias, p.Â 12-13) reality is understood by individuals within institutionally structured frameworks. Klein was the first who used Mannheim's theory and applied it to studies about a particular subject: femininity (Terrant 2006). Concerning the social world, âMannheimâs perspective required the thinker to look for ways of interpreting the situation more clearly and productivelyâ (Terrant 2006). Within this exposure and conceptualization of social reality this way of examining reality can provide motivation for women's emancipation.\n\nPolitical thought of women (connecting gender, race, & nationality)\nKlein considered the problem of social construction of the feminine more widely, women and men of one society being participants of two cultural systems and in regards to hegemonic norms, one is dominant to the other (Klein 1946, p.Â 174). In this context, Klein understood that women have a secondary status like particular discriminated groups in society, for example black Americans, Jews or immigrants (Terrant 2006, p.Â 171). What she believed to be the most challenging for women was that they âinternalized the sense of secondary statusâ (Klein 2006, p.Â 174), thus many accepted their own suppression. Klein called this phenomenon âa collective inferiority complexâ (Terrant 2006, p.Â 152) which she saw as analogous to other minority groups (Klein 1942).\n\nFor Klein, the reason for women's conformity and acceptance of their secondary status, are social attitudes manifested in powerful institutions of sex-roles, power and dominance-submission relations, and group prejudices (Terrant 2006, p.Â 152). The problem with the change of women's situations, according to her, was the strong character of stereotypes which are socially reproduced and carried from generation to generation enduring in people's minds (Terrant 2006, p.Â 153).\n\nDuring the period that Klein knew Karl Mannheim, he was a good friend and a mentor to her. His theory of the sociology of knowledge as well as his scientific modus operandi greatly influenced Klein (Tarrant 2006). Both were refugees from the Nazi regime, they first encountered each other in the London School of Economics, where Mannheim helped and guided Klein in the process of earning her second doctorate, this time in sociology. At first naming her thesis âFeminism and Antifeminism: A Study in Ideologies and Social Attitudesâ, by the time of its completion in 1944 and its publication in 1946 the title and subject had changed to The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology (Tarrant 2006, 137).\n\nThe book The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology [first published in 1946, second edition in 1971] is the second major thesis of Viola Klein. This work is introduced with a foreword by Karl Mannheim where he explains that the question of the feminine character cannot be reached with only one field of study; for instance he said that we can find this topic in âbiology, philosophy, psycho-analysis, experimental psychology, psychometrics, history, literary history, anthropology and sociology.â (p. vii). All these fields of knowledge have their own rules of research, with different results but complementarity of themes and utilities. According to Mannheim âAll of the social sciences have a common method to - the understanding of human behavior; a common method the quantitative analysis of behavior records; and a common aspiration - to devise ways of experimenting upon behavior.â (p. xii). In this foreword, he argues in favor of Viola Klein's intentions which had been criticized by other authors. To him she took old research not to plagiarize, but to give rise to another outlook. He explains that she tried to create new questioning based on already completed research in different fields of studies.\n\nIn the preface to the second edition, Viola Klein responds to criticism from other authors, especially sociologists who reproach her for a lack of own research and sociological studies. The writer Rosa Macaulay, was one such critic who accused her of using âsecondary sourcesâ instead of doing âoriginal researchâ (p. xv). Viola Klein explains that the universal theme that is the feminine role deserves to be constantly re-examined and matched with old and new studies, because scholarsâ ways of thinking guide our understandings of society more subjectively than objectively, regardless of the empirical framework. Given the universal theme of women and femininity she argues looking at the historical background of the social status of women, to see and compare feminine traits according to politics, socio-economics, and epochs, is perennially useful to social scientists, if not lay thinkers in general.\n\nâThe feminine characterâ is her a psycho-sociological term to label âfemininityâ as a âpsychosexual orientationâ (p. xvii). This idea of psychosexual orientation comes from biology where the feminine character is only defined by the physiological sex concept. From this point of view Klein wanted to show how Role Theory has been developed. This theory is not about âsex rolesâ but more about male and female behavior, âtemperamentâ that the society assigns to them. Even though her book was criticized for the way she researched and wrote, it helped develop the psychometric method.\n\nThe aim of her book was the âclarification of the idea of âfemininityâ (p.Â 1). Some main questions about the evolution of new women's roles and traits, structure Viola Klein's thesis: What is the new ideal of femininity? What are the effects on women's personality and how are they represented and considered by other social groups?\nTrying to answer these issues, the book shows that as long as society's expectations are changing, the feminine character will change in shape. Comparing different research demonstrates that the scientific knowledge has directly or indirectly influenced the âgeneral trend of intellectual and emotional development.â This influence by sciences is called âthe mental climateâ (p.Â 2). She especially notes the difference between scientific and social knowledge. In regards to sociology for example it is difficult to determine the âtruthâ when constructing an analysis. Scholars are heavily influenced by their social and cultural backgrounds which add to the subjectivity found in sociology. Scientific knowledge relies on such pragmatic instruments for analysis like theorems and formulas. That's why she mentions that relativism is avoided as long as possible.\n\nSome contexts are given to conform with research on: â(a) the status of women in a given society; (b) the prevailing ideologies concerning women in a certain historical period, and (c) the authorâs personal attitudes towards women.â (p.Â 3-4). The masculine standards influencing society situate women as an âoutgroupâ. This term describes implicitly the unequal strata of society. The concept of âoutgroupâ is based on âphysical characteristics, historical tradition, social role and different process of socialization.â (p.Â 4).\nSome turning points began the process of emancipation of women and their roles inside the social group that they are assigned to in societies. The first one was the Industrial Revolution; technological changes and surges in demand for labor implied that physical strength or traditional forms of labor no longer defined who could be productive. Then World War II led women to take on both male and female types of work, because only men were sent to fight and die, while women were left to maintain society and families (in both care and economic stability). Moreover, the capitalist ideology, itself supported by the spreading of democracy during the second part of the twentieth century, celebrated women's emancipation as labor was the engine of production, and more laborers meant more profits. The democracy ideology extols the equality between all human beings. Thus this thought reevaluates the role of the woman in society. Democratic institutions inevitably lead to enfranchisement. Also to be noted is that development led to the size of families decreasing, meaning that women had less (second shift) work to do in the family. All of these changes lead to a shift in how society views women.\n\n\"Owing, presumably, to the emotional character of philanthropic work and to the absence of pecuniary profit attaching to it, it did not seem âimproperâ for women of standing to engage in charitable activities, and soon we find ladies of rank and consequence running charity organizations, working for prison reform, collecting rent in the slums of the East End of London, embarking on propaganda for the abolition of slavery, against cruelty to children, against alcoholism and prostitution, and for the emancipation of women. The social history of the nineteenth century is full of women pioneers in all fields of social reform.\" (p.17).\n\nThis book was co-written by Alva Myrdal and Viola Klein, and supported by the International Federation of University of Women (IFUW) âto make an international survey of the needs for social reforms if women are to be put into a position to reconcile family and professional lifeâ (p.Â IX). The method was essentially questionnaires distributed by the IFUW in developed countries (USA, UK, France and Sweden).\nWomen's roles had been changing for many decades. They shifted from a paradigm of âWhat can women do?â to âwhat should women do ?â (p. xi). Women are thought to be the strong link between family and the human role of âcontinuation of the raceâ (p. xi). Here, there have been two conflicting roles since the industrial revolution: taking part in societal roles of economic and even political natures, and having home roles of caring and household management.\n\nBoth roles were formerly situated within household which were both the main centers of family care and economic production. After the industrial revolution society needs to âregenerate itselfâ (p. xii) perpetually, because development and progress demand that women continue in the economic sphere as they had in former times, but this takes them out of the household and into the factory or office. Many different cultural-institutional traditions, e.g. Christianity, Islam, Communism and National Socialism, have divergent ideologies for the role(s) of women.\n\nThe women's social revolution took place in two main phases; the first one being the acceptance of women in a larger variety of jobs that were formerly restricted to âmasculine jobsâ (p.Â 1), and the second being âthe growing number of women [combining] family and employmentâ (p.Â 1). Before the Industrial Revolution, women had an economic function within the family; they werenât working in a company but instead at home, crafting clothes, baking bread, making soap, raising the family (p.Â 4). After the industrial revolution, the economic function shifted to companies, this fueled not working as âa high standard of livingâ for women to define their upper class statuses.\n\nDuring this period, publications were released measuring comparative aptitudes and traits of men and women. Psychologists and sociologists proved that women and men were not so different and if a man tended to be stronger for example, a woman was more agile. This process had been accelerated by both the World Wars, women had a huge importance in economic capital when men were fighting on the battlefield. After these wars, women had more favorable positions in economic progress: âOur society has begun to accept the fact that women are in jobs to stayâ (p.Â 4). With it also came the emancipation of women with the right to vote, to work, and to education. The right to vote earned after World War I in the US, UK, Sweden and after World War II in France (p.Â 7) meant women were now political equals as well. The right to education allowed access to a larger range of fields like medicine formerly restricted to males.The right to work finally claimed by women âto regain position in the economic productivity and sense of social usefulness, the restitution of their lost share (â¦) Work moved out of the home, women wanted to move after itâ (p.Â 7).\n\nThe second phase of this social revolution had two major developments; âthe increased average life-expectancyâ and âthe change of the size and structure of the familyâ (p.Â 13). Better hygienic conditions in societies and massive increases in medical knowledge and technology led to infant mortality decreasing greatly between 1850 and 1950 coupled with longer life expectancy, with averages crossing 70 years of age whereas âone half of female population died before the age of 45â (p.Â 7) a hundred years before. Over the decades the average family size shrank. While in Victorian times, families had more than 5 children, the average was between 2 and 5 children in 1920 (p.Â 20) and in 1951 the proportion of women under 50 who had more than 5 children was merely 4,4% (p.Â 23). Myrdal and Klein predicted that families in the future would have an average of three children. Moreover, the interval between marriage and the first child should be two years and between every birth there should be a space of two years. If a woman got married at 22, the period of motherhood would be around 10 years âafter which her expectation of life would be a further 40 yearsâ (p.Â 24), a large period ripe with opportunities for other productive activities. Also there was a new development in the family structure; daughters were leaving home at the same time as sons, demanding independence that is âhigh in our scale of social valueâ (p.Â 25) to go to university, look for a job, and pursue independence. Daughters were not leaving home anymore just because they were getting married.\n\nToday there exist two spheres of work and home. The equilibrium between the demands of the community and the needs of individuals was more stable in former times when these spheres shared the same geographic location by family (p.Â 29), âfamilies work and leisure were shared much more evenly between men and womenâ, leading to an asymmetric but more efficient partnership (p.Â 29). With the industrial revolution, things changed; the sphere of work was created and belonged to men while the home sphere was âthe womanâs worldâ (p.Â 28). But when women got access to education, work, etc.\nthe home role âshould be done jointly by men and women if the ideal of a happy home is to become a realityâ (p.Â 29). Nevertheless, a majority of men enjoyed using their leisure time to accomplish some work-hobbies at home, becoming an amateur painter, carpenter, etc. while women still took on the lion's share of household duties.\n\nThe authors separate a woman's adulthood into three phases. The first one is a step that lasts around 7â10 years in European countries and 5 years in the USA. It corresponds to the first years in adulthood, after school but before marriage. Only a few will stay in this phase corresponding to women who don't get married. In European countries 82% of women in this phase were working whereas it fell down to 51% in the USA. In this phase women are living a kind of âmanâs lifeâ before their marriage; they are independent.\nWhen getting married the second phase of woman's adulthood begins, motherhood. Due to child rearing, the home becomes their workplace. The weekly work load for a housewife rises depending on the number of children: an average of 56 hrs with no children and up to 78 hrs for three. The crucial fact described is that for working women the weekly work load in both spheres is 84 hrs with no children and 85 hrs with three, which goes to show the result of the combined strain of both spheres of life. Afterwards women enter the third phase of adulthood, when their children grow up and leave home. A period of crisis can follow, the housewife is now alone, she does not have as much to do at home as before and looking for a job at 40 is complicated. âThe traditional stereotype is still at work in the minds of women themselves, making them believe that they are much older and much less capable than they in fact areâ (p.Â 40).\n\nThe authors noticed sex divisions were different in observed countries except in nursing and teaching. Pharmacology and dentistry in France and Sweden became feminine fields of work. In the US, it was in finance, insurance and real estates (44% of women in UK work in this field) (p.Â 76). These conditions resulted from local conditions and traditions. One thing the authors were sure about was that the choice made by women was âstrongly influenced by the role they hope to play in familyâ (p.Â 77). In the future women will constitute a good portion of the labor market and it will permit women to soon do âmore heart-searching when choosing a careerâ (p.Â 156) and obviously it is still important that they continue to fight for equality of rights between men and women.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "848317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=848317", "title": "Violence in sports", "text": "Violence in sports\n\nViolence in sports usually refers to violent and often unnecessarily harmful intentional physical acts committed during, or motivated by, a sports game, often in relation to contact sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby football, lacrosse, association football, boxing, mixed martial arts, wrestling, and water polo and, when referring to the players themselves, often involving excessively violent or potentially illegal physical contact beyond the normal levels of contact expected while playing the sport. These acts of violence can include intentional attempts to injure a player or coach by another player or coach, but can also include threats of physical harm or actual physical harm sustained by players or coaches by fans or those engaging in the spectating of sports, or threats and acts of violence performed by fans or spectators upon opposing fans or other spectators.\n\nThere are two major theories on the cause of violence in sports. One theory holds that humans have an instinct for violence, developed during a time when early human ancestors had to resort to violence and aggressiveness to survive and reproduce. Another theory deals with the sociological aspects of violence in sports, stating that sports are \"mock battles\" which can become actual battles due to their competitive nature.\n\nThrough a \"civilizing process\", many modern sports have become less tolerant of bloodshed than past versions, although many violent aspects of these sports still remain.\nAthletes sometimes resort to violence, in hopes of injuring and intimidating opponents. Such incidents may be part of a strategy developed by coaches or players.\n\nIn boxing, unruly or extremely violent behavior by one of the contestants often results in the fighter breaking the rules being penalized with a points reduction, or, in extreme cases, disqualification. Outlawed tactics in boxing include hitting the opponent on the back of the head, under the belly during clinching, and to the back. Other tactics that are outlawed, but less seen, are pushing an opponent extremely hard to the floor, kicking, or hitting repeatedly after the round has ended. Similar actions have also happened in ice hockey and Australian Football League matches.\n\nHigh school, college, and even professional sports teams often include initiation ceremonies (known as hazing in the USA) as a rite of passage. A 1999 study by Alfred University and the NCAA found that approximately four out of five college US athletes (250,000 per year) experienced hazing. Half were required to take part in alcohol-related initiations, while two-thirds were subjected to humiliation rituals.\n\nViolence may also be related to nationalism or as an outlet for underlying social tensions. It is often alcohol-related.\n\nViolence by supporters of sports teams dates back to Roman times, when supporters of chariot racing teams were frequently involved in major riots. Usually, underlying political and/or theological issues helped fuel riots related to sporting events in the Roman era. The Nika riots of 532 were especially deadly, with tens of thousands reportedly killed.\n\nIn periods when theatre was considered a form of mass entertainment, there were phenomena of rival fans supporting rival actors or theatrical teams, occasionally leading to violent outbursts having many similarities to present-day violence of sports fans â the Astor Place Riot in 1849 New York City being a conspicuous example.\n\nThe actions of English football hooligans and firms in the 1980s caused English teams to be banned from European competition for six years after the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. Although the level of football-related violence was significantly reduced in England after this event, in the recent Euro 2004 tournament, England were publicly warned that any violence by supporters at matches could result in their ejection from the tournament. Many known hooligans were prevented from traveling to the tournament in Portugal. There was a collective sigh of relief from security experts in the USA when England failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Alan Rothenberg (chairman of the World Cup organizing committee in the United States in 1994) said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolence has been a part of ice hockey since at least the early 1900s. According to the book \"\", in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork. Fighting in ice hockey is an established tradition of the sport in North America, with a long history involving many levels of amateur and professional play and including some notable individual fights. While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of penalties on players who engage in fights. Unique to North American professional team sports, the National Hockey League (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not eject players outright for fighting but major European and collegiate hockey leagues do.\n\nThe debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or \"heavyweights\") knocking each other out, some administrators are not considering eliminating fighting from the game, as some players consider it essential. Additionally, the majority of fans oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1883244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1883244", "title": "Willful blindness", "text": "Willful blindness\n\nWillful blindness (sometimes called ignorance of law, willful ignorance or contrived ignorance or Nelsonian knowledge) is a term used in law to describe a situation in which a person seeks to avoid civil or criminal liability for a wrongful act by intentionally keeping himself or herself unaware of facts that would render him or her liable. In \"United States v. Jewell\", the court held that proof of willful ignorance satisfied the requirement of knowledge as to criminal possession and importation of drugs.\n\nAlthough the term was originallyâand still isâused in legal contexts, the phrase \"willful ignorance\" has come to mean any situation in which people intentionally turn their attention away from an ethical problem that is believed to be important by those using the phrase (for instance, because the problem is too disturbing for people to want it dominating their thoughts, or from the knowledge that solving the problem would require extensive effort).\n\nIn \"United States v. Jewell\", the court held that proof of willful ignorance satisfied the requirement of knowledge as to criminal possession and importation of drugs. In a number of cases in the United States of America, persons transporting packages containing illegal drugs have asserted that they never asked what the contents of the packages were and so lacked the requisite intent to break the law. Such defenses have not succeeded, as courts have been quick to determine that the defendant \"should\" have known what was in the package and exercised criminal recklessness by failing to find out the package's contents. Notably, this rule has only ever been applied to independent couriers, and has never been used to hold larger services that qualify as common carriers (e.g., FedEx, United Parcel Service, or the U.S. Postal Service) liable for the contents of packages they deliver.\n\nA famous example of such a defense being denied occurred in \"In re Aimster Copyright Litigation\", in which the defendants argued that the file-swapping technology was designed in such a way that they had no way of monitoring the content of swapped files. They suggested that their inability to monitor the activities of users meant that they could not be contributing to copyright infringement by the users. The court held that this was willful blindness on the defendantâs part and would not constitute a defense to a claim of contributory infringement.\n\n\n\n"}
