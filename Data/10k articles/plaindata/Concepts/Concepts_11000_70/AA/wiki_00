An ATR system converts municipal solid waste (MSW) into either electricity or steam for district heating or industrial customers. The combustion bottom ash and the combustion fly ash, along with the air pollution control system fly ash, are treated to produce products that can be beneficially reused. Specifically, ATR systems consist of the following: \n\nAs a result of the growing need to manage waste from throughout greater Hamburg, the first commercially operating ATR facility – the Müllverwertung Rugenberger Damm (MVR) in Hamburg, Germany – was commissioned in 1999. The German Green Party has endorsed the specific features of the MVR facility in its \"Concept 2020\" initiative to cease all landfilling of waste by 2020 as an essential part of an integrated waste management system achieving the highest standards in the EfW industry. No landfilling of unprocessed waste has been allowed in Germany since 2005, and all 27 countries in the European Community are required to adopt similar bans by 2020.\n\nQuality control occurs at the inception of the process. Overhead refuse cranes, which hold approximately 5 tons each, mix the waste in the bunker to create a homogeneous mixture. This is important for good combustion and low carbon content in the bottom ash by-product. These cranes then deliver the mixed waste into the feeding hopper which leads down onto highly engineered stoker grates which control the rate that waste travels through the boiler. The intense heat ignites the waste as it moves along the forward feeding grates until only the by-product bottom ash remains at the end of the grate. Each combustion line feeds a boiler that operates at a temperature above for 2 seconds. The temperature in the combustion zone is measured through acoustic monitoring.\n\nCareful monitoring of the combustion process guarantees complete burning of the combustible material in an environmentally safe manner. A highly sophisticated computer controls the temperature, the grate speed, the amount of air used and all other aspects of the process that enables complete combustion and minimization of emissions to occur.\n\nThe maintenance of the furnace's high temperature is essential to rid the waste and the resulting combustion gases of complex organic compounds such as dioxin/furans. To prevent the reformulation of pollutants, fly ash is separated from the flue gas downstream of the super heaters to reduce the fly ash content, which could act as a catalyst in the critical reformulation temperature range of . At the exit of the boiler, the flue gas has been cooled down to a level of .\n\nConverting waste heat to electricity. As the waste is combusted, heat is released in the boiler. This heat is used to produce high-pressure, high-temperature, super-heated steam, which generates electrical energy when passed through a turbine-generator. The electricity is fed into the public power grid or can be sold directly to a customer. The steam can also be exported directly for use in district heating or industrial processes.\n\nAir pollution control. Each unit has an independent air pollution control system. Flue gas cleaning begins in the boiler, where oxides of nitrogen are reduced by injecting ammonia water into the combustion chamber. Lightly loaded absorbents (activated carbon from the second bag house) are injected into the flue gas downstream of the first bag house to separate any contaminants that have reformed (such as organic compounds like dioxins and furans), any condensed heavy metals, salts and other gaseous contaminants, as well as residue fly ash.\n\nThe first bag house is an essential part of the air pollution control system insofar as it makes it possible to produce reusable by-products such as hydrochloric acid and gypsum from the consecutive air pollution control process steps. Acid gases are removed from the flue gases by passing through a two-stage scrubber to remove acid components, especially halogen compounds such as hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid. A counter flow neutral scrubber follows, using a lime slurry to remove sulphur oxides (SO2, SO3). The pollutant gases are either dissolved in water droplets (acids) or bound as calcium salts (SO2, SO3) and thereby are successfully removed from the flue gas. A second bag house acts as a polishing filter to capture any remaining aerosols, organic compounds and heavy metals, which thereby are reduced to levels usually below detection.\n\nConverting combustion residue to marketable byproducts. The ATR process produces other marketable products in addition to energy. Following combustion, the material left consists of the non-combustible components of the waste and the inert materials produced during combustion. This is known as slag or bottom ash. The bottom ash is washed to eliminate soluble salts. Iron scrap and non-ferrous metals such as aluminium, copper and brass are separated and sold in secondary metals markets The bottom ash is then screened, crushed and sold for use as a construction material comparable to aggregate mined from a quarry or made from processed demolition waste.\n\nGypsum is created when the oxides of sulphur (SO2 and SO3) are separated by the single stage scrubber. It is purified, then sold to the construction industry.\n\nThe acid scrubbing process in the flue gas treatment system also produces a raw hydrochloric acid (HCl) with a concentration of 10%-12%. The acid is distilled (rectified) to yield commercial grade (30% concentration) hydrochloric acid.\n\nFly Ash Treatment. Fly ash, which is separated in the boiler and baghouses and constitutes up to 5% by weight of the combusted MSW, is treated to recover metals and minerals for reuse, resulting in an overall ATR process landfill diversion rate of approximately 98.5%.\n\nATR systems offer flue gas cleanup and emissions performance that meet or exceed the strictest clean air laws in the United States and the European Union. Emissions from an ATR plant contain fewer metals, dioxins and conventional pollutants than other EfW approaches.\n\nATR systems increase a facility’s “diversion rate” – the percentage of materials coming into plants that are destroyed or converted to energy and useful byproducts. The majority of EfW plants in the US, after incineration and recovery of some metals, combine both bottom ash and fly ash (20-25% of MSW input by weight) and send it to a landfill. ATR systems, by contrast, landfill less than 2 percent of a plant’s MSW input; all remaining MSW is converted into either energy or usable products.\n"}

The fundamentals of the method were outlined by John B. Robinson from the University of Waterloo in 1990. The fundamental question of backcasting asks: \"if we want to attain a certain goal, what actions must be taken to get there?\"\n\nWhile forecasting involves predicting the future based on current trend analysis, backcasting approaches the challenge of discussing the future from the opposite direction; it is \"a method in which the future desired conditions are envisioned and steps are then defined to attain those conditions, rather than taking steps that are merely a continuation of present methods extrapolated into the future\".\n\nIn statistics and data analysis, backcasting can be considered to be the opposite of forecasting; thus:\n\nBackcasting, a term first coined by John Robinson in 1982, involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.\n\nBackcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:\n\nAccording to Jansen (1994, p. 503):\n\nBackcasting is increasingly used in urban planning and resource management of water and energy. It was used by Peter Gleick and colleagues at the Pacific Institute in a 1995 study on California water policy, as an alternative to traditional California water planning approaches. In 2006, the Capital Regional District Water Services, which services the greater Victoria area in British Columbia, Canada, committed to backcasting to the year 2050 as a formal element of all future strategic water planning initiatives.\n\nBackcasting is a key component of the soft energy path, a concept developed by Amory Lovins after the shock of the 1973 energy crisis in the United States.\n\nBackcasting from Sustainability Principles, or System conditions of sustainability is a key concept of the 'Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development' pioneered by Karl-Henrik Robèrt, founder of The Natural Step, an international nonprofit organization dedicated to applied research for sustainability, in cooperation with a global academic Alliance for Strategic Sustainable Development which links universities which cooperate with businesses, and other NGOs. It has been refined and tested by peer-review and application within businesses (widely known examples are: Interface, Nike, Whistler).\n\nBackcasting is used in climate reconstruction or cosmology to determine the conditions (i.e., values of unknown independent variables) that existed in the distant past based on \"known\" (more accurately estimated) values of past dependent variables.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been used as an act of revenge and torture. The punishment has been used since Antiquity; Greek mythology makes several references to blinding as divine punishment, which reflects human practice.\n\nIn the Byzantine Empire and many other historical societies, blinding was accomplished by gouging out the eyes, sometimes using a hot poker, and by pouring a boiling substance, such as vinegar, on them. \n\nOedipus, who gouged out his own eyes after accidentally fulfilling the prophecy that he would end up killing his father and marrying his mother. In the Bible, Samson was blinded upon his capture by the Philistines.\n\nEarly Christians were often blinded as a penalty for their beliefs. For example, St. Lucy's torturers tore out her eyes.\n\nBlinding survives as a form of penalty in the modern era, especially as part of the sharia law. In 2003, a Pakistani court sentenced a man to be blinded after he subjected his fiancee to an acid attack resulting in loss of vision. The man who blinded Ameneh Bahrami in an acid attack was sentenced to blinding by an Iranian court in 2009; Bahrami eventually pardoned the attacker.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, blinding was used as a penalty for treachery or as a means of rendering a political opponent unable to rule and lead an army in war. In the 11th century, William the Conqueror used blinding as a punishment for rebellion to replace the death penalty in his laws for England.\n\nBlinding was a punishment for killing a hart or hind in a royal forest.\n\nHenry I of England blinded William, Count of Mortain, who had fought against him at Tinchebray in 1106. He also ordered blinding and castration as a punishment for thieves.\n\nIn 1014, the Byzantine emperor Basil II had 99 of every 100 captured Bulgarians blinded, leaving 150 one-eyed men to lead them back to their commander.\n\nBela II of Hungary and his father was blinded by Coloman, King of Hungary.\n\n"}
{"id": "2009431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009431", "title": "Caracazo", "text": "Caracazo\n\nThe Caracazo, or sacudón, is the name given to the wave of protests, riots, looting, shootings and massacres that began on 27 February 1989 in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, and the surrounding towns. The weeklong clashes resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, thousands by some accounts, mostly at the hands of security forces and the military. The riots and the protests began mainly in response to the government's economic reforms and the resulting increase in the price of gasoline and transportation.\n\nThe word \"Caracazo\" is the name of the city followed by the \"-azo\" suffix, which denotes a violent knock. Its translation could therefore be \"the Caracas smash\" or \"the big one in Caracas\". The name was inspired by the \"Bogotazo\", a massive riot in neighboring Colombia in 1948, which played a pivotal role in that country's history. \"Sacudón\" is from \"sacudir\" (to shake) and means something along the lines of \"the day that shook the country\" (see Spanish nouns: Other suffixes).\n\nThe words are pronounced and , respectively.\n\nA fall in oil prices in the mid-1980s caused an economic crisis to take hold in Venezuela, and the country had accrued significant levels of debt. Nevertheless, the administration of the left-leaning President Jaime Lusinchi was able to restructure the country's debt repayments and offset an economic crisis but allow for the continuation of the government's policies of social spending and state-sponsored subsidies.\n\nLusinchi's political party, the Democratic Action, was able to remain in power following the 1988 election of Carlos Andrés Pérez as president. Pérez then proposed a major shift in policy by implementing neoliberal economic reforms recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The program, called \"El Gran Viraje\" (The Great Turn), but popularly known as the \"paquete\" (the \"package\"), was contrary to statements made during Pérez's populist campaign in which he had described the IMF as \"a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing.\"\n\nMeasures taken by Pérez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the elimination of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs. When the subsidy was eliminated, gasoline prices rose by as much as 100% and so the costs of public transportation rose by 30%.\n\nWeeks before the outbreak of rioting, Carlos Andrés Pérez was inaugurated on 2 February 1989. During the \"lavish ceremony\", Fidel Castro and other Cuban personnel entered Venezuela for the event. With Cuba recently entering its Special Period, experiencing economic difficulties as a result of the Soviet Union's Perestroika, Castro allegedly sought to establish an ally in Venezuela so Cuba could also enjoy funds oil profits. The group of Cubans allegedly established a headquarters at the nearly finished Eurobuilding Hotel in Caracas and after the event, Venezuelan intelligence reported that less Cuban personnel departed from Venezuela than arrived. Cuban sleeper agents then allegedly waited for unrest to occur in Venezuela so they could exacerbate political tensions.\n\nThe protests and rioting began on the morning of February 27, 1989, in Guarenas, a town in Miranda State about east of Caracas, by the steep increase in public transportation prices. The protests and rioting quickly spread to the capital and other towns across the country. A lack of timely intervention by authorities - some police were under orders not to take action - led to the Metropolitan Police quickly being overwhelmed. Despite initial debate within the government over how to manage the situation, a heavyhanded approach was implemented, with a state of emergency and martial law being imposed.\n\nOn February 28, Pérez suspended a number of articles of the Constitution, including Article 60 (right to individual liberty and security), Article 62 (inviolability of the home), Article 66 (freedom of expression), Article 71 (right to gather publicly and privately), and Article 115 (right to peaceful protest). The rights were not completely restored until March 22, and in the interim, there was no official decree or resolution to define how government authority would be exercised in the absence of those constitutional rights.\n\nBy the time authorities encountered the scenes of rioting, citizens began firing weapons at officers, with ensuing firefights resulted in many bystanders being killed by \"bullets from army troops and from sniping protesters\". In many poor areas, citizens destroyed their own local commercial facilities, with food markets so damaged that their food distribution system was ruined. Much of the rioters destroyed properties indiscriminately, with no motives related to initial protests. According to Amnesty International, tactics used by security forces included \"disappearances,\" the use of torture, and extrajudicial killings. As part of the government's security forces, members of Hugo Chávez's MBR-200 allegedly participated in the crackdown. Chávez himself was sick that day with the measles. As tensions eased, troops began to sweep through neighborhoods collecting appliances and cash registers, telling citizens that if they provided a certificate of purchase, the items would be returned.\n\nThe initial official pronouncements said 276 people had died but many estimates put the number at above 2,000. Shortages of coffins were reported and many Venezuelans had to line up at government food distribution centers since markets were destroyed by rioters. Insurance estimates of damage caused during the rioting were $90 million CAD ($120 million 2017 USD).\n\nOn March 3, 1989, Pérez spoke with U.S. President George H. W. Bush. President Bush offered President Pérez a US$450 million emergency loan. Pérez thanked Bush and asked him to support a change in debt policy toward Latin America: \"I want to tell you if there is no change in [international] debt policy then whatever we may do here may be useless.\" Pérez told Bush that he had sent him a letter several days earlier and that he would appreciate it if he would read it.\n\nThe clearest consequence of the \"Caracazo\" was political instability. The following February, the army was called to contain similar riots in Puerto La Cruz and Barcelona and again in June, when rising of transportation costs ended in riots in Maracaibo and other cities. The reforms were modified.\n\nThe MBR-200 repudiated the Caracazo and accelerated its preparation for a coup d'état against the Perez government. In 1992 there were two attempted coups in February and November. Pérez was later accused of corruption and removed from the presidency. Chávez, a MBR-200 leader and an organiser of one of the coups, was found guilty of sedition and incarcerated. However, he was subsequently pardoned by Pérez's successor, Rafael Caldera, and he went on to be elected president after the latter. Chavez later explained that after the event, \"the members of the MBR 200 realized we had passed the point of no return and we had to take up arms. We could not continue to defend a murderous regime.\"\n\nIn 1998, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights condemned the government's action and referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. In 1999, the Court heard the case and found that the government had committed violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings. The Venezuelan government, by then headed by Chávez, did not contest the findings of the case and accepted full responsibility for the government's actions.\n\nIn August 2009, Defense Minister Italo del Valle Alliegro was charged in relation to the \"Caracazo\". In July 2010, the Supreme Court overturned an appeal court ruling, which had declared the case covered by a statute of limitations.\n\n\n"}

It generally refers to the highest or innermost body that veils the atman or true soul.\n\n\"Karana sarira\" or the causal body is the cause or seed of the subtle body and the gross body. It has no other function than being the seed of the subtle and the gross body. It is \"nirvikalpa rupam\", \"undifferentiated form\". It originates with \"avidya\", \"ignorance\" or \"nescience\" of the real identity of the atman, instead giving birth to the notion of \"jiva-bhuta\".\n\nSwami Sivananda characterizes the causal body as \"The beginningless ignorance that is indescribable\". Siddharameshwar Maharaj, the guru of Nisargadatta Maharaj, also describes the causal body as characterized by \"emptiness\", \"ignorance\" and \"darkness\". In the search for the \"I am\", this is a state where there is nothing to hold on to anymore.\n\nRamanuja concludes that it is at this stage that consummation of the atman with the Paramatman is reached and the search of the highest Purusa i.e. of Ishvara ends. \n\nAccording to other philosophical schools the causal body is not the \"atman\", because it also has a beginning and an end and is subject to modification. Shankara, not seeking a personal god, goes beyond \"Anandamaya Kosha\" in search of the transcendent Brahman.\n\nThe Indian tradition identifies it with the \"Anandamaya kosha\", and the deep sleep state, as mentioned in the Mandukya Upanishad, where \"buddhi\" becomes dormant and all concepts of time fail, although there differences between these three descriptions.\n\nIn Blavatsky's synthesis of eastern philosophy with western esotericism, the union of the higher Manas with the Buddhi (i.e. the essential nature of the fifth, along with the sixth, of the seven principles) is referred to as the Causal Body (Blavatsky, \"Key to Theosophy\", pp. 121, 174). This higher principle is contrasted with the lower, the \"Kama-Manas\", which is the seat of lower passions.\nIn the Theosophy of Annie Besant and C. W. Leadbeater, the \"Causal Body\" refers not to the \"Buddhi-Manas\" but to Blavatsky's \"Higher Manas\" alone. This is also referred to as the \"Higher Mental\", \"Abstract Mind\" (as opposed to Lower Mental or \"Concrete Mind\"), or \"Causal Body\". It is considered the highest subtle body, beyond even the mental body. As with all the vehicles of consciousness, the Causal Body is associated with an objective or cosmic plane, in this case the Causal plane. A detailed definition of the Causal Body, is provided by A. E. Powell, who has brought together information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.\n\nIn the tradition of Samael Aun Weor it is taught that most people have only incarnated a fraction of the causal body or human soul. This fraction is known as the Essence or the Buddhata, which in humanity is bottled up in the psychological aggregates that constitute the ego. Samael Aun Weor states:\nThus, the various aggregates that are within ourselves represent different volitional impulses. There are, therefore, several wills within our psyche which fight against each other. The intellectual animal doesn’t have any autonomous, independent and unitotal will. There is no unity in the intellectual animal’s willpower. But when a man has created his Body of Conscious Will [causal body], he has individual willpower he can work with in the whole universe.\nThe way to create the causal body is by working in the \"Forge of Cyclops\", that is, sexual alchemy between husband and wife.\n\n\n"}

When a German or Danish soldier or informant was killed by the Danish resistance movement, the Peter group performed one or more clearing murder.\n\nHitler, at some time in the latter half of 1944, ordered that 10 civilians be killed each time a German soldier was killed by civilians. In Denmark, this was modified so that only one civilian was shot for one German soldier.\n\nThe first clearing murder was of famous author and priest Kaj Munk January 4, 1944. Subsequently, several doctors were murdered, including a senior consultant in Vejle and four doctors in Odense. In all, it is estimated that around one hundred people were killed in clearing murders.\n\nUsually the clearing murders were done as street shooting in order to increase the terror impact of fear and uncertainty in the general population. The aim was to turn the population against the Danish resistance movement. Doctors were especially vulnerable to clearing murders since they were out to look after the sick at any time of day.\n\nThe Germans demanded the Danish newspapers to print articles linking resistance killings and clearing murders next to each other on the same page.\n\n"}

It may be described also as the dual bundle to the tangent bundle.\n\nSmooth sections of the cotangent bundle are differential one-forms.\n\nLet \"M\" be a smooth manifold and let \"M\"×\"M\" be the Cartesian product of \"M\" with itself. The diagonal mapping Δ sends a point \"p\" in \"M\" to the point (\"p\",\"p\") of \"M\"×\"M\". The image of Δ is called the diagonal. Let formula_1 be the sheaf of germs of smooth functions on \"M\"×\"M\" which vanish on the diagonal. Then the quotient sheaf formula_2 consists of equivalence classes of functions which vanish on the diagonal modulo higher order terms. The cotangent sheaf is the pullback of this sheaf to \"M\":\n\nBy Taylor's theorem, this is a locally free sheaf of modules with respect to the sheaf of germs of smooth functions of \"M\". Thus it defines a vector bundle on \"M\": the cotangent bundle.\n\nSee also: bundle of principal parts (which generalizes the above constructions to higher orders.)\n\nA smooth morphism formula_4 of manifolds, induces a pullback sheaf formula_5 on \"M\". There is an induced map of vector bundles formula_6.\n\nGiven a smooth manifold formula_7 embedded into formula_8 such that formula_7 is the vanishing locus of a smooth function formula_10, we can define the cotangent bundle of formula_7 as the set\nFor example, consider the 3-sphere given by the vanishing locus of formula_13 in formula_14. Then, we can compute a presentation of its cotangent bundle as the set\n\nSince the cotangent bundle \"X\"=\"T\"*\"M\" is a vector bundle, it can be regarded as a manifold in its own right. Because of the manner in which the definition of \"T\"*\"M\" relates to the differential topology of the base space \"M\", \"X\" possesses a canonical one-form θ (also tautological one-form or symplectic potential). The exterior derivative of θ is a symplectic 2-form, out of which a non-degenerate volume form can be built for \"X\". For example, as a result \"X\" is always an orientable manifold (meaning that the tangent bundle of \"X\" is an orientable vector bundle). A special set of coordinates can be defined on the cotangent bundle; these are called the canonical coordinates. Because cotangent bundles can be thought of as symplectic manifolds, any real function on the cotangent bundle can be interpreted to be a Hamiltonian; thus the cotangent bundle can be understood to be a phase space on which Hamiltonian mechanics plays out.\n\nThe cotangent bundle carries a tautological one-form θ also known as the \"Poincaré\" \"1\"-form or \"Liouville\" \"1\"-form. (The form is also known as the \"canonical one-form\", although this can sometimes lead to confusion.) This means that if we regard \"T\"*\"M\" as a manifold in its own right, there is a canonical section of the vector bundle \"T\"*(\"T\"*\"M\") over \"T\"*\"M\".\n\nThis section can be constructed in several ways. The most elementary method is to use local coordinates. Suppose that \"x\" are local coordinates on the base manifold \"M\". In terms of these base coordinates, there are fibre coordinates \"p\": a one-form at a particular point of \"T\"*\"M\" has the form \"p\" \"dx\" (Einstein summation convention implied). So the manifold \"T\"*\"M\" itself carries local coordinates (\"x\",\"p\") where the \"x\" are coordinates on the base and the \"p\" are coordinates in the fibre.

It can be linked to pessimism in psychology.\nThe term \"defeatism\" commonly is used in politics as a descriptor for an ideological stance that considers co-operation with the opposition party. In the military context, in wartime, and especially at the front, \"defeatism\" is synonymous with treason.\n\nUnder military law, a soldier can be accused of being defeatist if he refuses to fight by voicing doubt of the ideological validity of national policy; thus, existential questions such as “Is the war already lost?” and “Is the fight worth the effort?” are defeatism that connote advocacy of an alternative end-to-the war other than military victory.\n\nDuring World War II, Adolf Hitler unexpectedly dismissed many generals for defeatism. During the last year of war, the German people's court executed many people accused of defeatist talks or acts and their names were announced weekly in a pink colored poster pasted on billboards around the country.\n\nRevolutionary defeatism is a related idea, made most prominent by Vladimir Lenin, that establishes that the proletariat cannot win or gain in a capitalist war. Instead, according to Lenin, the true enemy of the proletariat is the imperialist leaders who send their lower classes into battle.

{"id": "23121551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23121551", "title": "Dialogical analysis", "text": "Dialogical analysis\n\nDialogical analysis, or more precisely dialogical interaction analysis, refers to a way of analyzing human communication which is based on the theory of dialogism. The approach has been developed based on the theoretical work of George Herbert Mead and Bakhtin.\n\nDialogism makes several assumptions. It assumes that human communication entails the interaction of diverse perspectives and is embedded in a socio-historical context, that the meaning of a communication can be different to the various participants, that it is important to examine the consequences of a communication, and that each participant in a communication is, to some degree, orienting to the orientation of the other.\n\nDialogical analysis is an interpretative methodology which closely analyzes spoken or written utterances or actions for their embedded communicative significance. Questions typically asked during a dialogical analysis include: What does each interactant think about themselves, the other and what the other thinks of them? What do the given utterances and actions imply about the given activity or participants? Why was a given communicative act performed – why did it need to be said? What was the alternative that the utterance was trying to dispel? People are often borrowing words, phrases and ideas from other people, and accordingly, dialogical analysis often asks: who is doing the talking? Specifically, which voices and echoes are evident in the given utterance?\n\nAlthough dialogical analysis tends to focus on discourse, it is distinct from discourse analysis and conversation analysis because its focus goes beyond the question of how people speak and what they achieve by speaking. Dialogical analysis uses dialogue as a metaphor for understanding phenomena beyond communication itself, such as the self (see dialogical self), internal dialogues, self-talk, misunderstandings, trust and distrust, the production of knowledge, and relations between groups in society.\n\nRecently there have been attempts to formalize the move from dialogism, which is often quite theoretical, to a systematic methodology for data analysis. These approaches focus upon 'sensitizing questions' that facilitate a dialogical analysis and step-by-step procedures for analyzing multivoicedness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "465183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=465183", "title": "Educational assessment", "text": "Educational assessment\n\nEducational assessment is the systematic process of documenting and using empirical data on the knowledge, skill, attitudes, and beliefs to refine programs and improve student learning. Assessment data can be obtained from directly examining student work to assess the achievement of learning outcomes or can be based on data from which one can make inferences about learning. Assessment is often used interchangeably with test, but not limited to tests. Assessment can focus on the individual learner, the learning community (class, workshop, or other organized group of learners), a course, an academic program, the institution, or the educational system as a whole (also known as granularity). The word 'assessment' came into use in an educational context after the Second World War.\n\nAs a continuous process, assessment establishes measurable and clear student learning outcomes for learning, provisioning a sufficient amount of learning opportunities to achieve these outcomes, implementing a systematic way of gathering, analyzing and interpreting evidence to determine how well student learning matches expectations, and using the collected information to inform improvement in student learning.\n\nThe final purpose of assessment practices in education depends on the \"theoretical framework\" of the practitioners and researchers, their assumptions and beliefs about the nature of human mind, the origin of knowledge, and the process of learning.\n\nThe term \"assessment\" is generally used to refer to all activities teachers use to help students learn and to gauge student progress. Assessment can be divided for the sake of convenience using the following categorizations:\n\nAssessment is often divided into initial, formative, and summative categories for the purpose of considering different objectives for assessment practices.\n\nJay McTighe and Ken O'Connor proposed seven practices to effective learning. One of them is about showing the criteria of the evaluation before the test. Another is about the importance of pre-assessment to know what the skill levels of a student are before giving instructions. Giving a lot of feedback and encouraging are other practices.\n\nEducational researcher Robert Stake explains the difference between formative and summative assessment with the following analogy: \n\nSummative and formative assessment are often referred to in a learning context as \"assessment of learning\" and \"assessment for learning\" respectively. Assessment of learning is generally summative in nature and intended to measure learning outcomes and report those outcomes to students, parents and administrators. Assessment of learning generally occurs at the conclusion of a class, course, semester or academic year. Assessment for learning is generally formative in nature and is used by teachers to consider approaches to teaching and next steps for individual learners and the class.\n\nA common form of formative assessment is \"diagnostic assessment\". Diagnostic assessment measures a student's current knowledge and skills for the purpose of identifying a suitable program of learning. \"Self-assessment\" is a form of diagnostic assessment which involves students assessing themselves. \"Forward-looking assessment\" asks those being assessed to consider themselves in hypothetical future situations.\n\n\"Performance-based assessment\" is similar to summative assessment, as it focuses on achievement. It is often aligned with the standards-based education reform and outcomes-based education movement. Though ideally they are significantly different from a traditional multiple choice test, they are most commonly associated with standards-based assessment which use free-form responses to standard questions scored by human scorers on a standards-based scale, meeting, falling below or exceeding a performance standard rather than being ranked on a curve. A well-defined task is identified and students are asked to create, produce or do something, often in settings that involve real-world application of knowledge and skills. Proficiency is demonstrated by providing an extended response. Performance formats are further differentiated into products and performances. The performance may result in a product, such as a painting, portfolio, paper or exhibition, or it may consist of a performance, such as a speech, athletic skill, musical recital or reading.\n\nAssessment (either summative or formative) is often categorized as either objective or subjective. Objective assessment is a form of questioning which has a single correct answer. Subjective assessment is a form of questioning which may have more than one correct answer (or more than one way of expressing the correct answer). There are various types of objective and subjective questions. Objective question types include true/false answers, multiple choice, multiple-response and matching questions. Subjective questions include extended-response questions and essays. Objective assessment is well suited to the increasingly popular computerized or online assessment format.\n\nSome have argued that the distinction between objective and subjective assessments is neither useful nor accurate because, in reality, there is no such thing as \"objective\" assessment. In fact, all assessments are created with inherent biases built into decisions about relevant subject matter and content, as well as cultural (class, ethnic, and gender) biases.\n\nTest results can be compared against an established criterion, or against the performance of other students, or against previous performance:\n\n\nAssessment can be either \"formal\" or \"informal\". Formal assessment usually implies a written document, such as a test, quiz, or paper. A formal assessment is given a numerical score or grade based on student performance, whereas an informal assessment does not contribute to a student's final grade. An informal assessment usually occurs in a more casual manner and may include observation, inventories, checklists, rating scales, rubrics, performance and portfolio assessments, participation, peer and self-evaluation, and discussion.\n\nInternal assessment is set and marked by the school (i.e. teachers). Students get the mark and feedback regarding the assessment. External assessment is set by the governing body, and is marked by non-biased personnel. Some external assessments give much more limited feedback in their marking. However, in tests such as Australia's NAPLAN, the criterion addressed by students is given detailed feedback in order for their teachers to address and compare the student's learning achievements and also to plan for the future.\n\nIn general, high-quality assessments are considered those with a high level of reliability and validity. Approaches to reliability and validity vary, however.\n\nReliability relates to the consistency of an assessment. A reliable assessment is one that consistently achieves the same results with the same (or similar) cohort of students. Various factors affect reliability—including ambiguous questions, too many options within a question paper, vague marking instructions and poorly trained markers. Traditionally, the reliability of an assessment is based on the following:\n\nThe reliability of a measurement x can also be defined quantitatively as:\nformula_1 where formula_2 is the reliability in the observed (test) score, x; \nformula_3 and formula_4 are the variability in ‘true’ (i.e., candidate’s innate performance) and measured test scores respectively. formula_2 can range from 0 (completely unreliable), to 1 (completely reliable).\nValid assessment is one that measures what it is intended to measure. For example, it would not be valid to assess driving skills through a written test alone. A more valid way of assessing driving skills would be through a combination of tests that help determine what a driver knows, such as through a written test of driving knowledge, and what a driver is able to do, such as through a performance assessment of actual driving. Teachers frequently complain that some examinations do not properly assess the syllabus upon which the examination is based; they are, effectively, questioning the validity of the exam.\nValidity of an assessment is generally gauged through examination of evidence in the following categories:\n\nA good assessment has both validity and reliability, plus the other quality attributes noted above for a specific context and purpose. In practice, an assessment is rarely totally valid or totally reliable. A ruler which is marked wrongly will always give the same (wrong) measurements. It is very reliable, but not very valid. Asking random individuals to tell the time without looking at a clock or watch is sometimes used as an example of an assessment which is valid, but not reliable. The answers will vary between individuals, but the average answer is probably close to the actual time. In many fields, such as medical research, educational testing, and psychology, there will often be a trade-off between reliability and validity. A history test written for high validity will have many essay and fill-in-the-blank questions. It will be a good measure of mastery of the subject, but difficult to score completely accurately. A history test written for high reliability will be entirely multiple choice. It isn't as good at measuring knowledge of history, but can easily be scored with great precision. We may generalize from this. The more reliable our estimate is of what we purport to measure, the less certain we are that we are actually measuring that aspect of attainment.\n\nIt is well to distinguish between \"subject-matter\" validity and \"predictive\" validity. The former, used widely in education, predicts the score a student would get on a similar test but with different questions. The latter, used widely in the workplace, predicts performance. Thus, a subject-matter-valid test of knowledge of driving rules is appropriate while a predictively valid test would assess whether the potential driver could follow those rules.\n\nIn the field of evaluation, and in particular educational evaluation, the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has published three sets of standards for evaluations. \"The Personnel Evaluation Standards\" was published in 1988, \"The Program Evaluation Standards\" (2nd edition) was published in 1994, and \"The Student Evaluation Standards\" was published in 2003.\n\nEach publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate. In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.\n\nThe following table summarizes the main \"theoretical frameworks\" behind almost all the theoretical and research work, and the instructional practices in education (one of them being, of course, the practice of assessment). These different frameworks have given rise to interesting debates among scholars.\n\nConcerns over how best to apply assessment practices across public school systems have largely focused on questions about the use of high-stakes testing and standardized tests, often used to gauge student progress, teacher quality, and school-, district-, or statewide educational success.\n\nFor most researchers and practitioners, the question is not whether tests should be administered at all—there is a general consensus that, when administered in useful ways, tests can offer useful information about student progress and curriculum implementation, as well as offering formative uses for learners. The real issue, then, is whether testing practices as currently implemented can provide these services for educators and students.\n\nPresident Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) on January 8, 2002. The NCLB Act reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. President Johnson signed the ESEA to help fight the War on Poverty and helped fund elementary and secondary schools. President Johnson's goal was to emphasizes equal access to education and establishes high standards and accountability. The NCLB Act required states to develop assessments in basic skills. To receive federal school funding, states had to give these assessments to all students at select grade level.\n\nIn the U.S., the No Child Left Behind Act mandates standardized testing nationwide. These tests align with state curriculum and link teacher, student, district, and state accountability to the results of these tests. Proponents of NCLB argue that it offers a tangible method of gauging educational success, holding teachers and schools accountable for failing scores, and closing the achievement gap across class and ethnicity.\n\nOpponents of standardized testing dispute these claims, arguing that holding educators accountable for test results leads to the practice of \"teaching to the test.\" Additionally, many argue that the focus on standardized testing encourages teachers to equip students with a narrow set of skills that enhance test performance without actually fostering a deeper understanding of subject matter or key principles within a knowledge domain.\n\nThe assessments which have caused the most controversy in the U.S. are the use of high school graduation examinations, which are used to deny diplomas to students who have attended high school for four years, but cannot demonstrate that they have learned the required material when writing exams. Opponents say that no student who has put in four years of seat time should be denied a high school diploma merely for repeatedly failing a test, or even for not knowing the required material.\n\nHigh-stakes tests have been blamed for causing sickness and test anxiety in students and teachers, and for teachers choosing to narrow the curriculum towards what the teacher believes will be tested. In an exercise designed to make children comfortable about testing, a Spokane, Washington newspaper published a picture of a monster that feeds on fear. The published image is purportedly the response of a student who was asked to draw a picture of what she thought of the state assessment.\n\nOther critics, such as Washington State University's Don Orlich, question the use of test items far beyond standard cognitive levels for students' age.\n\nCompared to portfolio assessments, simple multiple-choice tests are much less expensive, less prone to disagreement between scorers, and can be scored quickly enough to be returned before the end of the school year. Standardized tests (all students take the same test under the same conditions) often use multiple-choice tests for these reasons. Orlich criticizes the use of expensive, holistically graded tests, rather than inexpensive multiple-choice \"bubble tests\", to measure the quality of both the system and individuals for very large numbers of students. Other prominent critics of high-stakes testing include Fairtest and Alfie Kohn.\n\nThe use of IQ tests has been banned in some states for educational decisions, and norm-referenced tests, which rank students from \"best\" to \"worst\", have been criticized for bias against minorities. Most education officials support criterion-referenced tests (each individual student's score depends solely on whether he answered the questions correctly, regardless of whether his neighbors did better or worse) for making high-stakes decisions.\n\nIt has been widely noted that with the emergence of social media and Web 2.0 technologies and mindsets, learning is increasingly collaborative and knowledge increasingly distributed across many members of a learning community. Traditional assessment practices, however, focus in large part on the individual and fail to account for knowledge-building and learning in context. As researchers in the field of assessment consider the cultural shifts that arise from the emergence of a more participatory culture, they will need to find new methods of applying assessments to learners.\n\nSudbury model of democratic education schools do not perform and do not offer assessments, evaluations, transcripts, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational assessment for the 21st century, they adduce.\n\nAccording to Sudbury schools, this policy does not cause harm to their students as they move on to life outside the school. However, they admit it makes the process more difficult, but that such hardship is part of the students learning to make their own way, set their own standards and meet their own goals.\n\nThe no-grading and no-rating policy helps to create an atmosphere free of competition among students or battles for adult approval, and encourages a positive cooperative environment amongst the student body.\n\nThe final stage of a Sudbury education, should the student choose to take it, is the graduation thesis. Each student writes on the topic of how they have prepared themselves for adulthood and entering the community at large. This thesis is submitted to the Assembly, who reviews it. The final stage of the thesis process is an oral defense given by the student in which they open the floor for questions, challenges and comments from all Assembly members. At the end, the Assembly votes by secret ballot on whether or not to award a diploma.\n\nA major concern with the use of educational assessments is the overall validity, accuracy, and fairness when it comes to assessing English language learners (ELL). The majority of assessments within the United States have normative standards based on the English-speaking culture, which does not adequately represent ELL populations. Consequently, it would in many cases be inaccurate and inappropriate to draw conclusions from ELL students’ normative scores. Research shows that the majority of schools do not appropriately modify assessments in order to accommodate students from unique cultural backgrounds. This has resulted in the over-referral of ELL students to special education, causing them to be disproportionately represented in special education programs. Although some may see this inappropriate placement in special education as supportive and helpful, research has shown that inappropriately placed students actually regressed in progress.\n\nIt is often necessary to utilize the services of a translator in order to administer the assessment in an ELL student’s native language; however, there are several issues when translating assessment items. One issue is that translations can frequently suggest a correct or expected response, changing the difficulty of the assessment item. Additionally, the translation of assessment items can sometimes distort the original meaning of the item. Finally, many translators are not qualified or properly trained to work with ELL students in an assessment situation. All of these factors compromise the validity and fairness of assessments, making the results not reliable. Nonverbal assessments have shown to be less discriminatory for ELL students, however, some still present cultural biases within the assessment items.\n\nWhen considering an ELL student for special education the assessment team should integrate and interpret all of the information collected in order to ensure a non biased conclusion. The decision should be based on multidimensional sources of data including teacher and parent interviews, as well as classroom observations. Decisions should take the students unique cultural, linguistic, and experiential backgrounds into consideration, and should not be strictly based on assessment results.\n\n"}

{"id": "9496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9496", "title": "Epiphenomenalism", "text": "Epiphenomenalism\n\nEpiphenomenalism is a position on the mind–body problem which holds that physical and biochemical events within the human body (sense organs, neural impulses, and muscle contractions, for example) are causal with respect to mental events (thought, consciousness, and cognition). According to this view, subjective mental events are completely dependent for their existence on corresponding physical and biochemical events within the human body and themselves have no causal efficacy on physical events. The appearance that subjective mental states (such as intentions) influence physical events is merely an illusion. For instance, fear seems to make the heart beat faster, but according to epiphenomenalism the biochemical secretions of the brain and nervous system (such as adrenaline)—not the experience of fear—is what raises the heartbeat. Because mental events are a kind of overflow that cannot cause anything physical, yet have non-physical properties, epiphenomenalism is viewed as a form of property dualism.\n\nDuring the seventeenth century, Rene Descartes argued that animals are subject to mechanical laws of nature. He defended the idea of automatic behavior, or the performance of actions without conscious thought. Descartes questioned how the immaterial mind and the material body can interact causally. His interactionist model (1649) held that the body relates to the mind through the pineal gland. La Mettrie, Leibniz, and Spinoza all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by Cabanis (1802), and was further explicated by Hodgson (1870) and Huxley (1874).\n\nThomas Henry Huxley agreed with Descartes that behavior is determined solely by physical mechanisms, but he also believed that humans enjoy an intelligent life. In 1874, Huxley argued that animals are conscious automata in the Presidential Address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Huxley proposed that psychical changes are collateral products of physical changes. He termed the stream of consciousness an \"epiphenomenon;\" like the bell of a clock that has no role in keeping the time, consciousness has no role in determining behavior.\n\nHuxley defended automatism by testing reflex actions, originally supported by Descartes. Huxley hypothesized that frogs that undergo lobotomy would swim when thrown into water, despite being unable to initiate actions. He argued that the ability to swim was solely dependent on the molecular change in the brain, concluding that consciousness is not necessary for reflex actions. According to epiphenomenalism, animals experience pain only as a result of neurophysiology.\n\nIn 1870, Huxley conducted a case study on a French soldier who had sustained a shot in the Franco-Prussian War that fractured his left parietal bone. Every few weeks the soldier would enter a trance-like state, smoking, dressing himself, and aiming his cane like a rifle all while being insensitive to pins, electric shocks, odorous substances, vinegar, noise, and certain light conditions. Huxley used this study to show that consciousness was not necessary to execute these purposeful actions, justifying the assumption that humans are insensible machines. Huxley's mechanistic attitude towards the body convinced him that the brain alone causes behavior.\n\nIn the early 1900s scientific behaviorists such as Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of eliminativism or mental fictionalism, positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. George Santayana (1905) believed that all motion has merely physical causes. Because consciousness is accessory to life and not essential to it, natural selection is responsible for ingraining tendencies to avoid certain contingencies without any conscious achievement involved. By the 1960s, scientific behaviourism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the cognitive revolution. Participants in that revolution, such as Jerry Fodor, reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of \"epiphobia\"—fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.\n\nHowever, since the cognitive revolution, there have been several who have argued for a version of epiphenomenalism. In 1970, Keith Campbell proposed his \"new epiphenomenalism\", which states that the body produces a spiritual mind that does not act on the body. How the brain causes a spiritual mind, according to Campbell, is destined to remain beyond our understanding forever (see New Mysterianism). In 2001, David Chalmers and Frank Jackson argued that claims about conscious states should be deduced a priori from claims about physical states alone. They offered that epiphenomenalism bridges, but does not close, the explanatory gap between the physical and the phenomenal realms. These more recent versions maintain that only the subjective, qualitative aspects of mental states are epiphenomenal. Imagine both Pierre and a robot eating a cupcake. Unlike the robot, Pierre is conscious of eating the cupcake while the behavior is under way. This subjective experience is often called a \"quale\" (plural qualia), and it describes the private \"raw feel\" or the subjective \"what-it-is-like\" that is the inner accompaniment of many mental states. Thus, while Pierre and the robot are both doing the same thing, only Pierre has the inner conscious experience.\n\nFrank Jackson (1982), for example, once espoused the following view:\n\nAccording to epiphenomenalism, mental states like Pierre's pleasurable experience—or, at any rate, their distinctive qualia—are epiphenomena; they are side-effects or by-products of physical processes in the body. If Pierre takes a second bite, it is not caused by his pleasure from the first; If Pierre says, \"That was good, so I will take another bite\", his speech act is not caused by the preceding pleasure. The conscious experiences that accompany brain processes are causally impotent. The mind might simply be a byproduct of other properties such as brain size or pathway activation synchronicity, which are adaptive.\n\nSome thinkers draw distinctions between different varieties of epiphenomenalism. In \"Consciousness Explained\", Daniel Dennett distinguishes between a purely metaphysical sense of epiphenomenalism, in which the epiphenomenon has no causal impact at all, and Huxley's \"steam whistle\" epiphenomenalism, in which effects exist but are not functionally relevant.\n\nA large body of neurophysiological data seems to support epiphenomenalism. Some of the oldest such data is the Bereitschaftspotential or \"readiness potential\" in which electrical activity related to voluntary actions can be recorded up to two seconds before the subject is aware of making a decision to perform the action. More recently Benjamin Libet et al. (1979) have shown that it can take 0.5 seconds before a stimulus becomes part of conscious experience even though subjects can respond to the stimulus in reaction time tests within 200 milliseconds. The conclusions of this experiment have begun to receive some backlash and criticism, mainly by neuroscientists such as Peter Tse, who claim to show that the readiness potential has nothing to do with consciousness at all. Recent research on the Event Related Potential also shows that conscious experience does not occur until the late phase of the potential (P3 or later) that occurs 300 milliseconds or more after the event. In Bregman's auditory continuity illusion, where a pure tone is followed by broadband noise and the noise is followed by the same pure tone it seems as if the tone occurs throughout the period of noise. This also suggests a delay for processing data before conscious experience occurs. Popular science author Tor Nørretranders has called the delay the \"user illusion\", implying that we only have the illusion of conscious control, most actions being controlled automatically by non-conscious parts of the brain with the conscious mind relegated to the role of spectator.\n\nThe scientific data seem to support the idea that conscious experience is created by non-conscious processes in the brain (i.e., there is subliminal processing that becomes conscious experience). These results have been interpreted to suggest that people are capable of action before conscious experience of the decision to act occurs. Some argue that this supports epiphenomenalism, since it shows that the feeling of making a decision to act is actually an epiphenomenon; the action happens before the decision, so the decision did not cause the action to occur.\nThe most powerful argument against epiphenomenalism is that it is self-contradictory: if we have knowledge about epiphenomenalism, then our brains know about the existence of the mind, but if epiphenomenalism were correct, then our brains should not have any knowledge about the mind, because the mind does not affect anything physical.\n\nHowever, some philosophers do not accept this as a rigorous refutation. For example, Victor Argonov states that epiphenomenalism is a questionable, but experimentally falsifiable theory. He argues that the personal mind is not the only source of knowledge about the existence of mind in the world. A creature (even a zombie) could have knowledge about mind and the mind-body problem by virtue of some innate knowledge. The information about mind (and its problematic properties such as qualia) could have been, in principle, implicitly \"written\" in the material world since its creation. Epiphenomenalists can say that God created immaterial mind and a detailed \"program\" of material human behavior that makes it possible to speak about the mind–body problem. That version of epiphenomenalism seems highly exotic, but it cannot be excluded from consideration by pure theory. However, Argonov suggests that experiments could refute epiphenomenalism. In particular, epiphenomenalism could be refuted if neural correlates of consciousness can be found in the human brain, and it is proven that human speech about consciousness is caused by them.\n\nSome philosophers, such as Dennett, reject both epiphenomenalism and the existence of qualia with the same charge that Gilbert Ryle leveled against a Cartesian \"ghost in the machine\", that they too are category mistakes. A quale or conscious experience would not belong to the category of objects of reference on this account, but rather to the category of ways of doing things.\n\nFunctionalists assert that mental states are well described by their overall role, their activity in relation to the organism as a whole. \"This doctrine is rooted in Aristotle's conception of the soul, and has antecedents in Hobbes's conception of the mind as a 'calculating machine', but it has become fully articulated (and popularly endorsed) only in the last third of the 20th century.\" In so far as it mediates stimulus and response, a mental function is analogous to a program that processes input/output in automata theory. In principle, multiple realisability would guarantee platform dependencies can be avoided, whether in terms of hardware and operating system or, \"ex hypothesi\", biology and philosophy. Because a high-level language is a practical requirement for developing the most complex programs, functionalism implies that a non-reductive physicalism would offer a similar advantage over a strictly eliminative materialism.\n\nEliminative materialists believe \"folk psychology\" is so unscientific that, ultimately, it will be better to eliminate primitive concepts such as \"mind,\" \"desire\" and \"belief,\" in favor of a future neuro-scientific account. A more moderate position such as J. L. Mackie's \"error theory\" suggests that false beliefs should be stripped away from a mental concept without eliminating the concept itself, the legitimate core meaning being left intact.\n\nBenjamin Libet's results are quoted in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a \"conscious veto\", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In \"Freedom Evolves\", Daniel Dennett argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. Similar criticism of Libet-style research has been made by neuroscientist Adina Roskies and cognitive theorists Tim Bayne and Alfred Mele.\n\nOthers have argued that data such as the Bereitschaftspotential undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience and a conscious decision occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is \"completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery\".\n\nAdrian G. Guggisberg and Annaïs Mottaz have also challenged those findings.\n\nA study by Aaron Schurger and colleagues published in PNAS challenged assumptions about the causal nature of the readiness potential itself (and the \"pre-movement buildup\" of neural activity in general), thus denying the conclusions drawn from studies such as Libet's and Fried's.\n\nIn favor of interactionism, Celia Green (2003) argues that epiphenomenalism does not even provide a satisfactory 'out' from the problem of interaction posed by substance dualism. Although it does not entail substance dualism, according to Green, epiphenomenalism implies a one-way form of interactionism that is just as hard to conceive of as the two-way form embodied in substance dualism. Green suggests the assumption that it is less of a problem may arise from the unexamined belief that physical events have some sort of primacy over mental ones.\n\nDonald Symons dismisses epiphenomenalism from an evolutionary perspective. He says that the view that mind is an epiphenomenon of brain activity is not consistent with evolutionary theory, because if mind were functionless, it would have disappeared long ago, as it would not have been favoured by evolution.\n\n\n"}

It was designed by Folke Günther in Sweden. \n\nInspired by the \"Sanitas wall\" at Dr Gösta Nilsson's Sanitas farm project in Botswana, this technique makes an efficient use of space by fulfilling two essential functions: vertical plant growing and purification of greywater. This system is also known as a living wall or green wall.\n\nThe basic design is a wall of hollow concrete slabs, with compartments opening on one or both sides of the wall. The hollows are filled with inert material like gravel, expanded clay aggregate, perlite, or vermiculite. It is designed to let the water trickle over the longest possible treatment path along the length of the wall among the pebbles. \n\nThe water is brought in at the top, and percolates following a zig-zag pattern inside the wall. As it does so the plant roots grow among the inert material and extract nutrients from the water. A film of beneficial bacteria grows over the pebbles, releasing the nutrients in the percolating greywater. At the bottom of the wall a container collects the purified water, which can then be used for non-potable household use, for watering the garden, or it can be returned to the top of the wall.\n\n\"Plants used\": since the harvesting of the plants is a part of the purification process, fast growing, herbaceous crops are particularly suited for the Folkewall. Annual food crops are suitable, perennials like trees and shrubs should be avoided.\n\n\"Greywater\": The water feeding the plants in the wall must be free of heavy metals and/or unsafe pollutants, notably human waste.

There is wide agreement that these views were essentially fully formed over 2000 years ago. Candidates for the first thinkers to form these views, as well as the idea of a non-physical \"agent-causal\" libertarianism, include Democritus (460–370), Aristotle (384–322), Epicurus (341–270), Chrysippus (280–207), and Carneades (214–129).\n\nEarly religious accounts of man's fate explored the degree of human freedom permitted by superhuman gods. A strong fatalism is present in tales that foretell the future, based on the idea that the gods have foreknowledge of future events. Anxious not to annoy the gods, the myth-makers rarely challenged the idea that the gods' foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom.\n\nThe first thinkers to look for explanatory causes (ἀιτία) in natural phenomena (rather than gods controlling events) were the Greek Pre-Socratic philosophers (\"physiologoi\"). The reasons or rules (λόγοι) behind the physical (φύσις) world became the ideal \"laws\" governing material phenomena. Anaximander (610-546) coined the term physis (φύσις) and perhaps even the cosmological combination of cosmos (κόσμος), as organized nature, and logos (λόγος), as the law behind nature. The Greeks had a separate word for the laws (or conventions) of society, nomos (νόμος). Heraclitus (535–475) claimed that everything changes (\"you can't step twice into the same river\") but that there were laws or rules (the logos) behind all the change. The early cosmologists imagined that the universal laws were all-powerful and must therefore explain the natural causes behind all things, from the regular motions of the heavens to the mind (νοῦς) of man. These \"physiologoi\" transformed pre-philosophical arguments about gods controlling the human will into arguments about pre-existing causes controlling it.\n\nThe materialist philosophers Democritus and his mentor Leucippus were the first determinists. They claimed that all things, including humans, were made of atoms in a void, with individual atomic motions strictly controlled by causal laws. Democritus said:\n\nDemocritus wanted to wrest control of man's fate from arbitrary gods and make us more responsible for our actions. But ironically, he and Leucippus originated two of the great dogmas of determinism, physical determinism and logical necessity, which lead directly to the traditional and modern problem of free will and determinism.\n\nLeucippus dogmatically declared an absolute necessity which left no room in the cosmos for chance.\n\nThe consequence is a world with but one possible future, completely determined by its past.\n\nIn Plato's Gorgias (and in the Protagoras 345c4-e6), Socrates argues that no one does wrong willingly, one of the most famous doctrines to be associated with him. When framed in modern (Western) terms, the implication is that it is ignorance, rather that free individual agency, that is responsible for morally wrong actions.\n\nMichael Frede typifies the prevailing view of recent scholarship, namely that Aristotle did not have a notion of free-will.\n\nAristotle elaborated the four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle's word for these causes was ἀιτία, which translates as causes in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic \"every event has a (single) cause\" idea that was to come later.\nThen, in his \"Physics\" and \"Metaphysics\", Aristotle also said there were \"accidents\" caused by \"chance (τυχή)\". In his \"Physics\", he noted that the early physicists had found no place for chance among their causes.\n\nAristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity:\n\nTracing any particular sequence of events back in time will usually come to an accidental event – a \"starting point\" or \"fresh start\" (Aristotle calls it an origin or arche (ἀρχή) – whose major contributing cause (or causes) was itself uncaused.\n\nWhether a particular thing happens, says Aristotle, may depend on a series of causes that\n\nIn general, many such causal sequences contribute to any event, including human decisions. Each sequence has a different time of origin, some going back before we were born, some originating during our deliberations. Beyond causal sequences that are the result of chance or necessity, Aristotle felt that some breaks in the causal chain allow us to feel our actions \"depend on us\" (ἐφ' ἡμῖν). These are the causal chains that originate within us (ἐv ἡμῖν).\n\nRichard Sorabji's 1980 \"Necessity, Cause, and Blame\" surveyed Aristotle's positions on causation and necessity, comparing them to his predecessors and successors, especially the Stoics and Epicurus. Sorabji argues that Aristotle was an indeterminist, that real chance and uncaused events exist, but never that human actions are uncaused in the extreme libertarian sense that some commentators mistakenly attribute to Epicurus.\n\nAristotle accepted the past as fixed, in the sense that past events were irrevocable. But future events cannot be necessitated by claims about the present truth value of statements about the future. Aristotle does not deny the excluded middle (either p or not p), only that the truth value of p does not exist yet. Indeed, although the past is fixed, the truth value of past statements about the future can be changed by the outcome of future events. This is the problem of future contingents.\n\nAlthough he thinks Aristotle was not aware of the \"problem\" of free will vis-a-vis determinism (as first described by Epicurus), Sorabji thinks Aristotle's position on the question is clear enough. Voluntariness is too important to fall before theoretical arguments about necessity and determinism.\n\nIt is with Epicurus and the Stoics that clearly indeterministic and deterministic positions are first formulated. Writing one generation after Aristotle, Epicurus argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would \"swerve\" (\"clinamen\") from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions (\"libertarianism\"), something impossible if every action was deterministically caused.\n\nEpicurus did not say the swerve was directly involved in decisions. But following Aristotle, Epicurus thought human agents have the autonomous ability to transcend necessity and chance (both of which destroy responsibility), so that praise and blame are appropriate. Epicurus finds a \"tertium quid\", beyond necessity (Democritus' physics) and beyond chance. His \"tertium quid\" is agent autonomy, what is \"up to us\".\n\nLucretius (1st century BCE), a strong supporter of Epicurus, saw the randomness as enabling free will, even if he could not explain exactly how, beyond the fact that random swerves would break the causal chain of determinism.\n\nIn 1967, Pamela Huby suggested that Epicurus was the original discoverer of the \"freewill problem\". Huby noted that there had been two main free will problems, corresponding to different determinisms, namely theological determinism (predestination and foreknowledge) and the physical causal determinism of Democritus.\nIt is unfortunate that our knowledge of the early history of the Stoics is so fragmentary, and that we have no agreed account of the relations between them and Epicurus. On the evidence we have, however, it seems to me more probable that Epicurus was the originator of the freewill controversy, and that it was only taken up with enthusiasm among the Stoics by Chrysippus, the third head of the school.\n\nIn 2000 Susanne Bobzien challenged Pamela Huby's 1967 assertion that Epicurus discovered the \"free will problem\".\n\nBobzien thinks Epicurus did not have a model of what she calls \"two-sided freedom,\" because she believes that Epicurus\n\n\"assumed...a gap in the causal chain immediately before, or simultaneously with, the decision or choice, a gap which allows the coming into being of a spontaneous motion. In this way every human decision or choice is directly linked with causal indeterminism...To avoid misunderstandings, I should stress that I do believe that Epicurus was an indeterminist of sorts – only that he did not advocate indeterminist free decision or indeterminist free choice.\nA. A. Long and D. N. Sedley, however, agree with Pamela Huby that Epicurus was the first to notice the modern problem of free will and determinism.\n\nEpicurus' problem is this: if it has been necessary all along that we should act as we do, it cannot be up to us, with the result that we would not be morally responsible for our actions at all. Thus posing the problem of determinism he becomes arguably the first philosopher to recognize the philosophical centrality of what we know as the Free Will Question. His strongly libertarian approach to it can be usefully contrasted with the Stoics' acceptance of determinism.\n\nThe question remains how random swerves can help to explain free action. In her 1992 book, \"The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind\", Julia Annas wrote:\n\nOne view, going back to the 19th century historian Carlo Giussani, is that Epicurus' atomic swerves are involved directly in every case of human free action, not just somewhere in the past that breaks the causal chain of determinism. In 1928 Cyril Bailey agreed with Giussani that the atoms of the mind-soul provide a break in the continuity of atomic motions, otherwise actions would be necessitated. Bailey imagined complexes of mind-atoms that work together to form a consciousness that is not determined, but also not susceptible to the pure randomness of individual atomic swerves, something that could constitute Epicurus' idea of actions being \"up to us\" (πὰρ' ἡμάς). Bailey states that Epicurus did not \"identify\" freedom of the will with chance.\n\nIt may be that [Giussani's] account presses the Epicurean doctrine slightly beyond the point to which the master had thought it out for himself, but it is a direct deduction from undoubted Epicurean conceptions and is a satisfactory explanation of what Epicurus meant: that he should have thought that the freedom of the will was chance, and fought hard to maintain it as chance and no more, is inconceivable.\nIn 1967 David Furley de-emphasized the importance of the swerve in both Epicurus and Lucretius so as to defend Epicurus from the \"extreme\" libertarian view that our actions are caused directly by random swerves. (Bailey had also denied this \"traditional interpretation\".) Furley argues for a strong connection between the ideas of Aristotle and Epicurus on autonomous actions that are \"up to us\".\n\nThe swerve, then, plays a purely negative part in Epicurean psychology. It saves \"voluntas\" from necessity, as Lucretius says it does, but it does not feature in every act of \"voluntas\".\nOn the other hand, in his 1983 thesis, \"Lucretius on the Clinamen and 'Free Will'\", Don Paul Fowler defended the ancient claim that Epicurus proposed random swerves as directly causing our actions.\n\nI turn to the overall interpretation. Lucretius is arguing from the existence of \"voluntas\" to the existence of the \"clinamen\"; nothing comes to be out of nothing, therefore \"voluntas\" must have a cause at the atomic level, viz. the \"clinamen\". The most natural interpretation of this is that every act of \"voluntas\" is caused by a swerve in the atoms of the animal's mind...There is a close causal, physical relationship between the macroscopic and the atomic. Furley, however, argued that the relationship between \"voluntas\" and the \"clinamen\" was very different; not every act of volition was accompanied by a swerve in the soul-atoms, but the \"clinamen\" was only an occasional event which broke the chain of causation between the σύστασις of our mind at birth and the 'engendered' state (τὸ ἀπογεγεννημένον) which determines our actions.Its role in Epicureanism is\nmerely to make a formal break with physical determinism, and it has no real effect on the outcome of particular actions. (p. 338).\n\nIn a 1999 \"Phronesis\" article, Purinton agreed with Fowler that random swerves directly cause volitions and actions:\"since they do not make volition itself a fresh start of motion, and Sedley's view does not do justice to his atomism...It seems to me, therefore, that there is no good reason to reject the thesis that Epicurus held that swerves cause volitions from the bottom up. And there are a number of good reasons to accept it.\"\n\nIt was the Stoic school of philosophy that solidified the idea of natural laws controlling all things, including the mind. Zeno of Citium, the original founder of Stoicism, had a simple but powerful idea of the causal chain compared to Aristotle. Zeno said that every event has a cause, and that cause necessitates the event. Given exactly the same circumstances, exactly the same result will occur.\n\nThe major developer of Stoicism, Chrysippus, took the edge off strict necessity. Like Democritus, Aristotle, and Epicurus before him, he wanted to strengthen the argument for moral responsibility, in particular defending it from Aristotle's and Epicurus' indeterminate chance causes.\n\nWhereas the past is unchangeable, Chrysippus argued that some future events that are possible do not occur by necessity from past external factors alone, but might (as Aristotle and Epicurus maintained) depend on us. We have a choice to assent or not to assent to an action. Chrysippus said our actions are determined (in part by ourselves as causes) and fated (because of God's foreknowledge), but he also said that they are not necessitated, i.e., pre-determined from the distant past. Chrysippus would be seen today as a compatibilist.\n\nR. W. Sharples describes the first compatibilist arguments to reconcile responsibility and determinism by Chrysippus\n\nThe Stoic position, given definitive expression by Chrysippus (c. 280–207 BC), the third head of the school, represents not the opposite extreme from that of Epicurus but an attempt to compromise, to combine determinism and responsibility. Their theory of the universe is indeed a completely deterministic one; everything is governed by fate, identified with the sequence of causes; nothing could happen otherwise than it does, and in any given set of circumstances one and only one result can follow – otherwise an uncaused motion would occur.\n\nChrysippus was concerned to preserve human responsibility in the context of his determinist system. His position was thus one of 'soft determinism', as opposed on the one hand to that of the 'hard determinist' who claims that determinism excludes responsibility, and on the other to that of the libertarian who agrees on the incompatibility but responsibility by determinism. The Greek to eph' hemin (ἐφ΄ ἡμῖν), 'what depends on us', like the English 'responsibility', was used both by libertarians and by soft determinists, though they differed as to what it involved; thus he occurrence of the expression is not a safe guide to the type of position involved. The situation is complicated by the fact that the debate is in Greek philosophy conducted entirely in terms of responsibility (to eph' hemin) rather than of freedom or free will; nevertheless it can be shown that some thinkers, Alexander among them, have a libertarian rather than a soft-determinist conception of responsibility, and in such cases I have not hesitated to use expressions like 'freedom'.\nAlexander of Aphrodisias (c. 150–210), the most famous ancient commentator on Aristotle, wrote in the age of Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics. He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today. Greek philosophy had no precise term for \"free will\" as did Latin (\"liberum arbitrium\" or \"libera voluntas\"). The discussion was in terms of responsibility, what \"depends on us\" (in Greek ἐφ ἡμῖν).\n\nAlexander believed that Aristotle was not a strict determinist like the Stoics, and Alexander himself argued that some events do not have pre-determined causes. In particular, man is responsible for self-caused decisions, and can choose to do or not to do something, as Chrysippus argued. However, Alexander denied the foreknowledge of events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature.\n\nR. W. Sharples described Alexander's \"De Fato\" as perhaps the most comprehensive treatment surviving from classical antiquity of the problem of responsibility (τὸ ἐφ’ ἡμίν) and determinism. It especially shed a great deal of light on Aristotle's position on free will and on the Stoic attempt to make responsibility compatible with determinism.\n\n"}
{"id": "31516478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31516478", "title": "Frozen orbit", "text": "Frozen orbit\n\nIn orbital mechanics, a frozen orbit is an orbit for an artificial satellite in which natural drifting due to the central body's shape has been minimized by careful selection of the orbital parameters. Typically, this is an orbit in which, over a long period of time, the satellite's altitude remains constant at the same point in each orbit. Changes in the inclination, position of the lowest point of the orbit, and eccentricity have been minimized by choosing initial values so that their perturbations cancel out. This results in a long-term stable orbit that minimizes the use of station-keeping propellant.\n\nFor most spacecraft, changes to orbits are caused by the oblateness of the Earth, gravitational attraction from the sun and moon, solar radiation pressure, and air drag. These are called \"perturbing forces\". They must be counteracted by maneuvers to keep the spacecraft in the desired orbit. For a geostationary spacecraft, correction maneuvers on the order of 40–50 m/s per year are required to counteract the gravitational forces from the sun and moon which move the orbital plane away from the equatorial plane of the Earth.\n\nFor sun-synchronous spacecraft, intentional shifting of the orbit plane (called \"precession\") can be used for the benefit of the mission. For these missions, a near-circular orbit with an altitude of 600–900 km is used. An appropriate inclination (97.8-99.0 degrees) is selected so that the precession of the orbital plane is equal to the rate of movement of the Earth around the sun, about 1 degree per day.\n\nAs a result, the spacecraft will pass over points on the Earth that have the same time of day during every orbit. For instance, if the orbit is \"square to the sun\", the vehicle will always pass over points at which it is 6 a.m. on the north-bound portion, and 6 p.m. on the south-bound portion (or vice versa). This is called a \"Dawn-Dusk\" orbit. Alternatively, if the sun lies in the orbital plane, the vehicle will always pass over places where it is midday on the north-bound leg, and places where it is midnight on the south-bound leg (or vice versa). These are called \"Noon-Midnight\" orbits. Such orbits are desirable for many Earth observation missions such as weather, imagery, and mapping.\n\nThe perturbing force caused by the oblateness of the Earth will in general perturb not only the orbital plane but also the eccentricity vector of the orbit. There exists, however, an almost-circular orbit for which there are no secular/long periodic perturbations of the eccentricity vector, only periodic perturbations with period equal to the orbital period. Such an orbit is then perfectly periodic (except for the orbital plane precession) and it is therefore called a \"frozen orbit\". Such an orbit is often the preferred choice for an Earth observation mission where repeated observations of the same area of the Earth should be made under as constant observation conditions as possible.\n\nThe Earth observation satellites ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat are operated in sun-synchronous frozen orbits.\n\nThrough a study of many lunar orbiting satellites, scientists have discovered that most low lunar orbits (LLO) are unstable. Four \"frozen lunar orbits\" have been identified at 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86° inclination. NASA expounded on this in 2006:\n\nLunar mascons make most low lunar orbits unstable ... As a satellite passes 50 or 60 miles overhead, the mascons pull it forward, back, left, right, or down, the exact direction and magnitude of the tugging depends on the satellite's trajectory. Absent any periodic boosts from onboard rockets to correct the orbit, most satellites released into low lunar orbits (under about 60 miles or 100 km) will eventually crash into the Moon. ... [There are] a number of 'frozen orbits' where a spacecraft can stay in a low lunar orbit indefinitely. They occur at four inclinations: 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86°\"—the last one being nearly over the lunar poles. The orbit of the relatively long-lived Apollo 15 subsatellite PFS-1 had an inclination of 28°, which turned out to be close to the inclination of one of the frozen orbits—but poor PFS-2 was cursed with an inclination of only 11°.\n\nThe classical theory of frozen orbits is essentially based on the analytical perturbation analysis for artificial satellites of Dirk Brouwer made under contract with NASA and published in 1959.\n\nThis analysis can be carried out as follows:\n\nIn the article orbital perturbation analysis the secular perturbation of the orbital pole formula_1 from the formula_2 term of the geopotential model is shown to be\n\nwhich can be expressed in terms of orbital elements thusly:\n\nMaking a similar analysis for the formula_3 term (corresponding to the fact that the earth is slightly pear shaped), one gets\n\nwhich can be expressed in terms of orbital elements as\n\nIn the same article the secular perturbation of the components of the eccentricity vector caused by the formula_2 is shown to be:\n\nwhere:\n\n\nMaking the analysis for the formula_3 term one gets for the first term, i.e. for the perturbation of the eccentricity vector from the in-plane force component\n\nFor inclinations in the range 97.8–99.0 deg, the formula_6 value given by () is much smaller than the value given by () and can be ignored. Similarly the quadratic terms of the eccentricity vector components in () can be ignored for almost circular orbits, i.e. () can be approximated with\n\nAdding the formula_3 contribution \nformula_8\n\nto () one gets\n\nNow the difference equation shows that the eccentricity vector will describe a circle centered at the point formula_9; the polar argument of the eccentricity vector increases with formula_10 radians between consecutive orbits.\n\nAs\n\none gets for a polar orbit (formula_14) with formula_15 that the centre of the circle is at formula_16 and the change of polar argument is 0.00400 radians per orbit.\n\nThe latter figure means that the eccentricity vector will have described a full circle in 1569 orbits.\nSelecting the initial mean eccentricity vector as formula_17 the mean eccentricity vector will stay constant for successive orbits, i.e. the orbit is frozen because the secular perturbations of the formula_2 term given by () and of the formula_3 term given by () cancel out.\n\nIn terms of classical orbital elements, this means that a frozen orbit should have the following (mean!) elements:\n\nThe modern theory of frozen orbits is based on the algorithm given in a 1989 article by Mats Rosengren.\n\nFor this the analytical expression () is used to iteratively update the initial (mean) eccentricity vector to obtain that the (mean) eccentricity vector several orbits later computed by the precise numerical propagation takes precisely the same value. In this way the secular perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the formula_2 term is used to counteract all secular perturbations, not only those (dominating) caused by the formula_3 term. One such additional secular perturbation that in this way can be compensated for is the one caused by the solar radiation pressure, this perturbation is discussed in the article \"Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)\".\n\nApplying this algorithm for the case discussed above, i.e. a polar orbit (formula_24) with formula_25 ignoring all perturbing forces other than the formula_2 and the formula_3 forces for the numerical propagation one gets exactly the same optimal average eccentricity vector as with the \"classical theory\", i.e. formula_17.\n\nWhen we also include the forces due to the higher zonal terms the optimal value changes to formula_29.\n\nAssuming in addition a reasonable solar pressure (a \"cross-sectional-area\" of , the direction to the sun in the direction towards the ascending node) the optimal value for the average eccentricity vector becomes formula_30 which corresponds to :formula_31, i.e. the optimal value is not formula_32 anymore.\n\nThis algorithm is implemented in the orbit control software used for the Earth observation satellites ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat\n\nThe main perturbing force to be counter-acted to have a frozen orbit is the \"formula_3 force\", i.e. the gravitational force caused by an imperfect symmetry north/south of the Earth, and the \"classical theory\" is based on the closed form expression for this \"formula_3 perturbation\". With the \"modern theory\" this explicit closed form expression is not directly used but it is certainly still worthwhile to derive it.\n\nThe derivation of this expression can be done as follows:\n\nThe potential from a zonal term is rotational symmetric around the polar axis of the Earth and corresponding force is entirely in a longitudial plane with one component formula_35 in the radial direction and one component formula_36 with the unit vector formula_37 orthogonal to the radial direction towards north.

{"id": "386868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386868", "title": "Hungry ghost", "text": "Hungry ghost\n\nHungry ghost is a concept in Chinese Buddhism and Chinese traditional religion representing beings who are driven by intense emotional needs in an animalistic way.\nThe term ', literally \"hungry ghost\"'\", is the Chinese translation of the term \"preta\" in Buddhism.\n\"Hungry ghosts\" play a role in Chinese Buddhism and Taoism as well as in Chinese folk religion.\nThe term is not to be confused with the generic term for \"ghost\", \"\" (i.e. the spirit of a deceased ancestor). The understanding is that all people become such a regular ghost when they die, and would then slowly weaken and eventually die a second time. \nHungry ghosts, by contrast, are a much more exceptional case, and would only occur in very unfortunate circumstances, such as if a whole family were killed or when a family no longer venerated their ancestors.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of Buddhism, the idea became popular that souls would live in space until reincarnation. In the Taoist tradition it is believed that hungry ghosts can arise from people whose deaths have been violent or unhappy. Both Buddhism and Taoism share the idea that hungry ghosts can emerge from neglect or desertion of ancestors. According to the Hua-yen Sutra evil deeds will cause a soul to be reborn in one of six different realms. The highest degree of evil deed will cause a soul to be reborn as a denizen of hell, a lower degree of evil will cause a soul to be reborn as an animal, and the lowest degree will cause a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost. According to the tradition, evil deeds that lead to becoming a hungry ghost are killing, stealing and sexual misconduct. Desire, greed, anger and ignorance are all factors in causing a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost because they are motives for people to perform evil deeds.\n\nThere are many legends regarding the origin of hungry ghosts. In the Buddhist tradition there are stories from \"Chuan-chi po-yuan ching\" (\"Sutra of One Hundred Selected Legends\") that is from the early third century. Some examples of these stories are as follows:\n\nOne story is of a rich man who traveled selling sugar-cane juice. One day a monk came to his house looking for some juice to cure an illness. The man had to leave, so he instructed his wife to give the monk the drink in his absence. Instead of doing this, she secretly urinated in the monk's bowl, added sugar cane juice to it and gave it to the monk. The monk was not deceived, he poured out the bowl and left. When the wife died she was reborn as a hungry ghost.\n\nAnother such tale is of a man who was giving and kind. One day he was about to leave his house when a monk came by begging. The man instructed his wife to give the monk some food. After the man left his house his wife was overcome with greed. She took it upon herself to teach the monk a lesson, so she locked the monk in an empty room all day with no food. She was reborn as a hungry ghost for innumerable lifetimes.\n\nMost times the legends speak of hungry ghosts who in a previous lifetime were greedy women who refused to give away food. Other stories in the Buddhist tradition come from \"Kuei wen mu-lien ching\" (\"The Sutra on the Ghosts Questioning Mu-lien\"). One of the stories tells of a man who was a diviner who constantly misled people due to his own avarice and is now a hungry ghost. There is another story in \"The Legend of Mu-lien Entering the City and Seeing Five Hundred Hungry Ghosts\". The story is about five hundred men that were sons of elders of the city they lived in. When monks came begging to the city for food, the sons denied them because they thought the monks would keep coming back and eventually take all their food. After the sons died they were reborn as hungry ghosts.\n\nIn Chinese ancestor worship 鬼法界, 鬼界 is \"the realm of hungry ghosts\". There is a belief of the oral tradition of Chinese villagers that the ghosts of the ancestors may be granted permission to return to the world of the living at a certain time of the year, hungry and ready to take what they can from there, if these spirits had not been given sufficient offerings by their living relatives.\n\nA festival called the Hungry Ghost Festival (TC: 盂蘭盆, SC: 盂兰盆 Yúlánpén) is held to honor the hungry ancestor ghosts and food and drink is put out to satisfy their needs.\nThe Hungry Ghost Festival is celebrated during the 7th month of the Chinese calendar. It also falls at the same time as a full moon, the new season, the fall harvest, the peak of monastic asceticism, the rebirth of ancestors, and the assembly of the local community. According to tradition, during this month, the gates of hell are opened up and the hungry ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment. These ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who have forgotten to pay tribute to them after they died. They have long thin necks because they have not been fed by their families. Tradition states that families should offer prayers to their deceased relatives and burn \"hell money\". It is believed that \"hell money\" is a valid currency in the underworld and helps ghosts to live comfortably in the afterlife. People also burn other forms of joss paper such as paper houses, cars and televisions to please the ghosts.\n\nFamilies also pay tribute to other unknown wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune. A big feast is held for the ghosts on the 15th day of the 7th month, where people bring samples of food and place them on the offering table to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck. Live shows are also put on and everyone is invited to attend. The first row of seats is always empty as this is where the ghosts are supposed to sit to better enjoy the live entertainment. The shows are always put on at night and at high volumes, so that the sound attracts and pleases the ghosts. These acts were better known as \"Merry-making\".\n\nThe chief Taoist priest of the town wears an ornate crown of five gold and red panels, a practice borrowed from Buddhism. This represented the five most powerful deities (The Jade Emperor, Guan Yu, Tu Di Gong, Mazu and Xi Wangmu). He is believed to become their voice on earth.\n\nA sacrificial altar and a chair are built for a priest either at a street entrance or in front of the village. The Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha sits in front of the chair. Under the chair are plates of rice flour and peaches. Sitting on the altar are three spirit tablets and three funeral banners. After noon, sheep, pigs, chicken, fruits, and cakes are donated by families that are displayed on the altar. A priest will put a triangular paper banner of three colors with special characters on every sacrifice. After the music begins to play, the priest hits the bell to call the hungry ghosts back to the table. He then throws the rice and peaches into the air in all directions to distribute them to the ghosts.\n\nDuring the evening, incense is burnt in front of the doors of households. Incense stands for prosperity, the more incense burnt, the greater one's prosperity. During the festival, shops are closed to leave the streets open for the ghosts. In the middle of each street stands an altar of incense with fresh fruit and sacrifices displayed on it. Behind the altar, monks will sing songs that it is believed only the ghosts can understand. This rite is called \"shi ge'r\", meaning \"singing ghost songs\".\n\nFifteen days after the feast, to make sure all the hungry ghosts find their way back to hell, people float lanterns on water and set them outside their houses. These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a piece of board. Hungry ghosts are believed to have found their way back when the lanterns go out.\n\nIt is believed that the soul contains elements of both yin and yang. The yin is the \"kui\", or demon part, and the yang is the \"shen\", or spirit part. When death occurs, the \"kui\" should return to earth, and the \"shen\" to the grave or family shrine. If a ghost is neglected, it will become a \"kui\". The \"shen\", or ancestral spirit watches over its descendants, and can bring good fortune if properly worshipped.\n\nHungry ghosts are different from the ghosts of Chinese traditions, which all people are believed to become after death. According to the Buddha Dharma, there are three main groups of hungry ghosts: those with no wealth, those with a little and those with a lot. Those with no wealth are broken into three groups: the torch or flaming mouths, in which food and drink become flames; the needle mouths, whose throats are so tiny that food cannot pass through; and the vile mouths, whose mouths are so decomposed and smelly that they cannot ingest anything. The ghosts with a little wealth are able to eat small amounts. The ghosts with great wealth also have three subgroups: the ghosts of sacrifices, who live off sacrifices offered by humans and are similar to spirits described in China; the ghosts of losses, who live off lost objects from the human world; and the ghosts of great powers, like \"yakshas\" and \"rakshasas\", who are the powerful rulers of ghosts. The ghosts of sacrifices and losses sometimes suffer from hunger and thirst, whereas the ghosts of great powers have pleasures close to those of divine beings. Among hungry ghosts, however, most have little or no wealth and are extremely hungry.\n\nSixteen hungry ghosts are said to live in hell or in a region of hell. Unlike other hell dwellers, they can leave hell and wander. They look through garbage and human waste on the outskirts of human cities. They are said to be invisible during the daylight hours but visible at night. Some hungry ghosts can only eat corpses, or their food is burnt up in their mouths, sometimes they have a big belly and a neck as thin as a needle (this image is the basic one for hungry ghosts in Asian Buddhism).\n\nThere are many folk beliefs and taboos surrounding the Hungry Ghost Festival. Spirits are thought to be dangerous, and can take many forms, including snakes, moths, birds, foxes, wolves, and tigers. Some can even use the guise of a beautiful man or woman to seduce and possess. One story refers to a ghost which takes the form of a pretty girl and seduces a young man until a priest intervenes and sends the spirit back to hell. It is believed that possession can cause illness and/or mental disorders.\n\nDuring the 7th month of the Chinese calendar children are advised (usually by an elder in the family) to be home before dark, and not to wander the streets at night for fear a ghost might possess them. Swimming is thought to be dangerous as well, as spirits are believed to have drowned people. People will generally avoid driving at night, for fear of a \"collision\", or spiritual offence, which is any event leading to illness or misfortune. While \"ghost\" is a commonly used term throughout the year, many people use the phrase \"backdoor god\" or \"good brother\" instead during the 7th month, so as not to anger the ghosts. Another thing to avoid is sampling any of the food placed on the offering table, as doing this can result in \"mysterious illness\". Any person attending a show at indoor entertainment venues (\"getais\") will notice the first row of chairs is left empty. These seats are reserved for the spirits, and it is considered bad form to sit in them. After an offering has been burnt for the spirits, stepping on or near the burnt area should be avoided, as it is considered an \"opening\" to the spirit world and touching it may cause the person to be possessed.\n\nThe English term has often been used metaphorically to describe the insatiable craving of an addict.\n\nThe World of the Hungry Ghosts \"(preta)\" is one of the six domains of the desire realm of Buddhism.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism Hungry Ghosts (Tib. ཡི་དྭགས་, Wyl. yi dwags, ) have their own realm depicted on the Bhavacakra and are represented as teardrop or paisley-shaped with bloated stomachs and necks too thin to pass food such that attempting to eat is also incredibly painful. Some are described as having \"mouths the size of a needle's eye and a stomach the size of a mountain\". This is a metaphor for people futilely attempting to fulfill their illusory physical desires.\n\nAccording to the History of Buddhism, as elements of Chinese Buddhism entered a dialogue with Indian Buddhism in the Tibetan Plateau, this synthesis is evident in the compassion rendered in the form of blessed remains of food, etc., offered to the \"pretas\" in rites such as Ganachakra. \n\nIn Japanese Buddhism, two such creatures exist: the gaki and the jikininki. Gaki (餓鬼) are the spirits of jealous or greedy people who, as punishment for their mortal vices, have been cursed with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as human corpses or feces, though in more recent legends, it may be virtually anything, no matter how bizarre. Jikininki (食人鬼 \"people-eating ghosts\") are the spirits of greedy, selfish or impious individuals who are cursed after death to seek out and eat human corpses. They do this at night, scavenging for newly dead bodies and food offerings left for the dead. They sometimes also loot the corpses they eat for valuables. Nevertheless, jikininki lament their condition and hate their repugnant cravings for dead human flesh. \n\nThe Hungry Ghosts Scroll kept at the Kyoto National Museum depicts the world of the hungry ghosts, the suffering of these creatures and contains tales of salvation of these ghosts. The whole scroll has been designated as National Treasure of Japan and it was possibly part of a set of scrolls depicting the six realms which was kept at Sanjūsangen-dō.\n\n"}

To prove that an object in a certain class (on average) satisfies a certain property, select an object of that class which is incompressible. If it does not satisfy the property, it can be compressed by computable coding. Since it can be generally proven that almost all objects in a given class are incompressible, the argument demonstrates that almost all objects in the class have the property involved (not just the average). To select an incompressible object is ineffective, and cannot be done by a computer program. However, a simple counting argument usually shows that almost all objects of a given class can be compressed by only a few bits (are incompressible).\n\nThe incompressibity method depends on an objective, fixed notion of incompressibility. Such a notion was provided by the Kolmogorov complexity theory, named for Andrey Kolmogorov.\n\nOne of the first uses of the incompressibility method with Kolmogorov complexity its theory of computation was to prove that the running time of a one-tape Turing machine is quadratic for accepting a palindromic language and sorting algorithms require at least formula_1 time to sort formula_2 items. The first influential paper using the incompressibility method was published in 1980. The method was applied to a number of fields, and its name was coined in a textbook.\n\nThe Kolmogorov complexity of an object, represented by a finite, binary string, is the length of the shortest binary program on a fixed, optimal universal Turing machine. Since the machine is fixed and the program concerned is the shortest, the Kolmogorov complexity is a definite positive integer. The Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of the shortest binary program from which it can be computed. Therefore, it is a lower bound on the length of a computably-compressed version (in bits) of that object by any existing (or future) compression program.\n\nAccording to an elegant Euclidian proof, there is an infinite number of prime numbers. Bernhard Riemann demonstrated that the number of primes less than a given number is connected with the 0s of the Riemann zeta function. Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin proved in 1896 that this\nnumber of primes is asymptotic to formula_3; see Prime number theorem (use formula_4 for the natural logarithm an formula_5 for the binary logarithm). Using the incompressibility method, G. J. Chaitin argued as follows: Each formula_2 can be described by its prime factorization formula_7 (which is unique), where formula_8 are the first formula_9 primes which are (at most) formula_2 and the exponents (possibly) 0. Each exponent is (at most) formula_11, and can be described by formula_12 bits. The description of formula_2 can be given in formula_14 bits, provided we know the value of formula_15 (enabling one to parse the consecutive blocks of exponents). To describe formula_15 requires only formula_17 bits. Using the incompressibility of most positive integers, for each formula_18 there is a positive integer formula_2 of binary length formula_20 which cannot be described in fewer than formula_21 bits. This shows that the number of primes, formula_22 less than formula_2, satisfies\n\nA more-sophisticated approach attributed to Piotr Berman (present proof partially by John Tromp) describes every incompressible formula_2 by formula_9 and formula_27, where formula_28 is the largest prime number dividing formula_2. Since formula_2 is incompressible, the length of this description must exceed formula_11. To parse the first block of the description formula_9 must be given in prefix form formula_33, where formula_34 is an arbitrary, small, positive function. Therefore, formula_35. Hence, formula_36 with formula_37 for a special sequence of values formula_38. This shows that the expression below holds for this special sequence, and a simple extension shows that it holds for every formula_39:\n\nBoth proofs are presented in more detail.\n\nA labeled graph formula_41 with formula_2 nodes can be represented by a string formula_43 of formula_44 bits, where each bit indicates the presence (or absence) of an edge between the pair of nodes in that position. formula_45, and the degree formula_46 of each vertex satisfies\n\nTo prove this by the incompressibity method, if the deviation is larger we can compress the description of formula_48 below formula_49; this provides the required contradiction. This theorem is required in a more complicated proof, where the incompressibility argument is used a number of times to show that the number of unlabeled graphs is\n\nA transitive tournament is a complete directed graph, formula_41; if formula_52, formula_53. Consider the set of all transitive tournaments on formula_2 nodes. Since a tournament is a labeled, directed complete graph, it can be encoded by a string formula_43 of formula_44 bits where each bit indicates the direction of the edge between the pair of nodes in that position. Using this encoding, every transitive tournament contains a transitive subtournament on (at least) formula_57 vertices with\n\nThis was shown as the first problem. It is easily solved by the incompressibility method, as are the coin-weighing problem, the number of covering families and expected properties; for example, at least a fraction of formula_59 of all transitive tournaments on formula_2 vertices have transitive subtournaments on not more than formula_61 vertices. formula_2 is large enough.\n\nIf a number of events are independent (in probability theory) of one another, the probability that none of the events occur can be easily calculated. If the events are dependent, the problem becomes difficult. Lovász local lemma is a principle that if events are mostly independent of one another and have an individually-small probability, there is a positive probability that none of them will occur. It was proven by the incompressibility method. Using the incompressibility method, several versions of expanders and superconcentrator graphs were shown to exist.\n\nIn the Heilbronn triangle problem, throw formula_2 points in the unit square and determine the maximum of the minimal area of a triangle formed by three of the points over all possible arrangements. This problem was solved for small arrangements, and much work was done on asymptotic expression as a function of formula_2. The original conjecture of Heilbronn was formula_65 during the early 1950s. Paul Erdős proved that this bound is correct for formula_2, a prime number. The general problem remains unsolved, apart from the best-known lower bound formula_67 (achievable; hence, Heilbronn's conjecture is not correct for general formula_2) and upper bound formula_69 (proven by Komlos, Pintsz and Szemeredi in 1982 and 1981, respectively). Using the incompressibility method, the average case was studied. It was proven that if the area is too small (or large) it can be compressed below the Kolmogorov complexity of a uniformly-random arrangement (high Kolmogorov complexity). This proves that for the overwhelming majority of the arrangements (and the expectation), the area of the smallest triangle formed by three of formula_2 points thrown uniformly at random in the unit square is formula_71. In this case, the incompressibility method proves the lower and upper bounds of the property involved.\n\nThe law of the iterated logarithm, the law of large numbers and the recurrence property were shown to hold using the incompressibility method and Kolmogorov's zero–one law, with normal numbers expressed as binary strings (in the sense of E. Borel) and the distribution of 0s and 1s in binary strings of high Kolmogorov complexity.\n\nThe basic Turing machine, as conceived by Alan Turing in 1936, consists of a memory: a tape of potentially-infinite cells on which a symbol can be written and a finite control, with a read-write head attached, which scans a cell on the tape. At each step, the read-write head can change the symbol in the cell being scanned and move one cell left, right, or not at all according to instruction from the finite control. Turing machines with two tape symbols may be considered for convenience, but this is not essential.\n\nIn 1968, F. C. Hennie showed that such a Turing machine requires order formula_72 to recognize the language of binary palindromes in the worst case. In 1977, W. J. Paul presented an incompressibility proof which showed that order formula_72 time is required in the average case. For every integer formula_2, consider all words of that length. For convenience, consider words with the middle third of the word consisting of 0s. The accepting Turing machine ends with an accept state on the left (the beginning of the tape). A Turing-machine computation of a given word gives for each location (the boundary between adjacent cells) a sequence of crossings from left to right and right to left, each crossing in a particular state of the finite control. Positions in the middle third of a candidate word all have a crossing sequence of length formula_75 (with a total computation time of formula_76), or some position has a crossing sequence of formula_77. In the latter case, the word (if it is a palindrome) can be identified by that crossing sequence.\n\nIf other palindromes (ending in an accepting state on the left) have the same crossing sequence, the word (consisting of a prefix up to the position of the involved crossing sequence) of the original palindome concatenated with a suffix the remaining length of the other palindrome would be accepted as well. Taking the palindrome of formula_78, the Kolmogorov complexity described by formula_77 bits is a contradiction.\n\nSince the overwhelming majority of binary palindromes have a high Kolmogorov complexity, this gives a lower bound on the average-case running time. The result is much more difficult, and shows that Turing machines with formula_80 work tapes are more powerful than those with formula_9 work tapes in real time (here one symbol per step).\n\nIn 1984, W. Maass and M. Li and P. M. B. Vitanyi showed that the simulation of two work tapes by one work tape of a Turing machine takes formula_82 time deterministically (optimally, solving a 30-year open problem) and formula_83 time nondeterministically (in, this is formula_84. More results concerning tapes, stacks and queues, deterministically and nondeterministically, were proven with the incompressibiity method.\n\nHeapsort is a sorting method, invented by J. W. J. Williams and refined by R. W. Floyd, which always runs in formula_85 time. It is questionable whether Floyd's method is better than Williams' on average, although it is better in the worst case. Using the incompressibility method, it was shown that Williams' method runs on average in formula_86 time and Floyd's method runs on average in formula_87 time. The proof was suggested by Ian Munro.\n\nShellsort, discovered by Donald Shell in 1959, is a comparison sort which divides a list to be sorted into sublists and sorts them separately. The sorted sublists are then merged, reconstituting a partially-sorted list. This process repeats a number of times (the number of passes). The difficulty of analyzing the complexity of the sorting process is that it depends on the number formula_2 of keys to be sorted, on the number formula_89 of passes and the increments governing the scattering in each pass; the sublist is the list of keys which are the increment parameter apart. Although this sorting method inspired a large number of papers, only the worst case was established. For the average running time, only the best case for a two-pass Shellsort and an upper bound of formula_90 for a particular increment sequence for three-pass Shellsort were established. A general lower bound on an average formula_89-pass Shellsort was given which was the first advance in this problem in four decades. In every pass, the comparison sort moves a key to another place a certain distance (a path length). All these path lengths are logarithmically coded for length in the correct order (of passes and keys). This allows the reconstruction of the unsorted list from the sorted list. If the unsorted list is incompressible (or nearly so), since the sorted list has near-zero Kolmogorov complexity (and the path lengths together give a certain code length) the sum must be at least as large as the Kolmogorov complexity of the original list. The sum of the path lengths corresponds to the running time, and the running time is lower-bounded in this argument by formula_92. This was improved in to a lower bound of \nwhere formula_94. This implies for example the Jiang-Li-Vitanyi lower bound for all formula_89-pass increment sequences and improves that lower bound for particular increment sequences;\nthe Janson-Knuth upper bound is matched by a lower bound for the used increment sequence, showing that three pass Shellsort for this increment sequence uses formula_96 inversions.\n\nAnother example is as follows. formula_97 are natural numbers and formula_98, it was shown that for every formula_2 there is a Boolean formula_100 matrix; every formula_101 submatrix has a rank at least formula_102 by the incompressibility method.\n\nAccording to Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, in every formal system with computably enumerable theorems (or proofs) strong enough to contain Peano arithmetic, there are true (but unprovable) statements or theorems. This is proved by the incompressibility method; every formal system formula_103 can be described finitely (for example, in formula_104 bits). In such a formal system, we can express formula_105 since it contains arithmetic. Given formula_103, we can search exhaustively for a proof that some string formula_107 of length formula_108 satisfies formula_109. In this way, we obtain the first such string; formula_110: contradiction.\n\nAlthough the probabilistic method generally shows the existence of an object with a certain property in a class, the incompressibility method tends to show that the overwhelming majority of objects in the class (the average, or the expectation) have that property. It is sometimes easy to turn a probabilistic proof into an incompressibility proof or vice versa. In some cases, it is difficult or impossible to turn a proof by incompressibility into a probabilistic (or counting proof). In virtually all the cases of Turing-machine time complexity cited above, the incompressibility method solved problems which had been open for decades; no other proofs are known. Sometimes a proof by incompressibility can be turned into a proof by counting, as happened in the case of the general lower bound on the running time of Shellsort.\n"}

{"id": "884901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=884901", "title": "Latrell Sprewell", "text": "Latrell Sprewell\n\nLatrell Fontaine Sprewell (born September 8, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player; he played for the Golden State Warriors, the New York Knicks, and the Minnesota Timberwolves. During his time as a professional, Sprewell was named to the yearly NBA All-Star game four times; he also helped the Knicks reach the NBA Finals and the Timberwolves the Western Conference finals. Despite his accomplishments, his career was overshadowed by a 1997 incident in which he choked coach P. J. Carlesimo during a practice, which ultimately resulted in a 68-game suspension.\n\nSprewell's career came to an unexpected end in 2005 when he refused a $21-million three-year contract offer from the Timberwolves, which Sprewell implied would not be enough to feed his children. The Timberwolves offered him nothing more. Since that time, he has made headlines for grounding his million-dollar yacht and subsequently having it repossessed for missed payments, having two of his homes foreclosed upon, and being prohibited from seeing his children.\n\nAfter attending Washington High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sprewell played competitively with the Three Rivers Community College Raiders Basketball Team in Poplar Bluff, Missouri from 1988–1990, and from 1990–1992 with the University of Alabama, where he was a teammate of future NBA players Robert Horry, Jason Caffey and James Robinson.\n\nHe was selected 24th overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. Sprewell, nicknamed \"Spree\", made an immediate impact, starting 69 of the 77 games he played in during his rookie season and averaging 15.4 points per game. His performance would improve over the next few years, leading the team in scoring and playing for the Western Conference All-Star team in 1994, 1995, and 1997, scoring 24.2 ppg in 1996–97, fifth in the league. Additionally, in 1993–1994 he led the league in games played and minutes per game as the Warriors, led by Sprewell and NBA Rookie of the year power forward Chris Webber, made it back to the playoffs. They would, however, lose in the first round to the Phoenix Suns in three games.\n\nThough a four-time All-Star, a significant blemish on Sprewell's career was an incident that took place on December 1, 1997, when he attacked head coach P. J. Carlesimo during a Warriors practice. When Carlesimo yelled at Sprewell to make crisper passes (specifically asking him to \"put a little mustard\" on a pass), Sprewell responded that he was not in the mood for criticism and told the coach to keep his distance. When Carlesimo approached, Sprewell threatened to kill him and dragged him backwards by his throat, choking him for 7–10 seconds before his teammates and assistant coaches pulled Sprewell off his coach. Sprewell returned about 20 minutes later after showering and changing and again accosted Carlesimo. He landed a glancing blow at Carlesimo's right cheek before being dragged away again by the assistant coaches. It was not his first violent incident with the Warriors; in 1995, Sprewell fought with teammate Jerome Kersey and returned to practice carrying a two-by-four, and reportedly threatened to return with a gun. In a 1993 practice, Sprewell fought with Byron Houston, who was 50 pounds heavier than Sprewell and had what many teammates describe as having a Mike Tyson-like demeanor and physique.\n\nSprewell was suspended for 10 games without pay. However, the next day, in the wake of a public uproar, the Warriors voided the remainder of his contract altogether, which included $23.7 million over three years, and the NBA suspended him for one year. Sprewell took the case to arbitration and the contract voiding was overturned, but the league did suspend him for the rest of the season without pay, which amounted to 68 games. He sought to vacate the arbitration contract under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. His case went through all appeals, and was remanded. During the time he was serving his suspension from the NBA, Sprewell was charged with reckless driving for his role in a 90-mile-per-hour accident that injured two people. He spent three months under house arrest as part of a no-contest plea.\n\nDue to the NBA lockout, Sprewell did not play again until February 1999, after the Warriors traded him to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. Sprewell played 37 games for the Knicks that season, playing off the bench in all but four games.\n\nMany pundits felt that signing the volatile Sprewell was too big a gamble for the Knicks to take, but Sprewell himself vowed he was a changed man. The Knicks, who at the time still revolved around veteran All-Star center Patrick Ewing, narrowly qualified for the 1999 playoffs, making the field as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks navigated past the Miami Heat, Atlanta Hawks and finally the Indiana Pacers, making it as the first eighth seed in NBA history to the 1999 NBA Finals, where they met the San Antonio Spurs, who beat them in five games although Sprewell enjoyed a good series for the most part, averaging 26.0 ppg. He tallied 35 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the Knicks' 78-77 Game 5 loss, and was subsequently featured on the cover of the September 1999 issue of \"SLAM Magazine\".\n\nSprewell moved into the Knicks' starting lineup for the 1999–2000 season at small forward, and averaged 18.6 points, helping the Knicks to a 50-32 record good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference led by Sprewell, Ewing and shooting guard Allan Houston. The Knicks navigated past the Toronto Raptors in three hard-fought games and the Miami Heat in seven even harder-fought games in the first two rounds of the playoffs, en route to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers. But their quest for back-to-back NBA Finals appearances came to an end when they were defeated by the Pacers in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Sprewell averaged 19.7 ppg in the series, and the Knicks gave him a five-year/$62 million contract extension.\n\nThe 2000–01 season saw Sprewell step up as the Knicks' leader with Ewing traded to the Seattle SuperSonics, making his only All-Star appearance for the Knicks that year, scoring 17.7 points off the bench. However, despite another impressive season from Sprewell the Knicks would lose in the first round to the Toronto Raptors in five games in those 2001 playoffs. In 2001–02 Sprewell averaged 19.4 ppg, including 49 points in a game against the Boston Celtics, one of three times he scored 40 or more points that season; but it was not enough as the Knicks would miss the playoffs for the first time in 15 years.\n\nPrior to the 2002–03 season, Sprewell reported to training camp with a broken hand, which he claimed occurred when he slipped on his yacht; the Knicks fined him a record $250,000 for failing to report the incident to them. He then sued the \"New York Post\" for claiming he had broken his hand in a fight. Sprewell ultimately lost the lawsuit against the \"New York Post\".\n\nThat season, Sprewell made NBA history as he hit 9 of 9 three-point shots in one game, making the most three pointers without a single miss for the first time en route to a season-high 38 points versus the Los Angeles Clippers. The record has since been tied by then-Chicago Bulls guard Ben Gordon and broken by Nuggets guard Ty Lawson, who made 10 threes without missing in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After that season, in which the Knicks missed the playoffs for the second year in a row, Sprewell was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a four-team trade involving Keith Van Horn, Glenn Robinson and Terrell Brandon.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, Sprewell became part of the league's highest-scoring trio alongside superstar power forward Kevin Garnett and point guard Sam Cassell. With a 58-24 record, the Timberwolves qualified for the 2004 playoffs as the top seed in the Western Conference. They navigated past the Denver Nuggets in five games, and Sacramento Kings in seven, in the first two rounds of the playoffs. In the Western Conference Finals they met the Los Angeles Lakers, who defeated them in six games thanks to miracle shooting by Laker superstar off-guard Kobe Bryant, still the only appearance by the Timberwolves in the conference finals. Sprewell finished third in team scoring at 16.8 ppg, behind Garnett's 24.2 and Cassell's 19.8.\n\nOn October 31, 2004, the Minnesota Timberwolves offered Sprewell a three-year, $21 million contract extension, substantially less than what his then-current contract paid him. Claiming to feel insulted by the offer he publicly expressed outrage, declaring, \"I have a family to feed.\" He declined the extension and the Timberwolves offered him nothing more. Having once more drawn the ire of fans and sports media, Sprewell had the worst season of his career in the final year of his contract. In the summer of 2005, the Denver Nuggets, Cleveland Cavaliers and Houston Rockets all expressed interest in signing Sprewell, but none ended up signing him.\n\nOne month into the 2005–06 season and without a contract, Sprewell's agent, Bob Gist, said his client would rather retire than play for the NBA minimum salary, telling \"Sports Illustrated\", \"Latrell doesn't need the money that badly. To go from being offered $7 million to taking $1 million, that would be a slap in the face.\" Several days later, Gist said that Sprewell planned to wait until \"teams get desperate\" around the trade deadline in February, and then sign with a contending team -an eventuality that never materialized for him. Gist said that Sprewell would not be interested in signing for any team's $5 million mid-level exception, calling that amount \"a level beneath which [Sprewell] would not stoop or kneel!\"\n\nIn March 2006, Sprewell was offered contracts by the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs, both of whom were considered at the time to be strong favorites to win the NBA Championship, but Sprewell failed to respond and remained a free agent as the season came to a close. The Los Angeles Lakers also showed minimal interest in him at the start of that season, but nothing ever came of it.\n\nOver the course of his career, Sprewell started 868 of the 913 games he played in, averaging 18.8 ppg, 4.2 apg and 4.1 rpg with playoff career averages of 19.7 ppg, 3.4 apg and 4.3 rpg. He was elected to the All-NBA First Team at the end of his second season, and to the All-NBA Defensive second team that same year.\n\nSprewell's personal life since he last played in the NBA has been plagued with controversy and financial trouble. In 1994, his four-year-old daughter was attacked by his pet pit bull and bitten in her nose, lips, forehead and one ear, requiring surgery. Much earlier, while attending junior college, Sprewell had been arrested for stealing. In 2016, he appeared in a Priceline.com television advertisement, poking fun at himself.\n\nOn August 30, 2006, Milwaukee police investigated a claim by a 21-year-old female who claimed that she and Sprewell were having consensual sex aboard his yacht, named \"Milwaukee's Best\", when Sprewell began to strangle her. Police allegedly observed red marks on her neck. Police investigating the allegation searched Sprewell's yacht for evidence. On September 6, police declined to press charges. Sprewell then sought a restraining order along with \"civil remedies\" against the accuser.\n\nOn January 31, 2007, Sprewell's long-term companion sued him for $200 million for ending their relationship agreement. She claimed Sprewell agreed to support her and their four children through college.\n\nOn August 22, 2007, it was reported by multiple news agencies that Sprewell's yacht was repossessed by federal marshals after failing to continue paying for and insuring the vessel, for which he reportedly still owed approximately $1.3 million. In addition, while piloted by Sprewell, the yacht ran ashore near Atwater Beach, just north of Milwaukee. Sprewell refused to contract with a professional salvage firm to remove the yacht, which was eventually freed with the help of a local fishing vessel.\n\nIn February 2008 the yacht was auctioned for $856,000 after Sprewell defaulted on a $1.5 million mortgage, and three months later a Milwaukee area home owned by Sprewell went into foreclosure status. Between September 2007 and January 2008, according to documents, Sprewell had failed to make mortgage payments of $2,593 per month. In July 2009 a Westchester mansion owned by Sprewell went into foreclosure status, but that action was dismissed on motion of another party's attorney, Roger K. Marion.\n\n\n"}

In its purest sense, it is the basis of governance. \nThis form of law making is also applied in India. It is a process which works in India on the basis of Indian Constitution.\nLawmaking in modern democracies is the work of legislatures, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions. These bodies are influenced by lobbyists, pressure groups, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended. Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the budget is a matter of law.\n\nIn dictatorships and absolute monarchies the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement. However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the executive can make executive orders which have the force of law. In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law. Libertarians, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law. That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented. In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic sunset after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.\n"}
{"id": "936385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=936385", "title": "Liberty", "text": "Liberty\n\nBroadly speaking, liberty (Latin: \"Libertas\") is the ability to do as one pleases. In politics, liberty consists of the social, political, and economic freedoms to which all community members are entitled. In philosophy, liberty involves free will as contrasted with, determinism. In theology, liberty is freedom from the effects of \"sin, spiritual servitude, [or] worldly ties.\"\n\nSometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word \"freedom\" primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word \"liberty\" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others. Thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom. Freedom is more broad in that it represents a total lack of restraint or the unrestrained ability to fulfill one's desires. For example, a person can have the freedom to murder, but not have the liberty to murder, as the latter example deprives others of their right not to be harmed. Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts.\n\nThe word \"liberty\" is often used in slogans, such as \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" or \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\".\n\nPhilosophers from earliest times have considered the question of liberty. Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (121–180 AD) wrote:\"a polity in which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed.\"According to Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679):\"a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do\" (\"Leviathan\", Part 2, Ch. XXI).John Locke (1632–1704) rejected that definition of liberty. While not specifically mentioning Hobbes, he attacks Sir Robert Filmer who had the same definition. According to Locke:\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806–1873), in his work, \"On Liberty\", was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion. In his book \"Two Concepts of Liberty\", Isaiah Berlin formally framed the differences between these two perspectives as the distinction between two opposite concepts of liberty: positive liberty and negative liberty. The latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from tyranny and the arbitrary exercise of authority, while the former refers to the liberty that comes from self-mastery, the freedom from inner compulsions such as weakness and fear.\n\nThe modern concept of political liberty has its origins in the Greek concepts of freedom and slavery. To be free, to the Greeks, was not to have a master, to be independent from a master (to live as one likes). That was the original Greek concept of freedom. It is closely linked with the concept of democracy, as Aristotle put it:\n\nThis applied only to free men. In Athens, for instance, women could not vote or hold office and were legally and socially dependent on a male relative.\n\nThe populations of the Persian Empire enjoyed some degree of freedom. Citizens of all religions and ethnic groups were given the same rights and had the same freedom of religion, women had the same rights as men, and slavery was abolished (550 BC). All the palaces of the kings of Persia were built by paid workers in an era when slaves typically did such work.\n\nIn the Buddhist Maurya Empire of ancient India, citizens of all religions and ethnic groups had some rights to freedom, tolerance, and equality. The need for tolerance on an egalitarian basis can be found in the Edicts of Ashoka the Great, which emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of prisoners of war also appears to have been condemned by Ashoka. Slavery also appears to have been non-existent in the Maurya Empire. However, according to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, \"Ashoka's orders seem to have been resisted right from the beginning.\"\n\nRoman law also embraced certain limited forms of liberty, even under the rule of the Roman Emperors. However, these liberties were accorded only to Roman citizens. Many of the liberties enjoyed under Roman law endured through the Middle Ages, but were enjoyed solely by the nobility, rarely by the common man. The idea of inalienable and universal liberties had to wait until the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nThe social contract theory, most influentially formulated by Hobbes, John Locke and Rousseau (though first suggested by Plato in \"The Republic\"), was among the first to provide a political classification of rights, in particular through the notion of sovereignty and of natural rights. The thinkers of the Enlightenment reasoned that law governed both heavenly and human affairs, and that law gave the king his power, rather than the king's power giving force to law. This conception of law would find its culmination in the ideas of Montesquieu. The conception of law as a relationship between individuals, rather than families, came to the fore, and with it the increasing focus on individual liberty as a fundamental reality, given by \"Nature and Nature's God,\" which, in the ideal state, would be as universal as possible.\n\nIn \"On Liberty\", John Stuart Mill sought to define the \"...nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual,\" and as such, he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus, the prevailing question becomes \"how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control\".\n\nEngland and following the Act of Union 1707 Great Britain, laid down the cornerstones to the concept of individual liberty.\n\nIn 1166 Henry II of England transformed English law by passing the Assize of Clarendon act. The act, a forerunner to trial by jury, started the abolition of trial by combat and trial by ordeal.\n\nIn 1215 the Magna Carta was drawn up, it became the cornerstone of liberty in first England, Great Britain and later, the world.\n\nIn 1689 the Bill of Rights grants 'freedom of speech in Parliament', which lays out some of the earliest civil rights.\n\nIn 1859 an essay by the philosopher John Stuart Mill, entitled \"On Liberty\" argues for toleration and individuality. \"If any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.\"\n\nIn 1958 \"Two Concepts of Liberty\", by Isaiah Berlin, determines 'negative liberty' as an obstacle, as evident from 'positive liberty' which promotes self-mastery and the concepts of freedom.\n\nIn 1948 British representatives attempt to and are prevented from adding a legal framework to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (It was not until 1976 that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.) \n\nAccording to the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, all men have a natural right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\". But this declaration of liberty was troubled from the outset by the presence of slavery. Slave owners argued that their liberty was paramount, since it involved property, their slaves, and that Blacks had no rights that any White man was obliged to recognize. The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott decision, upheld this principle. It was not until 1866, following the Civil War, that the US Constitution was amended to extend these rights to persons of color, and not until 1920 that these rights were extended to women.\n\nBy the later half of the 20th century, liberty was expanded further to prohibit government interference with personal choices. In the United States Supreme Court decision \"Griswold v. Connecticut\", Justice William O. Douglas argued that liberties relating to personal relationships, such as marriage, have a unique primacy of place in the hierarchy of freedoms. Jacob M. Appel has summarized this principle:\nIn modern America, various competing ideologies have divergent views about how best to promote liberty. Liberals in the original sense of the word see equality as a necessary component of freedom. Progressives stress freedom from business monopoly as essential. Libertarians disagree, and see economic freedom as best. The Tea Party movement sees big government as the enemy of freedom.\n\nFrance supported the Americans in their revolt against English rule and, in 1789, overthrew their own monarchy, with the cry of \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\". The bloodbath that followed, known as the reign of terror, soured many people on the idea of liberty. Edmund Burke, considered one of the fathers of conservatism, wrote \"The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics\", liberalism is \"the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize freedom of choice\". But they point out that there is considerable discussion about how to achieve those goals. Every discussion of freedom depends on three key components: who is free, what they are free to do, and what forces restrict their freedom. John Gray argues that the core belief of liberalism is toleration. Liberals allow others freedom to do what they want, in exchange for having the same freedom in return. This idea of freedom is personal rather than political. William Safire points out that liberalism is attacked by both the Right and the Left: by the Right for defending such practices as abortion, homosexuality, and atheism, and by the Left for defending free enterprise and the rights of the individual over the collective.\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", Libertarians hold liberty as their primary political value. Their approach to implementing liberty involves opposing any governmental coercion, aside from that which is necessary to prevent individuals from coercing each other.\n\nAccording to republican theorists of freedom, like the historian Quentin Skinner or the philosopher Philip Pettit, one's liberty should not be viewed as the absence of interference in one's actions, but as non-domination. According to this view, which originates in the Roman Digest, to be a \"liber homo\", a free man, means not being subject to another's arbitrary will, that is to say, dominated by another. They also cite Machiavelli who asserted that you must be a member of a free self-governing civil association, a republic, if you are to enjoy individual liberty.\n\nThe predominance of this view of liberty among parliamentarians during the English Civil War resulted in the creation of the liberal concept of freedom as non-interference in Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan.\n\nSocialists view freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to a purely abstract ideal. Freedom is a state of being where individuals have agency to pursue their creative interests unhindered by coercive social relationships, specifically those they are forced to engage in as a requisite for survival under a given social system. Freedom thus requires both the material economic conditions that make freedom possible alongside social relationships and institutions conducive to freedom.\n\nThe socialist conception of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of creativity and individuality. Influenced by Karl Marx's concept of alienated labor, socialists understand freedom to be the ability for an individual to engage in creative work in the absence of alienation, where \"alienated labor\" refers to work people are forced to perform and un-alienated work refers to individuals pursuing their own creative interests.\n\nFor Karl Marx, meaningful freedom is only attainable in a communist society characterized by superabundance and free access. Such a social arrangement would eliminate the need for alienated labor and enable individuals to pursue their own creative interests, leaving them to develop and maximize their full potentialities. This goes alongside Marx's emphasis on the ability of socialism and communism progressively reducing the average length of the workday to expand the \"realm of freedom\", or discretionary free time, for each person. Marx's notion of communist society and human freedom is thus radically individualistic.\n\nSome authors have suggested that a virtuous culture must exist as a prerequisite for liberty. Benjamin Franklin stated that \"only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.\" Madison likewise declared: \"To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.\" John Adams acknowledged: \"Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\"\n\n\n"}

The basic procedure begins by presenting a subject with a stimulus (often a light of a particular color, or a visual pattern) that they will be required to remember, known as the 'sample'. They are then required to identify from a subsequent set of stimuli one that 'matches' the sample, known as the comparison stimuli. While the correct comparison stimulus option often matches the sample identically, the task can require a symbolic match or a matching of similar features (e.g. similar in color or shape).\n\nMatch-to-sample tasks were developed during the era of behaviorism, and were described by, among others, B.F. Skinner In its early form A pigeon would be presented with a colored light stimulus sample. It would then proceed to peck the sample and then be presented with two comparison stimuli. One comparison stimulus matches the sample (either because it is an identical color, or because the animal has learned an association such as green means left) and the other does not match. If it chooses (pecks) the matching comparison, then it is rewarded.\n\nA more complex version of the task has formed the basis for human-centered cognitive test batteries since the 1980s This version of the task involves a 4X4 matrix pattern that is filled with yellow and red squares. Participants are allotted a specific amount of time to study the first pattern that appears on the screen. After the first pattern disappears, it is then replaced by a pair of matrices. One of these is the same as the previously viewed stimulus and one differs by one or more cells of the matrix. The participant then indicates which of the two was the presented stimulus. One trial of this tasks takes approximately 5–10 seconds.\n\nThe strengths of this procedure are that participants have a limited time to think, so if they are more aware/alert, they should make more correct responses. It has also been hypothesized to be impacted by alertness, but resilient to practice effects.\n\nThe match-to-sample task has been shown to be an effective tool to understand the impact of sleep deprivation on short-term memory. One research study compared performance on a traditional sequential test battery with that on a synthetic work task requiring subjects to work concurrently on several tasks, testing subjects every three hours during 64 hrs of sleep deprivation. Similarly, another study used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging of the neural networks underlying the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval phase in the task. This test was used to discover the reduction in pattern expressions with sleep deprivation for each subject and how it related to the change in performance on the delayed-match-to-sample task. It also expanded the prefrontal areas regarding working memory and revealed substantial individual differences in performance. The test also reproduced findings of other working memory studies which demonstrated interactions between PFC and other parts of the brain.\n\nThe Delayed match-to-sample procedure is a slightly more complex variation of the task. In this case there is a time delay between the presentation of the sample and the comparison stimuli. By varying the length of the delay we can gain insight into how long the subject can retain information in their working memory. We can also use the delay to identify the extent to which modifying or adding new stimuli affects the performance of working memory in the subject. This is known as 'interference' and can come in two forms ; retroactive (following the presentation of the sample) or proactive (prior to the presentation of the sample).\n"}

The Open Christmas Letter was written in acknowledgment of the mounting horror of modern war and as a direct response to letters written to American feminist Carrie Chapman Catt, the president of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA), by a small group of German women's rights activists. Published in January 1915 in \"Jus Suffragii\", the journal of the IWSA, the Open Christmas Letter was answered two months later by a group of 155 prominent German and Austrian women who were pacifists. The exchange of letters between women of nations at war helped promote the aims of peace, and helped prevent the fracturing of the unity which lay in the common goal they shared, suffrage for women.\n\nThe decision by some suffragists to speak out against the war split the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom. Most British women were in favour of a quick solution to the conflict and were inclined to work toward that end in any way such as by helping fill positions abandoned by men off at war. Others were nationalistic and sought to make certain that British women were seen as patriotic, as doing their part, so that the men in power would think more highly of them and subsequently pass woman suffrage legislation. A minority of women advocated peace vociferously and worked with international peace organisations or with refugee aid societies. Nearly all suffragists agreed not to disrupt the nation at war in their promotion of women's suffrage. Toward the end of the war partial suffrage was granted, for property-holding women aged 30 and over.\n\nFrom 1906 until mid-1914, the Labour Party in the United Kingdom was the party seen as most supportive of women's suffrage—the right of women to vote. Suffragettes and other women's rights activists organised to elect Labour candidates and to push for legislation that expanded the rights of women. In August 1914 when the world became embroiled in war, the British women activists were sharply divided into two camps: the majority who wished to work with their country's war effort, and a minority who opposed the conflict. Millicent Garrett Fawcett of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) wished to have the NUWSS members work for the war so that the men in politics would view the women with greater respect and would thus be more amenable to granting them the right to vote. However, the NUWSS membership included those who were against war. When Fawcett turned the NUWSS to war work, eleven pacifist members resigned, later to join the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).\n\nLike the NUWSS, the more militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) led by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst chose to cease their obstructive activism for women's votes and instead advocated the alignment of British women to the cause of war. However, in October 1914, Sylvia Pankhurst travelled to Glasgow and spoke out against the war, becoming one of the first suffragettes to do so. She said that \"peace must be made by the people and not by the diplomats\". Though pacifist, Pankhurst held with her mother and sister to the general agreement that suffragettes would abstain from militant activism for the duration—she arranged for activist women to join with the War Emergency Worker's Committee and fill some of the positions that had been abandoned by men leaving for war.\n\nIn \"Jus Suffragii\" in December 1914, Carrie Chapman Catt published a letter that she had received earlier from , , and several other German women activists including presidents of woman suffrage societies in Germany. The letter was entitled \"To the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, through its president, Mrs. Chapman Catt.\" It began, \"To the women of all nations warm and hearty greetings in these wretched and bloody times.\" The German women expressed that the \"criminally rekindled war\" should not separate women from all countries who had previously been united \"by the common striving for the highest object—personal and political freedom\". They stated that \"True humanity knows no national hatred, no national contempt. Women are nearer to true humanity than men.\"\n\nCatt published another letter from German women's rights activist Clara Zetkin, one that expressed the desire for all women not to let \"the thunder of guns and the shouts of the jingoes\" make them forget that the rise of civilisation amongst the European countries held much in common. Zetkin wrote that the women of the world should guard their children against the \"hollow din\" of \"cheap racial pride\" which filled the streets, and that \"the blood of dead and wounded must not become a stream to divide what present need and future hope unite\".\n\nIn response to the letters from Germany, Emily Hobhouse organised the writing and signing of a peace-promoting letter from British women: the Open Christmas Letter. In the 1900s, Hobhouse campaigned against and worked to change the appalling conditions inside the British concentration camps in South Africa built for Boer women and children during the Second Boer War. She saw in the German letters the opportunity for maintaining vital international relations among women who could help mitigate the damage that war would bring. She wrote what she called a \"Letter of Christmas Greeting\" in November 1914 and circulated it for signatures of women who wished for peace. Pankhurst and Helen Bright Clark were among the first to sign Hobhouse's plea for continued sisterhood among the women of the world.\n\nOthers among the 101 signers were Margaret Ashton, Margaret Bondfield, Eva Gore-Booth, Esther Roper, Maude Royden, Helena Swanwick, and a wide range of women united by the wish for \"undiminished sisterly relations\" and a swift end to hostilities. Included among the women were some who were members of the Women's Labour League, and some of the Independent Labour Party. One of the listed women was \"Mrs. M. K. Gandhi\" but it is unknown whether Kasturba Gandhi, the wife of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, asked that her name be included. At least one of the signers was an American: Florence Edgar Hobson was the New York-born wife of English Liberal social theorist and economist John A. Hobson.\n\nUnder the heading \"On Earth Peace, Goodwill towards Men\", the letter's salutation addressed \"Sisters\" and began, \"Some of us wish to send you a word at this sad Christmastide, though we can but speak through the Press...\" The women of the UK were prevented from direct communication with the women of Germany because of the war. Instead, they sent their missive to America which was at that time a neutral nation. The letter continued, \"The Christmas message sounds like mockery to a world at war, but those of us who wished and still wish for peace may surely offer a solemn greeting to such of you who feel as we do.\" The letter mentioned that, as in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, \"the brunt of modern war falls upon non-combatants, and the conscience of the world cannot bear the sight\".\n\nIs it not our mission to preserve life? Do not humanity and common sense alike prompt us to join hands with the women of neutral countries, and urge our rulers to stay further bloodshed? ...Even through the clash of arms, we treasure our poet's vision, and already seem to hear     \"A hundred nations swear that there shall be     Pity and Peace and Love among the good and free.\"May Christmas hasten that day...\n\nIn the spring of 1915, the letter was answered in kind by 155 Germanic feminists including Augspurg and Heymann who had sent the earlier letter from Germany. Margarethe Lenore Selenka, Minna Cauer, and Helene Stöcker were among the German signers; Rosa Mayreder, Marianne Fickert, Ernestine Federn, and were in the group of Austrian signers. The response was entitled \"Open Letter in Reply to the Open Christmas Letter from Englishwomen to German\nand Austrian Women\" and was published in \"Jus Suffragii\" on 1 March 1915. The letter began:\n\nTo our English sisters, sisters of the same race, we express in the name of many German women our warm and heartfelt thanks for their Christmas greetings, which we only heard of lately.This message was a confirmation of what we foresaw—that women of the belligerent countries, with all faithfulness, devotion, and love to their country, can go beyond it and maintain true solidarity with the women of other belligerent nations, and that really civilised women never lose their humanity...\n\nDirectly after war broke out in August 1914, Rosika Schwimmer, a native of Austria–Hungary working in England but prevented by war from returning home, outlined her idea for an international conference of neutrals to mediate between warring nations. In September 1914, , president of the German Union for Woman Suffrage, wrote to Carrie Chapman Catt in America with \"deep personal regret\" for the \"terrible war\" to say that the women of Germany must withdraw their invitation to the annual IWSA International Alliance meeting in June 1915 which was to convene in Berlin. In December 1914 Julia Grace Wales, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, expanded eloquently on the concept, and published her views in a pamphlet entitled \"Continuous Mediation Without Armistice\", popularly known as the Wisconsin Plan. Taking these messages as her inspiration, Catt proposed that, instead of holding a woman suffrage convention in Berlin, an international peace congress of women should meet in The Hague for four days beginning 28 April 1915.\n\nWhen this announcement reached the UK, the NUWSS was divided on the one hand by patriots such as Fawcett and on the other by the signers of the Christmas letter who wished to send peace delegates. However, the majority of the NUWSS were nationalistic more than they were peace-minded—they were primarily concerned with helping the UK men win the war. The NUWSS membership rejected a resolution favoured by Helen Bright Clark and Margaret Bondfield which would have supported a delegation of women at The Hague. Because of this, Margaret Ashton resigned from the NUWSS and was subsequently censured by her local Manchester branch of suffragists. As well, Helena Swanwick and Maude Royden resigned from the NUWSS and made plans to attend at The Hague.\n\nAt The Hague, between 28 April and 1 May 1915, a large congress of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals. The event was called the International Congress of Women, or the Women's Peace Congress. A planned contingent of 180 British women was greatly reduced to just three persons by the government cancellation of British ferry service across the English Channel, stranding Royden and Swanwick, among others. Having already travelled to Flushing, Netherlands on a mission of mercy in late October 1914 to provide food for refugees from the fall of Antwerp, Chrystal Macmillan was able to attend the women's conference and speak for the UK. Macmillan, a signer of the Open Christmas Letter, had previously resigned from the NUWSS when its refusal to stand against the war had become clear. Macmillan was selected as one of the international committee who would travel to neutral nations and champion the proposal of the Congress. The Wisconsin Plan was unanimously adopted as the optimum method for returning peace to the world, and Macmillan, Schwimmer and the committee travelled to the neutral US to present President Woodrow Wilson with the plan. Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his Fourteen Points, and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the League of Nations.\n\nDuring the war, with British suffragists abstaining from taking militant action, British statesmen such as Prime Minister H. H. Asquith began to have a change of heart regarding their right to vote. In early 1917 a clause which provided suffrage for property-holding women aged 30 years and older was debated, and in June it was attached to the bill which would later become the Representation of the People Act 1918. Suffragists who were pacifists and suffragists who were nationalistic could both congratulate themselves for winning this incremental victory. Ten years later full voting equality with men was achieved in the UK with the Representation of the People Act 1928.\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the Australian government, the two types of workplace conflicts are when people's ideas, decisions or actions relating directly to the job are in opposition, or when two people just don't get along. Turner and Weed argue that in a conflict situation, don’t ask who, ask what and why. Managers should avoid blaming interpersonal conflicts on personality clashes. Such a tactic is an excuse to avoid addressing the real causes of conflict, and the department’s performance will suffer as a result. Managers must be able to recognize the signs of conflict behaviors and deal with the conflict in a forthright fashion. Approaching conflicts as opportunities to improve departmental policies and operations rather as ailments to be eradicated or ignored will result in a more productive work force and greater departmental efficiency. However, in order to avoid recognizing harsher business bullying situations, employers are more likely to refer to these actions as a personality clash.\n\nSigmund Freud thought a harmonious match of therapist and patient was essential for psychotherapy; but subsequent experience has demonstrated that success can follow even where there is an underlying personality clash.\n\nNeville Symington indeed saw a patient's willingness to proceed with therapy, \"despite\" her dislike of him, as a positive sign of health, and as a beginning repudiation of her narcissism.\n\nSome suggest that the only answer to a personality clash is the folk remedy of distancing - reducing contact with the clashing personality involved. Other recommendations are to focus on the positives in the other person, and to examine one's own psychodynamics for clues as to why one is finding them so difficult - perhaps due to a projection of some unacknowledged part of one's own personality.\n\nHoward Gardner saw a major part of what he called interpersonal intelligence as the ability to mediate and resolve such personality clashes from the outside.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29678048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29678048", "title": "Philosophy of human rights", "text": "Philosophy of human rights\n\nThe philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why the concept of human rights developed.\n\nOne of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with Hume). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of Weber). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in Rawls) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.\n\nNatural law theories base human rights on a \"natural\" moral, religious or even biological order that is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.\n\nSocrates and his philosophic heirs, Plato and Aristotle, posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (δίκαιον φυσικόν \"dikaion physikon\"; Latin \"ius naturale\"). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law, although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work by Thomas Aquinas.\n\nThe development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the Stoics.\n\nSome of the early Church Fathers sought to incorporate the until then pagan concept of natural law into Christianity. Natural law theories have featured greatly in the philosophies of Thomas Aquinas, Francisco Suárez, Richard Hooker, Thomas Hobbes, Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, and John Locke.\n\nIn the 16th century, asked by the Spanish monarchs to investigate the legitimacy of claims to land dominion by the \"indios\" of Latin America, Francisco de Vitoria expounded a theory of natural rights, especially in his famous \"Relectio de Indis\".\n\nIn the 17th century Thomas Hobbes founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism beginning from the principle that man in the state of nature, which is to say without a \"commonwealth\" (a state) is in a state of constant war one with the other and thus in fear of his life and possessions (there being no property nor right without a sovereign to define it). Hobbes asserted natural law as how a rational human, seeking to survive and prosper, would act; the first principle of natural law being to seek peace, in which is self-preservation. Natural law (which Hobbes accepted was a misnomer, there being no law without a commonwealth) was discovered by considering humankind's natural interests, whereas previous philosophers had said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for human beings to agree to create a commonwealth by submitting to the command of a sovereign, whether an individual or an assembly of individuals. In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.\n\nHugo Grotius based his philosophy of international law on natural law. He wrote that \"even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate\" natural law, which \"would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs.\" (\"De iure belli ac pacis\", Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument \"etiamsi daremus\" (\"non esse Deum\"), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.\n\nJohn Locke incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in \"Two Treatises of Government\". Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect \"life, liberty, and property,\" people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.\n\nThe Belgian philosopher of law Frank Van Dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception of natural law in the liberal tradition. There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.\n\n\"Dignity\" is a key term for the discussion of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not justify its claims on any philosophical basis, but rather it simply appeals to human dignity.\n\nKarl Rahner discusses human dignity as it relates to freedom. Specifically, his ideas of freedom relate to human rights as an appeal to the freedom to communicate with the divine. As embodied individuals who can have this freedom and dignity threatened by external forces, the protection of this dignity takes on an appeal to protect human rights.\n\nThe term \"human rights\" has replaced the term \"natural rights\" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence. For some, the debate on human rights remains thus a debate around the correct interpretation of Natural Law, and human rights themselves a positive, but reductionist, expression thereof\n\nThe English philosopher Thomas Hobbes suggested the existence of a hypothetical \"social contract\" where a group of free individuals agree for the sake of preservation to form institutions to govern them. They give up their natural complete liberty in exchange for protection from the Sovereign. This led to John Locke's theory that a failure of the government to secure rights is a failure which justifies the removal of the government, and was mirrored in later postulation by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his \"Du Contrat Social\" (The Social Contract).\n\nInternational equity expert Paul Finn has echoed this view:\n\nThe relationship between government and the governed in countries which follow the English law tradition is a fiduciary one. In equity law, a politician's fiduciary obligations are not only the duties of good faith and loyalty, but also include duties of skill and competence in managing a country and its people. Originating from within the Courts of Equity, the fiduciary concept exists to prevent those holding positions of power from abusing their authority. The fiduciary relationship between government and the governed arises from the governments ability to control people with the exercise of its power. In effect, if a government has the power to abolish any rights, it is equally burdened with the fiduciary duty to protect such an interest because it would benefit from the exercise of its own discretion to extinguish rights which it alone had the power to dispose of.\n\nThe Golden Rule, or the \"ethic of reciprocity\" states that one must do unto others as one would be treated themselves; the principle being that reciprocal recognition and respect of rights ensures that one's own rights will be protected. This principle can be found in all the world's major religions in only slightly differing forms, and was enshrined in the \"Declaration Toward a Global Ethic\" by the Parliament of the World's Religions in 1993.\n\nSoviet concept of human rights was different from conceptions prevalent in the West. According to Western legal theory, \"it is the individual who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted \"against\" the government\", whereas Soviet law declared that state is the source of human rights. Therefore, Soviet legal system regarded law as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government. Extensive extra-judiciary powers were given to the Soviet secret police agencies. The regime abolished Western rule of law, civil liberties, protection of law and guarantees of property. According to Vladimir Lenin, the purpose of socialist courts was \"not to eliminate terror ... but to substantiate it and legitimize in principle\".\n\nCrime was determined not as the infraction of law, but as any action which could threaten the Soviet state and society. For example, a desire to make a profit could be interpreted as a counter-revolutionary activity punishable by death. The liquidation and deportation of millions peasants in 1928–31 was carried out within the terms of Soviet Civil Code. Some Soviet legal scholars even asserted that \"criminal repression\" may be applied in the absence of guilt.\". Martin Latsis, chief of the Ukrainian Cheka explained: \"Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which class he belongs, what is his background, his education, his profession. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. That is the meaning and essence of the Red Terror.\"\n\nThe purpose of public trials was \"not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime – that was predetermined by the appropriate party authorities – but to provide yet another forum for political agitation and propaganda for the instruction of the citizenry (see Moscow Trials for example). Defense lawyers, who had to be party members, were required to take their client's guilt for granted...\"\n\nThe philosopher John Finnis argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being. Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:\n\nThe biological theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and altruism in the context of natural selection.\nHuman security is an emerging school of thought which challenges the traditional, state-based conception of security and argues that a people-focused approach to security is more appropriate in the modern interdependent world and would be more effective in advancing the security of individuals and societies across the globe.\n\n\nAccording to the recommendation of human rights scholar Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LLB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK: ‘Right’ being synonymous of ‘legal’ and antonymous of both ‘wrong’ and ‘illegal’, every ‘right’ of any human person is ipso facto a ‘legal right’ which deserves protection of law and legal remedy irrespective of having been written into the law, constitution or otherwise in any country.\n\n\nAccording to Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan: The only way ‘(a) to make the world terrorism and war free and also free from hunger, poverty, discrimination and exploitation; (b) to establish rule of law and economic, political and social justice; and (c) to confirm freedom of man, peace and development worldwide’ is protection and promotion human rights as ‘Ipso Facto Legal Rights’ and the unity of the world community in one and single theory of ‘man for man’ correlative, interdependent and ‘one to one-cum-one for other’ approach, namely, the ‘Man for Man Theory’ approach of world peace.\n\nThe idea of human rights is not without its critics. Jeremy Bentham, Edmund Burke, Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Marx are examples of historical philosophers who criticised the notion of natural rights. Alasdair MacIntyre is a leading contemporary critic of human rights. His criticisms are discussed below.\n\nEdmund Burke was an 18th-century philosopher, political theorist and statesman largely associated with the school of conservatism. His views on natural rights are best articulated in \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\", which directly attacked the \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen\" (1789) and its authors.\n\nA great deal of Burke’s uneasiness of the \"Declaration\" lies in the drafter’s abandonment of the existing establishment. For Burke, constitutional legitimacy was derived not from the Rousseauian doctrine of general will, but from a form of inherited wisdom. He thought that it was arrogant and limiting for the drafters of the \"Declaration\" to cast aside traditional notions that had stood the test of time. Although it may seem to the drafters that they had abandoned the shackles of tradition, for Burke, they had limited their findings to the narrow minded conception of one person or group. This is the grounding from which Burke’s attack of the \"Declaration\" is based.\n\nBurke did not deny the existence of natural rights; rather he thought that the a priori reasoning adopted by the drafters produced notions that were too abstract to have application within the framework of society. In stating that “the pretended right of these theorists are all extremes; and in a proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically false”, Burke identified that abstract rights are meaningless without a societal framework:\n\nIn contrast to Locke, Burke did not believe the purpose of government was to protect pre-existing natural rights; he believed “the primitive rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections, that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.” For Burke it was the government, as a result of long social evolution, that transformed the meaningless natural rights into the practical advantaged afforded to citizens.\n\nIt was not the rights themselves, as much as the level of abstraction and the placing of them above government which Burke found dangerous. He stated “those who pull down important ancient establishments, who wantonly destroy modes of administration, and public institutions… are the most mischievous, and therefore the wickedest of men”. For Burke politics had no simple answers, and definitely no overarching, universal maxims such as those expressed in the \"Declaration\". Rather the rights afforded to individuals were to be assessed in the context of the social framework. However, he acknowledged that the simplicity of the \"Declaration\" was attractive and feared its ability to undermine social order. Burke believed that the absolute nature of these principles of abstraction were inherently revolutionary; they were uncompromising and any derogation from the principles a reason to rise up in arms. This was a problem because;\n\nThe natural rights “Against which there can be no prescription; against these no agreements is binding” gave the revolutionaries the tools to destroy the very society that Burke believed afforded them with rights. In this way Burke thought the rights contained in the \"Declaration\" would lead to “the antagonist world of madness, discord, vice, confusion, and unavailing sorrow.”\n\nThe 18th-century Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham criticised the \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen\" in his text \"Anarchical Fallacies\". He famously asserted that the concept of natural rights was “nonsense upon stilts”. Bentham criticised the \"Declaration\" both for the language that it adopted and the theories it posited, stating; “Look to the letter, you find nonsense; look beyond the letter, you find nothing.”\n\nOne of the critiques Bentham levelled against the \"Declaration\" was its assertions of rights in the form of absolute and universal norms. He identified that absolute rights possessed by everyone equally are meaningless and undesirable. They lack meaning because if everyone has, for example, unbounded liberty, there is nothing precluding them from using that liberty to impinge on the liberty of another. In this way “human government and human laws” are required to give some bounds to rights in order for them to be realised. Even if advocates of absolute rights recognise this necessity, as the proponents of the \"Declaration\" did, Bentham argues that it is in vain. “It would be self-contradictory, because these rights are, in the same breath which their existence is declared, declared to be impresciptable; and impriscriptable… means nothing unless it excludes the interference of the laws.”\n\nIn addition to this contradiction, Bentham warned of the dangers of couching rights in absolute terms. A government that is able to protect every person’s right absolutely and equally is a utopian aspiration, but the \"Declaration\" couches it as the conditions for its legitimacy. “Against every government which fails in any degree of fulfilling these expectations, then, it is the professed object of this manifesto to excite insurrection.” Bentham does not deny that there are some laws that are morally wrong; his uneasiness is in easily justifying a revolutionary call to arms – with the violence, chaos and destruction associated with it – based on a repugnant law.\n\nOf the theoretical faults, Bentham thought that natural rights were a construction adopted to pursue the selfish aims of the drafters, of which no logical basis could be found. He acknowledged that it may be desirable to have rights, but “a reason for wishing that a certain right were established, is not that right; want is not supply; hunger is not bread.” To establish rights existed by virtue of laws enacted by a sovereign was logically sound, but to assert rights established by nature was not. “A natural right is a son that never had a father.”\n\nNot only did Bentham think that there was no logical basis for the theory of natural rights, but he believed that their individualistic approach was harmful to society.\n\nBentham thought that society was dependent upon people's ability to pursue the greater good, not just the short-term satisfaction of their own desires. The advancement of natural rights, which he saw as celebrating selfishness, was to provide the means to break down the social community that makes human life bearable.\n\nIn On the Jewish Question, Karl Marx criticized \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\" as bourgeois ideology:\nand that:\n\nThus for Marx, liberal rights and ideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs protection from other human beings. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is freedom from interference. What this view denies is the possibility — according to Marx, the fact — that real freedom is to be found positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found in human community, not in isolation. So insisting on a regime of rights encourages us to view each other in ways which undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human emancipation.\n\nMarxist critical theorist Slavoj Žižek argued that: \"liberal attitudes towards the other are characterized both by respect for otherness, openness to it, and an obsessive fear of harassment. In short, the other is welcomed insofar as its presence is not intrusive, insofar as it is not really the other. Tolerance thus coincides with its opposite. My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her, not intrude into his space—in short, that I should respect his intolerance towards my over-proximity. This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society: the right not to be 'harassed', that is, to be kept at a safe distance from others.\" and \"universal human rights are effectively the right of white, male property-owners to exchange freely on the market, exploit workers and women, and exert political domination.\"\n\nBritish sociologist Robert Fine claims that the key to Marx’s argument was to rebut the radicalism Bauer espoused: a radicalism that not only denied the rights of Jews but at once trashed the rights of man and citizen as such. What Marx stood for in the Jewish Question as in his earlier writings more generally was a philosophy of right. Fine believes what Marx stood against was a spiritless radicalism that revealed its inhumanity not only through its hostility to Jews but also through its hostility to the idea of right.\" Moreover, Fine argued that Marx argued that the society that gives rise to the idea of rights is the same as that which gives rise to the commodity form. They are two sides of the same medal. It is a society based on production by independent producers whose contact with each other is mediated through the exchange of products on the market. These producers are formally free to produce what and how much they wish. They are formally equal in that no producer can force others to produce against their will or expropriate their products against their will. They are self-interested in that they are all entitled to pursue their own private interests regardless of what others think or do. Their contact with other producers takes the form of free and equal exchanges in which individuals exchange their property in return for the property of another and this exchange of unneeded things in return for useful things appears to be done for the mutual benefit of each party.\n\nFine also claims that for Marx, exchange relations appear to be formed among free and equal property owners who enter a voluntary contract in pursuit of their own self-interest. Fine cites what he believes to be Marx's point about how in exchange lies the clue to all modern conceptions of freedom and equal right:\n\nFurthermore, the parties to the exchange must place themselves in relation to one another as persons whose will resides in those objects and must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other and alienate his own, except through an act to which both parties consent. Marx characterised this sphere of commodity exchange as ‘a very Eden of the innate rights of man’ – the realm of Freedom, Equality, Property and\nBentham:\n\nThus according to Robert Fine, Marx's basic criticism was that within political society people were seen as co-operative, while in their economic roles they were competitive, individualistic and egoistic. In short, the theory of rights expressed the division and alienation of human beings.\n\nAlasdair MacIntyre is a Scottish philosopher who has published a number of works in a variety of philosophical fields, including political philosophy, ethics and metaphysics. MacIntyre criticises the concept of human rights in After Virtue and he famously asserts that “there are no such rights, and belief in them is one with belief in witches and in unicorns.”\n\nMacIntyre argues that every attempt at justifying the existence of human rights has failed. The assertions by 18th century philosophers that natural rights are self-evident truths, he argues, are necessarily false as there are no such things as self-evident truths. He says that the plea 20th century philosophers made to intuition show a flaw in philosophical reasoning. MacIntyre then outlines that, although Dworkin is not wrong in asserting that the inability to demonstrate a statement does not necessitate its falsity, the same argument can be applied in relation to witches and unicorns.\n\nMacIntyre made this critique of human rights in the context of a wider argument about the failure of the Enlightenment to produce a coherent moral system. Philosophers of the enlightenment sought to cast aside the discredited notions of hierarchy and theology as justifications for morality. Instead, MacIntyre argues, the enlightenment placed the individual as the sovereign authority to dictate what is right and wrong. However allegiances to historical notions of morality remained and philosophers sought to find a secular and rational justification for existing beliefs. The problem, MacIntyre maintains, is that theological morality was developed to overcome defects in human nature; to posit an example of the ideal. Without this notion of ‘perfect humanity’ the only remaining foundation to build a moral theory on was the foundation of imperfect human nature. For MacIntyre, the result was a collection of moral stances, each claiming to have a rational justification and each disputing the findings of the rival notions.\n\nMacIntyre believes that a number of the moral debates that occur in society can be explained as a result of this failure of the “Enlightenment Project”. Human rights are an example of a moral belief, founded in previous theological beliefs, which make the false claim of being grounded in rationality. To illustrate how the principles lead to conflict, he gives the example of abortion; in this case the right of the mother to exercise control over her body is contrasted with the deprivation of a potential child to the right to life. Although both the right to liberty and the right to life are, on their own, considered morally acceptable claims, conflict arises when we posit them against each other.\n\nHenry of Ghent articulated the theory that every person has a property interest in their own body. John Locke uses the word property in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from labour. In addition, property precedes government and government cannot \"dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily.\" To deny valid property rights according to Locke is to deny human rights. The British philosopher had significant impacts upon the development of the Government of the UK and was central to the fundamental founding philosophy of the United States. Karl Marx later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his \"Theories of Surplus Value\", seeing the beginnings of a theory of surplus value in Locke's works. In Locke's \"Second Treatise\" he argued that the right to own private property was unlimited as long as nobody took more than they could use without allowing any of their property to go to waste and that there were enough common resources of comparable quality available for others to create their own property. Locke did believe that some would be more \"industrious and rational\" than others and would amass more property, but believed this would not cause shortages. Though this system could work before the introduction of money, Marx argued in \"Theories of Surplus Value\" that Locke's system would break down and claimed money was a contradiction of the law of nature on which private property was founded.\n"}

The boundary must be defined and identified by the properties of the material. The boundary may change over time. The boundary is usually the visible or tangible surface of the object. The matter in the object is constrained (to a greater or lesser degree) to move as one object. The boundary may move in space relative to other objects that it is not attached to (through translation and rotation). An object's boundary may also deform and change over time in other ways.\n\nAlso in common usage, an object is not constrained to consist of the same collection of matter. Atoms or parts of an object may change over time. An object is defined by the simplest representation of the boundary consistent with the observations. However the laws of Physics only apply directly to objects that consist of the same collection of matter.\n\nEach object has a unique identity, independent of any other properties. Two objects may be identical, in all properties except position, but still remain distinguishable. In most cases the boundaries of two objects may not overlap at any point in time. The property of identity allows objects to be counted.\n\nExamples of models of physical bodies include, but are not limited to a particle, several interacting smaller bodies (particles or other), and continuous media.\n\nThe common conception of physical objects includes that they have extension in the physical world, although there do exist theories of quantum physics and cosmology which may challenge this. In modern physics, \"extension\" is understood in terms of the spacetime: roughly speaking, it means that for a given moment of time the body has some location in the space, although not necessarily a point. A physical body as a whole is assumed to have such quantitative properties as mass, momentum, electric charge, other conserving quantities, and possibly other quantities.\n\nA body with known composition and described in an adequate physical theory is an example of physical system.\n\nAn object is known by the application of senses. The properties of an object are inferred by learning and reasoning based on the information perceived. Abstractly, an object is a construction of our mind consistent with the information provided by our senses, using Occam's razor.\n\nIn common usage an object is the material inside the boundary of an object, in 3-dimensional space. The boundary of an object is a contiguous surface which may be used to determine what is inside, and what is outside an object. An object is a single piece of material, whose extent is determined by a description based on the properties of the material. An imaginary sphere of granite within a larger block of granite would not be considered an identifiable object, in common usage. A fossilized scull encased in a rock may be considered an object because it is possible to determine the extent of the scull based on the properties of the material.\n\nFor a rigid body, the boundary of an object may change over time by continuous translation and rotation. For a deformable body the boundary may also be continuously deformed over time in other ways.\n\nAn object has an identity. In general two objects with identical properties, other than position at an instance in time, may be distinguished as two objects and may not occupy the same space at the same time (excluding component objects). An object's identity may be tracked using the continuity of the change in its boundary over time. The identity of objects allows objects to be arranged in sets and counted.\n\nThe material in an object may change over time. For example, a rock may wear away or have pieces broken off it. The object will be regarded as the same object after the addition or removal of material, if the system may be more simply described with the continued existence of the object, than in any other way. The addition or removal of material may discontinuously change the boundary of the object. The continuation of the objects identity is then based on the description of the system by continued identify being simpler than without continued identity.\n\nFor example, a particular car might have all its wheels changed, and still be regarded as the same car.\n\nThe identity of an object may not split. If an object is broken into two pieces at most one of the pieces has the same identity. An object's identity may also be destroyed if the simplest description of the system at a point in time changes from identifying the object to not identifying it. Also an object's identity is created at the first point in time that the simplest model of the system consistent with perception identifies it.\n\nAn object may be composed of components. A component is an object completely within the boundary of a containing object.\n\nIn classical mechanics a physical body is collection of matter having properties including mass, velocity, momentum and energy. The matter exists in a volume of three-dimensional space. This space is its extension.\n\nUnder Newtonian gravity the gravitational field further away than the furthest extent of an object is determined only by the mass and the position of the center of mass.\n\nInteractions between objects are partly described by orientation and external shape.\n\nIn continuum mechanics an object may be described as a collection of sub objects, down to an infinitesimal division, which interact with each other by forces which may be described internally by pressure and mechanical stress.\n\nIn quantum mechanics an object is a particle or collection of particles. Until measured, a particle does not have a physical position. A particle is defined by a probability distribution of finding the particle at a particular position. There is a limit to the accuracy with which the position and velocity may be measured. A particle or collection of particles is described by a quantum state.\n\nThese ideas vary from the common usage understanding of what an object is.\n\nIn particle physics, there is a debate as to whether some elementary particles are not bodies, but are points without extension in physical space within space-time, or are always extended in at least one dimension of space as in string theory or M theory.\n\nIn some branches of psychology, depending on school of thought, a physical body is a physical object with physical properties, as compared to mental objects. In (reductionistic) behaviorism, a physical body and its properties are the (only) meaningful objects of study.\nWhile in the modern day behavioral psychotherapy it is still only the means for goal oriented behavior modifications, in Body Psychotherapy it is not a means only anymore, but its felt sense is a goal of its own. In cognitive psychology, physical bodies as they occur in biology are studied in order to understand the mind, which may not be a physical body, as in functionalist schools of thought.\n\nA physical body is an enduring object that exists throughout a particular trajectory of space and orientation over a particular duration of time, and which is located in the world of physical space (i.e., as studied by physics). This contrasts with abstract objects such as mathematical objects which do not exist at any particular time or place.\nExamples are a cloud, a human body, a weight, a billiard ball, a table, or a proton. This is contrasted with abstract objects such as mental objects, which exist in the mental world, and mathematical objects. Other examples that are not physical bodies are emotions, the concept of \"justice\", a feeling of hatred, or the number \"3\". In some philosophies, like the Idealism of George Berkeley, a physical body is a mental object, but still has extension in the space of a visual field.\n\n"}

Less elaborate versions included smearing a cloth or piece of paper with pitch and pressing onto the head of the intended victim such as described by Myles Byrne* in his memoirs.\n\n\"\"Flogging, half hanging, picketing, were mild tortures in comparison of the pitch caps that were applied to the heads of those who happened to wear their hair short, called croppies; the head being completely singed, a cap made of strong linen well imbued with boiling pitch was so closely put on that it could not be taken off without bringing off a part of the skin and flesh from the head : in many instances the tortured victim had one of his ears cut off to satisfy the executioner that if he escaped he could readily be discovered, being so well marked.\" \"\n\nThe torture was usually preceded by the crude shearing of the victim's hair/scalp. The effect on the skull of this controlled form of local boiling somewhat resembles scalping, earlier known as a practice used by the colonists in North America and American Indians on each other.\nPitch has long, even in antiquity, been used (like other hot liquids, even melted metal) to pour into a victim's orifices. However, both those techniques were usually faster and often lethal, so less suitable as torture proper, rather as capital punishment.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "140704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140704", "title": "Pogrom", "text": "Pogrom\n\nThe term pogrom has multiple meanings, ascribed most often to the deliberate persecution of an ethnic or religious group either approved or condoned by the local authorities. According to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", the term is usually applied to anti-Jewish violence in the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has been extended to include any attacks against Jews and physical destruction of Jewish property, as well as looting of Jewish homes and businesses, throughout history. The characteristics of a pogrom vary widely, depending on the specific incidents, at times leading to, or culminating in, massacres. All outbreaks of antisemitic violence have become retrospectively known as pogroms. \n\nThe Russian-language term was adopted in the English language in order to describe the mass violence of 1881 and 1882 that was directed against Jews within the Pale of Settlement which was first created by Catherine the Great in what would become most of present-day Ukraine and Belarus, as well as parts of Lithuania, Moldova and Poland. The term \"pogrom\" is sometimes used, as well, to describe publicly sanctioned purgative attacks against non-Jewish ethnic or religious groups.\n\nFirst recorded in 1882, the Russian word \"pogrom\" (погро́м, ) is derived from the common prefix po- and the verb \"gromit\"' (громи́ть, ) meaning \"to destroy, to wreak havoc, to demolish violently\". Its literal translation is \"to harm\". The noun \"pogrom\", which has a relatively short history, is used in English and many other languages as a loanword, possibly borrowed from Yiddish (where the word takes the form פאָגראָם). Its widespread circulation in today's world began with the antisemitic excesses in the Russian Empire in 1881–1883.\n\nAnti-Jewish riots had already taken place in Europe during the Middle Ages. Jewish communities were targeted in the Black Death Jewish persecutions of 1348–1350, in Toulon in 1348, in Barcelona as well as in other Catalan cities, during the Erfurt massacre (1349), the Basel massacre, massacres in Aragon and in Flanders, as well as the \"Valentine's Day\" Strasbourg pogrom of 1349. Some 510 Jewish communities were destroyed during this period, extending further to the Brussels massacre of 1370. On Holy Saturday of 1389, a pogrom began in Prague that led to the burning of the Jewish quarter, the killing of many Jews, and the suicide of many Jews trapped in the main synagogue; the number of dead was estimated at 400–500 men, women and children.\n\nThe first atrocities against Jewish civilians, on a genocidal scale of destruction, were committed during the Khmelnytsky Pogroms of 1648–1657 in present-day Ukraine. Modern historians give estimates of the scale of the murders by Khmelnytsky's Cossacks ranging between 40,000 and 100,000 men, women and children, or perhaps many more.\n\nThe outbreak of violence against Jews (Hep-Hep riots) occurred at the beginning of the 19th century as a reaction to Jewish emancipation in the German Confederation.\n\nThe Russian Empire, which previously had very few Jews, acquired territories with large Jewish populations during the military Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, 1793 and 1795 conducted jointly with the Austrian and Prussian armies, and resulting in Poland's elimination from the geopolitical map of Europe for the next 123 years. In conquered territories, a new political entity called the Pale of Settlement was formed in 1791 by Catherine the Great. Most Jewish people from the former Commonwealth were allowed to reside only within the Pale, including families expelled by royal decree from St. Petersburg, Moscow and other large Russian cities. The 1821 Odessa pogroms marked the beginning of the 19th century pogroms in Tsarist Russia; there were four more such pogroms in Odessa before the end of the century. Following the assassination of Alexander II in 1881 by Narodnaya Volya – blamed on the Jews by the Russian government, anti-Jewish events turned into a wave of over 200 pogroms by their modern definition, which lasted for several years. Jewish self-governing \"Kehillah\" were abolished by Tsar Nicholas I in 1844.\n\nThe first in 20th-century Russia was the Kishinev pogrom of 1903 in which 47 Jews were killed, hundreds wounded, 700 homes destroyed and 600 businesses pillaged. In the same year, pogroms took place in Gomel (Belarus), Smela, Feodosiya and Melitopol (Ukraine). Extreme savagery was typified by mutilations of the wounded. They were followed by the Zhitomir pogrom (with 29 killed), and the Kiev pogrom of October 1905 resulting in a massacre of approximately 100 Jews. In three years between 1903 and 1906, about 660 pogroms were recorded in Ukraine and Bessarabia; half a dozen more in Belorussia, carried out with the Russian government's complicity, but no anti-Jewish pogroms were recorded in Poland. At about that time, the Jewish Labor Bund began organizing armed self-defense units ready to shoot back, and the pogroms subsided for a number of years. According to professor Colin Tatz, between 1881 and 1920 there were 1,326 pogroms in Ukraine (\"see: Southwestern Krai parts of the Pale\") which took the lives of 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews, leaving half a million homeless.\n\nLarge-scale pogroms, which began in the Russian Empire several decades earlier, intensified during the period of the Russian Civil War and the Revolution of 1917. Professor Zvi Gitelman (\"A Century of Ambivalence\") estimated that only in 1918–1919 over 1,200 pogroms took place in Ukraine, thus amounting to the greatest slaughter of Jews in Eastern Europe since 1648. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his book \"Two Hundred Years Together\" provided additional statistics from research conducted by Nahum Gergel (1887–1931). Gergel counted 1,236 incidents of anti-Jewish violence and estimated that 887 mass pogroms occurred, the remainder being classified as \"excesses\" not assuming mass proportions. The Kiev pogroms of 1919, according to Gitelman, were the first of a subsequent wave of pogroms in which between 30,000 and 70,000 Jews were massacred across Ukraine. Of all the pogroms accounted for in Gergel's research, about 40 percent were perpetrated by the Ukrainian People's Republic forces led by Symon Petliura, 25 percent by the Ukrainian Green Army and various Ukrainian nationalist gangs, and 17 percent by the White Army, especially the forces of Anton Denikin. A further 8.5 percent of Gergel's total was attributed to pogroms carried out by men of the Red Army although these pogroms were not sanctioned by the Bolshevik leadership; the high command disarmed the regiments which had perpetrated pogroms. The Ukrainian People's Republic of Symon Petliura also issued orders condemning pogroms, but lacked authority to intervene. After May 1919 the Directory lost its role as a credible governing body; almost 75 percent of pogroms occurred between May and September of that year. Thousands of Jews were killed only for being Jewish, without any political affiliations.\nThe instructions issued from above had only a limited impact on soldiers' attitudes toward violence against Jews, as related by author and future Nobel laureate Ivan Bunin. On May 15, 1919, Bunin wrote in his diary about yet another massacre: \n\nGergel's overall figures, which are generally considered conservative, are based on the testimony of witnesses and newspaper reports collected by the \"Mizrakh-Yidish Historiche Arkhiv\" which was first based in Kiev, then Berlin and later New York. The English version of Gergel's article was published in 1951 in the YIVO Annual of Jewish Social Science titled \"The Pogroms in the Ukraine in 1918–1921.\"\n\nIn June 1919, during the Polish–Soviet War, the Jewish First Guard Battalion from Minsk – at the insistence of its own members – was deployed by the Bolsheviks against the Polish Army which included the First and the Second Lithuanian–Belarusian Divisions. The Jews had won the first skirmish, forcing them to retreat several kilometers. On 8 August 1919, Polish troops took over the city in Operation Minsk, killed 31 Jews merely suspected of supporting the Bolshevist movement, beat and attacked many more, looted 377 Jewish-owned shops (aided by the local civilians) and ransacked many private homes. The aftermath of the pogrom in Minsk was described on an emotional level by Rabbi Yechezkel Abramsky in July 1920. The \"Morgenthau's report of October 1919 stated that there is no question that some of the Jewish leaders exaggerated these evils.\" According to Elissa Bemporad, the \"violence endured by the Jewish population under the Poles encouraged popular support for the Red Army, as Jewish public opinion welcomed the establishment of the Belorussian SSR.\" Irrespective of war-zone violence, the Jewish political groups, communal institutions and cultural organizations of all stripes were active in the Second Polish Republic.\n\nIn the early 20th century, pogroms broke out elsewhere in the world as well. In 1904 in Ireland, the Limerick boycott caused several Jewish families to leave the town. During the 1911 Tredegar riot in Wales, Jewish homes and businesses were looted and burned over the period of a week, before the British Army was called in by then-Home Secretary Winston Churchill, who described the riot as a \"pogrom\". In 1919 there was a pogrom in Argentina, during the Tragic Week.\n\nAfter the First World War, during the localized armed conflicts of independence, 72 Jews were killed and 443 injured in the 1918 Lwów pogrom. The following year, pogroms were reported by the \"New York Tribune\" in several cities in the newly reborn Poland. However, the reports were not only exaggerated but also manufactured by the German legation in Warsaw, quietly opposed to the rebirth of Poland after a century of imperial partitions. The German reports were delivered to Zionist headquarters and the foreign press elsewhere by the official services of the Wilhelmstrasse. Meanwhile, in the Mandatory Palestine under British administration, the Jews were targeted in the 1929 Hebron massacre and the 1929 Safed pogrom.\n\nThe first pogrom in Nazi Germany was the \"Kristallnacht\", often called \"Pogromnacht\", in which at least 91 Jews were killed, a further 30,000 arrested and incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps, over 1,000 synagogues burned, and over 7,000 Jewish businesses destroyed or damaged.\n\nDuring World War II, Nazi German death squads encouraged local populations in German-occupied Europe to commit pogroms against Jews. Brand new battalions of \"Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz\" (trained by SD agents) were mobilized from among the German minorities. During Operation Barbarossa which lasted from June 22 to December 5, 1941, \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler established the \"Schutzmannschaft\" collaborationist auxiliary battalions and tasked them with carrying out pogroms behind the front lines.\n\nA large number of pogroms occurred during the Holocaust at the hands of non-Germans. Perhaps the deadliest of these Holocaust-era pogroms was the Iași pogrom in Romania, in which as many as 13,266 Jews were killed by Romanian citizens, police and military officials.\n\nOn 1–2 June 1941, in the two-day Farhud pogrom in Iraq, \"rioters murdered between 150 and 180 Jews, injured 600 others, and raped an undetermined number of women. They also looted some 1,500 stores and homes\".\nIn June–July 1941, encouraged by the \"Einsatzgruppen\" in the city of Lviv – location of the Lwów ghetto – the Ukrainian People's Militia soon reorganized as the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police perpetrated two citywide pogroms in which around 6,000 Polish Jews were murdered, in retribution for alleged collaboration with the Soviet NKVD; the controversy surrounding the Lviv pogroms of 1941 is still debated today. On 12 October 1941 in Stanisławów, some 10,000–12,000 Jewish men, women and children were shot in the Jewish cemetery by the Germans and the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police during so-called \"Bloody Sunday\" . The shooters began firing at 12 noon, and continued without stopping by taking turns. It was the single largest massacre of Jews in the General Government prior to mass gassings of \"Aktion Reinhard.\"\n\nIn Lithuania, some local police led by Algirdas Klimaitis and Lithuanian partisans – consisting of LAF units reinforced by 3,600 deserters from the 29th Lithuanian Territorial Corps of the Red Army promulgated anti-Jewish pogroms in Kaunas along with occupying Nazis. On 25–26 June 1941, about 3,800 Jews were killed and synagogues and Jewish settlements burned.\n\nDuring the Jedwabne pogrom of July 1941, ethnic Poles burned at least 340 Jews in a barn (Institute of National Remembrance) in the presence of Nazi German \"Ordnungspolizei\". The role of the German \"Einsatzgruppe B\" remains the subject of debate.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, a series of violent antisemitic incidents occurred against returning Jews throughout Europe, particularly in the Soviet-occupied East where Nazi propagandists had extensively promoted the notion of a Jewish-Communist conspiracy (see Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946 and Anti-Jewish violence in Eastern Europe, 1944–1946). Anti-Jewish riots also took place in Britain in 1947.\n\nIn the Arab world, anti-Jewish rioters killed over 140 Jews in the 1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Tripolitania. Following the start of the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, a number of anti-Jewish events occurred throughout the Arab world, some of which have been described as pogroms. In 1947, half of Aleppo's 10,000 Jews left the city in the wake of the Aleppo riots, while other anti-Jewish riots took place in British Aden and the French Moroccan cities of Oujda and Jerada.\n\nAccording to Encyclopædia Britannica, \"the term is usually applied to attacks on Jews in the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [and] the first extensive pogroms followed the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881\", and the \"Wiley-Blackwell Dictionary of Modern European History Since 1789\" states that pogroms \"were antisemitic disturbances that periodically occurred within the tsarist empire.\" However, the term is widely used to refer to many events which occurred prior to the Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire. Historian of Russian Jewry John Klier writes in \"Russians, Jews, and the Pogroms of 1881–1882\" that \"By the twentieth century, the word 'pogrom' had become a generic term in English for all forms of collective violence directed against Jews.\" Abramson wrote that \"in mainstream usage the word has come to imply an act of antisemitism\", since while \"Jews have not been the only group to suffer under this phenomenon ... historically Jews have been frequent victims of such violence\".\nThe term is also used in reference to attacks on non-Jewish ethnic minorities, and accordingly some scholars do not include antisemitism as the defining characteristic of \"pogroms\". Reviewing its uses in scholarly literature, historian Werner Bergmann proposes that pogroms should be \"defined as a \"unilateral, nongovernmental\" form of \"collective\" violence \"initiated by the majority population\" against a largely defenseless ethnic group, and he states that pogroms occur when the \"majority\" expects the state to provide them with no assistance in overcoming a (perceived) threat from the minority,\" but he adds that in Western usage, the word's \"anti-Semitic overtones\" have been retained. Historian David Engel supports this, writing that \"there can be no logically or empirically compelling grounds for declaring that some particular episode does or does not merit the label [pogrom],\" but states that the majority of the incidents \"habitually\" described as pogroms took place in societies significantly divided by ethnicity and/or religion where the violence was committed by the higher-ranking group against a stereotyped lower-ranking group against whom they expressed some complaint, and with the belief that the law of the land would not be used to stop them.\n\nThere is no universally accepted set of characteristics which define the term pogrom. Klier writes that \"when applied indiscriminately to events in Eastern Europe, the term can be misleading, the more so when it implies that 'pogroms' were regular events in the region and that they always shared common features.\" Use of the term pogrom to refer to events in 1918–19 in Polish cities including Kielce, Pinsk and Lwów, was specifically avoided in the 1919 Morgenthau Report and the word \"excesses\" was used instead because the authors argued that the use of the term \"pogrom\" required a situation to be antisemitic rather than political in nature, which meant that it was inapplicable to the conditions existing in a war zone, and media use of the term pogrom to refer to the 1991 Crown Heights riot caused public controversy. In 2008, two separate attacks in the West Bank by Israeli Jewish settlers on Palestinian Arabs were characterized as pogroms by then Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert.\n\nWerner Bergmann suggests a particularly unifying characteristic of all such incidents: \"[b]y the \"collective attribution\" of a threat, the pogrom differs from other forms of violence, such as lynchings, which are directed at individual members of a minority group, while the \"imbalance of power\" in favor of the rioters distinguishes pogroms from other forms of riot (food riots, race riots or 'communal riots' between evenly matched groups); and again, the \"low level of organization\" separates them from vigilantism, terrorism, massacre and genocide\".\n\nThis is a partial list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word \"pogrom\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3637477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3637477", "title": "Rain garden", "text": "Rain garden\n\nOne of the wide variety of soil-absorption/filter systems, a rain garden, also called a stormwater garden, is a designed depression storage or a planted hole that allows rainwater runoff from impervious urban areas, like roofs, driveways, walkways, parking lots, and compacted lawn areas, the opportunity to be absorbed. The primary purpose of a rain garden is to improve water quality in nearby bodies of water and to ensure that rainwater becomes available for plants as groundwater rather than being sent through stormwater drains straight out to sea. In fact, it can actually reduce rain runoff by allowing stormwater to soak into the ground (as opposed to flowing into storm drains and surface waters which causes erosion, water pollution, flooding, and diminished groundwater) and cut down on the amount of pollution reaching creeks and streams by up to 30%.\n\nThe plants—a selection of wetland edge vegetation, such as wildflowers, sedges, rushes, ferns, shrubs and small trees—take up excess water flowing into the rain garden. Water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for stormwater to filter into the ground. Root systems enhance infiltration, maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in biofiltration. Microbial populations feed off plant root secretions and break down carbon (such as in mulch or desiccated plant roots) to aggregate soil particles which increases infiltration rates. Also, through the process of transpiration, rain garden plants return water vapor to the atmosphere.\n\nA more wide-ranging definition covers all the possible elements that can be used to capture, channel, divert, and make the most of the natural rain and snow that falls on a property. Thus, the whole garden can become a rain garden, and each component of the whole can become a small-scale rain garden in itself.\n\nIn developed areas, natural depressions where storm water would pool are filled in. The surface of the ground is often leveled or paved. Storm water is directed into storm drains which often may cause overflows of combined sewer systems or poisoning, erosion or flooding of waterways receiving the storm water runoff. Redirected storm water is often warmer than the groundwater normally feeding a stream, and has been linked to upset in some aquatic ecosystems primarily through the reduction of dissolved oxygen (DO). Storm water runoff is also a source of a wide variety of pollutants washed off hard or compacted surfaces during rain events. These pollutants include volatile organic compounds, pesticides, herbicides, hydrocarbons and trace metals Rain gardens are designed to capture the initial flow of storm water and reduce the accumulation of toxins flowing directly into natural waterways through ground filtration. They also reduce energy consumption. For example, \"the cumulative storage capacity of these rain gardens exceeds a conventional stormwater's system's by 10 times.\" The National Science Foundation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and a number of research institutions are presently studying the impact of augmenting rain gardens with materials capable of capture or chemical reduction of the pollutants to benign compounds.\nRain gardens are often located near a building's roof drainpipe (with or without rainwater tanks). Most rain gardens are designed to be an endpoint of drainage with a capacity to percolate all incoming water through a series of soil or gravel layers beneath the surface plantings. A French drain may be used to direct a portion of the rainwater to an overflow location for heavier rain events. By reducing peak stormwater discharge, rain gardens extend hydraulic lag time and somewhat mimic the natural water cycle displaced by urban development and allow for groundwater recharge. While rain gardens always allow for restored groundwater recharge, and reduced stormwater volumes, they may also increase pollution unless remediation materials are included in the design of the filtration layers.\n\nThe primary challenge of rain garden design centers on calculating the types of pollutants and the acceptable loads of pollutants the rain garden's filtration system can handle during storm-water events. This challenge is specifically acute when a rain event occurs after a longer dry period. The initial storm water is often highly contaminated with the accumulated pollutants from dry periods. Rain garden designers have previously focused on finding robust native plants and encouraging adequate biofiltration, but recently have begun augmenting filtration layers with media specifically suited to chemically reduce redox of incoming pollutant streams.\n\nRain gardens are beneficial for many reasons: improve water quality by filtering runoff, provide localized flood control, are aesthetically pleasing, and provide interesting planting opportunities. They also encourage wildlife and biodiversity, tie together buildings and their surrounding environments in attractive and environmentally advantageous ways, and provide significant partial solutions to important environmental problems that affect us all.\n\nA rain garden provides a way to use and optimize any rain that falls, reducing or avoiding the need for irrigation. They allow a household or building to deal with excessive rainwater runoff without burdening the public storm water systems. Rain gardens differ from retention basins, in that the water will infiltrate the ground within a day or two. This creates the advantage that the rain garden does not allow mosquitoes to breed. Compost, rather than soil, has better effects on filtering groundwater and rainwater. Compact lawn soil cannot harbor groundwater nearly as well, because the water simply flows off.\n\nThe first rain gardens were created to mimic the natural water retention areas that occurred before development of an area. The rain gardens for residential use were developed in 1990 in Prince George's County, Maryland, when Dick Brinker, a developer building a new housing subdivision had the idea to replace the traditional best management practices (BMP) pond with a bioretention area. He approached Larry Coffman, an environmental engineer and the county's Associate Director for Programs and Planning in the Department of Environmental Resources, with the idea. The result was the extensive use of rain gardens in Somerset, a residential subdivision which has a rain garden on each house's property. This system proved to be highly cost-effective. Instead of a system of curbs, sidewalks, and gutters, which would have cost nearly $400,000, the planted drainage swales cost $100,000 to install. This was also much more cost effective than building BMP ponds that could handle 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events. Flow monitoring done in later years showed that the rain gardens have resulted in a 75–80% reduction in stormwater runoff during a regular rainfall event.\n\nThis is also referred to as Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems or SUDS in the United Kingdom, and low impact development (LID) in the United States, and is cited by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nSome \"de facto\" rain gardens predate their recognition by professionals as a significant LID tool. Any shallow garden depression implemented to capture and retain rain water within the garden so as to drain adjacent land without running off a property is at conception a rain garden—particularly if vegetation is maintained with recognition of its role in this function. Vegetated roadside swales, now promoted as “bioswales”, remain the conventional drainage system in many parts of the world from long before extensive networks of concrete sewers became the conventional engineering practice in the industrialized world.\n\nWhat is new about such technology is the emerging rigor of increasingly quantitative understanding of how such tools may make sustainable development possible. This is as true for wealthy developed communities retrofitting bioretention into built stormwater management systems, as for developing communities seeking a faster and more sustainable development path.\n\nA rain garden requires an area where water can collect and infiltrate, and plants to maintain infiltration rates, diverse microbe communities, and water holding capacity. This way the rain garden may contribute to urban habitats for native butterflies, birds, and beneficial insects. Transpiration by growing plants accelerates soil drying between storms. This includes any plant extending roots to the garden area.\n\nSimply adjusting the landscape so that downspouts and paved surfaces drain into existing gardens may be all that is needed because the soil has been well loosened and plants are well established. However, many plants do not tolerate saturated roots for long and often more water runs off one's roof than people realize. Thus, rain garden plants are then selected to match the situation after the required location and storage capacity of the garden area are determined.\n\nWhen an area's soils are not permeable enough to allow water to drain and filter properly, the soil should be replaced and an underdrain installed. This bioretention mixture should typically contain 60% sand, 20% compost, and 20% topsoil, and there is a current trend to replace compost with biochar. The former non-permeable soil needs to be removed and replaced. The sandy soil (bioretention) mixture cannot be combined with a surrounding soil that does not have high sand content because the clay particles will settle in between the sand particles and form a concrete-like substance, according to a 1983 study.\n\nA five-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey indicates that rain gardens in urban clay soils can be effective without the use of underdrains or replacement of native soils with the bioretention mix. But, it also indicates that pre-installation infiltration rates should be at least .25 in/hour. Type D soils will require an underdrain paired with the sandy soil mix in order to drain properly.\n\nSometimes a drywell with a series of gravel layers near the lowest spot in the rain garden will help facilitate percolation. However, a drywell placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an infiltration basin defeating its purpose. Depression-focused recharge of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided. Similarly plans to install a rain garden near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer. The more polluted the water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. This is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high water table. In some cases lined bioretention cells with subsurface drainage are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly.\n\nRain gardens are at times confused with bioswales. Swales slope to a destination, while rain gardens do not; however, a bioswale may end with a rain garden. Drainage ditches may be handled like bioswales and even include rain gardens in series, saving time and money on maintenance. Part of a garden that nearly always has standing water is a water garden, wetland, or pond, and not a rain garden. Using the proper terminology ensures that the proper methods are used to achieve the desired results.\n\nAlthough specific plants are selected and designed for respective soils and climates, plants that can tolerate both saturated and dry soil are typically used for the rain garden. They need to have minimal maintenance to survive, and be compatible with adjacent land use.\n\nNative and adapted plants are the examples of such plants that are generally used. They are more tolerant of the local climate, soil, and water conditions; have deep and variable root systems for enhanced water infiltration and drought tolerance; habitat value and diversity for local ecological communities; and overall sustainability once established. There can be trade-offs associated with using native plants, including lack of availability for some species, late spring emergence, short blooming season, and relatively slow establishment.\n\nTrees under power lines, or that up-heave sidewalks when soils become moist, or whose roots seek out and clog drainage tiles can cause expensive damage. Trees generally contribute most when located close enough to tap moisture in the rain garden depression, yet do not excessively shade the garden. That said, shading open surface waters can reduce excessive heating of habitat. Plants tolerate inundation by warm water for less time because heat drives out dissolved oxygen, thus a plant tolerant of early spring flooding may not survive summer inundation.\n\nBamboo is another plant that works particularly well since it can clean water 27.6% better than domestic plants like grass or clovers. Rice, although it is hard to grow and maintain, works even better.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21421210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21421210", "title": "Signorelli parapraxis", "text": "Signorelli parapraxis\n\nThe Signorelli parapraxis represents the first and best known example of a parapraxis and its analysis in Freud's \"The Psychopathology of Everyday Life\". The parapraxis centers on a word finding problem and the production of substitutes. Freud couldn't recall the name (Signorelli) of the painter of the Orvieto frescos and produced as substitutes the names of two painters Botticelli and Boltraffio. Freud's analysis shows what associative processes had linked Signorelli to Botticelli and Boltraffio. The analysis has been criticised by linguists and others.\nOne important ingredient in Freud's analysis was the North-Italian village Trafoi where he received the message of the suicide of one of his patients, struggling with sexual problems. Without Trafoi the substitute Boltraffio rhyming to it would be incomprehensible. Freud links Trafoi to the theme 'death and sexuality', a theme preceding the word finding problem in a conversation Freud had during a trip by train through Bosnia-Herzegowina.\nThe second important ingredient in Freud's analysis is the extraction of an Italian word \"signor\" from the forgotten name Signorelli. \"Herr\", the German counterpart of \"Signor\", is then linked to Herzegowina and the word \"Herr\" occurring, as Freud tells us, in the conversation.\n\nFreud denies the relevance of the content of the frescos. Nevertheless, psychoanalysts have pursued their investigations particularly into this direction, finding however no new explanation of the parapraxis. Jacques Lacan suggested that the parapraxis may be an act of self-forgetting.\n\nThe first critique to Freud came from Emil Kraepelin, who in a postscript to his 1906 monograph on language disturbances in dreams, relates a dream involving Trafoi. The dream centers around a neologism \"Trafei\", which Kraepelin links to Trafoi. The dream may be seen as an implicit critique on Freud's analysis. Italian \"trofei\" is associated to \"Trafei\" in the same way as Trafoi (cf. van Ooijen, 1996) and clarifies Kraepelin's dream. The meaning of \"trofei\" reads in German \"Siegeszeichen\" (victory-signs) and this German word together with Latin \"signum\" clearly links to Freud's first name (Engels, 2006, p. 22-24).\n\nIn \"The Freudian Slip\" Sebastiano Timpanaro discusses Freud's analysis in chapter 6 \"Love and Death at Orvieto.\" (p. 63-81). He in fact doubts, that the name Boltraffio would have played a major role during the parapraxis, as he states: \"Boltraffio is a \"Schlimbesserung\" [that is a substitute worse than another substitute]\" and adds \"the correction goes astray because of incapacity to localize the fault.\"(p. 71). He calls Botticelli an \"involuntary banalization\" and Boltraffio \"a semi-conscious disimproved correction.\"(p. 75). As to the Signor-element in Freud's analysis he puts: \"The immediate equivalence Signore= Herr is one thing, the extraction of \"signor\" from Signorelli and of \"Her(r)\" from Herzegowina is another.\"\n\nPeter Swales (2003) investigated the historical data and states that Freud probably visited an exposition of Italian masters in Bergamo mid-September 1898, showing paintings of Signorelli, Botticelli and Boltraffio one next to the other. In his view the paintings at the exposition were the source of the substitute names in the parapraxis. Swales dwells largely on the three paintings. The association of the name Boltraffio to the name Da Vinci, another hypothesis formulated by Swales (because Freud might have seen the statue of Boltraffio at the bottom of the Da Vinci monument on \"Piazza della Scala\" in Milan some days before his visit to Bergamo), is not further pursued by Swales. Although Freud visited Trafoi on the 8th of August 1898, Swales doubts whether Freud received a message on the suicide of one of his patients.\n\nFreud in his analysis did not use the fact that he remembered very well a picture of the painter in the lower left corner of one of the frescos. The picture, sort of a signature, was thus a third substitute to the forgotten name Signorelli. The \"signature\" can be interpreted as a reference to the Latin verb \"signare\" and this word, instead of Freud's \"signore\", then leads to a simple analysis of the Signorelli parapraxis (Engels, 2006, p. 66-69). There seems to be no more need for the Bosnia-Hercegovina associations (\"Bo\" and \"Herr\") Freud himself introduced. In the alternative to Freud's analysis the suicide message in Trafoi remains an important point to understand the parapraxis (this message being a blow to Freud's self-esteem). The occurrence of the Signorelli parapraxis \"during\" Freud's trip from Ragusa to Trebinje (in Herzegowina) is not questioned, as was done by Swales. \n\n\n\n\n"}

However, when the Gapsin Coup failed, he took refuge in the United States, where he became a medical doctor. During his time in the United States he became the first Korean to gain American citizenship. From 1895 to 1898 he returned to Korea as chief adviser to the Joseon dynasty government and returned from 1945 to 1948 as chief adviser to the American occupation forces in the south. His nicknames were Songjae () and Ssang-gyeong (), his courtesy name was Yun-gyeong () and he wrote under the pen name N.H. Osia.\n\nSoh Jaipil was born in Boseong County, Korea. His family was one of the Joseon Dynasty's noble families. He was the second son of a Soh Kwang-hyo (also known as Soh Kwang-ha), who was a local magistrate in Boseong County. He was raised by one of his relatives in Seoul. At eight years of age, he was adopted by Soh Kwang-ha, the second cousin of his biological father Soh Kwang-hyo.\n\nSoh's family was from the upper echelons of Joseon Society. He was the eight generation descendant of Seo Jong-je, a daughter to Queen Jeongseong. She was the wife to the 21st King Yeongjo. Seo Kwang-bum, who shared similar ideological beliefs was also from his family.\n\nDuring his adolescence Soh studied at Kim Seong-geun and Park Kyu-su's private school. When Soh was a teenager, he had already been exposed to the reformist ideals of Kim Ok-gyun.\n\nHe passed the civil service exam at the age of 18, becoming one of the youngest people to ever pass this exam. As a result, he became a junior officer in 1882. Thereafter he was appointed to Gyoseokwan Bujeongja () and Seungmunwon Gajuseo (). In 1883 he was appointed to Seungmunwon Bujeongja () and Hunryunwon Bubongsa (). In the following year, he was sent to Japan where he studied both at the Keio Gijuku (the forerunner of the Keio University) and the Toyama Army Academy. In July 1884, his adoptive mother died, but he quickly returned to public service under special orders.\n\nIn his reports to the king, Soh explained that in the new world Korea's armed forces were useless and obsolete. This annoyed powerful conservatives, but it made Soh widely known and respected among like-minded young intellectuals. By that time, a small but growing number of young intellectuals understood that fundamental reform had to occur or Korea would fall victim to the imperialist powers. that he was appointed to Joryeon-guk Sagwanjang ().\n\nIn December 1884, Soh, following Kim Ok-gyun, was involved in the Gapsin Coup, a radical attempt to overturn the old regime and establish equality among people. Soh and Kim Ok-gyun, Park Yeong-hyo, Yun Chi-ho, Hong Yeong-shik, and others had planned a coup for seven months, from July to December 1884. He was appointed the Vice-Minister of Defense. The coup was defeated in three days, as China intervened by sending military troops. As a result, his two younger brothers were killed and his biological father Soh Kwang-ha and biological mother Lady Lee of Seongju were executed under a guilt-by-association system. His first wife Lady Kim was sold into slavery, but committed suicide. Convicted of treason, Soh Jaipil lost his whole family and had to flee Korea to save his life.\n\nThe majority of the 1884 revolutionaries fled to Japan. Unlike them, Soh moved to the United States. He saw Japan as essentially a conduit for Western knowledge and ideas, but preferred to deal with what he saw as the source itself.\n\nIn 1885, early in his stay in America Soh worked part-time jobs. In 1886, Soh lived in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and attended the Harry Hillman Academy (Wilkes-Barre, PA) thanks to the help of John Welles Hollenback. He began to use the name \"Philip Jaisohn\" at that time. In 1890, he became the first Korean immigrant to acquire United States citizenship. He studied medicine at Columbia Medical College (now George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences), and was the first Korean to receive an American medical degree in 1892.\n\nIn 1890, he became a U.S. citizen and from then he was often referred to by his American name Philip Jaisohn.\n\nIn 1894, he married Muriel Armstrong, a distant relative of the former president of the United States, James Buchanan, and daughter of George B. Armstrong, credited as the founder of the U.S. Railway Mail Service. They had two daughters, Stephanie and Muriel. In 1895, he was pardoned by the Joseon government, but he flatly refused to return.\n\nIn 1894, Japan defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese war which occurred on the Korean Peninsula. The Korean cabinet was filled with reformists. Along with these political changes, the treason of the Gapsin Coup was pardoned enabling Jaisohn's return in 1895. In December 1895, he went to Incheon. The Joseon government wanted to appoint him to Foreign Secretary but he refused to take the position. In Korea, he endeavored to politically educate people. Jaisohn published a newspaper, \"The Independent\" (독립신문), to transform the Korean population into an informed citizenry. He was the first to print his newspaper entirely in Hangul to extend readership to lower classes and women.\n\nIn the 1896 to 1898 Civil rights movement and suffrage movements. Soh's goal was to ensure that Korea would drift away from the Chinese sphere of influence but without falling too heavily under the influence of Russia or Japan. He was also behind the construction of the Independence Gate, which was initially meant to symbolize the end of Korea's ritual subordination to China. Apart from his journalistic and political activities, he delivered regular lectures on modern politics and the principles of democracy.\n\nHe promoted national independence as the principal political ideal and emphasized neutral diplomatic approaches to protect Korea from China, Russia and Japan. He also underscored the importance of public education, modernized industry and public hygiene. The Independence was particularly critical of misconduct by government officials, which caused strong reactions by the conservatives. Under the aegis of the Independence Club (), Jaisohn organized the All People's Congress, an open public forum to debate over political issues. The Congress was hailed by young reformers and began to establish nationwide chapters.\n\nIn November 1897, Soh enabled the construction of the Independence Gate (독립문;獨立門). At this time he also ended the policy of Yeongeunmun (영은문;迎恩門). Yeongeunmun was the Korean policy of welcoming the Chinese envoys, Yeongeun roughly translates from Korean to English as \"Welcome to beneficent Envoys of suzerain's.\"\n\nIn 1898, conservatives accused Jaisohn and the Club of seeking to replace the monarchy with a republic, and the Korean government requested Jaisohn to return to the US. After his return, the Korean government ordered the Club to disband and arrested 17 leaders including Rhee Syngman.\n\nIn April to August 1898, he accompanied an army to the Spanish–American War. In 1899 he found employment as clerk for the University of Pennsylvania Hospital.\n\nIn 1904, worked with Harold Deemer, who was a year younger, to create the \"Deemer and Jaisohn shop\". It was a stationery and printing industry store. In 1915, the shop became called the Philip Jaisohn Company, and specialized in the printing industry.\n\nIn the United States, Jaisohn conducted medical research at the University of Pennsylvania and later became a successful printer in Philadelphia. When he heard the news of the March 1st Movement (1919), a nationwide protest against Japanese rule in Korea, Jaisohn convened the \"First Korean Congress\", which was held in Philadelphia for three days. After the Congress, Jaisohn devoted his energies and private property to the freedom of Korea. He organized the League of Friends of Korea in 26 cities with the help of Rev. Floyd Tomkins, and established the \"Korean Information Bureau.\" He published a political journal \"Korea Review\" to inform the American public of the situation in Korea, and to persuade the U.S. government to support the freedom for Koreans.\n\nIn the 1920s, Soh, who had just turned 60, returned to research and spent his 60s and 70s working as a specialist doctor and micro-biologist, as well as occasionally publishing in peer-review academic journals.\n\nFive years later in 1924, Jaisohn went legally bankrupt due to his political engagement and had to resume practicing medicine to make a living. At age 62, he became a student again at the University of Pennsylvania to renew his medical knowledge. After this, he published five research articles in the medical journals specializing in pathology. During World War II, he volunteered as a physical examination officer with the belief that the victory of the U.S. would bring freedom to Korea.\n\nJaisohn returned to Korea once again after Japan's defeat in World War II. The U.S. Army Military Government in control of the southern part of Korea invited him to serve as chief adviser. In December 1946, he was elected to the Interim Legislative Assembly (). In May 1945, liberal and moderate socialist intellectuals selected him as candidate for presidency, but he declined. When the date of the first presidential election was confirmed by the United Nations, Jaisohn was petitioned to run for presidency by 3,000 people including a young Kim Dae-jung, but he refused in the end.\n\nJaisohn felt that political unity was needed for a new nation despite his uneasy relationship with the president elect Syngman Rhee. He decided to return to the United States in 1948. Suffering a heart attack a week earlier on December 29, Jaisohn died on January 5, 1951 during the Korean War, just two days before his 87th birthday.\n\nHis body was cremated, and his ashes were buried in Bib church in Philadelphia. In 1994 his remains were repatriated to South Korea. His ashes were buried in the National Cemetery of South Korea in Seoul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Philip Jaisohn Memorial House in Media, Pennsylvania was Dr. Jaisohn's home from 1925 to 1951. This house was bought when Dr. Jaisohn was in great financial difficulties, while his house in Philadelphia was pledged due to his devotion to the Korean independence. His Media home was acquired by the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation in 1987 and opened to the public in 1990. Since then, the Jaisohn House has been visited by many students and politicians from Korea such as former South Korean president and Nobel peace laureate Kim Dae-jung as well as Korean American immigrants and community neighbors.\n\nOn May 21, 1994, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission and the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation dedicated a historical marker for Dr. Jaisohn, stating:\n\nAmerican-educated medical doctor who sowed seeds of democracy in Korea, published its first modern newspaper (1896-98), and popularized its written language.

{"id": "50066223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50066223", "title": "Solitary confinement of women", "text": "Solitary confinement of women\n\nWhile studies have shown the effects of solitary confinement to be detrimental to some inmates, solitary confinement of women has particular consequences for women that may differ from the way it affects men. Solitary confinement rates for women in the United States are roughly comparable to those for men and about 20% of prisoners will be in solitary confinement at some point during their prison career. Conversely, solitary confinement has also has a very positive effect on women. This article explores both sides of the argument.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ report from 2011-2012, about 20% of female prison inmates and 17% of female jail inmates spent some time in solitary confinement during that year, numbers which are comparable to rates for men.\n\nSolitary confinement is allegedly used to prevent violence within the prison population, and is becoming more common with the prison industrial complex and the rise in incarceration rates. In most prisons, inmates that are put into solitary confinement fall into one of three categories: disciplinary segregation, voluntary administrative segregation, and involuntary administrative segregation. Disciplinary segregation is used as a punishment, while administrative segregation is a preventative measure intended to protect either the inmate being isolated or the other inmates. While segregation as a disciplinary measure or a precaution that protects other inmates is allegedly reserved for offenders who have committed violent acts while in prison, women in particular are often put into solitary for much smaller offenses, such as throwing things or talking back to guards. It is also often used against women who complain of sexual assault from prison guards or other inmates. Once they are in solitary confinement, women are often monitored more closely and disciplined more harshly than men are.\n\nAn offender who has committed a “serious disciplinary offense” may be put in solitary confinement as a punitive measure. Inmates put into disciplinary segregation are not required to be given the same privileges as those put into administrative segregation, but the duration of their stay in isolation tends to be shorter. According to a magazine written by inmates in a California prison, the practice operates under a “guilty until proven innocent” protocol, holding prisoners in solitary confinement even before it is clear that they committed the infraction.\n\nInmates who are considered to be politically threatening are sometimes put into isolation; although the United States does not officially hold political prisoners, some inmates in solitary confinement are there because of their political activism. This justification often means that minorities are more likely to end up in solitary confinement.\n\nAdministrative segregation, or “ad seg,\" is typically more common than disciplinary segregation, and serves to protect either the inmate being placed in solitary or others in the prison. An offender may be put into administrative segregation if they are thought to be dangerous to others or if their own safety is in danger, or if “the inmate has the potential to interfere with an ongoing investigation.\" Often women who vocalize the fact that they feel threatened by someone else will be put into solitary confinement, and similarly, if they are accused of acting threatening in any way, they are put into solitary without being able to defend themselves. Women who are put into administrative segregation tend to be those women who have had trouble adjusting to prison life and who are seen as “high-risk” and “high-needs” when they enter the prison. Because this type of segregation is not intended as punishment, inmates in administrative segregation are legally required to be treated in the same way as those in general confinement in the prison.\n\nWomen prisoners sometimes request to be put into solitary confinement, most often for their own protection. Specifically, some women are thought to request solitary confinement to avoid “further assaults on their identity” that might arise from their interactions and experiences in prison. Studies have found that women who have been in voluntary administrative segregation tend to have high personal or emotional needs, and some have struggled with substance abuse, although few have difficulty with “community functioning.”\n\nWomen prisoners who are deemed to be dangerous to other prisoners are sometimes put into administrative segregation; a prisoner can also be put in segregation if the officers determine that she herself is in danger and needs this protection. Like women who are voluntarily put into segregation, these women tend to have high personal and emotional needs, but many of them also have difficulties functioning in the community or associating with other people.\n\nIn general, women tend to be subjected to harsher disciplinary practices in prisons than men. In the case of solitary confinement, women are often put into segregation for committing small errors while in prison, for example spitting at a guard, while men must commit more violent infractions, such as attacking a guard, for segregation to become necessary. This could arise from the fact that women in prison are held to especially high standards of femininity, and prisons encourage them to conform to very traditional ideas of being a woman. This model of femininity requires women to be “pure, passive, heterosexual, and located in motherhood.\" When women do not comply with this standard while imprisoned, they are punished further. In fact, some prisons specifically isolate women who seem “butch” or not traditionally feminine.\n\nAnother catalyst for being put into solitary confinement that applies overwhelmingly to women is that prisoners who complain of abusive treatment by guards are often segregated as retaliation. In particular, women who speak out after guards have sexually harassed them are often put into segregation. Not only does this mean that guards who are guilty of sexually harassing inmates go unpunished, it also decreases the likelihood that women will report harassment.\n\nIn some prisons, women may be put into solitary confinement because their mental health issues prove to be too difficult for the authorities to deal with or are exhausting their resources. If the prison authorities are unable to address their inmates’ health concerns, they may put them into solitary confinement to avoid solving the problem. This means that the women in solitary confinement are often already at risk for mental health or other challenges, due to previous health concerns or sexual abuse.\n\nSolitary confinement has been shown to be detrimental to the mental and physical well-being of all inmates, but there are some ways in which being put into segregation can be more harmful for women than for men. This is often due to patriarchal structures that exist outside of the prison environment as well. They “experience segregation \"as women\"”; they are both subjected to slightly different treatment than men are and their perception of this treatment may differ as well.\n\nBeing put into solitary confinement can be very damaging to the mental health of female inmates, particularly those with a history of mental or physical illness, as has been found in a number of studies that observed and interviewed women who were being held in solitary confinement. Being held in a small space without access to objects, recreation, or human contact can lead to claustrophobia, anger, depression, hallucinations, insomnia, and obsessive ideation or fixation on dying. On a psychosomatic level, inmates in solitary confinement often experience a loss of appetite and/or weight, dizziness, or heart palpitations. Prison staff often do not respond adequately to complaints of any of these symptoms, and sometimes refuse to offer medical care or medication.\n\nSome of the anxiety that inmates, particularly female inmates, experience in solitary confinement comes from a loss or confusion of identity. Prisoners in solitary confinement are not allowed to decorate the small rooms that they are in or to bring most of their possessions that they were allowed in general confinement. This prevents the women from having any sort of entertainment, but also exacerbates feelings of a loss of individuality and of personal identity.\n\nStudies of the conditions of segregation, and interviews with the women who are subjected to them, have shown that women may also experience a collapse or confusion of identity while in prison because of their removal from their community and because of the unusual experience of space and time while in solitary confinement. Prisoners attach a lot of importance to the items that they have in their rooms; when they are placed into solitary confinement and no longer allowed to keep these identifying objects with them, they begin to lose their sense of self. Further, because prisoners kept in segregation often interact little with the outside world, and because the routines of eating and cleaning may be different from in general confinement, the women lose their ability to mark time. \"The Fire Inside\" magazine, written by offenders in California women’s prisons, quotes one prisoner as saying that her recommendation for those held in solitary confinement is “to create a schedule” and figure out the time of day, because it “helps to assert control over your own life and not be totally defined by whatever ‘routine’ the prison is forcing on you.”\n\nAnother aspect of their identity that is destroyed is their ability to form relationships with others. In most societies, women are perceived as being particularly social; having relationships with other people is seen as an essential element of their role as women in particular. This is of course impossible when in solitary confinement. It has been argued that this has a harmful effect on women especially. These conclusions were drawn from interviews with women who were still in solitary confinement, women who had been in solitary but had since been transferred back to the general prison population, and women who had been in solitary but had been released from incarceration, suggesting that these effects carry over beyond their time in segregation.\n\nSome prisons do allow inmates in solitary confinement to use recreation rooms and exercise yards, but these are often monitored by cameras, creating a sense of powerlessness and humiliating and deterring the women from using these facilities. Feelings of powerlessness or hopeless are exacerbated by the fact that women are often unsure of how long they will be held in solitary confinement.\n\nAll of these factors combined can have different effects on women, making them either increasingly anxious or increasingly indifferent. While some women feel desperate and angry, others attempt to feel as little as possible in order to mitigate the effects of segregation. Because of the detrimental effect on their mental stability, inmates in solitary confinement often resort to self-harm; this behavior is more common in women than in men. This can sometimes lead to women being held in solitary confinement for longer, as punishment for their destructive actions. Similarly, it reinforces the guards’ perceptions of these women as particularly violent or dangerous to the rest of the prison community.\n\nWomen in solitary confinement are often watched over by male guards, which can result in sexual harassment ranging from discomfort caused by guards watching them during private moments to nonconsensual sexual contact. Male guards often are present while women shower or undress, stripping away the women’s right to the privacy of their own bodies. Because women in solitary confinement experience so little human contact, the gaze of their guards is often the only interaction that they have with another person; this can exacerbate the feelings of loss of privacy.\n\nSimilarly, the clothing the women are required to wear is sexualized and humiliating. In some prisons, women in segregation wear a \"baby doll,\" a long shapeless dress, with no underclothes. Although men sometimes are required to wear the “baby doll” as well, women find that wearing it while being watched by their male guards is degrading and makes them feel powerless.\n\nBeyond this, women in segregation are sometimes subjected to sexual abuse or physical harassment by their male guards. They are often forced to undergo thorough strip searches, during which the guards are more forceful and invasive than is strictly necessary and serves mostly to demonstrate the guards’ authority over the inmates. Because so many female inmates have been victims of sexual or physical abuse, this forces them to relive the trauma of their previous abuse. This can be especially devastating for women whose mental states are already deteriorating, due to prior mental illness or to the effects of being in segregation. It can also result in pregnancy, and pregnant women in solitary confinement—whether the pregnancy was a result of a rape by a guard or not—are often denied proper medical care.\n\nWomen have also reported stories of being publicly humiliated when asking for additional sanitary pads during their menstrual periods, or being forced to hand in their used pads in order to acquire a new one, according to the women who contributed to \"The Fire Inside\" magazine. They are entirely dependent on male guards, even for such personal needs as this.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to be the primary guardian of a child or children; having a mother who is in solitary confinement, then, can be very detrimental to the children. Inmates in solitary confinement have much less frequent contact with family members, and when they do, they are usually separated by a partition. Although inmates are allowed some visits from immediate family members, a long background check is required. Children with mothers in prison are at a greater risk for depression or anxiety, substance abuse, or involvement in crime. These factors are only furthered by the more distanced relationship that becomes necessary with a mother in solitary confinement and the restrictions on visitation that accompany that.\n\nWomen who are released from solitary confinement into the general prison population are more likely than men to experience stigmatization and humiliation from the prison guards. This often leads to them isolating themselves and not interacting with other prisoners even when they are not in solitary confinement.\n\nOnce they are released from prison, too, they often have a harder time adjusting to being a part of society again, and frequently end up back in prison. Ex-offenders who were held in solitary confinement are more likely to commit violent acts against others once released than those who spent all their time in the general prison population. As one California prisoner who wrote for \"The Fire Inside\" prison magazine put it, “We go through these kind of mental, emotional, and spiritual stages. At first when you get here you’re angry and disoriented…Paranoia sets in…I slowly began to think of this cell as my safe place…What happens next year when they take the box away?” She, and other women in solitary confinement, become unequipped to deal with the outside world and the knowledge of technological advancement, social interaction skills, and mental stability that it requires.\n\nSolitary confinement is also known to have very positive effects on women. For example, ones needs are taken care of as food, shelter and a warm place to sleep are provided for the women. Moreover, a small solitary confinement cell is usually locked by a door or by bars, meaning that they are safe and secure from other violent inmates. Security survellance ensures that a female solitary confinement inmate has the highest welfare standards avaliable to them. Many women begin to love their solitary confinement cell and take comfort in the fact they are being taken care of. \n\nIn general, women of color, like men of color, are more likely to be put in prison than white women and men. Likewise, they are thought to be somewhat disproportionately represented in the solitary confinement population. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2011-2012, 16% of white prison inmates, 20% of black/African American prison inmates, 16% of Hispanic or Latino prison inmates, and 20% of prison with some other racial identification were in solitary confinement at some point. The difference was slightly less pronounced in jails, with 17% of white, 17% of black/African American, 15% of Hispanic/Latino, and 21% of other inmates spending time in solitary confinement. There is no data available that specifically documents the intersection between race and gender.\n\nAlthough the number of people of color in isolation is only slightly higher than the number of white people, their experiences in solitary confinement may differ. Women in solitary confinement are treated as less than human, in ways which parallel not only the larger societal degradation of women but also that of people of color. The sexually abusive nature of their interactions with the guards, and the denial of medical care, social contact, and resources, can be seen as racialized. In particular, guards often refer to women in solitary confinement using slurs that are both misogynist and racist.\n\nWomen who are put into solitary confinement are often isolated because of actions that challenge dominant perspectives of femininity. Because women of color are often seen as possessing these non-feminine qualities already, they are more susceptible to being put into solitary confinement because of this kind of behavior. Black women are often perceived as “aggressive and recalcitrant,” Latina women are thought to be “loud and belligerent, sexually aggressive, or…unable to speak English,” and Native American women are seen as “backward, savage, and/or primitive.” Because of these preconceptions, women of color are thought to deviate strongly from the feminine ideal, which can be grounds for putting them in solitary confinement.\n\nRepresentations of crime in popular media serve to perpetuate racial stereotypes as well. Offenders of color, including women, are often portrayed as violent, hypersexual, or drug-addicted. While this is true of women of color in the general prison population as well as those held in solitary confinement, there is a particularly strong culture of fear that is built up around segregation units and the prisoners who are held there. Inmates who appear to belong to particular minority groups are often profiled by prison guards as more likely to be dangerous, violent, or involved in a gang, and therefore are moved into isolation; for example, prisoners who speak a language other than English are sometimes targeted as foreign and therefore gang-involved or dangerous.\n\nTransgender or gender nonconforming people are overrepresented in prisons, especially transgender people of color. This could be partly due to the fact that they are disproportionately homeless or living in poverty, conditions which more often lead to incarceration, and because they are targeted by the police and perceived as violent or sexually promiscuous (transgender women in particular). These misconceptions can also be used as reasons that guards place transgender inmates in solitary confinement. The issues that cisgender women face in prisons in general and in solitary confinement in particular can be exacerbated for transgender women, and for transgender men as well. For example, transgender inmates are much more likely to be sexually assaulted than their cisgender counterparts.\n\nAllegedly to protect against this kind of thing, transgender offenders are often put into solitary confinement. Transgender women are sometimes put in male prisons and then separated from the general prison population and put in “protective custody,” which functions in the same ways as solitary confinement, and in fact transgender inmates are sometimes put into segregation facilities that have worse conditions than the ones that cisgender inmates are in. This is said to be for their own safety, since most harassment and assault comes from other prisoners. However, this does not prevent the violence perpetrated by prison guards. Further, while transgender women are often put into confinement to keep them from becoming victims of violence, they are sometimes held near inmates who have been put into confinement because of past violent actions, and then experience violence from those inmates.\n\nBeing in solitary confinement can have consequences for transgender women’s mental and physical health, in particular because transgender people are already more likely to suffer from depression or other mental illness. Prisoners, and especially those in solitary confinement, do not always have access to the necessary medications, and transgender people specifically are often denied access to the hormones that they take.\n\nTransgender inmates in some prisons are able to form communities with each other or with cisgender inmates, and these relationships both help prevent violence and help support those who have experienced it. Studies have been reported in which men have bonded together to prevent a transgender woman in their facility from being sexually assaulted, and to help transgender women get access to medication they needed. These groups sometimes commit violent acts to defend or avenge a friend who has been hurt, as in the case in a New York men’s prison when a group of men killed another man who had attacked a young female transgender inmate; however, despite this violence, it is evident that transgender women sometimes form strong and protective bonds with other inmates that are taken away in solitary confinement. In fact, this is sometimes the purpose of segregating inmates.\n\nDespite all this, some transgender women, just like some cisgender women, do in fact request to be put into solitary confinement for their own safety. This is not the norm, however, and most women find it to be a painful and harmful experience.\n"}

It has its starting point in the stochastic production frontier models simultaneously introduced by Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusen and Van den Broeck (1977).\n\nThe \"production frontier model\" without random component can be written as:\n\nformula_1\nthe best \nwhere \"y\" is the observed scalar output of the producer \"i\", \"i=1..I, x\" is a vector of \"N\" inputs used by the producer \"i\", \"f(x, β)\" is the production frontier, and formula_2 is a vector of technology parameters to be estimated.\n\n\"TE\" denotes the technical efficiency defined as the ratio of observed output to maximum feasible output.\n\"TE = 1\" shows that the \"i-th\" firm obtains the maximum feasible output, while \"TE < 1\" provides a measure of the shortfall of the observed output from maximum feasible output.\n\nA stochastic component that describes random shocks affecting the production process is added. These shocks are not directly attributable to the producer or the underlying technology. These shocks may come from weather changes, economic adversities or plain luck. We denote these effects with formula_3. Each producer is facing a different shock, but we assume the shocks are random and they are described by a common distribution.\n\nThe stochastic production frontier will become:\n\nformula_4\n\nWe assume that \"TE\" is also a stochastic variable, with a specific distribution function, common to all producers.\n\nWe can also write it as an exponential formula_5, where \"u ≥ 0\", since we required \"TE ≤ 1\". Thus, we obtain the following equation:\n\nformula_6\n\nNow, if we also assume that \"f(x, β)\" takes the log-linear Cobb–Douglas form, the model can be written as:\n\nformula_7\n\nwhere \"v\" is the “noise” component, which we will almost always consider as a two-sided normally distributed variable, and \"u\" is the non-negative technical inefficiency component. Together they constitute a compound error term, with a specific distribution to be determined, hence the name of “composed error model” as is often referred.\n\nStochastic Frontier Analysis has examined also \"cost\" and \"profit\" efficiency (see Kumbhakar & Lovel 2003). The \"Cost frontier\" approach attempts to measure how far from full-cost minimization (i.e. cost-efficiency) is the firm. Modeling-wise, the non-negative cost-inefficiency component is added rather than subtracted in the stochastic specification. \"Profit frontier analysis\" examines the case where producers are treated as profit-maximizers (both output and inputs should be decided by the firm) and not as cost-minimizers, (where level of output is considered as exogenously given). The specification here is similar with the \"production frontier\" one.\n\nStochastic Frontier Analysis has also been applied in micro data of consumer demand in an attempt to benchmark consumption and segment consumers. In a two-stage approach, a stochastic frontier model is estimated and subsequently deviations from the frontier are regressed on consumer characteristics (Baltas 2005).\n\nPolacheck & Yoon (1987) have introduced a three-component error structure, where one non-negative error term is added to, while the other is subtracted from, the zero-mean symmetric random disturbance. This modeling approach attempts to measure the impact of informational inefficiencies (incomplete and imperfect information) on the prices of realized transactions, inefficiencies that in most cases characterize both parties in a transaction (hence the two inefficiency components, to disentangle the two effects).\n\nRecently, various non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches were proposed in the literature, where no parametric assumption on the functional form of production relationship is made, see for example Parmeter and Kumbhakar (2014) and Park, Simar and Zelenyuk (2015) and references cited therein.\n\n"}
{"id": "52549787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52549787", "title": "Tampon tax", "text": "Tampon tax\n\nA tampon tax is a popular term used to call attention to the fact that tampons—and other feminine hygiene products—are subject to value-added tax, unlike the tax exemption status granted to other products considered basic necessities. Proponents of tax exemption argue that tampons, sanitary napkins, menstrual cups and comparable products constitute basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt.\n\nProponents argue that feminine hygiene products serving the basic menstrual cycle should be classified alongside other unavoidable, tax exempt necessities, such as groceries and personal medical items. The BBC estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use feminine hygiene products for about a week each month for about 30 years. While sales tax policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed at the same rate as non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general consumption tax on sanitary products. When asked about equivalent exemptions for men, proponents argue that no male products, condoms included, are comparable to feminine hygiene products, since menstruation is biological and \"feminine hygiene is not a choice\". As the vast majority of consumers of feminine hygiene products are women, the increased cost has been criticized as being discriminatory against women. The tampon tax is not a special tax levied directly on feminine hygiene products.\n\nAfter the tax in Canada was removed mid-2015, women began protesting in other countries later that year. On July 21, 2018, India eliminated the Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 12% from sanitary napkins.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom has levied a value-added tax on sanitary products since it joined the European Economic Community in 1973. This rate was reduced to 5% specifically for sanitary products in 2000 with lobbying from Member of Parliament Dawn Primarolo saying that this reduction was \"about fairness, and doing what we can to lower the cost of a necessity.\" This is the lowest rate possible under the European Union's value added tax law, which as of 2015 does not allow zero rates. The UK Independence Party raised the issue in the 2015 general election with promises to withdraw from the European Union and allow the zero rate. Prime Minister David Cameron commented, when prompted, that the tampon tax campaign was \"long-standing\" and a complicated issue within the European Union. In England, one in ten women between 14 and 21 cannot afford menstrual management products.\n\nLaura Coryton led a \"Stop taxing periods, period\" campaign with an online petition to have the European Union remove the value-added tax for sanitary products. George Osborne mentioned the petition by name in his 2015 Autumn Statement pledge to end the tampon tax at the European Union level. The petition platform's CEO cited the campaign as an example of successful clicktivism, with over 320,000 signatures. In March 2016, Parliament created legislation to eliminate the tampon VAT. It was expected to go into effect by April 2018 but did not do so; several British women protested for it publicly while displaying blood stains from their periods. On the 3rd October 2018, new EU VAT rules that will allow the UK to stop taxing sanitary products were approved by the European Parliament.\n\nIn July 2017, a pilot program began in Scotland to have free sanitary products available at schools and food banks for women who cannot afford them. The pilot scheme was launched for six months in Aberdeen, Scotland, with £42,500 of funding from the devolved Scottish Government in order to address the growing scandal of \"period poverty\". It was believed 1,000 girls would benefit from the scheme, as there were reports of teenage girls using tissues, toilet roll, torn T-shirts and even newspaper as makeshift sanitary products, with some girls even skipping school altogether. It was decided to launch the scheme to improve attainment and school attendance, as well as improve confidence amongst teenage girls during their period; and Scotland is believed to be the first country in the world to give out free sanitary products as part of a government-sponsored initiative.\n\nFurther to this half year pilot program, Scotland's opposition Labour Party intends to introduce a bill to make this permanent. Scotland is the first country to ban period poverty.\n\nA study by the WHO and UNICEF showed that one out of five women in Scotland have been forced to improvise with items including toilet paper and old clothes due to the high cost of commercial products.\n\nIn the United States, almost all states tax \"tangible individual property\" but exempt non-luxury \"necessities\": groceries, prescriptions, prosthetics, agriculture supplies, and sometimes clothes—the exemptions vary between states. Five states do not have a state sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon), and , ten states specifically exempted essential hygiene products (Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, and Pennsylvania).\n\nIn the U.S., most states charge sales tax for women's pads and tampons. Ten states have dropped the tampon tax — Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida, according to NPR and CNN. Seven other states have introduced such legislation, most recently Nebraska, Virginia and Arizona. In January 2018, California rejected a proposal to eliminate tampon tax.\n\nMany federal assistance programs such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and WIC (Women, Infants and Children) don’t allow the use of an EBT for products such as pads or tampons despite the products' classification as medical devices.  The IRS does not classify female products as medical devices, thus blocking women from buying them with pre-tax dollars in both flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. \n\nThere has been some changes to the tampon taxes but most of these changes are state level or by city. On a smaller scale, individual cities have also changed their laws in favor of eliminating the tampon tax. \n\nCalifornia Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia reported that California women each pay roughly US$7 per month over 40 years, constituting US$20 million in annual taxes. Garcia and Ling Ling Chang proposed a bill to remove the tampon tax in early 2016. At this period, only a handful of the country's states exempted tampons, and several others had no state sales tax. Garcia held that women were taxed \"for being women\" and bore an economic burden for having no other choice but to buy these products. Garcia and Chang added that the tax was \"regulatory discrimination\" that disproportionately affected poor women and women of color, and that it likely persisted due to social taboos against discussing menstruation. Both houses of the California State Legislature voted to exempt tampons from taxation in June 2016, but the bill was vetoed by the state's governor, Jerry Brown, three months later.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed AB-1561 due to the potential loss of money in taxing feminine hygiene products. In response, Cristina Garcia co-authored AB-0479: Common Cents Tax Reform Act with Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, which is a new measure outlining a solution to offset the feminine product and diaper tax exemption by increasing the tax on hard liquor.\n\nIn 2017, California State Legislature passed AB 10 requiring public middle schools and high schools where at least 40% of students meet the federal poverty level to stock half of the restrooms with free tampons and sanitary napkins. The law was passed in an effort to eliminate the cost burden and keep low-income students in schools during their menstrual cycle.\n\nCompanies involved in supplying the necessary feminine hygiene products (tampons and pads) for complete menstrual care in the restrooms of schools include WAXIE and Hospeco. They also supply various options for menstrual product dispensers that have a time delay mechanism to prevent products from being overused and/or abused.\n\nIn July 2016, New York State exempted feminine hygiene products from taxation, reducing the state's tax revenue by an estimated US$10 million annually. Connecticut and Illinois also removed their tax in 2016, with Florida following suit in 2017.\n\nA 2018 empirical study on New Jersey's 2005 tax break on menstrual products found that \"repealing tampon taxes removes an unequal tax burden and could make menstrual hygiene products more accessible for low-income consumers.\" The study utilized data from more than 16,000 purchases in 2004-2006 made in New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, using these latter nearby states as the control group. Through a differences-in-differences approach, they found that after the repeal, consumer prices on menstrual products decreased by 7.3%, relative to the control states. This was greater than the 6.9% sales tax, suggesting that the consumers benefitted from the tax break. Upon further analysis, the study also found that the decrease in consumer prices was greater for low-income consumers than high-income consumers (3.9% decrease versus 12.4% decrease). This suggests that low-income consumers received the most benefit from the tax break, while high-income consumers shared the benefit with producers of menstrual products.\n\nSupporters of the exemption of said taxes are calling their efforts \"menstrual equity\", explaining it as a social movement that strives for feminine products like tampons to be considered necessities. Things that are considered necessities, for example toilet paper, are not taxed. Activists are often being led by members of government. Councilwomen Julissa Ferreras-Copeland led a movement with a tampon tax pilot project ultimately providing free pads and tampons at a local high school in Queens, New York. Ferreras-Copeland's effort has now been expanded into 25 different schools around New York City. Other democrats including Ydanis Rodriguez and council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito are advocating for state legislature to stop taxing sanitary products. \n\nFree the Tampon, an advocate for free menstrual products estimates that it would cost less than $5 a year per user to provide tampons and pads in restrooms at schools and businesses.\n\n"}
{"id": "3684864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3684864", "title": "Three hares", "text": "Three hares\n\nThe three hares (or three rabbits) is a circular motif or meme appearing in sacred sites from the Middle and Far East to the churches of Devon, England (as the \"Tinners' Rabbits\"), and historical synagogues in Europe. It is used as an architectural ornament, a religious symbol, and in other modern works of art or a logo for adornment (including tattoos), jewelry, and a coat of arms on an escutcheon. It is viewed as a puzzle, a topology problem or a visual challenge, and has been rendered as sculpture, drawing, and painting.\n\nThe symbol features three hares or rabbits chasing each other in a circle. Like the triskelion, the triquetra, and their antecedents (e.g., the triple spiral), the symbol of the three hares has a threefold rotational symmetry. Each of the ears is shared by two hares, so that only three ears are shown. Although its meaning is apparently not explained in contemporary written sources from any of the medieval cultures where it is found, it is thought to have a range of symbolic or mystical associations with fertility and the lunar cycle. When used in Christian churches, it is presumed to be a symbol of the Trinity. Its origins and original significance are uncertain, as are the reasons why it appears in such diverse locations.\n\nThe earliest occurrences appear to be in cave temples in China, dated to the Sui dynasty (6th to 7th centuries). The iconography spread along the Silk Road, and was a symbol associated with Buddhism. The hares have been said to be \"A hieroglyph of 'to be'.\" In other contexts the metaphor has been given different meaning. For example, Guan Youhui, a retired researcher from the Dunhuang Academy, who spent 50 years studying the decorative patterns in the Mogao Caves, believes the three rabbits—\"like many images in Chinese folk art that carry auspicious symbolism—represent peace and tranquility.\" \"See\" Aurel Stein. The hares have appeared in Lotus motifs.\n\nThe three hares appear on 13th century Mongol metalwork, and on a copper coin, found in Iran, dated to 1281.\n\nAnother appears on an ancient Islamic-made reliquary from southern Russia. Another 13th or early 14th century box, later used as a reliquary, was made in Iran under Mongol rule, and is preserved in the treasury of the Cathedral of Trier in Germany. On its base, the casket has Islamic designs, and originally featured two images of the three hares. One was lost through damage.\n\nOne theory pertaining to the spread of the motif is that it was transported from China across Asia and as far as the south west of England by merchants travelling the silk road and that the motif was transported via designs found on expensive Oriental ceramics. This view is supported by the early date of the surviving occurrences in China. However, the majority of representations of the three hares in churches occur in England and northern Germany. This supports a contrary view that the three hares occurred independently as English or early German symbols.\n\nSome claim that the Devon name, Tinners' Rabbits, is related to local tin miners adopting it. The mines generated wealth in the region and funded the building and repair of many local churches, and thus the symbol may have been used as a sign of the miners' patronage. The architectural ornament of the three hares also occurs in churches that are unrelated to the miners of South West England. Other occurrences in England include floor tiles at Chester Cathedral, stained glass at Long Melford, Suffolk and a ceiling in Scarborough, Yorkshire.\n\nThe motif of the three hares is used in a number of medieval European churches, particularly in France (\"e.g.\", in the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière in Lyon) and Germany. It occurs with the greatest frequency in the churches of Devon, England. The motif appears in illuminated manuscripts, architectural wood carving, stone carving, window tracery and stained glass. In South Western England there are over thirty recorded examples of the three hares appearing on 'roof bosses' (carved wooden knobs) on the ceilings in medieval churches in Devon, (particularly Dartmoor). There is a good example of a roof boss of the three hares at Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Dartmoor, with another in the town of Tavistock on the edge of the moor. The motif occurs with similar central placement in Synagogues. Another occurrence is on the ossuary that by tradition contained the bones of St. Lazarus.\n\nWhere it occurs in England, the three hares motif usually appears in a prominent place in the church, such as the central rib of the chancel roof, or on a central rib of the nave. This suggests that the symbol held significance to the church, and casts doubt on the theory that they may have been a masons' or carpenters' signature marks. There are two possible and perhaps concurrent reasons why the three hares may have found popularity as a symbol within the church. Firstly, it was widely believed that the hare was hermaphrodite and could reproduce without loss of virginity. This led to an association with the Virgin Mary, with hares sometimes occurring in illuminated manuscripts and Northern European paintings of the Virgin and Christ Child. The other Christian association may have been with the Holy Trinity, representing the \"One in Three and Three in One\" of which the triangle or three interlocking shapes such as rings are common symbols. In many locations the three hares are positioned adjacent to the Green Man, a symbol commonly believed to be associated with the continuance of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic paganism. These juxtapositions may have been created to imply the contrast of the Divine with man's sinful, earthly nature.\n\nIn Judaism, the \"shafan\" in Hebrew has symbolic meaning. Although rabbits are listed as a non-kosher animal in the Biblethey at least arguably chew their cud lacking cloven hoovesrabbits can carry very positive symbolic connotations, like lions and eagles. 16th century German scholar Rabbi Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, saw the rabbits as a symbol of the Jewish diaspora. The replica of the Chodorow Synagogue from Poland (on display at the Museum of the Jewish Diaspora in Tel Aviv) has a ceiling with a large central painting which depicts a double-headed eagle holds two brown rabbits in its claws without harming them. The painting is surrounded by a citation from the end of Deuteronomy:\n\nThis may be translated: \"As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, hovereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her pinions (...thus is God to the Jewish people).\"\n\nThe hare frequently appears in the form of the symbol of the \"rotating rabbits\". An ancient German riddle describes this graphic thus:\n\nThis curious graphic riddle can be found in all of the famous wooden synagogues from the period of the 17th and 18th century in the Ashknaz region (in Germany) that are on museum display in Beth Hatefutsoth Museum in Tel Aviv, the Jewish Museum Berlin and The Israel Museum in Jerusalem. They also appear in the Synagogue from Horb am Neckar (donated to the Israel Museum). The three animals adorn the wooden panels of the prayer room from Unterlimpurg near Schwäbisch Hall, which may be seen in replica in the Jewish Museum Berlin. They also are seen in a main exhibit of the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. Israeli art historian Ida Uberman wrote about this house of worship: \"... Here we find depictions of three kinds of animals, all organized in circles: eagles, fishes and hares. These three represent the Kabbalistic elements of the world: earth, water and fire/heavens... The fact that they are always three is important, for that number . . . is important in the Kabbalistic context\".\n\nNot only do they appear among floral and animal ornaments, but they are often in a distinguished location, directly above the Torah ark, the place where the holy scriptures repose.\n\nThey appear on headstones in Sataniv (Сатанів), Khmelnytsky Oblast, western Ukraine.\n\nThe logo presents a problem in topology. It is a strange loop rendered as a puzzle.\n\nJurgis Baltrusaitis's 1955 \"Le Moyen-Âge fantastique. Antiquités et exotismes dans l'art gothique\" includes a 1576 Dutch engraving with the puzzle given in Dutch and French around the image. It notes:\n\n\"These are the oldest known dated examples of the Three Rabbits as a puzzle.\" One commentator believes its being a puzzle is likely reason for the image's popularity.\n\nOne recent philosophical book poses it as a problem in perception and an optical illusion—an example of contour rivalry. Each rabbit can be individually seen as correct—it is only when you try to see all three at once that you see the problem with defining the hares' ears. This is similar to \"The Impossible Tribar\" by Roger Penrose, originated by Oscar Reutersvärd. Compare M.C. Escher's impossible object.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4405396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4405396", "title": "Traditional Chinese timekeeping", "text": "Traditional Chinese timekeeping\n\nThe traditional Chinese time systems refers to the time standards for divisions of the day used in China until the introduction of the Shixian calendar in 1628 at the beginning of the Qing dynasty. \n\nThe third chapter of the Huainanzi outlines 15 hours during daylight. These are dawn (), morning light (), daybreak (), early meal (), feast meal (), before noon (), noon (), short shadow (), evening (), long shadow (), high setting (), lower setting(), sunset (), twilight (), rest time (). These are correlated to each hour from 06:00 to 20:00 on the 24-hour clock.\n\nThis system used two standards to measure the time in a solar day. Times during daylight were measured in the \"Shí-kè\" standard, and at night were measured using the \"Gēng-diǎn\" standard. \n\nThe \"Shí-kè\" ( - ) system is derived from the position of the sun. \n\nEach \"shí\" () was of the time between one midnight and the next, making it roughly double the modern hour. These dual hours are named after the earthly branches in order, with midnight in the first \"shí\". This first \"shí\" traditionally occurred from 23:00 to 01:00 on the 24-hour clock, but was changed during the Song dynasty so that it fell from 00:00 to 02:00.\n\nStarting from the end of the Tang Dynasty into the Song Dynasty, each \"shí\" was divided into two, with the first half of each \"shí\" called the initial hour () and the second called the central hour (). Using the change of the midnight hour and the first \"shí\" above, you could say that during the Song Dynasty midnight went from the central hour of the first \"shí\" () to the initial hour of the first \"shí\" ().\n\nDays were also divided into smaller units, called \"kè\" (). One \"kè\" was usually defined as of a day until 1628, though there were short periods before then where days had 96, 108 or 120 \"kè\". \"Kè\" literally means \"mark\" or \"engraving\", referring to the marks placed on sundials or water clocks to help keep time. \n\nUsing the definition of \"kè\" as of a day, each \"kè\" is equal to 0.24 hours, 14.4 minutes, or 14 minutes 24 seconds. Every \"shí\" will contain 8 \"kè\", with 7 or 8 full \"kè\" and partial beginning and/or ending \"kè\". These fractional \"kè\" are multiples of \"kè\", or 2 minutes 24 seconds. The 7 or 8 full \"kè\" within each \"shí\" were referred to as \"major \"kè\"\" (). Each of a \"kè\" was called a \"minor \"kè\"\" ().\n\nBoth \"shí\" and \"kè\" would be used to describe the time accurately. There are two ways of doing this.\n\n\"Kè\" were subdivided into smaller units, called \"fēn\" (). The number of \"fēn\" in each \"kè\" varied over the centuries, but a \"fēn\" was generally defined as of a day. Using this definition, one \"fēn\" is equal to 14.4 seconds. This also means that a \"fēn\" is of a major \"kè\", and a minor \"kè\" has only 10 \"fēn\".\n\nIn 1280, Guo Shoujing's Shòushí Calendar () had each \"fēn\" subdivided into 100 \"miǎo\" (). Using the definition of \"fēn\" as 14.4 seconds, each \"miǎo\" was 144 milliseconds long. \n\nEach \"fen\" was subdivided into \"shùn\" (), and \"shùn\" were subdivided into \"niàn\" ().\n\nThe Mahāsāṃghika, translated into Chinese as the \"Móhēsēngzhī Lǜ\" (Taishō Tripiṭaka 1425) describes several units of time, including \"shùn\" or \"shùnqǐng\" () and \"niàn\". According to this text, \"niàn\" is the smallest unit of time at 18 milliseconds and a \"shùn\" is 360 milliseconds. It also describes larger units of time, including a \"tánzhǐ\" () which is 7.2 seconds long, a \"luóyù\" () which is 2 minutes 24 seconds long, and a \"xūyú\" (), which is of a day at 48 minutes long.\n\nThe \"Gēng-diǎn\" ( - ) system uses predetermined signals to define the time during the night. \n\n\"Gēng\" () is a time signal given by drum or gong. The drum was sounded by the drum tower in city centers, and by night watchman hitting a gong in other areas. The character for \"gēng\" , literally meaning \"rotation\" or \"watch\", comes from the rotation of watchmen sounding these signals.\n\nThe first \"gēng\" theoretically comes at sundown, but was standardized to fall at codice_24, or 19:12. The time between each \"gēng\" is of a day, making a \"gēng\" 2.4 hours—or 2 hours 24 minutes—long.\n\nThe 5 \"gēngs\" in the night are numbered from one to five: \"yī gēng\" () (alternately \"chū gēng\" () for \"initial watch\"); \"èr gēng\" (); \"sān gēng\" (); \"sì gēng\" (); and \"wǔ gēng\" (). The 5 gēngs in daytime are named after times of day listed in the Book of Sui, which describes the legendary Yellow Emperor dividing the day and night into ten equal parts. They are morning (); midmorning, (); noon, (); afternoon (); and evening ().\n\nAs a 10-part system, the \"gēng\" are strongly associated with the 10 celestial stems, especially since the stems are used to count off the \"gēng\" during the night in Chinese literature.\n\n\"Diǎn\" (), or point, marked when the bell time signal was rung. The time signal was released by the drum tower or local temples. \n\nEach \"diǎn\" or point is of a day, making them 0.4 hours, or 24 minutes, long. Every sixth \"diǎn\" falls on the \"gēng\", with the rest evenly dividing every \"gēng\" into 6 equal parts.\n\nGēng and diǎn were used together to precisely describe the time at night.\n\nThe night length is inconsistent during a year. The nineteenth volume of the Book of Sui says that at the winter solstice, a day was measured to be 60% night, and at the summer solstice, only 40% night. The official start of night thus had a variation from 0 to 1 \"gēng\". \n\nThis variation was handled in different ways. From the start of the Western Han dynasty in 206 BC until 102 AD, \"yīgēng\" was moved back one \"kè\" every 9th day from the winter solstice to the summer solstice, and moved forward one \"kè\" every 9th day from summer solstice to the winter solstice. The Xia Calendar (), introduced in 102 AD, added or subtracted a \"kè\" to the start of night whenever the sun moved 2.5° north or south from its previous position.\n\nChinese still uses characters from these systems to describe time, even though China has changed to the UTC standards of hours, minutes, and seconds. \n\n\"Shí\" is still used to describe the hour. Because of the potential for confusion, \"xiǎoshí\" (, literally \"small hour\") is sometimes used for the hour as part of a 24-hour cycle, and \"shíchen\" () is used for the hour as part of the old 12-hour cycle. \n\n\"Diǎn\" is also used interchangeably with \"shí\" for the hour. It can also be used to talk about the time on the hour—for example, 8 o' clock is written as 8 \"diǎn\" (). \n\n\"Fēn\" is also used for minutes. To avoid confusion, sometimes the word \"fēnzhōng\" (, literally \"clock minute\") is used to clarify that one is talking about modern minutes. The time 09:45 can thus be written as \"9 \"shí\", 45 \"fēn\"\" () or \"9 \"diǎn\", 45 \"fēn\"\" ().\n\n\"Kè\" has been defined as of a day since 1628, so the modern \"kè\" equals 15 minutes and each double hour contains exactly 8 \"kè\". Since then, \"kè\" has been used as shorthand to talk about time in of a double hour or of a single hour. Their usage is similar to using \"quarter hour\" for 15 minutes or \"half an hour\" for 30 minutes in English. For example, 6:45 can be written as \"6 \"diǎn\", 3 \"kè\"\" ().\n\n\"Miǎo\" is now the standard term for a second. Like \"fēn\", it is sometimes written as \"miǎozhōng\" (, literally \"clock second\") to clarify that someone is talking about modern seconds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1802113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802113", "title": "Tri-Stat dX", "text": "Tri-Stat dX\n\nTri-Stat dX is a generic role-playing game system developed and published by Guardians of Order in 2003. Like other generic role-playing game systems, Tri-Stat dX has adaptable rules that can be applied to many genres and settings.\n\nTri-Stat dX's name comes from the system's three main Stats: Mind, Body and Soul. \"dX\" refers to the polyhedral dice used in the game: any of the available die types may be used.\n\nIt is based on the original Tri-Stat System first introduced in 1999 with the popular \"Big Eyes, Small Mouth\" \"(BESM)\" anime-genre RPG (which used d6 dice), which is now published by White Wolf Publishing, and the superhero-genre RPG \"Silver Age Sentinels\" (which used d10 dice), and now includes a number of related systems and games such as \"Ex Machina\", \"Dreaming Cities\", and \"\" (which uses a variation of the system).\n\nThe core rules for the Tri-Stat dX system were once available as a free download from the Guardians of Order website, which is now defunct. Although White Wolf has acquired the publishing rights for \"BESM\", they have not offered continued support for the Tri-Stat dX system. The rules however are still available on DriveThruRPG at no cost.\n\nSince all mechanics in Tri-Stat dX use two dice of the same die type (2d6, 2d10, 2d20 etc.), the first choice a Game Master (GM) must decide the game's Power Level, and thus what type of polyhedral dice to use in their game.\n\nTri-Stat uses one table of Stat Values which range from 1 (Inept) to 40 (Godlike). The \"human norm\" is considered 4. The bigger the die type used in the game, the more powerful the characters generally are, and achieve Stat Values much higher than the human norm. Playing in a \"mundane\" (real-world) setting, the GM would set the die type to 2d4, and only allow characters to achieve maximum unadjusted die roll totals of 8. A typical \"action-adventure\" would use a 2d6, allowing more heroic characters and unadjusted rolls up to 12. Games with transhuman characters would use 2d8, and allow rolls up to 16. Superhero games would use 2d10, or 2d12. Godlike characters would use 2d20.\n\nCharacters in Tri-Stat are built with Character Points. To help keep characters \"balanced\", each player is given the same number of Character Points. Depending on the setting's Power Level (and die type chosen by the GM), the GM assigns a number of Character Points to each player to spend on Stats and other abilities. In a \"Subhuman\" mundane world, the characters have 25 - 50 points. In an \"Action-Adventure\" setting, characters get 50 - 70 points and so on. Godlike characters could have 300+ Character Points.\n\nCharacters in Tri-Stat have three main Stats:\n\nTypical Stats range in levels from 1 to 20, although the Stats can go higher depending on the Power Level of the game. Levels of Stats are purchased with Character Points. All Stats cost two Character Points per level, requiring a minimum expenditure of two points per Stat. (Example: Having a Mind Stat of 6 would cost 12 points, two points each for the six stat points). An optional rule the GM can impose increases the point cost for Stats at incremental levels, so that high level Stats require more points to be increased to the next level.\n\nDerived Values are determined by mathematical formulas based on the values of the character's Stats.\n\nOptional derived values:\n\nAny Character Points left over from buying Stat levels are used to buy Attributes for the character. Attributes represent special talents, perks and superpower abilities a character may have. (With them, characters can fly, cast spells, bend iron bars, etc.). Not all campaigns require a character to have superpowers, so a GM can decide which Attributes will be allowed in their game and which ones will not. Because some Attributes (like Special Attacks, Organizational Ties, Gadgets, Henchmen, and Highly Skilled) are similar to GURPS advantages and d20 System Feats, at least some Attributes will be available to characters regardless of the setting.\n\nTri-Stat has many kinds of Attributes available to choose from. Each Attribute costs a certain amount of Character Points to purchase a Rank Level in that ability. The costs of an Attribute Level depends on what it can do for the character. Certain Attributes can be modified by Power Modifier Values (PMVs) (which can increase, \"e.g.\", a power's area of effect, duration, range, or number of targets, also increasing the point cost of the Attribute per Rank).\n\nDefects are the opposite of Attributes, and represent some kind of flaw or weakness in the character. By selecting Defects, a player can regain Character Points to spend elsewhere. There are many Defects available and each returns an amount of Character Points based on the severity of how much they hinder the character. An Attribute can also be assigned a Defect which brings the cost of the power down. For instance, a beam weapon superpower could require a character's special concentration to maintain, giving an advantage to an enemy force. A Personality Defect could be a mental illness the character suffers from, such as paranoia, delusions, or schizophrenia; or could be simply a character flaw, such as being completely obnoxious and difficult for others to deal with.\n\nSkills represent special areas of mental knowledge or technique a character may excel in. Like most games that use Skills, Tri-Stat has a comprehensive Skill list of subjects useful to characters. Of course, players and the GM may add Skills of their devising into the game system if needed. Depending on the campaign setting, certain Skills may or may not be available. For instance, in a Medieval fantasy setting, skills for computers would not be available. Each Skill is also tied to one (or more) of the character's three Stats. Mechanics, for example, is tied to both the Body and Mind Stat. Which one, depends on how the GM feels the character is using it.\n\nSkills are organized as either General or Combat Skills, and are purchased by Skill Points that are separate from Character Points. A character's starting amount of Skill Points and maximum Skill Level is determined by the campaign's Power Level. For example, in a \"Subhuman\" game, characters get 10 Skill Points and can have a maximum Skill Level of 2. In a \"Godlike\" campaign, characters get 60 Skill Points and can have a maximum Skill Level of 10. Certain Attributes can give characters more or fewer Skill Points as they choose. A character's level in a Skill determines how well they are at performing it. At Skill level 1 they are \"well trained\", and at 10 they are \"heavenly masters\" of it.\n\nThe Skill Point cost of a Skill depends on the particular Skill and the campaign setting it is being used in. Unlike many other games, skill cost is not based on its real world difficulty to learn. Instead, skill cost is based on its utility in a given setting. More useful skills cost more. Thus, in a mystery setting, investigative skills would be very expensive, while in a medieval martial arts setting those same investigative skills would be cheap to acquire.\n\nSkills are available with Specializations that subdivide a particular area of knowledge into specific Skills a character is adept at. For instance, if picking the Artisan Skill, a character could Specialize in \"Woodworking\" or \"Plumbing\" among others. Specializations only cost one Skill Point to acquire no matter the setting. For example, a character could pick Gun Combat in a modern day setting, and pay 8 Skill Points for 1 level of Gun Combat, and pay one Skill Point to Specialize in pistol (Level 2). When using other kinds of firearms their effective Level is 1, but with a pistol it would be Level 2.\n\nAll die roll resolutions in Tri-Stat use two polyhedral dice of the same type. Depending on the Power Level of the campaign, these die types will be different. For \"mundane\" settings, 2d4 is used; for \"heroic-action\" settings 2d6 is used; for \"post-human\" settings 2d8 is used; for \"superhero\" games 2d10 or 2d12 can be used; and for \"Godlike\" settings, 2d20 is used. The task resolution mechanic is similar to the method used in GURPS, where rolling lower than the target number is a success and rolling over it is a failure.\n\nWhenever a character needs to roll dice to see if they succeeded or failed at doing something, they must make a dice roll which randomly determines success or failure. There are three kinds of checks in Tri-Stat, Stat Checks, Skill Checks and Contested Checks. Stat Checks are made when the GM feels a check of a character's innate ability is required rather than a specific Skill. Skill Checks are made when a particular area of the character's expertise is being challenged. Contested Checks are made against the actions of another character, or non-player character (NPC), that is challenging the character, and is rolled against what that opponent does.\n\nStat Checks and Skill Checks are often altered by a Difficulty Modifier as determined by the GM. The Difficulty Modifier is added to the target number (usually the player's relevant Stat score) thus making rolling under the target number harder or easier. Modifier ranges depend on the type of die being used in the game. For instance, when using 2d6, Difficulty Modifiers range from +6 \"really easy\" to -6 \"really hard\". For 2d20, something really easy would be +20 and really difficult is -20. In all cases, average difficulty is set at zero, or no modification.\n\nWhen making a Stat Check, a player must roll a total, with two dice, that is less than or equal to the value of the character's Stat. For example, making a check to open a heavy door, a player must roll equal to or less than the numerical level of the character's Body Stat. If the roll was higher, the character has failed at the task.\n\nWhen making a Skill Check, the player selects the particular Skill being challenged and adds the Skill's numerical level as a bonus to the Stat it is tied to. The player must roll less than or equal to the modified Stat Check to succeed the task. Like a Stat Check, a higher roll is a failure. Often a GM may decide a particular task requires at least one level in a specific Skill, otherwise the character cannot perform the task or must do so as an Unskilled Check, where depending on the general familiarity of the situation, the GM adds in or subtracts Modifiers for the action.\n\nWhen directly challenged by another character or NPC, a player makes Stat and Skill checks as normal, but the results must be greater than the opposition's results to succeed. GMs may levy Difficulty Modifiers for favorable or unfavorable circumstance as they see fit, if the particular challenger is at an advantage, or disadvantage during the contest.\n\nTime in Tri-Stat is measured in Rounds which represent about 5 seconds of real time. Rounds are linked together in Scenes. A Scene changes when the specific events and places happen to change in the game. For example, a brawl Scene in a bar would change if the fight is moved out to the parking lot. During a Round, a character can take one of several kinds of Actions, such as Move, Attack, or Defend.\n\nCombat can be seen as a bunch of contested actions made against particular adversaries, however the character uses their Attack Combat Value as the number they must roll equal to, or less than, to score successful attacks against the opposition. Their ACV can be modified by Combat Skills, like Gun Combat, and any Specializations with a particular weapon to score a better hit against the target. Characters roll for Initiative (2 dice + ACV), during a Round of combat to see who goes first. The higher roll \"Gains Initiative\" and allows the character to either take action first, or hold and wait to see what their opponent does.\n\nDefenders of attacks roll their Defense Combat Value to see if they defend against an incoming attack. If they roll less than or equal to their DCV, they successfully defend against the attack whether or not the attacker succeeded his ACV or not. A failed Defense roll means the attack got through and the target takes damage.\n\nCharacters can take damage from either suffering an injury or from an attack in combat. Each attack has a Maximum Damage Rating (MDR), which is the total amount of damage points a particular weapon or accident situation can inflict upon the victim. When an attack makes it through a defense, the defender takes damage from the attack. Depending on the Power Level of the campaign, the damage is rolled with 2 dice and consulted on a Damage Percentage Table. The particular roll will indicate that the target took 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the attack's MDR. The attacker's Attack Combat Value is fully added to the resulting percentage of MDR to determine the total amount of damage inflicted upon the target. Damage is then deducted from a character or object's Health Points.\n\nThere are also optional damage rules, like a BESM-like approach where attacks always deal 100% damage (although 75% would be closer to the BESM damage increments) or the damage system from \"Hong Kong Action Theatre!\", where the margin of success of both attacker and defender determines whether the attack deals 100% damage, 50% damage, or completely misses.\n\nCritical Hits are inflicted whenever an attack die roll comes up as a 2. The attacker automatically hits the target (who cannot defend against it). The target then suffers double the MDR of the weapon plus the attacker's ACV in damage.\n\nIf a character loses all their Health Points, they fall unconscious and are dying. If their Health Points drop to the full negative amount of their Health Points they die. For instance, a character who has 25 Health Points dies when their Health Points reach −25.\n\nGame Masters reward Tri-Stat characters with Advancement Points, which the players can use to purchase better levels of Stats, Skills and Attributes.\n\n"}
{"id": "15818261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15818261", "title": "Zeolitic imidazolate framework", "text": "Zeolitic imidazolate framework\n\nZeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a class of metal-organic frameworks that are topologically isomorphic with zeolites. ZIFs are composed of tetrahedrally-coordinated transition metal ions (e.g. Fe, Co, Cu, Zn) connected by imidazolate linkers. Since the metal-imidazole-metal angle is similar to the 145° Si-O-Si angle in zeolites, ZIFs have zeolite-like topologies. As of 2010, 105 ZIF topologies have been reported in the literature. Due to their robust porosity, resistance to thermal changes, and chemical stability, ZIF’s are being investigated for applications such as carbon capture.\n\nZIFs are prepared by solvothermal or hydrothermal techniques. Crystals slowly grow from a heated solution of a hydrated metal salt, an ImH (imidazole with acidic proton), a solvent, and base. Functionalized ImH linkers allow for control of ZIF structure. This process is ideal for generating monocrystalline materials for single-crystal X-ray diffraction. A wide range of solvents, bases, and conditions have been explored, with an eye towards improving crystal functionality, morphology, and dispersity. Prototypically, an amide solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is used. The heat applied decomposes the amide solvent to generate amines, which in turn generate the imidazolate from the imidazole species. Methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and water have also been explored as alternative solvents for ZIF formation but require bases such as pyridine, TEA, sodium formate, and NaOH. Polymers such as poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide), polyvinylpyrrolidone, and poly-(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) have been found to act as crystal dispersants, imparting particle-size and morphology control.\n\nDue to their promising material properties, significant interest lies in economical large-scale production methods. Sonochemical synthesis, which allows nucleation reactions to proceed rapidly through acoustic generation of localized heat and pressure, has been explored as a way to shorten synthesis times. As with the case of zeolites, microwave-assisted synthesis has also been of interest for the rapid synthesis of ZIFs. Both methods have been shown to reduce reaction times from days to hours, or from hours to minutes. Solvent-free methods, such as ball-milling or chemical vapor deposition, have also been described to produce high-quality ZIF-8. Chemical vapor deposition is of particular promise due to the high degree of uniformity and aspect ratio control it can offer, and its ability to be integrated into traditional lithographic workflows for functional thin films (e.g. microelectronics). Environmentally-friendly synthesis based on supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO) have been also reported as a feasible procedure for the preparation of ZIF-8 at an industrial scale. Working under stoichiometric conditions, ZIF-8 could be obtained in 10 hours and does not require the use of ligand excess, additives, organic solvents or cleaning steps.\n\nZIF’s exhibit some properties relevant to carbon capture, but commercial technology is based on amine solvents.\n\nOne method to separate carbon dioxide exploits differences in its permeability. Because of the tunability of the pores, zeolites have been used to separate carbon dioxide. The pore size ranges from 3-12 Angstroms. Because the size of a carbon dioxide molecule is approximately 5.4 Angstroms, zeolites with a pore size of 4-5 Angstroms can be a great fit for carbon capture. However, there are factors other than just pore size that need to be considered when determining how effective zeolites will be at carbon capture. The first is basicity, which can be created by doing an alkali metal cation exchange. The second is the Si/Al ratio which impacts the cation exchange capacity. To get a higher adsorption capacity, there must be a lower Si/Al ratio in order to increase the cation exchange capacity.\n\nZif’s 68, 69, 70, 78, 81, 82, 95, and 100 have been found to have very high uptake capacity, meaning that they can store a lot of carbon dioxide even if they don’t have extremely high affinities. Of those, 68, 69, and 70 show high affinities for carbon dioxide, evidenced by their adsorption isotherms, which show steep uptakes at low pressures. One liter of ZIF can hold 83 liters of . This could also be useful for pressure-swing adsorption.\n\nMuch ZIF research focuses on the separation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide because a well-studied ZIF, ZIF-8, has a very high separation factor for hydrogen and carbon dioxide mixtures. It is also very good for the separation of hydrocarbon mixtures, like the following: \nIn addition to gas separations, ZIF’s have the potential to separate components of biofuels, specifically, water and ethanol. Of all of the ZIF’s that have been tested, ZIF-8 shows high selectivity. ZIF’s have also shown potential in separating other alcohols, like propanol and butanol, from water. Typically, water and ethanol (or other alcohols) are separated using distillation, however ZIF’s offer a potential lower-energy separation option.\n\nZIF’s also have great potential as heterogeneous catalysts; ZIF-8 has been shown to act as good catalysts for the transesterification of vegetable oils, the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction between benzoyl chloride and anisole, and for the formation of carbonates. ZIF-8 nanoparticles can also be used to enhance the performance in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between benzaldehyde and malononitrile. ZIF’s have also been shown to work well in oxidation and epoxidation reactions; ZIF-9 has been shown to catalyze the aerobic oxidation of tetralin and the oxidation of many other small molecules. It can also catalyze reactions to produce hydrogen at room temperature, specifically the dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane and NaBH hydrolysis. \n\nThe table below gives a more comprehensive list of ZIF’s that can act as catalysts for different organic reactions.\nZIF’s are also good candidates for chemical sensors because of their tunable adsorbance properties. ZIF-8 exhibits sensitivity when exposed to the vapor of ethanol and water mixtures, and this response is dependent on the concentration of ethanol in the mixture. Additionally, ZIF’s are attractive materials for matrices for biosensors, like electrochemical biosensors, for in-vivo electrochemical measurements. They also have potential applications as luminescent probes for the detection of metal ions and small molecules. ZIF-8 luminescence is highly sensitive to Cu2+, and Cd2+ ions as well as acetone. ZIF nanoparticles can also sense fluorescently tagged single stranded pieces of DNA.\n\nBecause ZIF’s are porous, chemically stable, thermally stable, and tunable, they are potentially a platform for drug delivery and controlled drug release. ZIF-8 is very stable in water and aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions but decompose quickly in acidic solutions, indicating a pH sensitivity that could aid in the development of ZIF-based drug-release platforms.\n\nWhile ZIFs are a subset of the MOF hybrids that combine organic and metal frameworks to create hybrid microporous and crystalline structures, they are much more restricted in their structure. Similar to MOFs, most ZIF properties are largely dependent on the properties of the metal clusters, ligands, and synthesis conditions in which they were created.\n\nMost ZIF alterations up to this point have involved changing the linkers - bridging O2- anions and imizazolate-based ligands - or combining two types of linkers to change bond angles or pore size due to limitations in synthesizing methods and production. A large portion of changing linkers included adding functional groups with various polarities and symmetries to the imidazolate ligands to alter the ZIFs carbon dioxide adsorption ability without changing the transitional-metal cations. Compare this to MOFs, which have a much larger degree of variety in the types of their building units.\n\nDespite these similarities with MOFs, ZIFs have significant properties that distinguish these structures as uniquely to be applied to carbon capture processes. Because ZIFs tend to resemble the crystalline framework of zeolites, their thermal and chemical stability are higher than those of other MOFs, allowing them to work at a wider range in temperatures, making them suitable to chemical processes.\n\nPerhaps the most important difference is the ZIFs hydrophobic properties and water stability. A main issue with zeolites and MOFs, to a certain extent, was their adsorption of water along with CO2.[7] Water vapor is often found in carbon-rich exhaust gases, and MOFs would absorb the water, lowering the amount of CO2 required to reach saturation. MOFs are also less stable in moist and oxygen rich environments due to metal-oxygen bonds performing hydrolysis. ZIFs, however, have nearly identical performances in dry and humid conditions, showing much higher CO2 selectivity over water, allowing the adsorbent to store more carbon before saturation is reached.\n\nEven in comparison with other materials, the ZIFs most attractive quality is still its hydrophobic properties. When compared to ZIFs in dry conditions, activated carbon was nearly identical with its uptake capacity. However, once the conditions were changed to wet, the activated carbon’s uptake was halved. When this saturation and regeneration tests were run at these conditions, ZIFs also showed minimal to no structural degradation, a good indication of the adsorbent’s re-usability.\n\nHowever, ZIFs tend to be expensive to synthesize. MOFs require synthesis methods with long reaction periods, high pressures, and high temperatures, which aren’t methods that are easy to scale-up. ZIFs do tend to be more affordable than commercially available non-ZIF MOFs.\n\nWhen combined with polymer-sorbent materials, research determined that hybrid polymer-ZIF sorbent membranes no longer following the upper bound of the Robeson plot, which is a plot of selectivity as a function of permeation for membrane gas separation.\n\n\n"}
