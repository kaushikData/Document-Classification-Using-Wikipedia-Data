The centerpiece is a device incorporating signal lights to indicate which workstation has the problem. The alert can be activated manually by a worker using a pullcord or button, or may be activated automatically by the production equipment itself. The system may include a means to stop production so the issue can be corrected. Some modern alert systems incorporate audio alarms, text, or other displays.\n\nAn Andon System is one of the principal elements of the Jidoka quality-control method pioneered by Toyota as part of the Toyota Production System and therefore now part of the Lean approach. It gives the worker the ability, and moreover the empowerment, to stop production when a defect is found, and immediately call for assistance. Common reasons for manual activation of the Andon are part shortage, defect created or found, tool malfunction, or the existence of a safety problem. Work is stopped until a solution has been found. The alerts may be logged to a database so that they can be studied as part of a continuous-improvement program.\n\nThe system typically indicates where the alert was generated, and may also provide a description of the trouble. Modern Andon systems can include text, graphics, or audio elements. Audio alerts may be done with coded tones, music with different tunes corresponding to the various alerts, or pre-recorded verbal messages.\n\nThe concept/process of giving a non-management (production line) worker the authority to stop the production line because of a suspected quality issue is generally thought to have been pioneered by W. Edwards Deming. Many in Japan credit Deming as the inspiration for what has become known as the Japanese post-war economic miracle of 1950 to 1960, when Japan rose from the ashes of war to start Japan on the road to becoming the second largest economy in the world through processes founded on the ideas Deming taught:\n\n\nUsage of the word originated within Japanese manufacturing companies, and in English is a loanword from a Japanese word for a paper lantern.\n\n"}
{"id": "1102119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1102119", "title": "Blood eagle", "text": "Blood eagle\n\nThe blood eagle is a ritualized method of execution, detailed in late skaldic poetry. According to the two instances mentioned in the Sagas, the victims (in both cases members of royal families) were placed in a prone position, their ribs severed from the spine with a sharp tool, and their lungs pulled through the opening to create a pair of “wings”. There is continuing debate about whether the ritual was a literary invention, a mistranslation of the original texts, or an authentic historical practice.\n\nThe blood eagle ritual killing rite appears in just two instances in Norse literature, plus oblique references some have interpreted as referring to the same ritual. The primary versions share certain commonalities: the victims are both noblemen (Halfdan Haaleg or \"Long-leg\" was a prince; Ælla of Northumbria a king) and both of the executions were in retaliation for the murder of a father.\n\nIn the \"Orkneyinga saga\", the blood eagle is described as a sacrifice to Odin. Torf-Einarr has Harald Fairhair's son Halfdan Long-Leg ritually executed:\n\nSnorri Sturluson's \"Heimskringla\" contains an account of the same event described in \"Orkneyinga saga\", with Einarr actually performing the deed himself:\n\nIn \"Þáttr af Ragnars sonum\" (the \"Tale of Ragnar's sons\"), Ivar the Boneless has captured king Ælla of Northumbria, who had killed Ivar's father Ragnar Loðbrók. The killing of Ælla, after a battle for control of York, is described thus:\n\nThe blood eagle is referred to by the eleventh-century poet Sigvatr Þórðarson, who, some time between 1020 and 1038, wrote a skaldic verse named \"Knútsdrápa\" that recounts and establishes Ivar the Boneless as having killed Ælla and subsequently cutting his back.\n\nSighvatr's skaldic verse in Old Norse:\nSkaldic verse, a common medium of Norse poets, was meant to be cryptic and allusive, and the idiomatic nature of Sighvatr's poem as a description of what has become known as the blood eagle is a matter of historical contention, particularly since in Norse imagery the eagle was strongly associated with blood and death.\n\nAnother possible oblique reference to the ritual appear in \"Norna-Gests þáttr\". There are two stanzas of verse near the end of its section 6, \"Sigurd Felled the Sons of Hunding\", where a character describing previous events says:\n\nThe word translated \"raven\" is not \"hrafn\" but \"hugin\", one of Odin's ravens.\n\nThere is debate about whether the blood eagle was historically practiced, or whether it was a literary device invented by the authors who transcribed the sagas. No contemporary accounts of the ritual exist, and the scant references in the sagas are several hundred years after the Christianization of Scandinavia. \n\nAlfred Smyth supported the historicity of the ritual, stating that it is clearly human sacrifice to the Norse god Odin. He characterized St. Dunstan's description of the Ælla's killing as an \"accurate account of a body subjected to the ritual of the blood eagle\". \n\nRoberta Frank reviewed the historical evidence for the ritual in her \"Viking Atrocity and Skaldic Verse: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle\", where she writes: \"By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the various saga motifs—eagle sketch, rib division, lung surgery, and 'saline stimulant'—were combined in inventive sequences designed for maximum horror.\" She concludes that the authors of the sagas misunderstood alliterative kennings which described carnivorous birds scavenging after battles, i.e. killing a foe and allowing their backs to be torn by eagles as battlefield carrion. She compared the lurid details of the blood eagle to Christian martyrdom tracts, such as that relating the tortures of Saint Sebastian, shot so full of arrows that his ribs and internal organs were exposed. She suggests that these tales of martyrdom inspired further exaggeration of the misunderstood skaldic verses into a grandiose torture and death ritual with no actual historical basis. David Horspool in his book \"King Alfred: Burnt Cakes and Other Legends\", while not committing to the historical veracity of the ritual, also saw parallels to martyrdom tracts. Frank's paper sparked a \"lively debate\". \n\nRonald Hutton's \"The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy\" states that \"the hitherto notorious rite of the 'Blood Eagle,' the killing of a defeated warrior by pulling up his ribs and lungs through his back, has been shown to be almost certainly a Christian myth resulting from the misunderstanding of some older verse.\"\n"}
{"id": "3230705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3230705", "title": "Characteristica universalis", "text": "Characteristica universalis\n\nThe Latin term characteristica universalis, commonly interpreted as \"universal characteristic\", or \"universal character\" in English, is a universal and formal language imagined by Gottfried Leibniz able to express mathematical, scientific, and metaphysical concepts. Leibniz thus hoped to create a language usable within the framework of a universal logical calculation or \"calculus ratiocinator\".\n\nThe \"characteristica universalis\" is a recurring concept in the writings of Leibniz. When writing in French, he sometimes employed the phrase \"spécieuse générale\" to the same effect. The concept is sometimes paired with his notion of a \"calculus ratiocinator\" and with his plans for an encyclopaedia as a compendium of all human knowledge.\n\nMany Leibniz scholars writing in English seem to agree that he intended his \"characteristica universalis\" or \"universal character\" to be a form of pasigraphy, or ideographic language. This was to be based on a rationalised version of the 'principles' of Chinese characters, as Europeans understood these characters in the seventeenth century. From this perspective it is common to find the \"characteristica universalis\" associated with contemporary universal language projects like Esperanto, auxiliary languages like Interlingua, and formal logic projects like Frege's \"Begriffsschrift\". The global expansion of European commerce in Leibniz's time provided mercantilist motivations for a universal language of trade so that traders could communicate with any natural language.\n\nOthers, such as Jaenecke, for example, have observed that Leibniz also had other intentions for the \"characteristica universalis\", and these aspects appear to be a source of the aforementioned vagueness and inconsistency in modern interpretations. According to Jaenecke,\n\nAs Couturat wrote, Leibniz criticized the linguistic systems of George Dalgarno and John Wilkins for this reason since they focused on\n\nLeibniz said that his goal was an alphabet of human thought, a universal symbolic language (characteristic) for science, mathematics and metaphysics. According to Couturat, \"In May 1676, he once again identified the universal language with the characteristic and dreamed of a language that would also be a calculus—a sort of algebra of thought\" (1901, chp 3.). This characteristic was a universalisation of the various \"real characteristics\". Couturat wrote that Leibniz gave Egyptian and Chinese hieroglyphics and chemical signs as examples of \"real characteristics\" writing:\n\nIn a footnote Couturat added:\n\nHartley Rogers emphasised the metaphysical aspect of the \"characteristica universalis\" by relating it to the \"elementary theory of the ordering of the reals,\" defining it as \"a precisely definable system for making statements of science\" (Rogers 1963: 934). Universal language projects like Esperanto, and formal logic projects like Frege's \"Begriffsschrift\" are not commonly concerned with the epistemic synthesis of empirical science, mathematics, pictographs and metaphysics in the way Leibniz described. Hence scholars have had difficulty in showing how projects such as the \"Begriffsschrift\" and Esperanto embody the full vision Leibniz had for his \"characteristica\".\n\nThe writings of Alexander Gode suggested that Leibniz' \"characteristica\" had a metaphysical bias which prevented it from reflecting reality faithfully. Gode emphasized that Leibniz established certain goals or \"functions\" first, and then developed the \"characteristica\" to fulfill those functions.\n\nIn the domain of science, Leibniz aimed for his \"characteristica\" to form diagrams or pictures, depicting any system at any scale, and understood by all regardless of native language. Leibniz wrote:\n\nP. P. Weiner raised an example of a large scale application of Leibniz's \"characteristica\" to climatic science. A weather-forecaster invented by Athanasius Kircher \"interested Leibniz in connection with his own attempts to invent a universal language\" (1940).\n\nLeibniz talked about his dream of a universal scientific language at the very dawn of his career, as follows:\n\nNicholas Rescher, reviewing Cohen's 1954 article, wrote that:\n\nNear the end of his life, Leibniz wrote that combining metaphysics with mathematics and science through a universal character would require creating what he called:\n\nThe universal \"representation\" of knowledge would therefore combine lines and points with \"a kind of pictures\" (pictographs or logograms) to be manipulated by means of his \"calculus ratiocinator\". He hoped his pictorial algebra would advance the scientific treatment of qualitative phenomena, thereby constituting \"that science in which are treated the forms or formulas of things in general, that is, quality in general\" (\"On Universal Synthesis and Analysis\", 1679, in Loemker 1969: 233).\n\nSince the \"characteristica universalis\" is diagrammatic and employs pictograms (below left), the diagrams in Leibniz's work warrant close study. On at least two occasions, Leibniz illustrated his philosophical reasoning with diagrams. One diagram, the frontispiece to his 1666 \"De Arte Combinatoria\" (On the Art of Combinations), represents the Aristotelian theory of how all material things are formed from combinations of the elements earth, water, air, and fire. \n\nThese four elements make up the four corners of a diamond (see picture to right). Opposing pairs of these are joined by a bar labeled \"contraries\" (earth-air, fire-water). At the four corners of the superimposed square are the four qualities defining the elements. Each adjacent pair of these is joined by a bar labeled \"possible combination\"; the diagonals joining them are labeled \"impossible combination\". Starting from the top, fire is formed from the combination of dryness and heat; air from wetness and heat; water from coldness and wetness; earth from coldness and dryness. This diagram is reproduced in several texts including \"Saemtliche Schriften und Briefe\" (\"Saemtliche Schriften und Briefe\", Reihe VI, Band 1: 166, Loemker 1969: 83, 366, Karl Popp and Erwin Stein 2000: 33).\n\nLeibniz rightly saw that creating the \"characteristica\" would be difficult, fixing the time required for devising it as follows: \"I think that some selected men could finish the matter in five years\" (Loemker 1969: 224), later remarking: \"And so I repeat, what I have often said, that a man who is neither a prophet nor a prince can ever undertake any thing of greater good to mankind of more fitting for divine glory\" (Loemker 1969: 225). But later in life, a more sober note emerged. In a March 1706 letter to the Electress Sophia of Hanover, the spouse of his patron, he wrote:\n\nIn another 1714 letter to Nicholas Remond, he wrote:\n\nC. J. Cohen (1954) set out three criteria which any project for a philosophical language would need to meet before it could be considered a version of the \"characteristica universalis\". In setting out these criteria, Cohen made reference to the concept of \"logistic\". This concept is not the same as that used in statistical analysis. In 1918, Clarence Irving Lewis, the first English-speaking logician to translate and discuss some of Leibniz's logical writings, elaborated on \"logistic\" as follows:\nFollowing from this Cohen stipulated that the universal character would have to serve as: \nThese criteria together with the notion of logistic reveal that Cohen and Lewis both associated the \"characteristica\" with the methods and objectives of general systems theory.\n\nInconsistency, vagueness, and a lack of specifics in both English language translations and modern English language interpretations of Leibniz's writings render a clear exposition difficult. As with Leibniz's \"calculus ratiocinator\" two different schools of philosophical thought have come to emphasise two different aspects that can be found in Leibniz's writing. The first point of view emphasizes logic and language, and is associated with analytic philosophy and rationalism. The second point of view is more in tune with Couturat's views as expressed above, which emphasize science and engineering. This point of view is associated with synthetic philosophy and empiricism. Either or both of these aspects Leibniz hoped would guide human reasoning like Ariadne's thread and thereby suggest solutions to many of humanity's urgent problems.\n\nBecause Leibniz never described the \"characteristica universalis\" in operational detail, many philosophers have deemed it an absurd fantasy. In this vein, Parkinson wrote:\n\nThe logician Kurt Gödel, on the other hand, believed that the \"characteristica universalis\" was feasible, and that its development would revolutionize mathematical practice (Dawson 1997). He noticed, however, that a detailed treatment of the \"characteristica\" was conspicuously absent from Leibniz's publications. It appears that Gödel assembled all of Leibniz's texts mentioning the \"characteristica\", and convinced himself that some sort of systematic and conspiratorial censoring had taken place, a belief that became obsessional. Gödel may have failed to appreciate the magnitude of the task facing the editors of Leibniz's manuscripts, given that Leibniz left about 15,000 letters and 40,000 pages of other manuscripts. Even now, most of this huge Nachlass remains unpublished.\n\nOthers in the 17th century, such as George Dalgarno, attempted similar philosophical and linguistic projects, some under the heading of \"mathesis universalis\". A notable example was John Wilkins, the author of \"An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language\", who wrote a thesaurus as a first step towards a universal language. He intended to add to his thesaurus an alphabet of human thought (an organisational scheme, similar to a thesaurus or the Dewey decimal system), and an \"algebra of thought,\" allowing rule-based manipulation. The philosophers and linguists who undertook such projects often belonged to pansophical (universal knowledge) and scientific knowledge groups in London and Oxford, collectively known as the \"Invisible College\" and now seen as forerunners of the Royal Society.\n\nA wide variety of constructed languages have emerged over the past 150 years which appear to support many of Leibniz's intuitions. If indeed they do support Leibniz's vision of unified science, then the remaining question is whether Ariadne's unifying thread can be discerned among these various projects, leading to their integration.\n\n\nOn Leibniz's lifelong interest in the \"characteristica\" and the like, see the following texts in Loemker (1969): 165–66, 192–95, 221–28, 248–50, and 654–66.\n\nOn the \"characteristica\", see Rutherford (1995) and the still-classic discussion in Couturat (1901: chpts. 3,4). Also relevant to the \"characteristica\" is Mates's (1986: 183–88) discussion of what he called the \"lingua philosophica\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2973525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2973525", "title": "Confidence", "text": "Confidence\n\nConfidence has a common meaning of a certainty about handling something, such as work, family, social events, or relationships. Some have ascribed confidence as a state of being certain either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct or that a chosen course of action is the best or most effective. Confidence comes from a latin word fidere' which means \"to trust\"; therefore, having a self-confidence is having trust in one's self. Arrogance or hubris in this comparison is having unmerited confidence – believing something or someone is capable or correct when they are not. Overconfidence or presumptuousness is excessive belief in someone (or something) succeeding, without any regard for failure. Confidence can be a self-fulfilling prophecy as those without it may fail or not try because they lack it and those with it may succeed because they have it rather than because of an innate ability.\n\nTaken to an extreme, over-confidence can cause problems as evidenced by the famous author Matthew Syed and mentioned here in this reference in regard to sport. Motivation theories have suggested that successful performance hinges on both skill and will. Yet, even a motivated and skilled individual can fail to perform if he or she does not have a personal certainty belief that s/he can handle what it takes or what needs to be done. Stajkovic (2006) argues that all three – skill, will, and confidence – are needed for action to unfold. The opposite of confidence is doubt. \n\nConfidence sits at the core of four other manifestations: Hope, Efficacy, Optimism and Resilience. Core confidence impacts hope by allowing one to figure out what needs to be done and how to do it. It affects self-efficacy as one gains the belief that specific tasks can be completed, gives one a positive outlook (optimism), and increases the belief that one can overcome obstacles (resilience). Confidence enables the potential that is already present (skill and motivation) to unfold. Self-confidence does not necessarily imply \"self-belief\" or a belief in one's ability to succeed. For instance, one may be inept at a particular sport or activity, but remain \"confident\" in one's demeanor, simply because one does not place a great deal of emphasis on the outcome of the activity. When one does not dwell on negative consequences one can be more \"self-confident\" because one is worrying far less about failure or the disapproval of others following potential failure. One is then more likely to focus on the actual situation which means that enjoyment and success in that situation is also more probable. Belief in one's abilities to perform an activity comes through successful experience and may add to, or consolidate, a general sense of self-confidence. Research by Stajkovic and colleagues revealed that confidence was a significant factor in academic performance, sales performance, satisfaction with life and job satisfaction. Studies have also found a link between high levels of confidence and wages. Seemingly, those who self-report they were confident earlier in schooling earned better wages and were promoted more quickly over the life course. Core confidence may also be linked to work satisfaction and plays a role in self-regulation. If there is doubt that a change can be made in response to feedback, it is unlikely the change will occur. However, if core confidence is high, the change is more likely to occur. If a person lacks core confidence, they are not likely to initiate the change needed. Those who have high core confidence are more likely to set and achieve high performance goals. \n\nLow confidence makes it less likely that a person will initiate action and more likely that a person will disengage because they doubt they can handle what needs to be done. Even with skill and motivation, without confidence, goals are not likely to be met. In certain fields of medical practice patients experience lack of self-confidence during the recovery period. This is commonly referred to as DSF or \"defectum sui fiducia\" from the Latin etymology of lack of self-confidence. For example, this can be the case after stroke whereby the patient refrains from using the weaker lower limb due to fear of it not being strong to hold their weight whilst standing or walking.\n\nIt is suggested that the confidence bias can be explained by a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment), whereas noise is defined as the mixing of memories during the storing (observing/learning) and retrieval process (remembering/judgment). The information-theoretic logic behind this explanation is very similar to the mechanism that can also lead to the conservatism bias, and holds that we mix true and false evidence during storage and retrieval of evidence to and from our memories. The confidence bias results because as judges we \"look inside our own memory\" (evaluate our confidence) and find evidence that is more extreme than when we retrieve evidence for our judgements (which are conservative due to mixing of extreme values during retrieval). This explanation is very simple and straightforward, but nevertheless sufficient mechanism to generate both, overconfidence (in situations where judges are very sure) and underconfidence (in cases when judges openly state to lack the required knowledge).\n\n"}
{"id": "22082177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22082177", "title": "Consequential strangers", "text": "Consequential strangers\n\nConsequential strangers are personal connections other than family and close friends. Also known as \"peripheral\" or \"weak\" ties, they lie in the broad social territory between strangers and intimates. The term was coined by Karen L. Fingerman and further developed by Melinda Blau, who collaborated with the psychologist to explore and popularize the concept.\n\nSocial life in the 21st century includes a wide array of personal connections, not just intimates—people associated with a particular part of one’s life and daily activities, such as co-workers, neighbors, gym buddies, fellow volunteers and congregants, and providers of goods and services. Typically, peripheral ties far outnumber one’s close relations. Decades of research have shown the importance of primary relationships in both psychological and physiological well being. Yet an analysis of the broader social landscape suggests that consequential strangers provide many of the same benefits as intimates as well as many distinct and complementary functions. They are not universally beneficial—undesirable consequential strangers who cannot be avoided can be found in the workplace, neighborhoods and organizations. But to thrive in a modern society, research suggests, it is vital to have a variety of connections.\n\nThe academic underpinnings of the concept can be traced back to Mark Granovetter’s influential 1973 paper, \"The Strength of Weak Ties,\" in which the sociologist argued that job opportunities were most likely to come from people in the more distant reaches of one’s personal network—old bosses, former coworkers, college connections. Subsequent studies of social networks have shown that information, resources, and new connections—which confer social capital—are the province of weak ties in all arenas of life, not just employment. Benefits accrue to individuals, families, and the larger community as well. For example, one study found that African American mothers who made use of community ties as well as their families, were able to get their children into magnet schools and extracurricular programs that protected them from the dangers of inner city life.\n\nHistorically, relationship scholars have concentrated almost entirely on intimates: partners, children, parents, and, to a lesser extent, best friends. However, the trend toward urbanization underscored the importance of peripheral relationships. It is almost impossible to cope with the demands of modern life without weak ties. Thus, over the last several decades a handful of researchers and theorists have emphasized the important role of weak ties in anchoring individuals in the larger community. As one scholar observed in 1989, \"Social scientists have long held that close and intimate friendships are the \"sine qua non\" of personal relationships, and no doubt they are important, but ties with acquaintances are equally important.\"\n\nTechnology has played a key role in the unprecedented rise of consequential strangers. Advances in transportation and communication have always altered the ways in which people can connect—the pony express allowed the printed word to spread; the telephone made it possible to speak to distant contacts. But computers and digitalization have accelerated the process. In 1997, when Merrill Lynch asked social observer Michael Schrage to analyze how \"new\" technologies would transform businesses, he stressed that the shift did not herald an \"information revolution\" as much as a \"relationship revolution\". His predictions proved prescient. Today, at least 1.6 billion people are connected via computer and mobile devices. Various social media, such as blogs, wikis, Twitter, SMS, and networking sites like Facebook facilitate contact, coordination, and collaboration across boundaries of time and space—and at minimal cost. Most relationships—personal and business—are now conducted both on and off the Internet. As a result, the ranks of consequential strangers have grown as has the ability to keep in touch with them.\n\nConsequential strangers comprise the aggregate of personal connections outside one’s inner circles of family and close friends. Such relationship are referred to elsewhere as \"peripheral\" (versus \"core\"), \"secondary\" (versus \"primary\"), or \"weak ties\" (versus \"strong\"). Colloquially, they are also known as acquaintances. But in reality, relationships cannot be neatly classified into groups. Rather, they fall along a continuum. Consequential strangers occupy the vast territory between strangers and close (or core) ties. They are just beyond Stanley Milgrim’s conception of a familiar stranger—one frequently encountered and broadly identifiable (a woman, an Asian, a cop)—but not known in the personal sense. In contrast, a personal and repeated pattern of interaction is evident with a consequential stranger.\n\nThe field of consequential strangers encompasses a diverse assortment of relationship types. The gradations between weak ties are often blurred, among other reasons because all relationships are fluid and dynamic. Over time, some consequential stranger connections become close friends or even intimate partners, while others stay at the level of acquaintanceship—for example, those \"anchored\" to a particular place, such as a school, gym, or train station or involved in a paid service or status hierarchies (e.g., a boss and worker).\n\nAlso, the vocabulary of relationships can be confusing. Whereas some languages, such as French, have two forms of the pronoun \"you\"—using the informal \"tu\" with intimates and the formal \"vous\" with acquaintances—English has no such markers. The word \"friend\" is used to describe close \"and\" casual relations. One must inquire further to find out what the speaker means. Likewise, \"acquaintance\" can be defined either as a relationship that falls short of friendship or as a stage from which the relationship becomes more intimate. Technology further complicates the linguistic issue. For example, Japanese sociologist Hidenori Tomita coined the term \"intimate stranger\"—a person with whom one shares intimate and yet anonymous contact—to describe \"new relationships born through the new media.\"\n\nSocial scientists in the seventies observed that in order for a relationship to develop into increasing intimacy, the social partners need opportunities to get together, time with one another, and a certain degree of privacy (optimum group size for developing intimacy is small). More recent conceptualizations extend that premise, theorizing that a relationship is more than the sum of two people. Environmental, historical, and cultural factors also impinge on the course of a given relationship. Among factors cited are the partners’ other social ties, their respective positions in the life cycle, the era in which the two are embedded, and the place—home, community, country—where their liaison unfolds. Moreover, \"getting together\" nowadays often occurs in virtual, not real, space.\n\nThe \"closest\" peripheral ties involve mutual recognition and repeated interactions (in one another’s physical presence or online). A treasured accountant or a cherished priest might be among one’s closest consequential strangers. At the other extreme are relationships that are barely blips on the social radar, such as people with adjoining season seats for a game or same-time-next-year conventioneers.\n\nAnother factor that shapes a relationship is the level of investment and stability. People are committed to their intimates, less so to their consequential strangers. If one's tennis partner moves or the owner of a favorite deli retires, such individuals might be missed, but others will fill their roles. Also, weak ties often serve compartmentalized needs—for a particular kind of assistance, a leisure activity, a work project—whereas intimates are more likely to serve multiple functions.\n\nSelf-disclosure—both \"breadth\" (the variety of subjects discussed) and \"depth\" (the degree of intimate sharing)—is the engine that drives all relationships. As a rule of thumb, the closer the relationship, the more time spent together, the more likely that social partners will self-disclose. However, in all relationships, social partners strike a balance between a need to connect and a need for one’s own space. At different times of day, at different times of life, and at different points in history, people are more or less open to disclosing information about themselves. Even within a long-term relationship, partners do not always share with one another on a deep level. Thus, although lovers and best friends may be the \"likely\" recipients of confidences, they are rarely the only ones. Individuals also confide in their consequential strangers, particularly those near the intimate end of the continuum. Studies have shown, for example, that this happens frequently with certain professionals—among them, hairdressers and divorce lawyers. Likewise, gym buddies and frequent patrons at diners often share confidences with one another. In part it's the regularity of contact, in part the place itself. Under certain conditions, Zick Rubin found that people even share with complete strangers, a paradox known as the \"stranger on a train\" phenomenon.\n\nNumerous studies underscore the importance of intimate relationships—and nothing in the conceptualization of consequential strangers disputes this. However, weak ties can be similar to, different from, and supportive of close relations. Indeed, consequential strangers can provide many of the same benefits to individuals as do close relationships: companionship, a sense of belonging, and emotional support, particularly in times of crisis or emergency.\n\nBecause relationships mirror different aspects of the self, both weak and strong ties contribute to an individual’s sense of identity. In some situations, consequential strangers may allow distinct facets of identity to emerge. For example, women over fifty who join the Red Hat Society tend to express aspects of themselves in the company of other \"Hatters\" that would surprise members of their families.\n\nResearch also suggests that one can develop a greater sense of agency and mastery by stepping into multiple roles. Being with one’s poker buddies requires a different skill set than volunteering at the local hospital or conducting a meeting at work. And because of the lack of familiarity in these various situations, it is necessary to communicate in more \"elaborated\" patterns of speech with consequential strangers than with loved ones. Relating to assorted others forces an individual to \"negotiate, exercise judgment, reconcile, compromise, and take account of the intentions, purposes, motivations, and perspective\" of his or her assorted role partners.\"\n\nWeak ties also provide benefits not available in close ties: information, resources, and novelty, as well as a sense of being \"known\" in the larger community. Consequential strangers often act as \"bridges\" to new people and groups. Through them, an individual is exposed to ideas, cultures, life strategies, and diversions that are beyond the scope of their loved ones' knowledge and experience.\n\nCasual connections provide fodder for social comparison—a psychological process in which one regards another’s circumstances and feels better or worse off. In certain situations, downward comparison (feeling better than) may contribute to self-esteem. One study found that college students tend to view friends as comparable to themselves, but make downward comparisons with acquaintances. Viewing oneself as better than a close partner might jeopardize the relationships.\n\nConsequential strangers can also support intimate ties, especially in the family. In a given day, parents deal with child care providers, teachers, coaches, and other parents who can offer tangible aid, such as car pools, information about school policies, as well as emotional support to the family.\nMany peripheral relationships are satisfying, although some are also the cause of daily hassles. When a weak tie is bothersome, one can often walk away. However, there are certain consequential strangers from whom escape is impossible—a coworker, neighbor, or teacher that rankles.\n\nAnother study suggests that lying may be more frequent between consequential strangers than between intimates. Gossip, particularly among a closed system of colleagues or neighbors, spreads quickly among weak ties as well.\n\nAggression in the workplace—an arena filled mostly with consequential strangers rather than close friends—is also well documented. Researchers have even linked increases in blood pressure to the experience of working for an unfavorable supervisor. A vast literature regarding work and family further suggests that difficulties with co-workers can reverberate at home in the form of anger or withdrawal.\n\nAnother way to view the impact of consequential strangers is by pulling the camera back from the individual to the entire network. Each individual travels through life in what was first conceptualized in the 1980s as a \"social convoy\"—an entourage of people that he or she has collected along the way. This assortment of personal ties is one type of social network.Some individuals are better or less equipped for life's challenges and crises, not merely because of their strength or socio-economic status, but also because of the composition of their convoys. Research indicates that the best convoys are composed of a combination of intimates and consequential strangers—people in the community, service providers, acquaintances one encounters in leisure and volunteer activities.\n\nThe perspective of the convoy enables a different view of one's life: \"not as a string of events but as a cavalcade of people.\" Running into an old college roommate or a former employer allows an individual to revisit the past with the perspective of the present. Some close relations are part of the convoy from birth to death (parents, children), or for large portions of the journey (partners, close friends), while others (former roommates, exes) drop by the wayside. However, consequential strangers typically travel only part of the way, often for a specific function. For example, during a health crisis, medical personnel, members of support groups, and home aides might become part of an individual’s convoy for a time.\n\nThe nature of a convoy can impact well being. Epidemiological research, which has focused on both strong and weak ties, suggests that social isolation bodes badly for psychological and physiological health. In contrast, \"social integration\"—having a personal network of intimates and consequential strangers—may increase longevity and resistance to disease. For example, an ongoing series of \"viral challenge\" studies have been conducted over the last twenty years, in which subjects are quarantined and deliberately infected with a virus. Those who had contact in the prior two weeks with six or more types of relationships (based on their responses to a checklist of 12 relationship types, both weak and strong) are four times less likely to come down with a cold than volunteers who had three or fewer types of connections.\n\nA diverse social convoy is also more likely to deliver tangible and emotional support when needed. It is like having a personal \"grapevine,\" be it at work or in the community, that allows one to keep current, to find the best service provider, and to gain access to different types of resources by being a \"bridge\" between different groups. One sociologist theorizes that knowing people in a wide range of professions, across all socio-economic levels, confers \"cultural capital,\" enabling an individual to talk widely on many subjects. In this way, a diverse convoy is like a \"liberal arts program, teaching a little of almost everything.\"\n\nSimilar benefits accrue to groups and institutions. The most innovative companies are those in which executives hire a diverse workforce and are open to input from all levels of employees, not just those at the top. They seek inspiration and encourage collaboration \"outside\" their own boundaries as well, in essence drawing from the widest possible range of consequential strangers. In a similar vein, marketing experts realize that tapping into broad social networks is an effective way to promote ideas and products. The success of social movements and political campaigns also depends on peripheral connections. For example, the youthful volunteers who participated in \"Freedom Summer,\" a massive education and voter registration initiative in 1964, were drawn into the civil rights movement by people in the community, friends of friends, teachers and preachers—in short, their consequential strangers. More recently, Barack Obama's successful bid for the Presidency in 2008 exemplified a similar phenomenon, aided and accelerated by technology.\n\n"}
{"id": "8798086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8798086", "title": "De (Chinese)", "text": "De (Chinese)\n\nDe (; ) is a key concept in Chinese philosophy, usually translated \"inherent character; inner power; integrity\" in Taoism, \"moral character; virtue; morality\" in Confucianism and other contexts, and \"quality; virtue\" (\"guna\") or \"merit; virtuous deeds\" (\"punya\") in Chinese Buddhism.\n\nChinese \"de\" 德 is an ancient and linguistically complex word. The following analyzes it in terms of semantics, graphics, and etymology.\n\nThe \"Hanyu Da Zidian\", defines twenty meanings for \"de\" 德, translatable as\nThis dictionary provides early usage examples, and all of these \"de\" meanings occur in Han or pre-Han Chinese classic texts, except for number 17 (\"de\" abbreviating \"Deutschland\").\n\nTranslating \"de\" into English is problematic and controversial. Arthur Waley believed that \"de\" was better translated \"power\" than \"virtue\", and explained with a \"bank of fortune\" metaphor.\nIt is usually translated 'virtue', and this often seems to work quite well; though where the word occurs in early, pre-moralistic texts such a translation is in reality quite false. But if we study the usage of the word carefully we find that \"de\" can be bad as well as good. What is a 'bad virtue'? Clearly 'virtue' is not a satisfactory equivalent. Indeed on examining the history of the word we find that it means something much more like the Indian \"karma\", save that the fruits of \"te\" are generally manifested here and now; whereas \"karma\" is bound up with a theory of transmigration, and its effects are usually not seen in this life, but in a subsequent incarnation. \"Te\" is anything that happens to one or that one does of a kind indicating that, as a consequence, one is going to meet with good or bad luck. It means, so to speak, the stock of credit (or the deficit) that at any given moment a man has at the bank of fortune. Such a stock is of course built up partly by the correct carrying out of ritual; but primarily by securing favourable omens; for unless the omens are favourable, no rite can be carried out at all. (1958:31)\nBased on the cognate relation between \"de\" and \"zhi\" \"to plant\", Waley further noted the early Chinese regarded planting seeds as a \"de\", hence it \"means a latent power, a 'virtue' inherent in something.\"\n\nThe linguist Peter A. Boodberg investigated the semantics and etymology of \"de\" 德, which he called \"perhaps the most significant word, next to \"tao\" 道, in ancient Chinese macro- and microcosmology.\"\n\nThe standard translation for it is \"virtue,\" both in the sense of inherent quality and in that of moral excellence, but with the validity of the traditional rendering somewhat shaken by Arthur Waley's insistence on interpreting it as \"power.\" Indeed, it is believed by many scholars that the term originated in the mytho-magical period of Chinese speculation when \"tê\" was conceived as a kind of \"mana\"-like potency inherent in substances, things, and human beings, a potency which, on the one hand, made them true to their essence, and on the other, made possible their influencing of other entities. It appears often as if it had been imagined as a kind of electric charge permeating the thing in question, waxing or waning in accordance with some mysterious law, and capable of being transmitted, in the case of living beings, from one generation to another. Contrary-minded students of ancient Chinese philosophy dispute this interpretation as rather narrow and possibly anachronistic, and point to the fact that \"tê\" had early acquired, at least in Confucian literature, ethical connotations close to our \"virtue,\" that is, as moral, and only rarely amoral or immoral, efficacy. They find, therefore, no quarrel with rendering \"tê\", almost invariably, as \"virtue.\" Philologists are, however, troubled by the absence in the Chinese term of any connotations reminiscent of the Latin etymon \"vir\", such as manliness and virility. They remind us that \"tê\" is free from any contamination with sexual associations and differs in that from its great counterpart, \"tao\", the Way, which, in one or two expressions, such as \"jên tao\" 人道, \"the way of men and women,\" is suggestive of sexual activity. Other recommended translation, such as \"energy\" and \"essential quality,\" seem also inadequate from the etymological point of view. (1979:32) \n\nVictor Mair explains that the difficulty of accurately translating \"de\",\nMair (1990:135) concludes that Daoist \"de\" is best translated \"integrity\", which \"means no more than the wholeness or completeness of a given entity,\" and like \"de\", \"it represents the selfhood of every being in the universe.\"\n\n\"De\" \"power; virtue\" is written with the Chinese character in both Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese. This character 德 combines the \"chi\" 彳 \"footstep; go\" radical (recurring graphic elements that suggest meaning) with \"zhi\" 直 \"straight; vertical\" and \"xin\" 心 \"heart; mind\". \"De\" 德 has rare variant characters of (without the horizontal 一 line) and or (without the 彳 \"footstep\" radical).\n\nThe earliest written forms of \"de\" 德 are oracle script from the Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE) and bronzeware script and seal script from the Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE). Oracle characters wrote \"de\" 德 with 彳\"footstep; go\" and 直 \"straight\", later bronze characters added the 心 \"heart; mind\" element. The oracle script for \"zhi\" 直 \"straight; vertical\" ideographically depicted \"shu\" 丨\"vertical line (in a character)\" above \"mu\" 目 \"eye\", the bronze script elaborated the line into \"shi\" 十 \"ten\"', and the seal script separated the eye and heart with a horizontal line.\n\nBoodberg (1979:33-4) undertook a \"graphophonetic analysis\" of \"de\". Based on the phonetic element \"zhi\" 直 \"upright; erect\" and the radical 行 suggesting movement, he translates \"de\" as English \"arrect\" \"set upright; direct upward\" (from Latin \"ad-\" \"to\") or \"insititious\" \"ingrafted; inserted\" potency (from Latin \"insitio\" \"to implant; to graft\"). Interpreting the 心 \"heart; mind\" to connote \"innerness\", he takes the prefix from Latin \"indoles\" \"innate quality; natural disposition\" to further neologize \"indarrect\". Boodberg concludes that the noun \"de\" is best translated \"enrective\" in the passive sense of power, or \"arrective\" in the active sense of influencing others. He says the Chinese understood \"de\" as potent but not coercive, and as arrective rather than corrective. Since early texts describe \"de\" 德 as an acquired quality, he proposes it is a paronym of \"de\" 得 \"to acquire; to obtain\", which is a common definition of \"de\" \"power; virtue\". Lastly, he notes a possible etymology of \"see straight; looking straight at things; intuition\" because early \"zhi\" 直 graphs depicted a straight line over an 目 \"eye\" (horizontally written 罒 in 德).\n\nVictor H. Mair proposes a Proto-Indo-European etymology for \"de\".\n\nAccording to Axel Schuessler's new etymological dictionary of Old Chinese (2007:208), \"de\" < *\"tək\" 德 \"moral force, virtue, character; quality, nature\" is probably in the same word family as \"de\" < *\"tək\" 得 \"to get\" and perhaps \"zhi\" < *\"drək\" 直 \"straight; right\". It quotes the proposal of Edwin G. Pulleyblank that \"de\" 德 and \"de\" 得 are cognate with Tibetan language \"thub\" \"a mighty one, one having power and authority\".\n\nClassic texts of philosophical Daoism frequently refer to \"de\".\n\n\"De\" (德) is a keyword in the \"Daodejing\" where it occurs 44 times, compared to 76 occurrences of \"dao\". The title refers to a textual division between the \"Daojing\" (chapters 1-37, since 1 begins with \"dao\": \"The Way that can be told\") and the \"Dejing\" (chapters 38-81, since 38 begins with \"de\": \"The man of highest \"power\", see below). The (relatively) modern compound word \"daode\" (道德) means \"morality, ethical principles, ethics, moral philosophy\". Two common \"de\" themes are its connection with the \"dao\" and its usefulness in managing people. (Note that \"de\" is \"power\" in the following translations by Arthur Waley.)\n\nThe first \"Daojing\" theme is the interrelationship between \"de\" and \"dao\". \"Such the scope of the All-pervading Power. That it alone can act through the Way.\" (21, tr. Waley). The so-called \"\"De\" Chapter\" has the greatest number of occurrences.\nThe man of highest \"power\" does not reveal himself as a possessor of \"power\";\nTherefore he keeps his \"power\".\nThe man of inferior \"power\" cannot rid it of the appearance of \"power\";\nTherefore he is in truth without \"power\".\nThe man of highest \"power\" neither acts nor is there any who so regards him; The man of inferior \"power\" both acts and is so regarded.\nThe man of highest humanity, though he acts, is not regarded;\nWhereas a man of even the highest morality both acts and is so regarded;\nWhile even he who is best versed in ritual not merely acts, but if people fail to respond\nThen he will pull up his sleeves and advance upon them. That is why it is said:\n\"After Tao was lost, then came the 'power';\nAfter the 'power' was lost, then came human kindness.\"\nAfter human kindness was lost, then came morality,\nAfter morality was lost, then came ritual. (38, tr. Waley)\nHere is another example.\nTruly, if one uses the Way as one's instrument, the results will be like the Way; if one uses the \"power\" as instrument, the results will be like the \"power\". If one uses what is the reverse of the \"power\", the results will be the reverse of the \"power\".\n\nFor to those who have conformed themselves to the Way, the Way readily lends its power. To those who have conformed themselves to the power, the power readily, lends more power. While to those who conform themselves to inefficacy, inefficacy readily lends its ineffectiveness. (23, tr. Waley)\nCompare this third example.\nTao gave them birth;\nThe \"power\" of Tao reared them,\nShaped them according to their kinds,\nPerfected them, giving to each its strength.\nTherefore of the ten thousand things there is not one that does not worship Tao and do homage to its \"power\". No mandate ever went forth that accorded to Tao the right to be worshipped, nor to its \"power\" the right to be worshipped, nor to its \"power\" the right to receive homage.\nIt was always and of itself so.\nTherefore as Tao bore them and the \"power\" of Tao reared them, made them grow, fostered them, harboured them, brewed for them, so you must,\nRear them, but not lay claim to them,\nControl them, but never lean upon them,\nBe chief among them, but not manage them.\nThis is called the \"mysterious power.\" (51, tr. Waley)\nChapters 10 and 65 also use this \"xuande\" (玄德 \"dark/mysterious \"de\"\") phrase.\n\nThe second \"Daodejing\" theme is the efficacy of \"de\" for statesmanship (see meanings 6 and 7 above). A sage ruler can acquire sufficient \"de\" to influence his subjects through, in effect, \"wu wei\" government.\nYou cannot rule men nor serve heaven unless you have laid up a store;\nThis \"laying up a store\" means quickly absorbing,\nAnd \"quickly absorbing\" means doubling one's garnered \"power\".\nDouble your garnered power and it acquires a strength that nothing can overcome.\nIf there is nothing it cannot overcome, it know no bounds,\nAnd only what knows no bounds is huge enough to keep a whole kingdom in its grasp. (59, tr. Waley) \nCompare this description of using one's accumulated \"de\" to affect others.\nThe best charioteers do not rush ahead;\nThe best fighters do not make displays of wrath.\nThe greatest conqueror wins without joining issue;\nThe best user of men acts as though he were their inferior.\nThis is called the power that comes of not contending,\nIs called the capacity to use men,\nThe secret of being mated to heaven, to what was of old. (68, tr. Waley) \n\nMair interprets these \"de\" occurrences.\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" uses \"de\" 191 times. Many contexts praise Daoist \"integrity; inner power\", some mock Confucianist and Mohist \"virtue\", and others make \"de\" wordplays. One of the chapter titles is \"De chong fu\" (5, 德充符, \"The Sign of Complete Virtue\").\n\nSeveral of the \"Zhuangzi\" translators (listed here) explain the difficulties of rendering \"de\" into English. Frederic H. Balfour (1881:xxxvii) succinctly glosses \"de\" with Greek and Chinese.\n德. In ethics, Virtue — \"ἀρετή\" [\"areté\" \"excellence\"]; in physics, Energy — \" δύναμις\" [\"dunamis\" \"potential power; force\"]. 道 [\"The Tao\"] is the 體 [\"body; embodiment\"] of which 德 is the 用 [\"use; function\"]. \nJames Legge (1891:81) gives this footnote to the \"\"De\" Chapter\".\n論德, 'About the Attributes;' of Tâo, that is. It is not easy to render teh here by any other English term than 'virtue,' and yet there would be a danger of its thus misleading us in the interpretations of the chapter.\nThe 'virtue,' is the activity or operation of the Tâo, which is supposed to have come out of its absoluteness. Even Han Fei so defines it here, — 'Teh is the meritorious work of the Tâo.' \nFung Yu-lan (1938:8) cites two examples.\nNext, we come to the conception of \"Tê\", or virtue. Lao Tzŭ said:\n\"\"Tao\" produces a thing; \"Tê\" maintains it.\" – \"\"Tao Tê Ching\",\" \"51\". \nChuang Tzŭ said:\n\"That which things get in order to live is called \"Tê\".\" – \"Chapter XII\". \nSo \"Tê\" is what an individual thing receives from \"Tao\". The total spontaneity of all things is \"Tao\". The spontaneity that an individual thing receives from \"Tao\" is \"Tê\". As some commentator said, the relation between \"Tê\" and \"Tao\" is just like that between the water in river or lake, and water in general. \nBurton Watson (1968:25), whose translation will be cited below, describes the subtle connotations.\nIn nearly all cases I have rendered \"te\" as \"virtue\" except where it has the meaning of a favor or good deed done for someone, This word presents certain difficulties in Chuang Tzu. Sometimes he employs it to mean conventional virtue — that is, virtue in the Confucian or Mo-ist sense — in which case it has bad connotations; at other times he employs it in a good sense to mean the true virtue or vital power that belongs to the man of Tao. (Compare Waley's rendering of the title \"Tao-te-ching\" as \"The Way and Its Power\".) I prefer not to try to distinguish these two usages in the translation because I do not wish to impose upon the English a distinction that is not explicit in the original. The reader should keep in mind, incidentally, that the words \"virtue\" (\"te\") and \"gain\" or \"to get\" (\"te\") are homophones, and this fact is the basis of frequent puns and word plays — that is, the man of true Taoist virtue is one who, as we would say in English, has \"got it.\" \nVictor H. Mair (1994:383) differentiates \"Zhuangzi\"'s contextual usages of \"de\".\nIn Confucian or conventional contexts, \"te\" is translated as \"virtue.\" In Taoist or unconventional contexts, it is translated as \"integrity.\" The most etymologically precise equivalent in English is the archaic word \"dough[tiness].\" \n\n\"De\" was central in Daoist cosmology, and the \"Zhuangzi\" frequently explains it with \"dao\" \"the Way\" and \"tian\" \"heaven; god\". Chapter 12, \"Heaven and Earth\", has two good illustrations.\nIn the Great Beginning, there was nonbeing; there was no being, no name. Out of it arose One; there was One, but it had no form. Things got hold of it and came to life, and it was called Virtue. Before things had forms, they had their allotments; these were of many kinds, but not cut off from one another, and they were called fates. Out of the flow and flux, things were born, and as they grew they developed distinctive shapes; these were called forms. The forms and bodies held within them spirits, each with its own characteristics and limitations, and this was called the inborn nature. If the nature is trained, you may return to Virtue, and Virtue at its highest peak is identical with the Beginning. Being identical, you will be empty; being empty, you will be great. You may join in the cheeping and chirping and, when you have joined in the cheeping and chirping, you may join with Heaven and earth. Your joining is wild and confused, as though you were stupid, as though you were demented. This is called Dark Virtue. Rude and unwitting, you take part in the Great Submission. (12, tr. Watson 1968:131-2) \n\nPervading Heaven and earth: that is the Way. Moving among the ten thousand things: that is Virtue. Superiors governing the men below them: that is called administration. Ability finding trained expression: that is called skill. Skill is subsumed in administration; administration in duty; duty in Virtue; Virtue in the Way; and the Way in Heaven. Therefore it is said, those who shepherded the world in ancient times were without desire and the world was satisfied, without action and the ten thousand things were transformed. They were deep and silent and the hundred clans were at rest. The Record says: \"Stick to the One and the ten thousand tasks will be accomplished; achieve mindlessness and the gods and spirits will bow down.\" (12, tr. Watson 1968:126-7) \n\n\"Zhide\" (至德 \"perfect/ultimate \"de\"\") occurs seven times (see the punning proverb quoted below). For instance,\nWhen a man has perfect virtue, fire cannot burn him, water cannot drown him, cold and heat cannot afflict him, birds and beasts cannot injure him. I do not say that he makes light of these things. I mean that he distinguishes between safety and danger, contents himself with fortune or misfortune, and is cautious in his comings and goings. Therefore nothing can harm him.\n\n\"Hence it is said: the Heavenly is on the inside, the human is on the outside. Virtue resides in the Heavenly. Understand the actions of Heaven and man, base yourself upon Heaven, take your stand in virtue, and then, although you hasten or hold back, bend or stretch, you may return to the essential and speak of the ultimate.\" (17, tr. Watson 1968:182-3) \n\nThe people have their constant inborn nature. To weave for their clothing, to till for their food — this is the Virtue they share. They are one in it and not partisan, and it is called the Emancipation of Heaven. Therefore in a time of Perfect Virtue the gait of men is slow and ambling; their gaze is steady and mild. In such an age mountains have no paths or trails, lakes no boats or bridges. The ten thousand things live species by species, one group settled close to another. Birds and beasts form their flocks and herds, grass and trees grow to fullest height. So it happens that you can tie a cord to the birds and beasts and lead them about, or bend down the limb and peer into the nest of the crow and the magpie. In this age of Perfect Virtue men live the same as birds and beasts, group themselves side by side with the ten thousand things. Who then knows anything about \"gentleman\" or \"petty man\"? Dull and ununwitting, men have no wisdom; thus their Virtue does not depart from them. Dull and unwitting, they have no desire; this is called uncarved simplicity. In uncarved simplicity the people attain their true nature.\n\nThen along comes the sage, huffing and puffing after benevolence, reaching on tiptoe for righteousness, and the world for the first time has doubts; mooning and mouthing over his music, snipping and stitching away at his rites, and the world for the first time is divided. Thus, if the plain unwrought substance had not been blighted, how would there be any sacrificial goblets? If the white jade had not been shattered, how would there be any scepters and batons? If the Way and its Virtue had not been cast aside, how would there be any call for benevolence and righteousness? If the true form of the inborn nature had not been abandoned, how would there be any use for rites and music? If the five colors had not confused men, who would fashion patterns and hues? If the five notes had not confused them, who would try to tune things by the six tones? That the unwrought substance was blighted in order to fashion implements — this was the crime of the artisan. That the Way and its Virtue were destroyed in order to create benevolence and righteousness — this was the fault of the sage. (9, tr. Watson 1968:105-6) \n\nThis parable blaming sages for losing the primordial \"dao\" and \"de\" has several \"Zhuangzi\" parallels. Here are two.\nSo it is said, With the sage, his life is the working of Heaven, his death the transformation of things. In stillness, he and the yin share a single Virtue; in motion, he and the yang share a single flow. He is not the bearer of good fortune, nor the initiator of bad fortune. Roused by something outside himself, only then does he respond; pressed, only then does he move; finding he has no choice, only then does he rise up. He discards knowledge and purpose and follows along with the reasonableness of Heaven. Therefore he incurs no disaster from Heaven, no entanglement from things, no opposition from man, no blame from the spirits. His life is a floating, his death a rest. He does not ponder or scheme, does not plot for the future. A man of light, he does not shine; of good faith, he keeps no promises. He sleeps without dreaming, wakes without worry. His spirit is pure and clean, his soul never wearied. In emptiness, nonbeing, and limpidity, he joins with the Virtue of Heaven.\n\nSo it is said, Grief and happiness are perversions of Virtue; joy and anger are transgressions of the Way; love and hate are offenses against Virtue. When the mind is without care or joy, this is the height of Virtue. When it is unified and unchanging, this is the height of stillness. When it grates against nothing, this is the height of emptiness. When it has no commerce with things, this is the height of limpidity. When it rebels against nothing, this is the height of purity. (15, tr. Watson 1968:168-9) \n\nThe Yellow Emperor said, \"Do-Nothing-Say‑Nothing — he's the one who is truly right. Wild-and-Witless appears to be so. But you and I in the end are nowhere near it. Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Therefore the sage practices the teaching that has no words. The Way cannot be brought to light; its virtue cannot be forced to come. But benevolence — you can put that into practice; you can discourse on righteousness, you can dupe one another with rites. So it is said, When the Way was lost, then there was virtue; when virtue was lost, then there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost, then there was righteousness; when righteousness was lost, then there were rites. Rites are the frills of the Way and the forerunners of disorder. So it is said, He who practices the Way does less every day, does less and goes on doing less, until he reaches the point where he does nothing, does nothing and yet there is nothing that is not done.\" Now that we've already become 'things,' if we want to return again to the Root, I'm afraid we'll have a hard time of it! The Great Man — he's the only one who might find it easy. (22, tr. Watson 1968:235) \nThis theme of sagely rulers using the powers of \"de\" recurs in the \"Heaven and Earth\" chapter.\nHeaven and Earth are huge, but they are alike in their transformations. The ten thousand things are numerous, but they are one in their good order. Human beings are many, but they are all subjects of the sovereign. The sovereign finds his source in Virtue, his completion in Heaven. Therefore it is said that the sovereign of dark antiquity ruled the world through inaction, through Heavenly Virtue and nothing more. (12, tr. Watson 1968:126) \n\nThe man of kingly Virtue moves in simplicity and is ashamed to be a master of facts. He takes his stand in the original source and his understanding extends to the spirits. Therefore his Virtue is far‑reaching. His mind moves forth only when some external thing has roused it. Without the Way the body can have no life, and without Virtue, life can have no clarity. To preserve the body and live out life, to establish Virtue and make clear the Way — is this not kingly Virtue? Broad and boundless, suddenly he emerges, abruptly he moves, and the ten thousand things follow him — this is what is called the man of kingly Virtue. (12, tr. Watson 1968:128) \n\nOne of the Inner Chapters has a dialogue between Confucius and Duke Ai of Lu (r. 494-468 BCE). The Duke describes meeting a hunchback named Ai Taito, who was famously ugly and charismatic, and asks about his incredible popularity, which the Master attributes to formless and water-like \"de\".\nConfucius said, \"I once went on a mission to Ch'u, and as I was going along, I saw some little pigs nursing at the body of their dead mother. After a while, they gave a start and all ran away and left her, because they could no longer see their likeness in her; she was not the same as she had been before. In loving their mother, they loved not her body but the thing that moved her body. When a man has been killed in battle and people come to bury him, he has no use for his medals. When a man has had his feet amputated, he doesn't care much about shoes. For both, the thing that is basic no longer exists. When women are selected to be consorts of the Son of Heaven, their nails are not pared and their ears are not pierced. When a man has just taken a wife, he is kept in posts outside [the palace] and is no longer sent on [dangerous] missions. If so much care is taken to keep the body whole, how much more in the case of a man whose virtue is whole? Now Ai T'ai‑t'o says nothing and is trusted, accomplishes nothing and is loved, so that people want to turn over their states to him and are only afraid he won't accept. It must be that his powers are whole, though his virtue takes no form.\"\n\n\"What do you mean when you say his powers are whole?\" asked Duke Ai.\n\nConfucius said, \"Life, death, preservation, loss, failure, success, poverty, riches, worthiness, unworthiness, slander, fame, hunger, thirst, cold, heat — these are the alternations of the world, the workings of fate. Day and night they change place before us and wisdom cannot spy out their source. Therefore, they should not be enough to destroy your harmony; they should not be allowed to enter the Spirit Storehouse. If you can harmonize and delight in them, master them and never be at a loss for joy, if you can do this day and night without break and make it be spring with everything, mingling with all and creating the moment within your own mind — this is what I call being whole in power.\"\n\n\"What do you mean when you say his virtue takes no form?\"\n\n\"Among level things, water at rest is the most perfect, and therefore it can serve as a standard. It guards what is inside and shows no movement outside. Virtue is the establishment of perfect harmony. Though virtue takes no form, things cannot break away from it.\" (5, tr. Watson 1968:73-74) \n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" is famous for wordplay and witticism. Several passages make puns between \"de\" \"obtain\" and \"de\" \"integrity; virtue\" (see Watson 1968:183, 214). The \"Autumn Floods\" chapter quotes a \"perfect \"de\" does not \"de\"\" (至德不得) proverb; \"I have heard it said, 'The Man of the Way wins no fame, the highest virtue wins no gain, the Great Man has no self.' To the most perfect degree, he goes along with what has been allotted to him.\" (17, tr. Watson 1968:178-9). \"De\" derogatorily means \"virtue; morality\" in some contexts mocking the Confucians, Mohists, and School of Names. For instance, this derision of their sophistry: \"There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates, there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations, and there are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues.\" (2, tr. Watson 1968:44). Translating the witty words of \"Zhuangzi\" can be highly complex. A final instance mentions five types of \"xiongde\" (凶德 \"bad/fiendish/terrible \"de\"\"), but only lists the first one \"zhongde\" (中德 \"center/middle \"de\"\"). Compare these \"de\" translations by Watson (\"virtue\") and Mair (\"integrity\").\nThere is no greater evil than for the mind to be aware of virtue, and to act as though it were a pair of eyes. For when it starts acting like a pair of eyes, it will peer out from within, and when it peers out from within, it is ruined. There are five types of dangerous virtue, of which inner virtue is the worst. What do I mean by inner virtue? He who possesses inner virtue will think himself always in the right, and denigrate those who do not do as he does. (32, tr. Watson 1968:359) \nThere is no greater affliction than for integrity to be possessed by the mind and for the mind to be possessed by its eye. Once ruled by the mind's eye, a person looks inward, and when she looks inward she is defeated. There are five types of malevolent integrity and the chief among them is egocentric integrity. What is meant by \"egocentric integrity\"? She who has egocentric integrity is possessed by self-love and ridicules whatever she does not do herself. (tr. Mair 1994:330) \n\nThe word \"bade\" 八德 \"eight virtues/powers\" first appears in the \"Discussion on Making All Things Equal\" chapter. Although many \"Zhuangzi\" commentators and translators try to give \"de\" \"some special meaning other than its ordinary one of \"virtue\" in this context\", notes Watson, \"I believe Chuang Tzu is deliberately parodying the ethical categories of the Confucians and Mo-ists.\"\nThe Way has never known boundaries; speech has no constancy. But because of [the recognition of a] \"this,\" there came to be boundaries. Let me tell you what the boundaries are. There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates, there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations, and there are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues. (2, tr. Watson 1968:43-44) \nLater Confucianists misread this Daoist context and moralistically interpreted \"bade\" as \"xiao\" 孝 \"filial piety\", \"di\" 悌 \"sibling piety\", \"zhong\" 忠 \"loyalty; fidelity\", \"xin\" 信 \"trust; believe\", \"li\" 禮 \"ritual; rites; courtesy\", \"yi\" 義 \"righteousness; right conduct\", \"lian\" 廉 \"upright; honorable; integrity\", and \"zhi\" 恥 \"humility; shame\".\n\nThe Four Books of Confucianism give some insightful explanations of \"de\" \"virtue\". Note that the following quotations cite Charles Muller's scholarly translations of the \"Analects\", \"Doctrine of the Mean\", \"Great Learning\", and \"Mencius\". The more familiar translations of James Legge render \"ren\" \"humaneness; human-heartedness\" as \"perfect virtue\", which occasionally creates confusion with \"de\" as \"virtue\". Compare their translations of these two \"Analects\" passages.\nYen Yüan asked about [仁] perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" (12:1, tr. Legge) \nYen Yüan asked about the meaning of [仁] humaneness. The Master said, \"To completely overcome selfishness and keep to propriety is humaneness. If for a full day you can overcome selfishness and keep to propriety, everyone in the world will return to humaneness. Does humaneness come from oneself, or from others?\" (12:1, tr. Muller) \nThe Master said, \"Let the will be set on the path of duty. Let [德] every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. Let [仁] perfect virtue be accorded with. Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.\" (7:6, tr. Legge) \nConfucius said: \"Set your aspirations on the Tao, hold to [德] virtue, rely on your [仁] humaneness, and relax in the study of the arts.\" (7:6, tr. Muller) \n\n\"De\" occurs 40 times in the Confucian \"Lunyu\" or \"Analects\". While Confucius extolled \"de\" \"virtue; morality\" — \"If you are virtuous, you will not be lonely. You will always have friends.\" (4:25) — he frequently criticized his contemporaries for having lost it. He described \"de\" as something that one can augment, and praised sage kings who governed through its compelling powers.\n\nConfucius claimed that the rulers of ancient China had \"zhide\" \"perfect/ultimate \"de\"\" (see above). The two examples below mention the legendary Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun, King Wu, the founder of the Zhou Dynasty, and Tai Bo, who ceded the throne to his nephew King Wen.\nConfucius said: \"T'ai Po can be said to have had a [至德] perfected level of virtue. He declined the rule of the kingdom three times, without the people knowing about it.\" (8:1) \nShun, with five ministers, was able to successfully govern the empire. King Wu said, \"Altogether I have ten ministers.\" Confucius said, \"Their ability is the issue. Don't you think so? When the T'ang [Shang] and Wu [Zhou] dynasties combined, they had as many ministers as you, with a woman and nine men. King Wen (of the Chou) controlled two-thirds of the empire, and with this, served the Yin. Indeed, the [德] virtue of Chou can be called the [至德] epitome of virtue!\" (8:20) \n\nGood government is a central \"Analects\" topic, and the following citations illustrate the importance of \"de\" for rulers and officials.\nConfucius said: \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\" (2:1) \nConfucius said: \"If you govern the people legalistically and control them by punishment, they will avoid crime, but have no personal sense of shame. If you govern them by means of virtue and control them with propriety, they will gain their own sense of shame, and thus correct themselves.\" (2:3) \nConfucius said: \"The Superior Man cares about virtue; the inferior man cares about material things. The Superior Man seeks discipline; the inferior man seeks favors.\" (4:11) \nSomeone said: \"What do you think of the saying: 'Repay harm with virtue'?\" Confucius replied, \"Then how will you repay virtue? Repay harm with Justice and repay virtue with virtue.\" (14:36) \nChi K'ang Tzu asked Confucius about government saying: \"Suppose I were to kill the unjust, in order to advance the just. Would that be all right?\" Confucius replied: \"In doing government, what is the need of killing? If you desire good, the people will be good. The nature of the Superior Man is like the wind, the nature of the inferior man is like the grass. When the wind blows over the grass, it always bends.\" (12:19) \nIn this wind and grass simile, \"de\" clearly does not mean moral \"virtue\", but something like \"nature; character\". Compare these two semantically similar usages.\nConfucius said: \"Heaven gave birth to the virtue within me. What can Huan T'ui [who wanted to kill Confucius] do to me?\" (7:22) \nConfucius said: \"The Southerners have a saying: 'If a man is not constant in his self-cultivation, he cannot be a shaman or a healer.' It is a good proverb. If you are not consistently developing your virtue, what can you give to others? You will not even be able to give a diagnosis.\" (13:22) \n\nConfucius recurrently disparaged his Spring and Autumn period contemporaries for having diminished their natural \"de\" virtue. One notably ironic \"Analects\" passage accuses the Master himself of having lost it.\nChieh Yu, the madman of Ch'u, passed by Confucius, singing: \"Phoenix! Phoenix! How your virtue has declined! Your past cannot be corrected, But your future is yet to come. Give up! Give up! Those who involve themselves in Government now Will be in danger.\" Confucius jumped down, wanting to talk to him, but he ran away, so Confucius couldn't talk to him. (18:5) \nHere are some Confucian quotations about the rarity of people who possessed true \"de\" \"virtue\".\nConfucius said: \"Yu, those who understand virtue are few and far between.\" (15:3) \nConfucius said: \"Even over a long period of time, there have been few people who have actualized the Mean into Manifest Virtue.\" (6:27) \nConfucius said: \"I have never seen one who loves virtue as much as he loves sex.\" (9:17, repeated in 14:12) \nConfucius said: \"The virtuous will certainly have something to say, but those who have something to say are not necessarily virtuous. The humane man is always brave, but the brave man is not necessarily possessed of humaneness.\" (14.5) \nConfucius said: \"Clever words disrupt virtue. Lack of patience in small matters leads to the disruption of great plans.\" (15:26) \nConfucius said: \"The 'conventional townsman' is a thief of virtue.\" (17:13, cf. Mencius 7B:37) \nConfucius said: \"To apprehend the Tao and lecture on it before actualization is to throw away your accumulation of virtue.\" (17:14) \nThis last quote implies that \"de\" can be accumulated, and Confucius was not completely pessimistic about virtue going astray. For example (14:6), he praised his disciple Nangong Kuo as \"a Superior Man, a man of enhanced virtue.\" These four contexts describe \"de\" as a measurable force that one can \"return,\" \"cultivate,\" \"extend,\" and \"heighten\".\nTseng Tzu said: \"When they are careful (about their parents) to the end and continue in reverence after (their parents) are long gone, the virtue of the people will return to its natural depth.\" (1:9) \nConfucius said: \"Having virtue and not cultivating it; studying and not sifting; hearing what is just and not following; not being able to change wrongdoing: these are the things that make me uncomfortable.\" (7:3) \nTzu Chang said: \"Keeping one's virtue without extending it; trusting the Tao without enriching it. What can you gain? And what can you get rid of?\" (19:2) \nFan Chih, while strolling with the Master among the Rain Dance altars, said, \"May I ask how to heighten virtue, overcome wickedness and resolve delusion?\" The Master said, \"An excellent question! If you take care of your responsibilities before you seek your own gain, won't this heighten your virtue? If you attack your own evil rather than the evil of others, won't you overcome wickedness? If, because of a moment's anger, you endanger your own life, as well as that of your parents, is this not delusion?\" (12:21) \n\nThe \"Da Xue\" or \"Great Learning\" is an early Confucianist text that was transmitted as a \"Liji\" chapter. The brief main passage, which is attributed to Confucius, repeats the phrase \"ming mingde\" (明明德 \"brighten the bright \"de\"\"), which Legge translates \"illustrate illustrious virtue\".\nThe way of great learning consists in manifesting one's bright virtue, consists in loving the people, consists in stopping in perfect goodness. … The ancients who wanted to manifest their bright virtue to all in the world first governed well their own states. (tr. Muller) \n\nThe received \"Great Learning\" includes nine commentaries. The first one was supposedly written by Zeng Zi, a disciple of Confucius. It explains \"mingde\" by quoting three \"Shujing\" sections, an otherwise unknown bathtub inscription of King Tang of Shang, and a \"Shijing\" ode.\nIn the \"Announcement to K'ang\" it is said, \"He was able to [明德] manifest his virtue.\" The \"T'ai-chia\" says, \"He contemplated Heaven's unveiled mandate.\" The \"Canon of Yao\" says, \"he was able to [明峻德] manifest his lofty virtue.\" \n\nThe inscription of the bath of King T'ang said, \"If you renew yourself for one day, you can renew yourself daily, and continue to do so.\" In the \"Announcement of K'ang\" it says, \"carry out the renewal of the people.\" The \"Book of Odes\" says, \"Even though Chou was an ancient state, its mandate was sustained anew.\" Therefore there is nothing in which the Superior Man does not fully exert himself. (tr. Muller) \n\nThe \"Zhongyong\" or \"Doctrine of the Mean\", which like the \"Great Learning\" above was included in the \"Liji\", uses \"de\" 22 times.\n\nWhile Confucianist texts generally describe the \"de\" of humans, one passage portrays that of \"guishen\" (鬼神 \"ghosts and spirits; gods\").\nConfucius said: \"The overabundance of the [德] power of spiritual beings is truly amazing! Looking for them, they cannot be seen. Listening for them, they cannot be heard. There is nothing that they do not embody. They cause the people of the world to fast for purification, and wear beautiful clothes in order to participate at the sacrifices. They are overflowing, seeming to be above, seeming to be on the left and on the right. The \"Book of Odes\" says: 'Trying to investigate the spirits, we cannot reach them. How could we possibly grasp them with our thoughts?' The manifestation of the subtle and the inconcealability of sincerity is like this.\"(16, tr. Muller) \nNote how the \"Doctrine of the Mean\" attributes almost mystical powers to \"cheng\" (誠 \"sincerity; truth; honesty\").\nSincerity is just 'perfecting' and the Way is just 'following.' Sincerity is the beginning and end of all things. Without sincerity there is nothing. Thus the Superior Man values the process of \"becoming-sincere.\" But sincerity is not \"just-perfecting\"; it also means \"perfecting all things.\" To perfect yourself, you need \"jen\". To perfect others, you need wisdom. The [德] virtue of our nature is that it is none other than the Way by which inner and outer are merged. Thus we can always use it to set things right. (25, tr. Muller) \n\nOnly that person who has fully actualized sincerity is able to adjust the strings of the Great Net of the World; is able to establish himself in the Great Root of the World; is able to understand the transformations and the nurturing of Heaven and Earth. So sincere is his \"jen\"; so unfathomable is his depth; so vast is his spaciousness. Who is able to understand this, but one who has the firm, acute, luminous sagely intelligence – who is permeated with [天德] Heavenly Virtue? (32, tr. Muller) \n\nTwo passages use the compound \"dade\" (大德 \"big/great \"de\").\nWhat a good son was Shun (the sage emperor)! His [德] virtue was that of a sage, he was venerated as an emperor. His wealth included everything within the Four Seas. He is sacrificed to in the ancestral temple, and his sons and grandsons have preserved his name. Therefore we can say that the [大德] greatly virtuous always attain their appropriate position, always receive their proper reward, always get their recognition and are always long-lived. (17, tr. Muller) \n\nConfucius transmitted the legacy of (sage-emperors) Yao and Shun and modeled his character on that of (sage-kings) Wen and Wu. He was ruled by the Heavenly seasons from above, and combined the Earth and Waters below. He was like Heaven and Earth, which have nothing they do not support, and nothing they do not cover. His function was like the revolution of the four seasons, the alternation of sun and moon. He nourishes the myriad things and they grow up together without harming each other, and they follow their courses simultaneously without interfering with each other. His [小德] smaller power is like the rivers and streams. His [大德] great power is seen in deep transformations. This is why Heaven and Earth are called \"great.\" (30, tr. Muller) \n\nThe \"Doctrine of the Mean\" also mentions the concept of \"zhide\" \"perfect \"de\"\".\nHow great is the Way of the sage! Superabundant, it develops all things, extending up to Heaven. How excellent it is! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of conduct; it waits for the right person and then functions. Hence it is said: \"If you do not [至德] perfect your virtue, the [至道] perfect Way cannot be actualized.\" Therefore the Superior Man esteems his [德] virtuous nature and follows the path of inquiry, extending himself in breadth and greatness, penetrating all subtleties, penetrating its height and brilliance, following the course of the actualization of the Mean. He reviews the old and learns the new, thickening his character through the valorization of propriety. (27, tr. Muller) \n\n\"De\" 德 \"virtue; character\" occurs 41 times in the \"Mengzi\" or \"Mencius\". Many occurrences are in quotations, for instance 6A6 and 6A17 quote \"Shijing\" odes 260 and 247. Mencius frequently quotes Confucius about \"de\"; 3A4 quotes the \"Lunyu\" 12:19 wind and grass metaphor, and 7B37 quotes 17:13 about \"Conventional townsmen are thieves of virtue.\" Three common \"de\" thematic usages are that wise rulers can utilize its powers, should employ people with \"de\", and should understand how it affects friendship.\n\nThe first and most frequent Mencian teaching is that a ruler should develop his \"de\" as a means of controlling people.\nThe king said: \"What kind of [德] qualities are necessary for real kingship?\" Mencius said: \"Take care of the people, and no one can oppose you.\" (1A7, tr. Muller) \n\nThere was king Wen, moreover, with all the virtue which belonged to him; and who did not die till he had reached a hundred years — and still his influence had not penetrated throughout the kingdom. (2A1, tr. Legge) \n\nMencius said, \"He who uses force as a pretense of Humaneness is the de-facto strongman among the princes. But such a strongman must have a large state in order to be effective. The man who uses his virtue to practice Humaneness is the true king. To be a real king you don't need an especially large territory. T'ang did it with only seventy li and King Wen did it with only one hundred li. When you use your power to force people into submission, they will never submit with their hearts; it is only because they don't have enough strength to resist. When people submit to virtue, they are happy from the bottom of their hearts, and they submit sincerely, the way the seventy disciples submitted to Confucius.\" (2A3, tr. Muller) \n\nMencius said, 'When right government prevails in the kingdom, princes of little virtue are submissive to those of great, and those of little worth to those of great. When bad government prevails in the kingdom, princes of small power are submissive to those of great, and the weak to the strong. Both these cases are the rule of Heaven. They who accord with Heaven are preserved, and they who rebel against Heaven perish. (4A7, tr. Legge) \n\nWan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say, \"When the disposal of the kingdom came to Yü, his virtue was inferior to that of Yâo and Shun, and he transmitted it not to the worthiest but to his son.\" Was it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it was not so. When Heaven gave the kingdom to the worthiest, it was given to the worthiest. When Heaven gave it to the son of the preceding sovereign, it was given to him. … 'In the case of a private individual obtaining the throne, there must be in him virtue equal to that of Shun or Yü; and moreover there must be the presenting of him to Heaven by the preceding sovereign. It was on this account that Confucius did not obtain the throne.' (5A6, tr. Legge) \n\nMencius said, 'The administration of government is not difficult — it lies in not offending the great families. He whom the great families affect, will be affected by the whole State; and he whom any one State affects, will be affected by the whole kingdom. When this is the case, such an [sic] one's virtue and teachings will spread over all within the four seas like the rush of water.' (4A6, tr. Legge) \n\n'Confucius said, \"The flowing progress of virtue is more rapid than the transmission of royal orders by stages and couriers.\"' (2A1, tr. Legge) \nNote how these last two examples describe rapidly flowing powers of \"de\".\n\nThe second related theme is that rulers should seek out and employ those individuals who have \"de\".\nIf a prince hates disgrace, the best course for him to pursue, is to esteem virtue and honour virtuous scholars, giving the worthiest among them places of dignity, and the able offices of trust. (2A2, tr. Legge) \n\nMencius said: \"Humaneness brings glory and non-Humaneness brings disgrace. So if you hate disgrace but still involve yourself in what is not Humaneness, it is like hating moisture and living in a basement. If you really hate it, you should honor virtue and respect the good. Install good men into positions of rank and give jobs to people of ability.\" (2A4, tr. Muller) \n\nTherefore a prince who is to accomplish great deeds will certainly have ministers whom he does not call to go to him. When he wishes to consult with them, he goes to them. The prince who does not honour the virtuous, and delight in their ways of doing, to this extent, is not worth having to do with. (2B7, tr. Legge 214) \n\nChien asked, \"How do you go about 'just being content'?\" Mencius said, \"If you value virtue and enjoy Rightness, you can be content. Hence the gentleman in dire straits does not lose his sense of Rightness, and when successful, does not lose the Path. Since he does not lose his sense of Rightness when in dire straits, the gentleman is able to keep a grasp on himself. Since he does not lose the Path when he becomes successful, the people are not disappointed in him.\" (7A9, tr. Muller) \n\nHsien-ch'iû Mang asked Mencius, saying, 'There is the saying, \"A scholar of complete virtue may not be employed as a minister by his sovereign, nor treated as a son by his father.\" … Mencius replied, 'No. These are not the words of a superior man. They are the sayings of an uncultivated person of the east of Qi.' (5A4, tr. Legge) \n\nA third theme in \"Mencius\" is the connection between \"de\" and friendship.\nWan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'I venture to ask the principles of friendship.' Mencius replied, 'Friendship should be maintained without any presumption on the ground of one's superior age, or station, or the circumstances of his relatives. Friendship with a man is friendship with his virtue, and does not admit of assumptions of superiority.' (5B12, tr. Legge) \n\nDuring the frequent interviews of the duke Mû with Tsze-sze, he one day said to him, \"Anciently, princes of a thousand chariots have yet been on terms of friendship with scholars — what do you think of such an intercourse?\" Tsze-sze was displeased, and said, \"The ancients have said, 'The scholar should be served:' how should they have merely said that he should be made a friend of?\" When Tsze-sze was thus displeased, did he not say within himself, — \"With regard to our stations, you are sovereign, and I am subject. How can I presume to be on terms of friendship with my sovereign! With regard to our virtue, you ought to make me your master. How can you be on terms of friendship with me?\" Thus, when a ruler of a thousand chariots sought to be on terms of friendship with a scholar, he could not obtain his wish — how much less could he call him to his presence!' (5B16, tr. Legge) \n\nOne final example of Confucian \"de\" usages is this context where the word has a markedly negative meaning, semantically opposed to moral \"virtue\".\nMencius said, 'Qiu acted as chief officer to the head of the Ji family, whose [德] evil ways he was unable to change, while he exacted from the people double the grain formerly paid.' (4A14, tr. Legge) \n\nSeveral Mawangdui (before 168 BCE) texts named \"Xingde\" 刑德 (\"Punishment and Virtue\") describe De as a mantic function related to the sexagenary cycle and the astronomical notion of the \"Nine Palaces\" ().\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2219115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219115", "title": "Deficits in attention, motor control and perception", "text": "Deficits in attention, motor control and perception\n\nDAMP—deficits in attention, motor control and perception—is a controversial psychiatric concept conceived by Christopher Gillberg.\n\nDAMP is similar to minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), a concept that was formulated in the 1960s. Both concepts are related to certain psychiatric conditions, such as hyperactivity. The concept of MBD was strongly criticized by Sir Michael Rutter [Gillberg, 2003, p. 904] and several other researchers, and this led to its abandonment in the 1980s. At the same time, research showed that something similar was needed. One alternative concept was ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Gillberg proposed another alternative: DAMP. Gillberg's concept was formulated in the early 1980s, and the term itself was introduced in a paper that Gillberg published in 1986 (see Gillberg [1986]). (DAMP is essentially MBD without the etiological assumptions.)\n\nThe concept of DAMP met with considerable criticism. For example, Sir Michael Rutter stated that the concept of DAMP (unlike ADHD) was \"muddled\" and \"lacks both internal coherence and external discriminative validity ... it has no demonstrated treatment or prognostic implications\"; he concluded that the concept should be abandoned. Another example is the criticism of Per-Anders Rydelius, Professor of Child Psychiatry at the Karolinska Institute, who argued that the definition of DAMP was too vague: \"the borderline between DAMP and conduct disorders [is] unclear ... the borderline between DAMP and ADHD [is] unclear\"; he concluded that \"the concept is in need of revision\". And in 2000, Eva Kärfve, a sociologist at the University of Lund, published a book which argued that Gillberg's work on DAMP should be rejected.\n\nPerhaps the strongest criticism of DAMP is that Gillberg and his co-workers in Gothenburg are almost the only people doing research on DAMP. Indeed, in a review of DAMP published by Gillberg in 2003, it was noted that there were only \"about 50\" research papers that had been published on DAMP and that the \"vast majority of these have either originated in the author's own clinical and research setting or have been supervised and/or co-authored by him\" [Gillberg, 2003, p. 904]. This is in contrast to ADHD, on which \"several thousand papers\" had been published [Gillberg, 2003, p. 905]. As far as clinical practice goes, DAMP has been primarily accepted only in Gillberg's native Sweden and in Denmark [Gillberg, 2003, p. 904], and even in those countries acceptance is mixed.\n\nIn 2003, Gillberg revised his definition of DAMP. The new definition is as follows:\n\nStrong criticism of DAMP, however, has continued. In particular, it has been observed that \"the validity and utility of DAMP will remain unclear until stronger evidence of the special status of the overlap between its constituent disorders is provided\".\n\nIn 2005, there was an hour-long television program broadcast on Swedish TV, questioning why Sweden, almost alone in the world, would accept the DAMP construct. The program featured critical commentary from Sir Michael Rutter. It also considered some of the controversies over Gillberg's Gothenburg study.\n\nThe concept of DAMP (deficits in attention, motor control, and perception) has been in clinical use in Scandinavia for about 20 years. DAMP is diagnosed on the basis of concomitant attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and developmental coordination disorder in children who do not have severe learning disability or cerebral palsy. In clinically severe form it affects about 1.5% of the general population of school age children; another few per cent are affected by more moderate variants. Boys are overrepresented; girls are currently probably underdiagnosed. There are many comorbid problems/overlapping conditions, including conduct disorder, depression/anxiety, and academic failure. There is a strong link with autism spectrum disorders in severe DAMP. Familial factors and pre- and perinatal risk factors account for much of the variance. Psychosocial risk factors appear to increase the risk of marked psychiatric abnormality in DAMP. Outcome in early adult age was psychosocially poor in one study in almost 60% of unmedicated cases. There are effective interventions available for many of the problems encountered in DAMP.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "601131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601131", "title": "Deflationary theory of truth", "text": "Deflationary theory of truth\n\nIn philosophy and logic, a deflationary theory of truth is one of a family of theories that all have in common the claim that assertions of predicate truth of a statement do not attribute a property called \"truth\" to such a statement.\n\nGottlob Frege was not the first philosopher or logician to note that predicating truth or existence does not express anything above and beyond the statement to which it is attributed. He noted:\n\nIt is worthy of notice that the sentence \"I smell the scent of violets\" has the same content as the sentence \"it is true that I smell the scent of violets\". So it seems, then, that nothing is added to the thought by my ascribing to it the property of truth. (Frege, G., 1918. \"Thoughts\", in his \"Logical Investigations\", Oxford: Blackwell, 1977)\nNevertheless, the first serious attempt at the formulation of a theory of truth which attempted to systematically define the truth predicate out of existence is attributable to F.P. Ramsey. Ramsey argued, against the prevailing currents of the times, that not only was it not necessary to construct a theory of truth on the foundation of a prior theory of meaning (or mental content) but that once a theory of content had been successfully formulated, it would become obvious that there was no further need for a theory of truth, since the truth predicate would be demonstrated to be redundant. Hence, his particular version of deflationism is commonly referred to as the \"redundancy theory\". Ramsey noted that in ordinary contexts in which we attribute truth to a proposition directly, as in \"It is true that Caesar was murdered\", the predicate \"is true\" does not seem to be doing any work. \"It is true that Caesar was murdered\" just means \"Caesar was murdered\" and \"It is false that Caesar was murdered\" just means that \"Caesar was not murdered\".\n\nRamsey recognized that the simple elimination of the truth-predicate from all statements in which it is used in ordinary language was not the way to go about attempting to construct a comprehensive theory of truth. For example, take the sentence \"Everything that John says is true\". This can be easily translated into the formal sentence with variables ranging over propositions \"For all P, if John says P, then P is true.\" But attempting to directly eliminate \"is true\" from this sentence, on the standard first-order interpretation of quantification in terms of objects, would result in the ungrammatical formulation \"For all P, if John says P, then P.\" It is ungrammatical because P must, in that case, be replaced by the name of an \"object\" and not a proposition. Ramsey's approach was to suggest that such sentences as \"He is always right\" could be expressed in terms of relations: \"For all \"a\", \"R\" and \"b\", if he asserts \"aRb\", then \"aRb\"\".\n\nRamsey also noticed that, although his paraphrasings and definitions could be easily rendered in logical symbolism, the more fundamental problem was that, in ordinary English, the elimination of the truth-predicate in a phrase such as \"Everything John says is true\" would result in something like \"If John says something, then \"that\"\". Ramsey attributed this to a defect in natural language, suggesting that such \"pro-sentences\" as \"that\" and \"what\" were being treated as if they were pronouns. This \"gives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which disappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism...\" According to Ramsey, it is only because natural languages lack, what he called, \"pro-sentences\" (expressions that stand in relation to sentences as pronouns stand to nouns) that the truth predicate cannot be defined away in all contexts.\n\nA.J. Ayer took Ramsey's idea one step further by declaring that the redundancy of the truth predicate implies that there is no such \"property\" as truth.\n\nThere are sentences...in which the word \"truth\" seems to stand for something real; and this leads the speculative philosopher to enquire what this \"something\" is. Naturally he fails to obtain a satisfactory answer, since his question is illegitimate. For our analysis has shown that the word \"truth\" does not stand for anything, in the way which such a question requires.\n\nThis extreme version of deflationism has often been called the \"disappearance theory\" or the \"no truth\" theory of truth and it is easy to understand why, since Ayer seems here to be claiming both that the \"predicate\" \"is true\" is redundant (and therefore unnecessary) and \"also\" that there is no such \"property\" as truth to speak of.\n\nPeter Strawson formulated a \"performative theory\" of truth in the 1950s. Like Ramsey, Strawson believed that there was no separate problem of truth apart from determining the semantic contents (or facts of the world) which give the words and sentences of language the meanings that they have. Once the questions of meaning and reference are resolved, there is no further question of truth. Strawson's view differs from Ramsey's, however, in that Strawson maintains that there is an important role for the expression \"is true\" : specifically, it has a \"performative\" role similar to \"I promise to clean the house\". In asserting that \"p\" is true, we not only assert that \"p\" but also perform the \"speech act\" of confirming the truth of a statement in a context. We signal our agreement or approbation of a previously uttered assertion or confirm some commonly held belief or imply that what we are asserting is likely to be accepted by others in the same context.\n\nSome years before Strawson developed his account of the sentences which include the truth-predicate as performative utterances, Alfred Tarski had developed his so-called semantic theory of truth. Tarski's basic goal was to provide a rigorously logical definition of the expression \"true sentence\" within a \"specific formal language\" and to clarify the fundamental conditions of \"material adequacy\" that would have to be met by any definition of the truth-predicate. If all such conditions were met, then it would be possible to avoid semantic paradoxes such as the liar paradox (i.e., \"This sentence is false.\") Tarski's material adequacy condition, or Convention T, is: a definition of truth for an object language implies all instances of the sentential form\n\nwhere \"S\" is replaced by a name of a sentence (in the object-language) and \"P\" is replaced by a translation of that sentence in the metalanguage. So, for example, \"\"La neve è bianca\" is true if and only if snow is white\" is a sentence which conforms to Convention T; the object-language is Italian and the metalanguage is English. The predicate \"\"true\" does not appear in the object language, so no sentence of the object language can directly or indirectly assert truth or falsity of itself. Tarski thus formulated a two-tiered scheme that avoids semantic paradoxes such as Russell's paradox.\n\nTarski formulated his definition of truth indirectly through a recursive definition of the satisfaction of sentential functions and then by defining truth in terms of satisfaction. An example of a sentential function is \"x\" defeated \"y\" in the 2004 US presidential elections\"; this function is said to be satisfied when we replace the variables \"x\" and \"y\" with the names of objects such that they stand in the relation denoted by \"defeated in the 2004 US presidential elections\" (in the case just mentioned, replacing \"x\" with \"George W. Bush\" and \"y\" with \"John Kerry\" would satisfy the function, resulting in a true sentence). In general, a, ..., a \"satisfy\" n-ary predicate φ(x. ..., x) if, and only if substitution of the names 'a', ..., 'a' for the variables of φ in the relevant order yields \"φ(a, ..., a)\", and φ(a, ..., a). Given a method for establishing the satisfaction (or not) of every atomic sentence of the form A(...x...), the usual rules for truth-functional connectives and quantifiers yield a definition for the satisfaction condition of all sentences of the object language. For instance, for any two sentences \"A\", \"B\", \"A\"&\"B\" is satisfied if and only if \"A\" and \"B\" are satisfied (where '&' stands for conjunction), for any sentence \"A\", ~\"A\" is satisfied if and only if \"A\" fails to be satisfied, and for any open sentence \"A\" where x is free in \"A\", (x)\"A\" is satisfied if and only if for every substitution of an item of the domain for x yielding \"A\"*, \"A\"* is satisfied. Whether any complex sentence is satisfied is seen to be determined by its structure. An interpretation is an assignment of denotation to all of the non-logical terms of the object language. A sentence \"A\" is true (under an interpretation \"I\") if and only if it is satisfied in \"I\".\n\nTarski thought of his theory as a species of correspondence theory of truth, not a deflationary theory.\n\nOn the basis of Tarski's semantic conception, W. V. O. Quine developed what eventually came to be called the \"disquotational theory\" of truth. Quine interpreted Tarski's theory as essentially deflationary. He accepted Tarski's treatment of sentences as the only truth-bearers. Consequently, Quine suggested that the truth-predicate could only be applied to sentences within individual languages. The basic principle of disquotationalism is that an attribution of truth to a sentence undoes the effects of the quotation marks that have been used to form sentences. Instead of (T) above then, Quine's reformulation would be something like the following \"Disquotation Schema\":\n\nDisquotationalists are able to explain the existence and usefulness of the truth predicate in such contexts of generalization as \"John believes everything that Mary says\" by asserting, with Quine, that we cannot dispense with the truth predicate in these contexts because the convenient expression of such generalization is precisely the role of the truth predicate in language. In the case of \"John believes everything that Mary says\", if we try to capture the content of John's beliefs, we would need to form an infinite conjunction such as the following:\n\nThe disquotation schema (DS), allows us to reformulate this as:\n\nSince \"x\" is equivalent to \"\"x\" is true\", for the disquotationalist, then the above infinite conjunctions are also equivalent. Consequently, we can form the generalization:\n\nSince we could not express this statement without a truth-predicate along the lines of those defined by deflationary theories, it is the role of the truth predicate in forming such generalizations that characterizes all that needs to be characterized about the concept of truth.\n\nGrover, Camp and Belnap developed a deflationary theory of truth called \"prosententialism\", which has since been defended by Robert Brandom.\n\nProsententialism asserts that there are prosentences which stand in for and derive their meanings from the sentences which they substitute. In the statement:\n\nthe pronoun \"he\" takes its reference from the noun \"Bill.\" By analogy, in the statement:\n\nthe clause \"this is how things were\" receives its reference from the previously occurring sentential clause \"he was in financial straits\", according to a prosententialist account.\n\nHow does this relate to truth? Prosententialists view the statements that contain \"is true\" as sentences which do not contain a truth-predicate but rather contain \"some\" form of prosentence; the truth-predicate itself is part of an anaphoric or prosentential construction. Prosententialists point out the many parallels which exist between pronouns and prosentences. Pronouns are often used out of \"laziness\", as in:\n\nor they can be used in quantificational contexts, such as:\n\nIn a similar manner, \"it is true\" can be used as a prosentence of laziness, as in:\n\nand as a quantificational prosentence, such as:\n\nProsententialists therefore reject the idea that truth is a property of some sort.\n\nPaul Horwich's theory of truth, known as the \"minimalist theory\", takes the primary truth-bearing entities to be propositions, rather than sentences. According to the minimalist view then, truth is indeed a property of propositions (or sentences, as the case may be) but it is so minimal and anomalous a property that it cannot be said to provide us with any useful information about or insight into the nature of truth. It is fundamentally nothing more than a sort of metalinguistic property.\n\nAnother way of formulating the minimalist thesis is to assert that the conjunction of all of the instances of the following schema:\n\nprovides an implicit definition of the property of truth. Each such instance is an axiom of the theory and there are an infinite number of such instances (one for every actual or possible proposition in the universe). Our concept of truth consists of nothing more than a disposition to assent to all of the instances of the above schema when we encounter them.\n\nOne of the main objections to deflationary theories of all flavors was formulated by Jackson, Oppy and Smith in 1994 (following Kirkham 1992). According to the objection, if deflationism is interpreted as a \"sentential\" theory (that is, one where truth is predicated of sentences on the left hand side of the biconditionals such as (T) above), then deflationism is false; on the other hand, if it is interpreted as a \"propositional\" theory, then it is trivial. Examining another simple instance of the standard equivalence schema:\n\nthe objection is just that, if the italicized words are taken as a \"sentence\", then it is false, because something more is required for the whole statement to be true than merely the fact that \"grass is green\" is true. It is also necessary that the sentence \"grass is green\" means that grass is green and this further \"linguistic\" fact is not dealt with in the equivalence schema.\n\nHowever, if we now assume that \"grass is green\" on the left-hand side refers to a proposition, then the theory seems trivial since grass is green is defined as true if and only if grass is green. Note that the triviality involved here is not caused by the concept of truth but by that of \"proposition\". In any case, simply accepting the triviality of the propositional version implies that, at least within the Deflationary Theory of Truth, there can be no explanation of the connection between sentences and the things that they express; i.e., propositions.\n\nMichael Dummett, among others, has argued that deflationism cannot account for the fact that truth should be a normative goal of assertion. The idea is that truth plays a central role in the activity of stating facts. The deflationist response is that the assertion that truth is a norm of assertion can be stated only in the form of the following infinite conjunction:\n\nOne should assert the proposition that grass is green only if grass is green and one should assert the proposition that lemons are yellow only if lemons are yellow and one should assert the proposition that a square circle is impossible only if a squared circle is impossible and...\n\nThis, in turn, can be reformulated as:\n\nIt may be the case that we use the truth-predicate to express this norm, not because it has anything to do with the nature of truth in some inflationary sense, but because it is a convenient way of expressing this otherwise inexpressible generalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45461213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45461213", "title": "Deviance regulation theory", "text": "Deviance regulation theory\n\nDeviance regulation theory (DRT) posits that people choose to stray from social norms in socially attractive ways as well as avoiding socially unattractive behaviors that stray from social norms. These actions are all performed in an effort to preserve a constructive private and public self-image. DRT was proposed by Hart Blanton at the University of Albany in 2003 and has various applications in behavior change including alcohol interventions, inducing creativity, and other uses that are briefly mentioned below. Limitations to this theory have yet to be discovered but with future research Blanton and Christie are sure that boundaries are to be found.\n\nDeviance regulation theory (DRT) builds upon past research on causal attribution, self-representation, social comparison, person perception, and social prototypes. These areas of research focus on identity and actions separately. In DRT, deviance is defined strictly as a divergence from a norm, lacking any negative connotation that the term deviance commonly holds in psychology. Deviance regulation theory links actions and identities to explain and predict adherence to, and deviance from, normative action based on identity pursuit. This is a somewhat narrow scope because application is limited to situations where identity concerns are predominant.\n\nDRT relies on a dual-motivational system to explain the pursuit of identity within reference groups. On one side of the system, motivation comes from the avoidance of negative self-views. In a reference group where a behavior is required of its members, the members of the reference group will internalize the group mentality. If an individual were to deviate from the normative behavior, they would then develop negative self-views. So in order to protect their positive self-regard, individuals are motivated to avoid deviating from the normative behavior.\n\nOn the other side of the dual-motivational system, in a reference group where a behavior deviating from the norm is desirable but not required of its members, members of the group would regard the deviant act as an ideal. In this scenario, an individual is motivated to deviate from the norm because doing so will raise their esteem within the reference group and will elevate their level of positive self-regard.\n\nIn both schemes, deviance from or adherence to a normative act is guided by identity pursuit. In the first scheme behavior was guided by the preservation of positive identity through the avoidance of negative self-regard; and in the second scheme, behavior was guided by the pursuit of positive identity. Which motivation will guide behavior will depend on the context within reference groups and individual variance, although avoidance of negative identity seems to be a more pungent motivator. In the first example the negative self-views would come from ideas of social obligation. Not meeting the minimum requirements of the social obligation leads to feelings of exclusion which is why it can be a very powerful motivator. Positive identity pursuit gives motivation to exhibit what Blanton and Christie referred to as \"optional ideals\". Meeting minimums for social inclusion seems to be a more pressing influence over behavior than exhibiting ideal (but not required) behavior, especially when individual abilities and interests are taken into account.\n\nResearch by Hart Blanton has not found limitations because the experiments were conducted under circumstances that favored the current theory. Blanton and Christie expect boundary conditions to become evident through future research and may be found to exist in situations where the individual is resistant to change. If an individual makes a conscious effort to resist a reference group's perceived attempt to alter the individual's behavior, it seems plausible that DRT could backfire. The same way that people key off of behavior from ingroups, people also observe and avoid normative behavior displayed by people in outgroups. In this context DRT could play the opposite role as an individual would avoid the observed normative behavior.\n\nDifferences in culture could potentially expose another boundary condition. A person's level of self-representation could be a limit of application. Future research could show whether cultural identity would influence the predictive power of deviance regulation theory. It seems intuitive to think that a person who holds a more collective identity (e.g. in eastern culture individuals base more of their identity off of the identity of the success and failure of their collective nation when compared with individuals from western culture) may be influenced differently by motivations relating to identity pursuit than someone who holds an individualistic view of identity.\n\nDeviance regulation theory is primarily used as an intervention meant to influence behavior through social norms. By framing a message about what behaviors are considered normal in either a positive or negative way, it is possible to influence individuals to either engage or abstain from those behaviors based on the desire to appear as an individual with positive qualities. There are several ways in which a deviance regulation intervention has been and can possibly be used:\n\nAmong the uses of deviance regulation interventions, the regulation of alcohol use, especially among college students, is perhaps the most prevalent. Interventions involving conformity are particularly relevant in the case of college drinking due to the tendency of college students to overestimate the amount of alcohol consumed by their peers, as well as projection, or the tendency for individuals to view their peer's drinking habits as similar to their own, causing them to see their own alcohol use as normal. Furthermore, a deviance regulation intervention makes sense among this population due to college often being a time of identity development, and because many see drinking as an integral part of the college experience could serve as a behavior with which to establish an identity.\n\nOne way deviance regulation interventions have been used to control alcohol consumption is by increasing the use of protective behavioral strategies. Protective behavioral strategies (PBS) are methods that an individual can employ in order to limit the consequences of alcohol use, and include limiting the number of drinks consumed in a session, moderating the manner of drinking, and serious harm reduction, such as having a designated driver. It was found that individuals who believed the use of PBS was high were most influenced by a negative message about those who do not use PBS and that individuals who believed PBS use was low were more influenced by a positive message about those who use PBS. However, this held true only for the manner of drinking strategy, and only influenced behavior when the subject believed in the message.\n\nDeviance regulation interventions have also been used to influence creativity. This was done by manipulating self guides, which are internalized evaluative standards developed through socialization. There are two types of self guides: ought self-guides, which are representative of attributes that are socially desirable and are performed out of a sense of obligation or social obligation or responsibility, and Ideal self guides, which represent attributes formed more from the individual's desires and personal ambitions. Both of these self-guides are associated with distinct motivational orientations. Ought self-guides, which focus on attributes typically taught through punishment, lead to a prevention-focus, or the avoidance of unwanted outcomes. Conversely, ideal self-guides, which are developed through praise and admiration, lead to a promotion-focus, or the desire to achieve positive outcomes.\n\nIt has been generally observed that individuals high in promotion-focus are more likely to show flexible and creative thinking patterns. Therefore, researchers believed that situations that activate promotion-focus should result in greater creativity. It was found that those who put a high emphasis on social obligation had less desire to be creative, and therefore manipulation of the salience of ought self-guides inhibited creative output while manipulation of ideal self-guides increased creative output. Furthermore, priming of promotion-focus lead subjects led to more novel answers on a word association test. However, it is believed that these results came from an increase in creative expression, not creative ability, as the boost to creative output vanished among speeded trials.\n\nA deviance regulation intervention has been used in various other scenarios in order to encourage flu immunization, condom use, as well as prospectively for the discouragement of cigarette smoke.\n"}
{"id": "863410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=863410", "title": "Eco-efficiency", "text": "Eco-efficiency\n\nOver the years, as countries and regions around the world began to develop, it slowly became evident that industrialization and economic growth come hand in hand with environmental degradation. Eco-Efficiency has been proposed as one of the main tools to promote a transformation from unsustainable development to one of sustainable development. It is based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste and pollution. “It is measured as the ratio between the (added) value of what has been produced (e.g. GDP) and the (added) environment impacts of the product or service (e.g. S02 emissions).” The term was coined by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in its 1992 publication “Changing Course,” and at the 1992 Earth Summit, eco-efficiency was endorsed as a new business concept and means for companies to implement Agenda 21 in the private sector. Ergo the term has become synonymous with a management philosophy geared towards sustainability, combining ecological and economic efficiency.\n\nAlthough eco-efficiency is a rather new method, the idea is not. In the early 1970s Paul R. Ehrlich and John Holdren developed the lettering formula I = PAT to describe the impact of human activity on the environment. Furthermore, the concept of eco-efficiency was first described by McIntyre and Thornton in 1978, but it wasn’t until 1992, when the term was formally coined and widely publicized by Stephan Schmidheiny in ‘’Changing Course’’. Schmidheiny set out “to change the perception of industry as being part of the problem of environmental degradation to the reality of its becoming part—a key part—of the solution for sustainability and global development.” The major drivers in the early phase of eco-efficiency’s development were the “forward-looking managers and thinkers in 3M and Dow.” It was their involvement which catapulted eco-efficiency from a brilliant idea to a workable concept. The results of the WBCSD’s work creating the “linkage between environmental performance and the bottom line was published in 1997 in its report Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value.”\n\nAccording to the WBCSD definition, eco-efficiency is achieved through the delivery of \"competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing environmental impacts of goods and resource intensity throughout the entire life-cycle to a level at least in line with the Earth's estimated carrying capacity.\" \nIt works by implementing 4 main types of ratios. \nThe ratios may be applied to any unit comprising economic activities because such activities always relate to cost and value, “and having some physical substrate, always influence the environment.” Furthermore, there are two different levels upon which to orchestrate the ratios: ‘’micro’’ and ‘’macro’’. \nThere are three different methods to determine eco-efficiency at the micro-level. First, ‘’incremental eco-efficiency’’, which “specifies the effects of the total value of a product system or sector and its total concomitant environmental effects.” Second, an analysis method nicknamed ‘’win-win’’, which “gives a comparison between a historical reference situation and potentially new situations based on the use of new technologies.” It should be noted that the win-win micro-method is limited because it cannot give a concrete answer on the question of whether it improves overall environmental performance. And the third is ‘’difference eco-efficiency’’, which is similar to the win-win variant, but removes all irrelevant alternatives to heighten potential for optimal technologies while comparing two alternatives.\nNow the macro-level is much less defined and has shown less accurate results. However, “the ultimate aim of eco-efficiency analysis is to help move micro-level decision making into macro-level optimality.” The main goal in years to come is to create headline indicators to carry out macro-level analysis at a country/world scale.\n\nThere are two life-cycle assessment (LCA) -based calculation systems on eco-efficiency: the Analysis Method of BASF, and the method of the Eco-costs value ratio of the Delft University of Technology.\n\nThe reduction in ecological impacts translates into an increase in resource productivity, which in turn can create a competitive advantage. \nAccording to the WBCSD, critical aspects of eco-efficiency are:\nStrategies that have been linked to eco-efficiency include “Factor 4” and “Factor 10”, which call for specific reductions in resource use, “natural capitalism”, which incorporates eco-efficiency as part of a broader strategy, and the “cradle-to-cradle” movement, which claims to go beyond eco-efficiency in abolishing the very idea of waste. According to Boulanger, all versions of eco-efficiency share four key characteristics:\n\nThe view that improvements in eco-efficiency are sufficient for achieving sustainability has been challenged by Huesemann and Huesemann, who demonstrate using extensive historical evidence that increases in technological efficiency have not reduced overall resource use and pollution. Moreover, with “cradle-to-cradle”, growth is conducive to sustainability per se.\nThis broader concept is called ‘’Sustainable Production and Consumption’’ (SPC). “This concept involves changes in production and consumption patterns that lead to sustainable use of natural resources;” business has taken a key role in accelerating the use of this concept because businesses both consume and produce. Eco-efficiency is routinely a concept used because it combines performance along two of the three axes of sustainable development, making it easier for academics and leading thinkers to tease out the associated social issues.\n\nFurthermore, eco-efficiency is also a very useful tool because it can adapt and flex to be fit different sizes of companies, while also maintaining relevance with the larger scale of government and national policies. For example, larger national players such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2002), European Commission (EU 2005), European Environment Agency (EEA) and the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) have all recognized that eco-efficiency is a practical approach that businesses should adopt in setting and achieving their environmental performance objectives. It has been proven to heighten market values for firms, serve as an effective management tool for governments, benefit civil society, and increase quality of life. “It does this by changing industrial processes, creating new products and changing and influencing markets with new ideas and with new rules.” More people aim to get more value for their money in the market, while also enjoying a better environment.\n\nRecently, there has also been use of eco-efficiency in more non-traditional ways, such as a use in banks to integrate environmental criteria into their credit-approval process; looking at “eco-integrated economic risks of a customer.” And is also being implemented as marketing advantages where, “eco-efficient choices are always preferred,” especially in service sectors such as tourism.\n\n\n"}

Modernism saw attacks on the false pleasures of consumerism from the right, as well as from the left, with Herbert Marcuse denouncing the false pleasures of happy consciousness of \"those whose life is the hell of the affluent society\".\n\nFrom another angle, Richard Hoggart contrasted the immediate, real pleasures of the working-class from the increasingly ersatz diet fed them by the media.\n\nAs the 20th Century wore on, however - while concern for the contrast of false and authentic pleasures, fragmented or integrated experiences, certainly remained - the mass media increasingly became less of a scapegoat for the prevalence of false pleasure, figures like Frederic Jameson for example insisting instead on \"the false problem of value\" in a world where \"reification or materialization is a key structural feature of both modernism and mass culture\".\n\nSlavoj Žižek had added a further twist to the debate for the 21st century, arguing that in a postmodern age dominated by what he calls \"the superego injunction to enjoy that permeates our discourse\", the quest for pleasure has become more of a duty than a pleasure: for Žižek, \"psychoanalysis is the only discipline in which you are allowed \"not\" to enjoy\" !\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14709667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14709667", "title": "Fear appeal", "text": "Fear appeal\n\nFear appeal is a term used in psychology, sociology and marketing. It generally describes a strategy for motivating people to take a particular action, endorse a particular policy, or buy a particular product, by arousing fear. A well-known example in television advertising was a commercial employing the musical jingle: \"Never pick up a stranger, pick up Prestone anti-freeze.\" This was accompanied by images of shadowy strangers (hitchhikers) who would presumably do one harm if picked up. The commercial's main appeal was not to the positive features of Prestone anti-freeze, but to the fear of what a \"strange\" brand might do.\n\nA fear appeal is a persuasive message that attempts to arouse fear in order to divert behavior through the threat of impending danger or harm. It presents a risk, presents the vulnerability to the risk, and then may, or may not suggest a form of protective action.\n\nIt is assumed that through a fear appeal the perception of threatening stimuli creates fear arousal. The state of fear is believed to be an unpleasant emotional state that involves physiological arousal that motivates cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses directed towards alleviating the threat or reducing fear. There are many different theoretical models of fear appeal messages. They include: the extended parallel process model, the drive theory, the subjective expected utility theory, the protection motivation theory, the health belief model, the theory of reasoned action, and the transtheoretical model. These models are widely used in substance abuse campaigns, sexual health programs, and many other general health contexts. The persuasive effect of fear appeals is thought to be influenced by several factors such as individual characteristics, self-efficacy, perception of norms, fear strength, perceived threat, perception of treatment efficacy, and defense mechanisms. Mixed results have been produced from studies that attempt to demonstrate the effectiveness of fear appeals for behavior modification, and a recent meta-analysis recommended extreme caution in the use of fear appeals.\n\nOver the last half century, a substantial amount of research has been done on the influence of fear on persuasion. A multitude of theories and models of fear appeals, also known as cognitive mediating processes, have been derived from this research. The goal of each of these has been to conceptualize the influence of fear on persuasion so as to better understand how to employ it in addressing the public on a number of social issues.\n\nThe extended parallel process model (EPPM) is a theory that explains how cognitive and emotional mechanisms trigger distinct motivational and coping responses such as fear control and danger control responses. Fear control responses minimize fear through emotional coping that generates reassurance through denial of the threat or derogation of the persuasive message. Fear control is a process of denial that does not involve physically averting behavior to the perceived threat. Danger control is a cognitive process also oriented towards reducing the presented threat. However, unlike fear control response, danger control response may prompt protective action. Thus according to the extended parallel process model, the experience of fear is considered an emotional reaction, and the perceptions of threat are a set of cognitions. \nThe extended parallel process model differs from many other fear appeal arguments because it suggests that fear arousal and danger control processes are distinct processes where fear arousal need not precede the danger control process that underpin precautionary behaviors.\n\nIt is predicted that a fear appeal will initiate a dominant response of either fear control or danger control processes. \nThe extended parallel process model concludes that cognitions (attitudes, intentions, and behavior changes) result in fear appeal success via the danger control process. It also concludes that fear appeals fail when the fear emotion is reduced via the fear control process.\n\nDefensive avoidance is an example of a fear control response that leads to the failure of fear appeals.\n\nEmotional tension is a key characteristic of drive theory. According to the theory, a threat that portrays the negative consequences of non-compliance to a recommended behavior is expected to create fear. In order to relieve the emotional tension of the threat, the \"drive\" state motivates behavior conduct that reduces the tension. According to the drive theory, it is expected that the greater the fear, the greater the compliance to message recommendations.\n\nResearch has not produced consistent empirical results supporting the drive reduction model. For example, a dental hygiene presentation to a group of high school students reported greater change in attitudes using mild rather than strong fear appeals. When repeated, the reverse effect was true: greater attitude and behavior change occurred when a strong fear appeal was used, versus a moderate or weak fear appeal.\n\nThe subjective expected utility theory has been applied to contexts beyond fear appeals. In the context of a fear appeal, the subjective expected utility theory predicts that a fear appeal is successful when the individual believes that the benefits in risk reduction outweigh the expected cost of acting. \nTo assess the efficacy of a fear appeal respondents would be asked about the likelihood and severity of harmful outcomes of risk involved. The proposed severity is considered under the conditions of the current behavior and then under the alternative behavior. The efficacy is perceived through the effectiveness of the respondents answer. The subjective expected utility theory is unlike other theories of fear appeal because it does not describe the emotional process involved in fear reduction. It is only used to predict the relative likelihood of action. As previously stated, the subjective expected utility theory can be applied to various contexts such as predicting retirement and child-bearing.\n\nThe protection motivation theory is an attitude-based model. It holds that a fear appeal argument initiates a cognitive assessment process that considers the severity of the threatened event, the probability of the occurrence of the event, and the efficacy of a recommended behavior response. According to the theory, the cognitive assessment processes enhance a fear appeal when it provokes protection motivation. Protection motivation is a variable that arouses, sustains, and directs the suggested behavior to avoid danger. In absence of protection motivation, the recommended protective action is judged to be ineffective in averting the threat or impossible to undertake then no intention to act will result. The protection motivation theory predicts that preventative actions will be preferred in a high threat situation when the self-efficacy and the efficacy of the recommended action are both high. Conversely, it is expected that maladaptive actions will be maintained when there is a high threat but the efficacy perceptions are low.\n\nThe protection motivation theory has been applied to analyzing the efficacy of health campaigns such as those encouraging self-breast examinations for detecting breast cancer. Studies found that perceptions of threat concerning breast cancer prompted adaptive actions, such as performing self-examinations, and maladaptive actions, such as to avoid thinking about breast cancer.\n\nThe health belief model predicts that perceived susceptibility and severity of a risk motivates individuals to engage in preventive actions, and the type of preventative action depends on the perceived benefits and hindrances of performing the action.\n\nA fear argument based on the health belief model is typically presented in terms of the likelihood and severity of health consequences if the current behavior is not changed. With the health belief model, it is unclear whether self-efficacy is directly considered a cost of performing a suggested action because occasionally, a fear appeal is thought to be less effective if a difficulty of acting is considered a cost of acting.\n\nAccording to the theory of reasoned action, acting on fear appeals begins by consideration of a wider range of consequences of continuing the current behavior beyond the threat of health risks. It also considers a wider range of consequences of the suggested behavior beyond the costs and reduced health risks. The projected consequences vary depending on the situation. The theory of reasoned action differs from other theories because it also incorporates a social influence factor in predicting the efficacy of fear appeals. The social influence is determined by normative beliefs and the desires of other relevant people to perform the given behavior.\n\nThe theory of reasoned action has been applied to alcohol, tobacco, and other drug campaigns. For example, it has helped identify the importance of peer pressure and the normative belief of parents as variables for improving school-based drug campaigns. Although the theory of reasoned action has been shown to be a strong predictive utility of social behavior, it is considered to be deficient in explaining behavior change.\n\nA transtheoretical model of fear appeals explains a dynamic process of health behavior change. Its structure is based on the assumption that behavior change is a systematic process involving a series of stages referred to as stages of change. It also holds that the transition between stages involves a rational coping process referred to as processes of change. The stages of change are: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. According to the transtheoretical model, movement through the different stages involves a process called decision balance. Decision balance takes into account the potential gains and costs resulting from the new behavior. It is believed that an individual will not change or continue a behavior unless they perceive advantages to outweigh the disadvantages.\n\nThe pre-contemplation stage is a period in which individuals have no intentions to stop a risky behavior or start a healthy behavior. This may be due to a lack in knowledge of the risk involving their current behavior, or an unwillingness to acknowledge that their behavior puts them at risk. The process of change from the pre-contemplation phase to the contemplation phase includes the response of conscious raising, dramatic relief, and an environmental reevaluation process to the argument.\n\nThe second stage is contemplation. It is the stage at which an individual is actively considering stopping risky behavior or starting a healthy behavior. It is predicted that individuals will remain at this stage for a long period of time due to the difficulty in evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of behavior change.\nThe process of change to the following stage is expedited by self-reevaluation.\n\nThis is the third stage at which individuals have been persuaded and commit to change their behavior.\nThe process of change to the action stage involves a self-liberation process in which the fear appeal influences a changed behavior.\n\nAction is the stage at which the individual engages in behavior change. They have tried to stop their risky behavior. The process of change that helps facilitate progression includes behavioral processes, such as reinforcement management, helping relationships, counterconditioning, and stimulus control.\n\nMaintenance is the final stage for changing risky behavior. This is the stage at which individuals adopt healthy behavior into their lifestyle, and try to prevent regression into the risk behavior.\nRegression is possible at any point of the stages. \nThe transtheoretical model has been used to structure various programs for smoking cessation, alcohol abstinence, sunscreen use, dietary change, and contraceptive use.\n\n\"The ultimate goal of fear appeals is to effectively promote reflective message processing and to influence individual affect towards the message\". Individual perceptual differences towards the fear appeal are factors that govern the efficacy of the fear appeal. Researchers have examined several variables that have been thought, at one time or another, to influence the persuasive effect of fear appeals. These factors include: individual characteristics, risk perception, perception of self-efficacy, perception of treatment efficacy, perception of norms, the strength of the fear elicited, perceived threat, and defense mechanisms. The results of the research have demonstrated that various, and sometimes multiple factors, affect the efficacy of fear appeals depending on the method used and the individual.\n\nAlso of interest in the fear appeals literature has been the contribution of individual characteristics. The goal has been to understand which individual differences in personality or psychological traits contribute or detract from the effectiveness of the fear appeal. Individual moderating variables studied thus far include trait anxiety, age, ethnicity, gender, coping style, locus of control, self-esteem, perceived vulnerability, need for cognition and uncertainty orientation. Of these, uncertainty orientation and need for cognition have been found to interact with the level of threat. Uncertainty orientation is an individual's characteristic response to uncertainty. That is, whether one attends to or avoids and ignores the source of the uncertainty. Those with an uncertainty orientation tend to be more motivated to deeply process the information presented as the personal relevance increases, whereas those with a certainty orientation will actively avoid it. Some early studies examined other characteristics, such as individual thresholds for fear arousal, to see if they moderated the effect of fear on persuasion. A study by Janis and Feshbach (1954) found that those with lower fear arousal thresholds were the least compelled to act by the high fear appeals, as they tended to react with defensive control responses. Lower threshold subjects were also more easily persuaded by counterarguments following the fear appeal. Trait anxiety has also been the subject of some of the early research, which has since been found to have no discernible effect on persuasion.\n\nThe self-efficacy theory states that all processes of psychological change alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is enhanced by performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Self-efficacy can also be enhanced by the perceived dependability of the source. The level of self-efficacy an individual has is believed to influence their choice of behavior as well as the amount of time, and the amount of effort expended on that behavior. If the individual does not believe that he or she is capable of averting the threat, it is likely that denial or other defensive responses will be produced in order to lower the fear. The fear of threatening situations may have an adverse effect on the efficacy of a fear appeal. An intimidating situation may cause an individual to believe that he/she is incapable of performing the suggested preventative behaviors that will lead to avoidance behaviors. Bandura's\n\nResearch done by others have revealed \"a positive, linear effect of fear on overall intentions and behavior\", especially when the messages endorse people's self-efficacy. This effect is more positive when behaviors are performed on one-time basis instead of repeatedly. However, other researchers also pointed out that in the context of self-efficacy need to be considered carefully in relation to other stratefies. The use of other persuative techniques such as behavioral trainings might counteract against the efficacy of fear appeal in isolation.\n\nAccording to the theory of self-efficacy, performance accomplishments are related to the success of personal experience. When strong efficacy expectations are established, then the impact of occasional failures are reduced. If self-efficacy is established, it tends to generalize to other situations. \nVicarious experience is the observation of others who have performed threatening activities. If others are observed to successfully perform threatening activities, then self-efficacy is expected to increase because the social comparison will reinforce the perception that the behavior can be achieved through effort.\nVerbal persuasion is widely used because of the potentially persuasive influence of suggestion. The influence of suggestion is expected to boost individual self-efficacy. Research has shown that the effects of verbal persuasion may not prevail through a long history of failure. It has been shown to create an enduring sense of self-efficacy in situations where aid is given to facilitate successful action. Failures have a negative effect because it discredits the persuaders and undermines the individual's self-efficacy.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, stressful situations can lessen the feeling of personal competency. Poor performance, for example is usually associated with a state of high arousal. Fear-provoking thoughts can cause an individual to overestimate the intensity of a threatening situation. According to the self-efficacy theory, diminishing emotional arousal can reduce avoidance behavior. Physiological arousal has been predicted to have both positive and negative effects on beneficial or negative coping behaviors. A positive perception of an aroused state may energize, while a negative perception of an aroused state may inhibit coping behaviors.\n\nPhysiological arousal has been predicted to have both positive and negative effects on beneficial or negative coping behaviors. A positive perception of an aroused state may energize, while a negative perception of an aroused state may inhibit coping behaviors.\n\nPerceived treatment efficacy is also referred to as response-outcome expectancies. It is conceptualized as a person's estimate that a given behavior will lead to certain outcomes. Perception of treatment efficacy differs from self-efficacy because an individual's belief in their ability to perform the suggested actions does not influence their behavior it is the perceived outcome that determines an individual's actions. The enactment of sustained long-term behaviors intended by the fear appeal communication is strongly influenced by the individual perception of treatment efficacy. The extent to which an individual perceives the protection of the recommended action against the health risk determines whether they are persuaded to perform the recommended course of action. A positive perception of treatment efficacy is internalized by the emphasis of the positive aspects of the recommended action. Perceived treatment efficacy is possibly the most integral element of an effectively persuasive fear appeal, and more predictive of action than fear arousal, is perceived efficacy. Some research has found that perceived efficacy is more predictive of intention to change behavior than other elements of perceived threat.\n\nEven if a health behavior is portrayed as harmful, the behavior may not be altered by fear inducing communication if the individual is convinced that the behavior is common practice. The behavior is unlikely to be changed if the individual's social group models or reinforces the actions. In this case, there may also be a false perception of norms. Reinforcement of the negative health behavior by the common social group decreases the effectiveness of the fear appeal.\n\nExample: In a study of alcohol abuse on college campuses, students demonstrated heavy alcohol use in response to their peer groups that reinforced the behavior. Students who abused alcohol also believed that their peers were even heavier users than they actually were. Those who believed that heavy intoxication was an element of campus culture may be at a greater risk for personal alcohol abuse due to the desire to conform to the perceived norm.\n\nThe strength of the fear elicited by the message is also an important determinant of the subject's intentions to change the target behavior. Fear strength is distinct from threat severity in that, as mentioned before, fear strength is related to the emotion of fear, whereas threat severity is considered to be an entirely cognitive process. Some early research found that higher levels of fear produced defensive reactions, compelling the researchers to caution that low or moderate levels were the most effective. With rare exception, strength of the fear elicited has been consistently found to be positively correlated with behavior change. This positive linear correlation is ubiquitous in fear appeal research and has laid to rest the curvilinear relationship implied by some of the earliest research. Strength of fear has been found to be positively correlated, as expected, with arousal. Early research has found that low fear appeal strength was the most persuasive. Strength of fear alone is not enough to motivate change in behavior as strong fear with no recommended action, or a recommended action that is not easily performed, may result in the exact opposite effect. According to Sternthal and Craig, fear strength affects attitude change more than it does intentions. They argue that although persuasion increases when fear rises from low to moderate levels, when rising from moderate to high levels, it actually decreases.\n\nSome have even gone so far as to argue that fear is an entirely unnecessary component of an effective appeal as perceived efficacy is more predictive of intention to change behavior than either element of perceived threat. The tendency for higher levels of fear to raise defensive control responses, it is argued, suggests that fear is not useful and that efficacy may be able to bring about intention and behavior change by itself. Another argument states that since higher levels of personal efficacy are necessary, the target of the fear appeal who is most likely to act is one who is most likely to change his behavior to begin with. The implication is that another tact (other than fear) is necessary.\n\nPerceived threat is thought to be an important moderator in the process of fear evoked persuasion. It consists of both the perceived severity of the threat and the perceived susceptibility to it.\n\nPerceived susceptibility, sometimes referred to as perceived vulnerability, is thought to be key in motivating an individual to act in response to a fear appeal. It is the perception of the probability and extent to which he/she might experience the threat. Perceived severity, however, is the degree to which the person believes that they will be harmed if the threat is experienced. These threat components form the perceptual trigger for the fear reaction. Higher levels of perceived susceptibility have been found to increase the degree to which people are critical of the message. An example of a fear appeal of a message that emphasizes perceived severity would be the quote \"AIDS leads to death\". These threat components form the perceptual trigger for fear reaction. Higher levels of perceived susceptibility have been found to increase the degree to which people are critical of the message. However, subjects report more positive thoughts about the recommendation and negative emotions associated with the threat when susceptibility is high. Higher levels of perceived susceptibility are associated with greater intention to change behavior in the manner recommended in the fear appeal message, and are a strong determinant of intentions and behavior, even in the face of weak arguments. It is thought that when perceived susceptibility is high, defense motivations prevent even poor information or weak arguments from detracting from the message's impact on intention. As influential as it appears to be, susceptibility has still been found in some cases to have a much less direct effect on motivation to act on the message than, for instance, self efficacy beliefs or response efficacy.\n\nPerceived severity, the extent to which the individual believes he/she will be adversely affected by the threat has a significant effect on persuasion. A statement that emphasizes the seriousness of a threat would be a statement directed towards a targeted population. An example would be, \"You're at-risk for AIDS because you share needles while using intravenous drugs\". In some cases, persuasion has been found to be aided by lowering severity, the majority of the fear appeal research has found just the opposite. However, it is important to distinguish perceived severity of the threat from the actual fear elicited. The former is considered to be an entirely cognitive process, while the latter is an emotional process. Some have even argued that cognitive processes in the context of fear appeals are more important than emotional ones. Research has found that the effect of fear on intentions is mediated by the perceived severity. That is, fear does not act directly on intentions, but increases the level of perceived severity, which in turn raises intentions to act on the message. Indeed, the strength of the fear appeal is believed to be positively correlated with the perceived severity of the threat. Severity seems to produce the strongest effects on perceptions.\n\nThe previous components are thought to determine what response an individual has to the message. One of these potential reactions to the fear appeal that is of the most negative consequence is that of the defensive fear control reaction. In response to the fear appeal, an individual may form the intent to change their behavior. However, when either self or response efficacy is low, the individual, perceiving that they are unable to avert the threat, may rely on defensive avoidance to lower their fear. Some have argued that fear appeals are unnecessary as defensive avoidance reactions have been found in some studies to be positively correlated with strength of fear and negatively with perceived efficacy.\n\nThe required balance of fear and efficacy levels has been the subject of much research, with some finding that moderate to high levels of fear are unnecessary in changing intentions. In fact, they argue, what is important is the ratio of these to each other. Gore and Bracken (2005)\nfound that even with low levels of threat, they were able to take individuals who had started to exhibit defensive fear control reactions to move toward danger control (intention change) reactions. Another way of defending yourself against fear appeals is prior knowledge, according to one study, individuals are less likely to be influenced by a fear appeal if they have prior knowledge.\n\nThis is your brain on drugs, the D.A.R.E. program, abstinence-only sex education, deprogramming.\n\nA number of ethical concerns regarding the use of fear appeals have been raised, leading to widespread debate regarding the acceptability of their use. For example, it has been questioned whether it is ethical to expose large numbers of people to potentially distressing messages without their consent. Hastings, Stead and Webb question whether it is ethically acceptable to expose an entire population to a distressing message intended for a specific subset of that population. For example, a fear appeal message stressing the likelihood of premature death for individuals who smoke may also reach the children of people who smoke, leading to avoidable anxiety in such groups.\n\nFurther to this, it is evident that anxiety responses may not even be helpful when elicited in the target group. This is because, while anxiety can motivate positive health behaviour, it can also be maladaptive, as some individuals form a defensive response to mitigate the negative feeling arising from the fear appeal. While there have been mixed results regarding whether fear appeals elicit a defense response, it is important to note that studies exploring this relationship are done in a laboratory setting free of external distractions and where participants are told to focus on the health messages. It may be that people may have stronger defense responses in real life situations where they must navigate a complex range of competing messages and where they have the option of ignoring the message or looking for competing explanations. In addition to this, no studies have followed responses to fear appeals over the longer term, and it possible that repetition of fear appeals may lead to habituation and annoyance, therefore cause individuals to tune out to the messages of the health promotion campaign. Furthermore, even if they do work, some authors question whether it is ethical to frighten people in to behaving in a certain way, as this may compromise their autonomy by manipulating their beliefs.\n\nA concern has also been raised that fear appeals serve to contribute to the widening of health disparities. This is because certain individuals are more likely to develop the maladaptive responses mentioned above. Empirical research suggests that fear appeals work best for individuals with high levels of self-efficacy, and that maladaptive responses are more likely in those with low self-efficacy. This means that fear appeals work best for those who are equipped, both physically and psychologically, to take appropriate action. Individuals who do not have the resources for health behaviour change are often those who already have negative health status. For example, people who regularly engage in behaviours which are damaging to health (e.g. smoking and other drug use) have been found to typically have lower self-efficacy than others. Therefore, it seems that, in addition to having the potential to cause harm, this harm is more likely to affect groups that would most benefit from health behaviour change, therefore contributing to the widen of health disparities.\n\nThere is also a concern that fear appeals give rise to stigmatisation of those who are seen to be already suffering the negative consequences of the undesirable behaviour. For example, injury prevention campaigns often rely on emphasising the negative consequences of potentially becoming disabled. Wang hypothesises that when becoming disabled is portrayed as unacceptable, so is being disabled, adding to the stigmatisation of disabled individuals. For example, in responses to a poster campaign stating that \"Last year, 1057 teenagers got so drunk they couldn't stand up. Ever.\" presented alongside a picture of a wheelchair, disabled participants in Wang's study felt that this held them up as an example of how not to be. One participant said \"I feel it's an attack on my self esteem and dignity.\"\n\n"}

The end result is list of actions needed to achieve the desired results.\n\nSally Fuller and Ramon Aldag argue that group decision-making models have been operating under too narrow of a focus due to the overemphasis of the groupthink phenomenon. In addition, according to them, group decision-making has often been framed in relative isolation, ignoring context and real-world circumstances, which is a likely consequence of testing group decision-making in laboratory studies. They claim that the groupthink model is overly deterministic and an unrealistically restrictive depiction of the group problem-solving process.” To address these problems, they propose a new model that incorporates elements of group decision-making processes from a broader, more comprehensive perspective, offering a more general and generalizable framework for future research. The model includes elements of Irving Janis's original model (1977), but only those that have been consistently supported by the literature. To understand the differences between the two models, we briefly summarize both Janis's model and the GGPS-model first.\n\nJanis defines groupthink as “the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive in-group that it tends to over-ride realistic appraisals of alternative courses of action.” In a subsequent article, he elaborates on this by saying: “I use the term \"groupthink\" as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action. Groupthink refers to a deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-group pressures.”\nAll this suggests that the original groupthink model was proposed for a rather specific situation, and Janis states that we can only call a phenomenon groupthink if all the warning signs are present (see groupthink symptoms).\n\nThe GGPS-model (developed by Ramon Aldag and Sally Fuller) broadens the perspectives, incorporating elements of the original groupthink model, in a fashion that creates a more widely applicable schematic.\nTwo key differences should be noted in comparison to Janis’ model:\n\n\nThree sets of antecedents are proposed by GGPS: decision characteristics, group structure and decision-making context.\n\nElements belonging here are the importance of the decision, time pressure, structure, procedural requirements, and task characteristics.\n\n\"Examples\": whether the task is simple or complex will make a substantial difference in required member input, as well as in whether a directive leader is necessary. Group interaction is also altered if, given a task, a single correct answer exists and if it becomes obvious to any of the members, since subsequent group interaction will likely be reduced.\n\nElements are cohesiveness, members’ homogeneity, insulation of the group, leader impartiality, leader power, history of the group, probability of future interaction, stage of group development and type of group.\n\n\"Examples\": whether group members anticipate to work together again in the future can have a major impact on to what degree can political motives influence the process. If it’s unlikely that the group will come together again, political influence can be lessened. Stage of group development is important because members of mature group with a long history may feel more comfortable challenging each other’s ideas, thus cohesiveness results in quality decision making and positive outcomes.\n\nElements are organizational political norms, member political motives, prior discussion of issue, prior goal attainment, goal definition, and degree of stress from external threat.\n\n\"Examples\": whether group members identified and pursue a unitary goal or they have multiple, discrepant goals influences the rationality of the decision-making process. Members’ political motives also make a tremendous difference, if individuals have a vested interest in certain outcomes, or there are one or more coalitions present, behavior in the decision making process could be altered.\n\nThe model differentiates two categories of emergent group characteristics: group perceptions and processes.\n\nThese include members’ perceptions of the group’s vulnerability, the inherent morality of the group, member unanimity, and views of opposing groups.\n\nThese include the group’s response to negative feedback, treatment of dissenters, self-censorship, and use of mindguards.\n\nDecision process characteristics are grouped in terms of the first three stages of group problem-solving processes: problem identification, alternative generation and evaluation and choice. Implementation and control stages are not included because they follow the actual decision, but some variables preparing for those stages are indeed included (e.g. development of contingency plans and gathering of control-related information).\n\nElements of this stage are predecisional information search, survey of objectives, and explicit problem definition.\n\n\"Example\": if members of the group fail to explicitly or correctly define the problem, there is a chance that they will solve the wrong problem.\n\nElements are number of alternatives and quality of alternatives.\n\n\"Example\": in generating alternatives, it’s important to differentiate quality and quantity of alternative ideas generated. Some group processes, such as brainstorming, are directed towards generating large numbers of ideas, with the assumption that it will lead to a superior alternative. Defective processes, on the other hand, might lead to large numbers of low quality ideas.\n\nElements are information processing quality, the source of the initial selection of a preferred alternative, emergence of preferred alternative, group decision rule, timing of convergence, reexamination of preferred and rejected alternatives, source of the final solution, development of contingency plans, and gathering of control-related information.\n\n\"Example\": whether the group decides based on a majority rule or a consensus has to be reached, makes a great difference in the process. If a consensus is to be reached, dissent could be discouraged, because dissenters could elongate and jeopardize the process. With a majority rule, dissent is more acceptable.\n\nThe GGPS model includes an array of decision, political and affective outcomes.\n\nDecision outcomes: include acceptance of the decision by those affected by it and/or those who have to implement it, adherence to the decision, implementation success, and decision quality.\n\n\"Example\": if the leader of the group is not satisfied with the decision, he/she might unilaterally reverse it.\n\nPolitical outcomes: include future motivation of the leader, future motivation of the group and future use of the group.\n\n\"Example\": if the outcome did not satisfy the political agenda of the leader, he/she might use the group less or not at all in the future.\n\nAffective outcomes: include satisfaction with the leader, satisfaction with the group process and satisfaction with the decision.\n\n\"Example\": whether members are content with the fairness of the group process, whether trust was developed and preserved, or whether commitment to the decision is strong will greatly influence the group’s future functioning.\n"}
{"id": "12718563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12718563", "title": "Gravity turn", "text": "Gravity turn\n\nA gravity turn or zero-lift turn is a maneuver used in launching a spacecraft into, or descending from, an orbit around a celestial body such as a planet or a moon. It is a trajectory optimization that uses gravity to steer the vehicle onto its desired trajectory. It offers two main advantages over a trajectory controlled solely through the vehicle's own thrust. First, the thrust is not used to change the spacecraft's direction, so more of it is used to accelerate the vehicle into orbit. Second, and more importantly, during the initial ascent phase the vehicle can maintain low or even zero angle of attack. This minimizes transverse aerodynamic stress on the launch vehicle, allowing for a lighter launch vehicle.\n\nThe term gravity turn can also refer to the use of a planet's gravity to change a spacecraft's direction in situations other than entering or leaving the orbit. When used in this context, it is similar to a gravitational slingshot; the difference is that a gravitational slingshot often increases or decreases spacecraft velocity and changes direction, while the gravity turn only changes direction.\n\nThe gravity turn is commonly used with launch vehicles such as a rocket or the Space Shuttle that launch vertically. The rocket begins by flying straight up, gaining both vertical speed and altitude. During this portion of the launch, gravity acts directly against the thrust of the rocket, lowering its vertical acceleration. Losses associated with this slowing are known as gravity drag, and can be minimized by executing the next phase of the launch, the pitchover maneuver, as soon as possible. The pitchover should also be carried out while the vertical velocity is small to avoid large aerodynamic loads on the vehicle during the maneuver.\n\nThe pitchover maneuver consists of the rocket gimbaling its engine slightly to direct some of its thrust to one side. This force creates a net torque on the ship, turning it so that it no longer points vertically. The pitchover angle varies with the launch vehicle and is included in the rocket's inertial guidance system. For some vehicles it is only a few degrees, while other vehicles use relatively large angles (a few tens of degrees). After the pitchover is complete, the engines are reset to point straight down the axis of the rocket again. This small steering maneuver is the only time during an ideal gravity turn ascent that thrust must be used for purposes of steering. The pitchover maneuver serves two purposes. First, it turns the rocket slightly so that its flight path is no longer vertical, and second, it places the rocket on the correct heading for its ascent to orbit. After the pitchover, the rocket's angle of attack is adjusted to zero for the remainder of its climb to orbit. This zeroing of the angle of attack reduces lateral aerodynamic loads and produces negligible lift force during the ascent.\n\nAfter the pitchover, the rocket's flight path is no longer completely vertical, so gravity acts to turn the flight path back towards the ground. If the rocket were not producing thrust, the flight path would be a simple ellipse like a thrown ball (it's a common mistake to think it is a parabola: this is only true if it is assumed that the Earth is flat, and gravity always points in the same direction, which is a good approximation for short distances), leveling off and then falling back to the ground. The rocket is producing thrust though, and rather than leveling off and then descending again, by the time the rocket levels off, it has gained sufficient altitude and velocity to place it in a stable orbit.\n\nIf the rocket is a multi-stage system where stages fire sequentially, the rocket's ascent burn may not be continuous. Obviously, some time must be allowed for stage separation and engine ignition between each successive stage, but some rocket designs call for extra free-flight time between stages. This is particularly useful in very high thrust rockets, where if the engines were fired continuously, the rocket would run out of fuel before leveling off and reaching a stable orbit above the atmosphere. The technique is also useful when launching from a planet with a thick atmosphere, such as the Earth. Because gravity turns the flight path during free flight, the rocket can use a smaller initial pitchover angle, giving it higher vertical velocity, and taking it out of the atmosphere more quickly. This reduces both aerodynamic drag as well as aerodynamic stress during launch. Then later during the flight the rocket coasts between stage firings, allowing it to level off above the atmosphere, so when the engine fires again, at zero angle of attack, the thrust accelerates the ship horizontally, inserting it into orbit.\nBecause heat shields and parachutes cannot be used to land on an airless body such as the Moon, a powered descent with a gravity turn is a good alternative. The Apollo lunar module used a slightly modified gravity turn to land from lunar orbit. This was essentially a launch in reverse except that a landing spacecraft is lightest at the surface while a spacecraft being launched is heaviest at the surface. A computer program called Lander that simulated gravity turn landings applied this concept by simulating a gravity turn launch with a negative mass flow rate, i.e. the propellant tanks filled during the rocket burn. The idea of using a gravity turn maneuver to land a vehicle was originally developed for the Lunar Surveyor landings, although Surveyor made a direct approach to the surface without first going into lunar orbit.\n\nThe vehicle begins by orienting for a retrograde burn to reduce its orbital velocity, lowering its point of periapsis to near the surface of the body to be landed on. If the craft is landing on a planet with an atmosphere such as Mars the deorbit burn will only lower periapsis into the upper layers of the atmosphere, rather than just above the surface as on an airless body. After the deorbit burn is complete the vehicle can either coast until it is nearer to its landing site or continue firing its engine while maintaining zero angle of attack. For a planet with an atmosphere the coast portion of the trip includes reentry through the atmosphere as well.\n\nAfter the coast and possible reentry the vehicle jettisons any no longer necessary heat shields and/or parachutes in preparation for the final landing burn. If the atmosphere is thick enough it can be used to slow the vehicle a considerable amount, thus saving on fuel. In this case a gravity turn is not the optimal entry trajectory but it does allow for approximation of the true delta-v required. In the case where there is no atmosphere however, the landing vehicle must provide the full delta-v necessary to land safely on the surface.\n\nIf it is not already properly oriented, the vehicle lines up its engines to fire directly opposite its current surface velocity vector, which at this point is either parallel to the ground or only slightly vertical, as shown to the left. The vehicle then fires its landing engine to slow down for landing. As the vehicle loses horizontal velocity the gravity of the body to be landed on will begin pulling the trajectory closer and closer to a vertical descent. In an ideal maneuver on a perfectly spherical body the vehicle could reach zero horizontal velocity, zero vertical velocity, and zero altitude all at the same moment, landing safely on the surface (if the body is not rotating; else the horizontal velocity shall be made equal to the one of the body at the considered latitude). However, due to rocks and uneven surface terrain the vehicle usually picks up a few degrees of angle of attack near the end of the maneuver to zero its horizontal velocity just above the surface. This process is the mirror image of the pitch over maneuver used in the launch procedure and allows the vehicle to hover straight down, landing gently on the surface.\nThe steering of a rocket's course during its flight is divided into two separate components; control, the ability to point the rocket in a desired direction, and guidance, the determination of what direction a rocket should be pointed to reach a given target. The desired target can either be a location on the ground, as in the case of a ballistic missile, or a particular orbit, as in the case of a launch vehicle.\n\nThe gravity turn trajectory is most commonly used during early ascent. The guidance program is a precalculated lookup table of pitch vs time. Control is done with engine gimballing and/or aerodynamic control surfaces. The pitch program maintains a zero angle of attack (the definition of a gravity turn) until the vacuum of space is reached, thus minimizing lateral aerodynamic loads on the vehicle. (Excessive aerodynamic loads can quickly destroy the vehicle.) Although the preprogrammed pitch schedule is adequate for some applications, an adaptive inertial guidance system that determines location, orientation and velocity with accelerometers and gyroscopes, is almost always employed on modern rockets. The British satellite launcher Black Arrow was an example of a rocket that flew a preprogrammed pitch schedule, making no attempt to correct for errors in its trajectory, while the Apollo-Saturn rockets used \"closed loop\" inertial guidance after the gravity turn through the atmosphere.\n\nThe initial pitch program is an open-loop system subject to errors from winds, thrust variations, etc. To maintain zero angle of attack during atmospheric flight, these errors are not corrected until reaching space. Then a more sophisticated program can take over to correct trajectory deviations and attain the desired orbit. In the Apollo missions, the transition to closed-loop guidance took place early in second stage flight after maintaining a fixed inertial attitude while jettisoning the first stage and interstage ring. Because the upper stages of a rocket operate in a near vacuum, fins are ineffective. Steering relies entirely on engine gimballing and a reaction control system.\n\nTo serve as an example of how the gravity turn can be used for a powered landing, an Apollo type lander on an airless body will be assumed. The lander begins in a circular orbit docked to the command module. After separation from the command module the lander performs a retrograde burn to lower its periapsis to just above the surface. It then coasts to periapsis where the engine is restarted to perform the gravity turn descent. It has been shown that in this situation guidance can be achieved by maintaining a constant angle between the thrust vector and the line of sight to the orbiting command module. This simple guidance algorithm builds on a previous study which investigated the use of various visual guidance cues including the uprange horizon, the downrange horizon, the desired landing site, and the orbiting command module. The study concluded that using the command module provides the best visual reference, as it maintains a near constant visual separation from an ideal gravity turn until the landing is almost complete. Because the vehicle is landing in a vacuum, aerodynamic control surfaces are useless. Therefore, a system such as a gimballing main engine, a reaction control system, or possibly a control moment gyroscope must be used for attitude control.\n\nAlthough gravity turn trajectories use minimal steering thrust they are not always the most efficient possible launch or landing procedure. Several things can affect the gravity turn procedure making it less efficient or even impossible due to the design limitations of the launch vehicle. A brief summary of factors affecting the turn is given below.\n\n\nFor spacecraft missions where large changes in the direction of flight are necessary, direct propulsion by the spacecraft may not be feasible due to the large delta-v requirement. In these cases it may be possible to perform a flyby of a nearby planet or moon, using its gravitational attraction to alter the ship's direction of flight. Although this maneuver is very similar to the gravitational slingshot it differs in that a slingshot often implies a change in both speed and direction whereas the gravity turn only changes the direction of flight.\n\nA variant of this maneuver, the free return trajectory allows the spacecraft to depart from a planet, circle another planet once, and return to the starting planet using propulsion only during the initial departure burn. Although in theory it is possible to execute a perfect free return trajectory, in practice small correction burns are often necessary during the flight. Even though it does not require a burn for the return trip, other return trajectory types, such as an aerodynamic turn, can result in a lower total delta-v for the mission.\n\nMany spaceflight missions have utilized the gravity turn, either directly or in a modified form, to carry out their missions. What follows is a short list of various mission that have used this procedure.\n\n\nThe simplest case of the gravity turn trajectory is that which describes a point mass vehicle, in a uniform gravitational field, neglecting air resistance. The thrust force formula_1 is a vector whose magnitude is a function of time and whose direction can be varied at will. Under these assumptions the differential equation of motion is given by:\n\nHere formula_3 is a unit vector in the vertical direction and formula_4 is the instantaneous vehicle mass. By constraining the thrust vector to point parallel to the velocity and separating the equation of motion into components parallel to formula_5 and those perpendicular to formula_5 we arrive at the following system:\n\nHere the current thrust to weight ratio has been denoted by formula_7 and the current angle between the velocity vector and the vertical by formula_8. This results in a coupled system of equations which can be integrated to obtain the trajectory. However, for all but the simplest case of constant formula_9 over the entire flight, the equations cannot be solved analytically and must be integrated numerically.\n"}

Complexity or imprecision of verbal or written expression or diagram, often containing excessive use of jargon, dialect, mathematics, science, symbols, or diagrams. The metaphor makes reference to Greek (either ancient or modern), as an archetypal foreign form of communication both written and spoken. Technically, the phrase is classified as a dead metaphor, meaning that its components cannot be used separately, unlike for example the dormant metaphor \"foot of the hill\", which permits saying \"that hill has a tree at its foot\". \n\nIt may have been a direct translation of a similar phrase in (\"it is Greek, [therefore] it cannot be read\"). This phrase was increasingly used by monk scribes in the Middle Ages, as knowledge of the Greek alphabet and language was dwindling among those who were copying manuscripts in monastic libraries.\n\nRecorded usage of the metaphor in English traces back to the early modern period. It appears in 1599 in Shakespeare's play \"Julius Caesar\", as spoken by Servilius Casca to Cassius after a festival in which Caesar was offered a crown:\nHere, Casca's literal ignorance of Greek is the source of the phrase, using its common meaning to play on the uncertainty among the conspirators about Cicero's attitude to Caesar's increasingly regal behaviour. Shakespeare was not the only author to use the expression.\n\nIt was also used in 1603 by Thomas Dekker in his play \"Patient Grissel\":\nThe expression is almost exclusively used with reference to the speaker (generally \"Greek to me\"); Dekker's \"Greek to him\" is rare.\n\nDifferent languages have similar formulations. Many have picked the point of reference to be a foreign language with another alphabet or writing system.\n\nThis is an example of the usage of demonyms in relation to the ability of a people to be understood, comparable to the development of the words \"barbarian\" (one who babbles), \"Nemec\" (Slavic for \"the mute one\" indicating Germans).\n\nIn an article published by Arnold L. Rosenberg in the language journal \"Lingvisticæ Investigationes\", he claimed that there was a popular \"consensus\" that Chinese was the \"hardest\" language, since various non-English languages most frequently used the Chinese language in their equivalent expression to the English idiom \"it's all Greek to me\". Also, David Moser of the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies made the same claim as Arnold L. Rosenberg.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "597564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=597564", "title": "Just-noticeable difference", "text": "Just-noticeable difference\n\nIn the branch of experimental psychology focused on sense, sensation, and perception, which is called psychophysics, a just-noticeable difference or JND is the amount something must be changed in order for a difference to be noticeable, detectable at least half the time (absolute threshold). This limen is also known as the difference limen, differential threshold, or least perceptible difference.\n\nFor many sensory modalities, over a wide range of stimulus magnitudes sufficiently far from the upper and lower limits of perception, the 'JND' is a fixed proportion of the reference sensory level, and so the ratio of the JND/reference is roughly constant (that is the JND is a constant proportion/percentage of the reference level). Measured in physical units, we have:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the original intensity of the particular stimulation, formula_3 is the addition to it required for the change to be perceived (the JND), and \"k\" is a constant. This rule was first discovered by Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878), an anatomist and physiologist, in experiments on the thresholds of perception of lifted weights. A theoretical rationale (not universally accepted) was subsequently provided by Gustav Fechner, so the rule is therefore known either as the Weber Law or as the Weber–Fechner law; the constant \"k\" is called the Weber constant. It is true, at least to a good approximation, of many but not all sensory dimensions, for example the brightness of lights, and the intensity and the pitch of sounds. It is not true, however, of the wavelength of light. Stanley Smith Stevens argued that it would hold only for what he called \"prothetic\" sensory continua, where change of input takes the form of increase in intensity or something obviously analogous; it would not hold for \"metathetic\" continua, where change of input produces a qualitative rather than a quantitative change of the percept. Stevens developed his own law, called Stevens' Power Law, that raises the stimulus to a constant power while, like Weber, also multiplying it by a constant factor in order to achieve the perceived stimulus.\n\nThe JND is a statistical, rather than an exact quantity: from trial to trial, the difference that a given person notices will vary somewhat, and it is therefore necessary to conduct many trials in order to determine the threshold. The JND usually reported is the difference that a person notices on 50% of trials. If a different proportion is used, this should be included in the description—for example one might report the value of the \"75% JND\".\n\nModern approaches to psychophysics, for example signal detection theory, imply that the observed JND, even in this statistical sense, is not an absolute quantity, but will depend on situational and motivational as well as perceptual factors. For example, when a researcher flashes a very dim light, a participant may report seeing it on some trials but not on others.\n\nThe JND formula has an objective interpretation (implied at the start of this entry) as the disparity between levels of the presented stimulus that is detected on 50% of occasions by a particular observed response (Torgerson, 1958), rather than what is subjectively \"noticed\" or as a difference in magnitudes of consciously experienced 'sensations'. This 50%-discriminated disparity can be used as a universal unit of measurement of the psychological distance of the level of a feature in an object or situation and an internal standard of comparison in memory, such as the 'template' for a category or the 'norm' of recognition (Booth & Freeman, 1993). The JND-scaled distances from norm can be combined among observed and inferred psychophysical functions to generate diagnostics among hypothesised information-transforming (mental) processes mediating observed quantitative judgments (Richardson & Booth, 1993).\n\nIn music production, a single change in a property of sound which is below the JND does not affect perception of the sound. For amplitude, the JND for humans is around 1 dB (Middlebrooks & Green, 1991; Mills, 1960).\n\nThe \"just-noticeable difference (JND)\" (the threshold at which a change is perceived) depends on the tone's frequency content. Below 500 Hz, the JND is about 3 Hz for sine waves, and 1 Hz for complex tones; above 1000 Hz, the JND for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 cents).\nThe JND is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches. The JND becomes smaller if the two tones are played simultaneously as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies. The total number of perceptible pitch steps in the range of human hearing is about 1,400; the total number of notes in the equal-tempered scale, from 16 to 16,000 Hz, is 120.\n\nJND analysis is frequently occurring in both music and speech, the two being related and overlapping in the analysis of speech prosody (i.e. speech melody). While several studies have shown that JND for tones (not necessarily sine waves) might normally lie between 5 and 9 semitones (STs), a small percentage of individuals exhibit an accuracy of between a quarter and a half ST (Bachem, 1937). Although JND varies as a function of the frequency band being tested, it has been shown that JND for the best performers at around 1 kHz is well below 1 Hz, (i.e. less than a tenth of a percent (Ritsma, 1965; Nordmark, 1968; Rakowski, 1971). It is, however, important to be aware of the role played by critical bandwidth when performing this kind of analysis (Nordmark, 1968).\n\nWhen analysing speech melody, rather than musical tones, accuracy decreases. This is not surprising given that speech does not stay at fixed intervals in the way that tones in music do. Johan 't Hart (1981) found that JND for speech averaged between 1 and 2 STs but concluded that \"only differences of more than 3 semitones play a part in communicative situations\" ('t Hart, 1981, page 811).\n\nNote that, given the logarithmic characteristics of Hz, for both music and speech perception results should not be reported in Hz but either as percentages or in STs (5 Hz between 20 and 25 Hz is very different from 5 Hz between 2000 and 2005 Hz, but the same when reported as a percentage or in STs).\n\nWeber’s law has important applications in marketing. Manufacturers and marketers endeavor to determine the relevant JND for their products for two very different reasons:\n\n\nWhen it comes to product improvements, marketers very much want to meet or exceed the consumer’s differential threshold; that is, they want consumers to readily perceive any improvements made in the original products. Marketers use the JND to determine the amount of improvement they should make in their products. Less than the JND is wasted effort because the improvement will not be perceived; more than the JND is again wasteful because it reduces the level of repeat sales. On the other hand, when it comes to price increases, less than the JND is desirable because consumers are unlikely to notice it.\n\nWeber's law is used in haptic devices and robotic applications. Exerting the proper amount of force to human operator is a critical aspects in human robot interactions and tele operation scenarios. It can highly improve the performance of the user in accomplishing a task.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25383344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25383344", "title": "Jīva (Jainism)", "text": "Jīva (Jainism)\n\nThe Jīva or Atman (; ) is a philosophical term used within Jainism to identify the soul. As per the Jain cosmology, \"jīva\" or soul is the principle of sentience and is one of the \"tattvas\" or one of the fundamental substances forming part of the universe. The Jain metaphysics, states Jagmanderlal Jaini, divides the universe into two independent, everlasting, co-existing and uncreated categories called the \"jiva\" (soul) and the \"ajiva\" (non-soul). This basic premise of Jainism makes it a dualistic philosophy. The \"jiva\", according to Jainism, is an essential part of how the process of karma, rebirth and the process of liberation from rebirth works.\n\nJains regard soul as one of the six fundamental and eternal substances (\"dravyas\") which forms the universe. The two states of soul substance are mentioned in the Jain texts. These are — Svābhva (pure or natural) and Vibhāva (impure or unnatural state). Souls in transmigration are in impure state and liberated ones are said to be in natural or pure state.\n\nJain philosophy is the oldest Indian philosophy that completely separates matter from the soul. According to \"The Theosophist\", \"some religionists hold that Atman (Spirit) and Paramatman (God) are identical, while others assert that they are distinct ; but a Jain will say that Atman and Paramatman are identical as well as distinct.\"\n\nThe five vows of Jain practice are believed in Jainism to aid in freeing the \"jīva\" from karmic matter, reduce negative karmic effects and accrue positive karmic benefits.\n\nAccording to Jain philosophy, rebirth occurs through soul. Depending on the karmic particles attached to a soul, Jain theology states a being is reborn in one of four \"gatis\" (states of existence), namely, heavenly being (\"deva\"), human (\"manushya\"), hell being (\"naraki\") and animals and plants (\"triyancha\"). Besides this there also exist a sub-microscopic life form, Nigoda, possessing only one sense, i.e., of touch.\n\nIn Jain beliefs, souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through \"Saṃsāra\". Some evolve to a higher state, some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma. Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist \"Abhavya\" (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain moksha (liberation). The \"Abhavya\" state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act. Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-samsara cycle, and does not subscribe to Advaita style nondualism of Hinduism, or Advaya style nondualism of Buddhism.\n\nThe Jaina theosophy, like ancient Ajivika, but unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through \"Saṃsāra\". As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives. With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.\n\nA liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond \"Saṃsāra\", is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a \"Siddha\". A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in Jainism, particularly in the Digambara sect of Jainism; however, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Shvetambara sect that believes that women too can achieve liberation from \"Saṃsāra\".\n\nIn contrast to Buddhist texts which do not expressly or unambiguously condemn injuring or killing plants and minor life forms, Jaina texts do. Jainism considers it a bad karma to injure plants and minor life forms with negative impact on a soul's . However, some texts in Buddhism and Hinduism do caution a person from injuring all life forms, including plants and seeds.\n\nAccording to the Jain text, Samayasāra:\nAccording to Vijay Jain, the souls which rest on the pure self are called the Real Self, and only \"arihant\" and \"Siddhas\" are the Real Self.\n\nJain texts explain that there are fourteen stages of spiritual development called \"Gunasthana\". These are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "285073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285073", "title": "Kobayashi Maru", "text": "Kobayashi Maru\n\nThe Kobayashi Maru is a training exercise in the fictional \"Star Trek\" universe designed to test the character of Starfleet Academy cadets in a no-win scenario. The Kobayashi Maru test was first depicted in the opening scene of the film \"\" and also appears in the 2009 film \"Star Trek\". Screenwriter Jack B. Sowards is credited with inventing the test. The test's name is occasionally used among \"Star Trek\" fans or those familiar with the series to describe a no-win scenario, a test of one's character or a solution that involves redefining the problem and managing an insurmountable scenario gracefully.\n\nThe notional primary goal of the exercise is to rescue the civilian vessel \"Kobayashi Maru\" in a simulated battle with the Klingons. The disabled ship is located in the Klingon Neutral Zone, and any Starfleet ship entering the zone would cause an interstellar border incident. The approaching cadet crew must decide whether to attempt rescue of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" crew—endangering their own ship and lives—or leave the \"Kobayashi Maru\" to certain destruction. If the cadet chooses to attempt rescue, the simulation is designed to guarantee that the cadet's ship is destroyed with the loss of all crew members.\n\nIn \",\" the simulation takes place on a replica of a starship bridge, with the test-taker as captain and other Starfleet members, officers or other cadets, in other key positions. In the scenario of the 2280s, the cadet receives a distress signal stating that the civilian freighter \"Kobayashi Maru\" has struck a gravitic mine in the Klingon Neutral Zone and is rapidly losing power, hull integrity and life support. Sensor readings are indeterminate and there is no way to verify the distress signal. There are no other vessels nearby. The cadet must quickly make a decision:\n\n\nIf the cadet chooses to rescue the \"Kobayashi Maru\"s crew and passengers, the scenario progresses quickly. The bridge officers notify the cadet that they are in violation of the treaty between the Federation and the Klingons, giving the cadet a chance to turn back before finally committing to this dangerous action. As the starship enters the Neutral Zone, the communications officer loses contact with the crippled vessel. Klingon warships then quickly appear on an intercept course. Attempts to contact them are met with radio silence; indeed, their only response is to open fire with devastating results. No defense is sufficient against the Klingons and the cadet's ship is eventually defeated (and destroyed if the scenario plays out fully).\n\nNot depicted on film are the possible consequences of rejecting the rescue appeal. These are discussed at length in novels and video games and include mutiny of the crew over being asked to abandon civilians to die; violations of Starfleet policy regarding rendering of aid to distressed vessels; Klingon incursion into Federation territory responding to \"provocation\" by the \"Kobayashi Maru\"; or the weight on the cadet's conscience caused by refusing to render aid.\n\nThe objective of the test is not for the cadet to outfight or outplan the opponent but rather to force the cadet into a no-win situation and simply observe how he or she reacts.\n\nThe opening of \"\" is itself a \"Kobayashi Maru\" test, but this is not revealed until after the end of the scene, leading the audience to believe that this is a genuine combat scenario involving the USS \"Enterprise\". The test-taker, Saavik (Kirstie Alley), is in command of the simulated USS \"Enterprise\". During the test, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) serves as science officer and second-in-command, Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is standing by on the bridge, Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) as communications officer, and Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) as helm officer; cadets are at other positions. After the distress call is received, Saavik orders Sulu to plot an intercept course with the imperiled ship. Sulu warns Saavik against violating the Neutral Zone but she overrules him. Contact with the \"Kobayashi Maru\" is lost, and three Klingon battle cruisers appear on an intercept course. Outgunned and in violation of the Federation–Klingon treaty, Saavik orders a retreat, but the Klingon ships quickly overtake and cripple the \"Enterprise\". Further attacks kill Sulu, Uhura, McCoy, and Spock. Mr. Scott reports that the \"Enterprise\" is dead in space. Saavik orders that a log buoy be launched, and that the crew abandon ship.\n\nAdmiral James Kirk, who had been monitoring the situation from a control room, halts the simulation. All the \"deceased\" officers rise, and Spock (now revealed as the cadets' instructor) orders the trainees to the briefing room. Saavik protests being subjected to a no-win scenario, opining that it does not properly reflect her command abilities. Kirk explains that the test is meant to reveal how the subject deals with a no-win scenario, and that how one deals with death is as important as how one deals with life. Later in the film, after repeated inquiries from Saavik, Kirk says that the exercise is a true no-win scenario because there is no correct resolution—it is a test of character.\n\nThe scene used the same set as the bridge of the \"Enterprise\" (shown later in the film). The test is a vehicle to introduce the concept of the no-win scenario as presented to cadets. The main plot of the film deals with James Kirk's response when finally forced to face such a scenario in real life.\n\nJames T. Kirk took the test three times while at Starfleet Academy. Before his third attempt, Kirk surreptitiously reprogrammed the simulator so that it was possible to rescue the freighter. Despite having cheated, Kirk was awarded a commendation for \"original thinking\". This fact is revealed in \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\", as Kirk, Saavik and others are marooned. Saavik accuses Kirk of never having faced the no-win scenario. Kirk replies that he does not believe in it.\n\nThe 2009 J. J. Abrams film depicts cadet James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) reprogramming the test so the Klingon ships' shields suddenly drop, allowing all five to be destroyed with ease so the safe rescue of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" can commence. This incident earns him the ire of Spock, who is an Academy instructor maintaining the simulation and creator of the test.\n\nDuring a disciplinary hearing, Spock and Kirk meet for the first time and say many of the same lines that their characters originally used in \"The Wrath of Khan\". Kirk argues that the test itself is a cheat, since the program is unwinnable, and thus cheating is the only solution. Spock counters that the point of the test is not to win, but to face fear and accept the possibility of death, like Kirk's father did. Due to an attack on Vulcan by the film's villain Nero, the hearing is put on hold and left unresolved.\n\nIn the novelization of the film, the last chapter reveals that the information Kirk used to defeat the test was obtained during his trysts with an Orion female fellow cadet, who talked in her sleep.\n\nAs Spock had not entered Starfleet Academy as a command-track cadet, he did not take the \"Kobayashi Maru\" test while there. In his death scene at the conclusion of \"The Wrath of Khan\", he describes his sacrifice as his solution to the no-win scenario.\n\nDepictions of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" test are a fairly popular subject in \"Star Trek\" literature. Non-canonical examples of \"Kobayashi Maru\" tests have been described in many \"Star Trek\" novels. Much like Kirk, characters are frequently depicted as coming up with innovative or surprising ways of handling the situation.\n\n\"The Kobayashi Maru\" (1989) by Julia Ecklar tells how each of these officers faced the problem:\n\nIn the novel \"Dreadnought\" by Diane Carey, the protagonist, Piper, a recent academy graduate, manages to crash the entire simulator by attempting to improvise an engineering solution to the problem through an unorthodox series of computer commands and jury-rigging, essentially tricking the computer into fighting itself. Her instructors admit that her solution might theoretically have been successful.\n\nIn A.C. Crispin's novel \"Sarek\", Peter Kirk, James T. Kirk's nephew, uses his experiences throughout the novel to come up with another way to defeat the unwinnable scenario, this time against Romulan opponents. Upon entering the Romulan Neutral Zone, he provokes the Romulans, who are expected to destroy the \"Enterprise\". Before the Romulans open fire, Peter challenges the Romulan commander to a ritual fight to the death (using an obscure but still valid Romulan law predating their schism with the Vulcans), in which actual battle is prohibited until the contest is resolved. As Peter leaves the bridge to go to the simulation transporter room, he instructs the crew to beam aboard the \"survivors\" and escape, leaving him to certain death.\n\nThe simulation ends with the supervising instructor ending the test in confusion. Upon learning of Peter's trick, he promises to change the scenario to prevent it from being re-used. Peter is credited, however, with coming up with an actual \"winning\" solution: saving the \"Kobayashi Maru\" and his own ship by sacrificing himself. This echoes Spock's description of his own sacrifice depicted in \"The Wrath of Khan\" as his resolution of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" test.\n\nIn William Shatner's novel \"Avenger\", Captain Christine McDonald of the USS \"Tobias\" tells Captain Kirk that in her time, the \"Kobayashi Maru\" scenario is no longer used to test character, but rather to evaluate the \"original thinking\" for which Kirk had received a commendation. In the new version of the scenario, cadets are charged with coming up with ways to outsmart the simulation by reprogramming it to counter various moves made by the more advanced AI of the computer.\n\nIn his \"\" novels, Peter David suggests that future versions of the scenario would involve the Romulans.\n\nIn \"Stone and Anvil\", Mackenzie Calhoun realizes that it is impossible to rescue the \"Kobayashi Maru\". He uses the unorthodox solution of destroying the \"Kobayashi Maru\" itself. He determines that a rescue attempt will be unsuccessful, would likely end in failure and would probably also result in his own ship being destroyed or captured. His reasoning is that it is more merciful to kill the civilians outright rather than let them be captured (and likely tortured) by the Romulans. Alternatively, he proposes the possibility that the entire scenario is a Romulan trap and the \"Kobayashi Maru\" is in league with the Romulans, so destruction of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" is a valid attack on an enemy.\n\nThree short stories in the \"\" anthologies series have also tackled the test. In \"The Bottom Line\" by Andrew Morby (\"Strange New Worlds III\", 2000) and Shawn Michael Scott's \"Best Tools Available\" (\"Strange New Worlds VI,\" 2003), cadet Nog solves the scenario in two entirely different (and thoroughly Ferengi) manners.\n\nKevin Lauderdale's \"A Test of Character\" (\"Strange New Worlds VII\", 2004) depicts a different version of Kirk's solution from Ecklar's, in which Kirk's tampering is \"cheating without cheating,\" since he merely creates a level playing field where success is not necessarily guaranteed.\n\nIn this novel by Andy Mangels and Michael A. Martin, the scenario occurs as an actual plot event instead of a training exercise. The \"Kobayashi Maru\" is a retrofitted Klingon cargo vessel under Earth control and with a human crew. When the ship is struck by a gravitic mine, Captain Jonathan Archer and the crew of the \"Enterprise\" are sent to assist. Though forewarned that the \"Enterprise\" is entering a trap set by the Romulans, Archer attempts to rescue the crew and passengers of the \"Kobayashi Maru\". At this point three Klingon cruisers being controlled by remote Romulan telepresence systems drop out of warp and begin attacking the \"Enterprise\". As the ship's systems begin to fail from Romulan attempts to capture \"Enterprise\" via the same telepresence systems, Archer is forced to withdraw, preventing the capture of \"Enterprise\" but leaving the \"Kobayashi Maru\" to be destroyed.\n\nIn the video game \"\", one of the missions assigned to the player is the \"Kobayashi Maru\" scenario. The player – who controls the character of Cadet David Forrester – has a choice to make before the test. The player can have Forrester face the unaltered version of the test, or have Forrester reprogram the computer as Captain Kirk did, altering the scenario in one of three ways. He can reprogram the Klingon AI, making them fight poorly (they do not fire at all), reprogram the strength of the Klingon ships by making them easier to beat (in addition, their weapons cause no damage), or make the Klingon captains fear and respect him personally (Kirk's solution from the novel).\n\nIf the player cheats by altering the battle itself, he is treated to two larger waves of Klingon D7 cruisers after destroying the initial wave of three. After destroying those waves, the simulator computer crashes with a Guru Meditation error, and in debriefing the commandant remarks that he would be impressed were it not for the impossibility of such a feat.\n\nIf the player cheats by instilling fear and respect into the Klingon captains, he is able to hail the Klingons during the scenario. The Klingon captain extols Forrester's prowess, and agrees to help him rescue the freighter instead. This allows the scenario to complete successfully, and the commandant seems truly impressed in debriefing. No matter how the player cheats, if he chooses this option the cheating is detected by Academy staff, and Forrester is offered a chance to avoid punishment by helping the authorities with an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nIf the player decides to face the unaltered version, the ship is swiftly destroyed by the first wave of D7 cruisers, or if they opt to not rescue the ship, they are forced to listen to the crew of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" die. It is possible to defeat the Klingons in the unaltered version; however, before the player can rescue the crew of the \"Kobayashi Maru\", the game bugs out and the player's ship blows up anyway even though there are no Klingons left.\n\nThe video game \"\" offers an alternate version of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" test, though conditions are entirely different - The player, who controls the character of Cadet Torlek, is assigned to prevent an incident between the Klingon Empire and the Tholian forces on approach, in the midst of a simulated Klingon-Federation war. Unlike the choice of saving lives or not, the player has the choice of either attempting to perform his duty but failing, in which the Klingons are forced to compromise their campaign to hold back the Tholians, or to sully his honor by collaborating with the Tholians and surrendering Colonel Poktarhl (Torlek's commanding officer), but ultimately ending the incident.\n\nRegardless of the result, the player is berated by General Chang for his deeds, and Chang's response can depend on Torlek's attitudes - If the player accepts the punishment, Chang will be severe but ultimately retain the player, given only his success record, so far.

It holds that \"any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information-bearing degrees of freedom of the information-processing apparatus or its environment\".\n\nAnother way of phrasing Landauer's principle is that if an observer loses information about a physical system, the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.\n\nA so-called logically-reversible computation, in which no information is erased, may in principle be carried out without releasing any heat. This has led to considerable interest in the study of reversible computing. Indeed, without reversible computing, increases in the number of computations-per-joule-of-energy-dissipated must come to a halt by about 2050: because the limit implied by Landauer's principle will be reached by then, according to Koomey's law. \n\nAt 20 °C (room temperature, or 293.15 K), the Landauer limit represents an energy of approximately 0.0172 eV, or 2.75 zJ. Theoretically, roomtemperature computer memory operating at the Landauer limit could be changed at a rate of one billion bits per second with energy being converted to heat in the memory media at the rate of only 2.85 trillionths of a watt (that is, at a rate of only 2.85 pJ/s). Modern computers use millions of times as much energy per second.\n\nRolf Landauer first proposed the principle in 1961 while working at IBM. He rigorously justified and stated important limits to an earlier conjecture by John von Neumann. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as being simply the Landauer bound or Landauer limit.\n\nIn 2011, the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost. Instead, the cost can be taken in another conserved quantity, such as angular momentum.\n\nIn a 2012 article published in \"Nature\", a team of physicists from the École normale supérieure de Lyon, University of Augsburg and the University of Kaiserslautern described that for the first time they have measured the tiny amount of heat released when an individual bit of data is erased.\n\nIn 2014, physical experiments tested Landauer's principle and confirmed its predictions.\n\nIn 2016, researchers used a laser probe to measure the amount of energy dissipation that resulted when a nanomagnetic bit flipped from off to on. Flipping the bit required 15 millielectron volts (3 zeptojoules).\n\nA 2018 article published in \"Nature Physics\" features a Landauer erasure performed at cryogenic temperatures (T = 1K) on an array of high-spin (S = 10) quantum molecular magnets. The array is made to act as a spin register where each nanomagnet encodes a single bit of information. The experiment has laid the foundations for the extension of the validity of the Landauer principle to the quantum realm. Owing to the fast dynamics and low \"inertia\" of the single spins used in the experiment, the researchers also showed how an erasure operation can be carried out at the lowest possible thermodynamic cost — that imposed by the Landauer principle — and at a high speed. \n\nLandauer's principle can be understood to be a simple logical consequence of the second law of thermodynamics—which states that the entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease—together with the definition of thermodynamic temperature. For, if the number of possible logical states of a computation were to decrease as the computation proceeded forward (logical irreversibility), this would constitute a forbidden decrease of entropy, unless the number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state were to simultaneously increase by at least a compensating amount, so that the total number of possible physical states was no smaller than it was originally (i.e. total entropy has not decreased).\n\nYet, an increase in the number of physical states corresponding to each logical state means that, for an observer who is keeping track of the logical state of the system but not the physical state (for example an \"observer\" consisting of the computer itself), the number of possible physical states has increased; in other words, entropy has increased from the point of view of this observer.\n\nThe maximum entropy of a bounded physical system is finite. (If the holographic principle is correct, then physical systems with finite surface area have a finite maximum entropy; but regardless of the truth of the holographic principle, quantum field theory dictates that the entropy of systems with finite radius and energy is finite due to the Bekenstein bound.) To avoid reaching this maximum over the course of an extended computation, entropy must eventually be expelled to an outside environment.\n\nLandauer's principle asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the \"Landauer limit\":\nwhere \"k\" is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38×10 J/K), \"T\" is the temperature of the heat sink in kelvins, and ln 2 is the natural logarithm of 2 (approximately 0.69315).\n\nFor an environment at temperature \"T\", energy \"E\" = \"ST\" must be emitted into that environment if the amount of added entropy is \"S\". For a computational operation in which 1 bit of logical information is lost, the amount of entropy generated is at least \"k\" ln 2, and so, the energy that must eventually be emitted to the environment is \"E\" ≥ \"kT\" ln 2.\n\nThe principle is widely accepted as physical law, but in recent years it has been challenged for using circular reasoning and faulty assumptions, notably in Earman and Norton (1998), and subsequently in Shenker (2000) and Norton (2004, 2011), and defended by Bennett (2003) and Ladyman et al. (2007).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2328272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328272", "title": "Leibzoll", "text": "Leibzoll\n\nThe Leibzoll (German: \"body tax\") was a special toll which Jews had to pay in most of the European states in the Middle Ages and up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe origin of the Leibzoll may be traced to the political position of the Jews in Germany, where they were considered crown property and, therefore, under the king's protection. In his capacity as Holy Roman emperor the king claimed the exclusive rights of the jurisdiction and taxation of the Jews, and retained responsibility for the protection of their lives and their property. He granted them protection either by a guard or by safe-conduct; chiefly by the latter, for the Jews, being extensive travelers, when they went on long business trips could not always be accompanied by imperial guards. The first instance of the granting of one of these safe-conducts occurred under Louis le Débonnaire (814–840), and a specimen of it may be found among the documents preserved in the \"Liber Formularum\" of that period. According to this document the king grants freedom of travel and exemption from all taxes to three Jews of Lyons \"neque teloneum, neque paravereda aut mansionaticum, aut pulveraticum, aut cespitaticum, aut ripaticum, aut rotaticum, aut portaticum, aut herbaticum prædictis Hebræis exigere præsumant\" (De Rozières, \"Recueil Général des Formules Usitées dans l'Empire des Francs,\" i. 41–43, Paris, 1859–1871; Simson, \"Jahrbücher des Fränkischen Reiches Unter Ludwig, dem Frommen,\" i. 393–396, Leipsic, 1874–76). For such a safe-conduct the Jews were required to pay a certain fee; but this, being understood, is not stated anywhere, as the payment constitutes the only reason for the exemption from other taxes. The stipulations regulating the tolls of Raffelstetten, , issued between 904–906, are to be interpreted in the same manner—the Jews, as privileged merchants, shall not pay more than the regular toll (\"justum theloneum\"). The law expressly states this conforms with the ancient custom (Pertz, \"Mon. Germaniæ Leges,\" iii. 480; Georg Waitz, \"Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte\", iv. 1, 70, Kiel, 1884; Scherer, \"Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden,\" p. 110, Leipsic, 1901); the same is stated in the charter granted to the Jews of Worms, 1090 (\"Zeitschrift für die Gesch. der Juden in Deutschland,\" i. 139). When the Jews passed under the jurisdiction of the territorial rulers, this principle was acknowledged. Frederick II of Austria, in his law on the Jews, issued 1244, decreed that within the limits of his state they should not pay more than the legal rate of toll—the same rate that all other citizens had to pay (Scherer, l.c. p. 181). As in the stipulations regulating the , and as in the law of Frederick II, only customs duties for goods or slaves were mentioned: therefore a personal tax was unknown.\n\nAs the Jews in increasing numbers passed under territorial jurisdiction, the exemption from personal tax, which was granted them as long as they remained crown property, was no longer respected, for each territorial ruler considered himself entitled to levy taxes on all foreign Jewish subjects who passed through his territory. But these taxes continued as customs duties until, with the growing hostility of the free cities, and with the frequent expulsion from vast territories which became the rule in the fifteenth century, those rulers who had expelled the Jews from their domains determined on the adoption of a policy of keeping them away from their borders. International relations, however, would not permit of the disregard of a passport granted by a foreign ruler to one of his subjects, so when Jews visited a territory in which no Jew was permitted to settle they were subjected to the payment of a toll.\n\nOwing to the weakness of the imperial power of the Holy Roman Empire, Jews expelled from a place could easily settle in the vicinity, and on the strength of their passports do business in the place from which they had been expelled. So the Jews expelled from Nuremberg in 1499 settled in Fürth; those expelled from Nördlingen (1507) settled in ; those who could not gain entrance into the city of Lübeck settled in the village of —all places of settlement within easy walking distance of the cities in which they were denied residence. On the passports issued to them by their respective sovereigns they could engage in trade in the latter places, at least during the day, and, therefore, since the local governments wished to enforce the decrees excluding the Jews, they were driven to adopt new measures (\"R. E. J.\" viii. 212). Administrators soon recognized the financial utility of the Leibzoll, and the territorial rulers in the German empire levied such a toll from all traveling Jews, whether foreigners or their own subjects. In Nuremberg the average annual value of the toll for the last ten years during which Leibzoll was levied (1797–1806) was 2,448 florins (Barbeck, \"Gesch. der Juden in Nürnberg und Fürth,\" p. 106, Nuremberg, 1878).\n\nThe wording of the laws sometimes also suggests an intention of humiliating the Jews. For example, an ordinance of Philip V of Spain (1703) fixes the toll for a wagon-load of merchandise, one head of cattle, or one Jew, when passing over the bridges of Luxembourg, at four sols (\"R. E. J.\" viii. 208). Sometimes the humiliation lay in the form in which the tax was levied. In some places a Jew passing a toll-gate had to cast dice in remembrance of the crucifixion (Grätz, \"Gesch.\" 3d ed., viii. 14); elsewhere, as in Freiberg, in Saxony, Jews were forced to pay for a guard to follow them as long as they remained within the city. Even after the Leibzoll had been officially abolished, as in Austria by Emperor Joseph II in 1782, Jews entering Vienna or staying there for some time had to pay a special tax which differed from Leibzoll only in name. The same may be said of Nuremberg, where Leibzoll was abolished theoretically in 1800, but was levied practically until 1806 under the name of \"Passier- und Eintrittsgeld\". In Warsaw, where the French government had emancipated the Jews, the Russian government re-introduced the Leibzoll under the name of \"Tagzettel\", requiring every Jew entering the city to pay five silver groschen for the first day and three for every additional day he remained (\"Allg. Zeit. des Jud.\" 1862, p. 12).\n\nCertain exemptions from Leibzoll were granted. Under the Austrian law of 1244, corpses were exempt. Albert III, Duke of Austria gave free safe-conduct to three Austrian Jews to bring \"etrogim\" from Triest free of duty in 1389 (Scherer, l.c. p. 535). The Jews living within the territory of the Elector of Mayence were exempted from Leibzoll when they were traveling to attend one of the regular landtags, or to meetings of the district congregations (see Bamberger, \"Histor. Berichte über die Juden der Stadt Aschaffenburg,\" p. 26, Strasburg, 1900). As a mark of special favor, court Jews or mint-farmers were exempt from the payment of such tolls (see Harburg). Later the exemption was extended to manufacturers; and Hirsch David, velvet-manufacturer of Berlin, was exempted by the king (1731) because his business required him to travel frequently (\"Allg. Zeit. des Jud.\" 1902, p. 477). When Meyerbeer went to Vienna, the \"Judenamt\" received orders to treat him \"not as a Jew, but as a cavalier\" (ib. 1847, p. 91). Native Jews were often exempted, for a fixed sum, from paying this toll, but naturally this freed them from it only within the confines of their own country. Thus the Jews of Saxony were exempt from the Leibzoll by an order dated 16 April 1773 (Levy, \"Geschichte der Juden in Sachsen,\" p. 71, Berlin, 1901). The Jews of Berlin compromised with the elector, in 1700, by paying 1,000 ducats annually; this sum (\"Jüdische Presse,\" 22 Aug. 1902) exempted only those who were in the possession of a lawful charter (\"Schutzbrief\"), which had replaced the old safe-conduct (\"Judengeleit\"), and who therefore were called \"vergleitete Juden\" or \"escorted Jews\".\n\nIn December, 1787, Frederick William II of Prussia abolished the Leibzoll in Berlin, and in July, 1788, he abolished it in other places. The abolition of the toll was due largely to the exertions of David Friedländer. In 1791 the Bishop of Salzburg also abolished the toll in his own dominions.\n\nNotwithstanding the liberal spirit which these abolitions showed, the majority of the German states still clung to the tax. With the advent of the French, however, some of them were compelled to abolish the Leibzoll. Early in July, 1798, the French general Cacatte informed the members of the government at Nassau-Usingen that, at the order of the division commander Freitag, the special taxes of the Jews were to be abolished, as they were repugnant to justice and humanity. In consequence of this order the Jews on the left bank of the Rhine were relieved from the payment of Leibzoll. At the conclusion of the peace of Lunéville (21 July 1801) the toll was re-imposed.\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century the Jews of Germany found a courageous champion in , who worked persistently for the abolition of this impost. Perceiving that ample resources would be required to carry on his campaign, and not being personally able to command these, he invoked the aid of the German and foreign Jews in 1803, asking them to subscribe to the fund raised for this purpose. He instituted negotiations with the minor German princes at the Diet of Ratisbon (1804), and, aided by Dalberg, the imperial chancellor, succeeded in obtaining free passage for the Jews throughout the Rhine provinces and Bavaria. It was largely due to his efforts that the Leibzoll was abolished in Kurhessen, Hohenlohe, Neuwied, Wied-Runkel, Braunfels, Solms-Rödelheim, and also in Nassau (September, 1806). The emancipation of the Jews from these imposts created much antagonism; and among those opposed to it were such men as Paalzow, Grattenauer, and Buchholz. In the northern Hanse towns the French garrisons compelled the burghers to relieve the Jews from the payment of the Leibzoll, and, notwithstanding much opposition, secured the privilege for the Jews of Hamburg, Lübeck, and Bremen. The Leibzoll was abolished in Brunswick-Lüneburg 23 April 1823, through the efforts of Israel Jacobson, court agent to the Duke of Brunswick. Although the tax had been almost universally abolished, its collection still continued from the Jews visiting Vienna in the reign (1804–1835) of Francis I of Austria. Of the German states, Saxony was the last to abolish it.\n\nUp to 1862 the Polish Jews visiting Russia were treated as foreigners, and as such were not admitted into the interior of the empire. On the other hand, the Russian Jews had great difficulty in entering Poland, and those who went there for business had to pay a \"Geleitzoll.\" In 1826 the representatives of the Jewish community of Kovno petitioned the government for the abolition of the tax, which amounted then to fifteen Polish florins. By order of Emperor Nicholas I this application was referred to the Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, then Viceroy of Poland, who stated that he considered the abolition of the tax inexpedient, but proposed decreasing its amount and regulating it according to age, sex, and business occupation. He deemed it advisable to introduce a similar tax in Russia, and suggested that each Polish Jew entering Russia, and each Russian Jew entering Poland, should be supplied with a pass descriptive of the place of its issuance, the bearer's business, etc. The local police was to be charged with the inspection of the passes. In consequence of this report, Emperor Nicholas ordered the minister of finance to communicate with the proper authorities, and to draft the regulations for the introduction of the tax in question. After a prolonged correspondence with the Polish authorities the minister found the proposed measure to be inexpedient, not only because of the decrease in the revenues which it would effect, but also because of possible complications and abuses in its enforcement. The \"Geleitzoll\", therefore, remained until abolished by an ukase of 24 May 1862.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22074859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22074859", "title": "Maze solving algorithm", "text": "Maze solving algorithm\n\nThere are a number of different maze solving algorithms, that is, automated methods for the solving of mazes. The random mouse, wall follower, Pledge, and Trémaux's algorithms are designed to be used inside the maze by a traveler with no prior knowledge of the maze, whereas the dead-end filling and shortest path algorithms are designed to be used by a person or computer program that can see the whole maze at once.\n\nMazes containing no loops are known as \"simply connected\", or \"perfect\" mazes, and are equivalent to a \"tree\" in graph theory. Thus many maze solving algorithms are closely related to graph theory. Intuitively, if one pulled and stretched out the paths in the maze in the proper way, the result could be made to resemble a tree.\n\nThis is a trivial method that can be implemented by a very unintelligent robot or perhaps a mouse. It is simply to proceed following the current passage until a junction is reached, and then to make a random decision about the next direction to follow. Although such a method would always eventually find the right solution, this algorithm can be extremely slow.\n\nThe wall follower, the best-known rule for traversing mazes, is also known as either the \"left-hand rule\" or the \"right-hand rule\". If the maze is \"simply connected\", that is, all its walls are connected together or to the maze's outer boundary, then by keeping one hand in contact with one wall of the maze the solver is guaranteed not to get lost and will reach a different exit if there is one; otherwise, he or she will return to the entrance having traversed every corridor next to that connected section of walls at least once.\n\nAnother perspective into why wall following works is topological. If the walls are connected, then they may be deformed into a loop or circle. Then wall following reduces to walking around a circle from start to finish. To further this idea, notice that by grouping together connected components of the maze walls, the boundaries between these are precisely the solutions, even if there is more than one solution (see figures on the right).\n\nIf the maze is not simply-connected (i.e. if the start or endpoints are in the center of the structure surrounded by passage loops, or the pathways cross over and under each other and such parts of the solution path are surrounded by passage loops), this method will not reach the goal.\n\nAnother concern is that care should be taken to begin wall-following at the entrance to the maze. If the maze is not simply-connected and one begins wall-following at an arbitrary point inside the maze, one could find themselves trapped along a separate wall that loops around on itself and containing no entrances or exits. Should it be the case that wall-following begins late, attempt to mark the position in which wall-following began. Because wall-following will always lead you back to where you started, if you come across your starting point a second time, you can conclude the maze is not simply-connected, and you should switch to an alternative wall not yet followed. See the \"Pledge Algorithm\", below, for an alternative methodology.\n\nWall-following can be done in 3D or higher-dimensional mazes if its higher-dimensional passages can be projected onto the 2D plane in a deterministic manner. For example, if in a 3D maze \"up\" passages can be assumed to lead northwest, and \"down\" passages can be assumed to lead southeast, then standard wall following rules can apply. However, unlike in 2D, this requires that the current orientation be known, to determine which direction is the first on the left or right.\n\nDisjoint mazes can be solved with the wall follower method, so long as the entrance and exit to the maze are on the outer walls of the maze. If however, the solver starts inside the maze, it might be on a section disjoint from the exit, and wall followers will continually go around their ring. The Pledge algorithm (named after Jon Pledge of Exeter) can solve this problem.\n\nThe Pledge algorithm, designed to circumvent obstacles, requires an arbitrarily chosen direction to go toward, which will be preferential. When an obstacle is met, one hand (say the right hand) is kept along the obstacle while the angles turned are counted (clockwise turn is positive, counter-clockwise turn is negative). When the solver is facing the original preferential direction again, and the angular sum of the turns made is 0, the solver leaves the obstacle and continues moving in its original direction.\n\nThe hand is removed from the wall only when both \"sum of turns made\" and \"current heading\" are at zero. This allows the algorithm to avoid traps shaped like an upper case letter \"G\". Assuming the algorithm turns left at the first wall, one gets turned around a full 360 degrees by the walls. An algorithm that only keeps track of \"current heading\" leads into an infinite loop as it leaves the lower rightmost wall heading left and runs into the curved section on the left hand side again. The Pledge algorithm does not leave the rightmost wall due to the \"sum of turns made\" not being zero at that point (note 360 degrees is not equal to 0 degrees). It follows the wall all the way around, finally leaving it heading left outside and just underneath the letter shape.\n\nThis algorithm allows a person with a compass to find their way from any point inside to an outer exit of any finite two-dimensional maze, regardless of the initial position of the solver. However, this algorithm will not work in doing the reverse, namely finding the way from an entrance on the outside of a maze to some end goal within it.\n\nTrémaux's algorithm, invented by Charles Pierre Trémaux, is an efficient method to find the way out of a maze that requires drawing lines on the floor to mark a path, and is guaranteed to work for all mazes that have well-defined passages.\nA path from a junction is either unvisited, marked once or marked twice. The algorithm works according to the following rules:\nWhen you finally reach the solution, paths marked exactly once will indicate a way back to the start. If there is no exit, this method will take you back to the start where all paths are marked twice.\nIn this case each path is walked down exactly twice, once in each direction. The resulting walk is called a bidirectional double-tracing.\n\nEssentially, this algorithm, which was discovered in the 19th century, has been used about a hundred years later as depth-first search.\n\nDead-end filling is an algorithm for solving mazes that fills all dead ends, leaving only the correct ways unfilled. It can be used for solving mazes on paper or with a computer program, but it is not useful to a person inside an unknown maze since this method looks at the entire maze at once. The method is to 1) find all of the dead-ends in the maze, and then 2) \"fill in\" the path from each dead-end until the first junction is met. Note that some passages won't become parts of dead end passages until other dead ends are removed first. A video of dead-end filling in action can be seen here: .\n\nDead-end filling cannot accidentally \"cut off\" the start from the finish since each step of the process preserves the topology of the maze. Furthermore, the process won't stop \"too soon\" since the end result cannot contain any dead-ends. Thus if dead-end filling is done on a perfect maze (maze with no loops), then only the solution will remain. If it is done on a partially braid maze (maze with some loops), then every possible solution will remain but nothing more. \n\nIf given an omniscient view of the maze, a simple recursive algorithm can tell one how to get to the end. The algorithm will be given a starting X and Y value. If the X and Y values are not on a wall, the method will call itself with all adjacent X and Y values, making sure that it did not already use those X and Y values before. If the X and Y values are those of the end location, it will save all the previous instances of the method as the correct path. Here is a sample code in Java:\nThe maze-routing algorithm is a low overhead method to find the way between any two locations of the maze. The algorithm is initially proposed for chip multiprocessors (CMPs) domain and guarantees to work for any grid-based maze. In addition to finding paths between two location of the grid (maze), the algorithm can detect when there is no path between the source and destination. Also, the algorithm is to be used by an inside traveler with no prior knowledge of the maze with fixed memory complexity regardless of the maze size; requiring 4 variables in total for finding the path and detecting the unreachable locations. Nevertheless, the algorithm is not to find the shortest path.\n\nMaze-routing algorithm uses the notion of Manhattan distance (MD) and relies on the property of grids that the MD increments/decrements \"exactly\" by 1 when moving from one location to any 4 neighboring locations. Here is the pseudocode without the capability to detect unreachable locations.\n\nWhen a maze has multiple solutions, the solver may want to find the shortest path from start to finish. There are several algorithms to find shortest paths, most of them coming from graph theory. One possible algorithm finds the shortest path by implementing a breadth-first search, while another, the A* algorithm, uses a heuristic technique. The breadth-first search algorithm uses a queue to visit cells in increasing distance order from the start until the finish is reached. Each visited cell needs to keep track of its distance from the start or which adjacent cell nearer to the start caused it to be added to the queue. When the finish location is found, follow the path of cells backwards to the start, which is the shortest path. The breadth-first search in its simplest form has its limitations, like finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.\n\n\n"}

Thus, people in lower or upper classes can also possess middle-class values, they are not exclusive to people who are actually middle-class. Contemporary politicians in Western countries frequently refer to such values, and to the middle-class families that uphold them, as worthy of political support.\n\nMiddle-class values can be contrasted with other values that may be held by other people belonging to other classes and historical time periods, such as:\n\nBritish economic historian Gregory Clark has controversially claimed, in his book \"A Farewell to Alms\", on the basis of extensive research, that Britain may have been where the Industrial Revolution began because the British people had a head start in \"evolving\"through a combination of cultural and possibly even genetic changesa critical mass of people with middle-class values.\n\nOthers have claimed, by contrast, that the \"natural inclination\" of workers at the early stages of the Industrial Revolution was to work as few hours as needed to earn a subsistence living, and workers had to be brainwashed into working long hours. Some have claimed that compulsory education and advertising played a part in this brainwashing - compulsory education instilling obedience and hard work at an early age, and advertising instilling desire for consumer goods that had to be paid for with more work.\n\nIn A Farewell to Alms Clark disputes such explanations, citing persistent large differences in labour productivity in India and Britain, even when British managers and identical machines to those used in Britain were used, and even though both countries have compulsory education for children.\n\nSince the middle class is the dominant class in western modernity (specifically after the industrial revolution), middle-class values hold cultural capital and hegemony over western modernial cultures. Middle class values are thus imposed upon an entire population through economic and cultural means. That is, those living within the bounds of western modernity must conform to middle-class expectations in order to gain access to wealth or cultural legibility. Middle-class values, or the lack thereof, are transmitted from parents to children, by schools, by employers, and by mainstream media, such as the quintessentially middle-class newspaper \"The Daily Mail\".\n\nAccording to Gregory Clark, it is possible that there is also a substantial genetic component, and this is why social mobility is so low across societies and across history, as he establishes in his book The Son Also Rises. However, this view is highly problematic, ethnocentric, and eurocentric as it naturalizes and self-validates middle-class dominance.\n\n\n"}

Such a tensor can be defined as a linear function which maps an (\"M\" + \"N\")-tuple of \"M\" one-forms and \"N\" vectors to a scalar. \n\nConsider the following octet of related tensors:\nThe first one is covariant, the last one contravariant, and the remaining ones mixed.

{"id": "8680973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8680973", "title": "Negative priming", "text": "Negative priming\n\nNegative priming is an implicit memory effect in which prior exposure to a stimulus unfavorably influences the response to the same stimulus. It falls under the category of priming, which refers to the change in the response towards a stimulus due to a subconscious memory effect. Negative priming describes the slow and error-prone reaction to a stimulus that is previously ignored. For example, a subject may be imagined trying to pick a red pen from a pen holder. The red pen becomes the target of attention, so the subject responds by moving their hand towards it. At this time, they mentally block out all other pens as distractors to aid in closing in on just the red pen. After repeatedly picking the red pen over the others, switching to the blue pen results in a momentary delay picking the pen out (however, there is a decline in the negative priming effect when there is more than one nontarget item that is selected against). The slow reaction due to the change of the distractor stimulus to target stimulus is called the negative priming effect.\n\nNegative priming is believed to play a crucial role in attention and memory retrieval processes. When stimuli are perceived through the senses, all the stimuli are encoded within the brain, where each stimulus has its own internal representation. In this perceiving process, some of the stimuli receive more attention than others. Similarly, only some of them are stored in short-term memory. Negative priming is highly related to the selective nature of attention and memory.\n\nBroadly, negative priming is also known as the mechanism by which inhibitory control is applied to cognition. This refers only to the inhibition stimuli that can interfere with the current short-term goal of creating a response. The effectiveness of inhibiting the interferences depends on the cognitive control mechanism as a higher number of distractors yields higher load on working memory. Increased load on working memory can in turn result in slower perceptual processing leading to delayed reaction. Therefore, negative priming effect depends on the amount of distractors, effectiveness of the cognitive control mechanism and the availability of the cognitive control resources.\n\nThere are a number of theories and models that try to explain the reason behind negative priming. They all try to reason negative priming's role in cognition and justify why it occurs. A few of the well-known models are presented below.\n\nDistractor inhibition model is the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect as the result of selective attention to a target stimulus. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, we perceive other stimuli surrounding the target as distractors in order to help focus. But when one of those distractors becomes the new target of attention, our response to the target is hampered due to immediate residual inhibition. Selective attention is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other distractors that also compete for a response. To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving excitation to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress distractors. This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the internal representations of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's internal representation is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the internal representation of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate already. This is referred to as the transient residual inhibition. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater reaction time.\n\nThere are a few problems associated with this inhibition model. This model accounts for negative priming only when the stimuli are repetitively ignored as distractors during a goal directed behavior of selecting the target stimulus. This model does not support negative priming effects found in cases short of goal directed behavior. Another issue is that negative priming effects have been found to be long-term contradicting to the proposed transient residual inhibition. Long-term persistence of negative priming questions the validity of the distractor inhibition model.\n\nThe episodic retrieval model is the current popular model and explains that negative priming occurs due to memory retrieval. This model theorizes that each encounter with a stimulus is encoded and stored separately as an individual episode. Each episode includes perceptual details of both the stimuli and the response developed for that stimulus. When a stimulus is encountered the second time, the previous episode regarding that stimulus along with its tags of perceptual details, role in selective attention, and response given are all retrieved automatically. When the repetitively ignored distractor stimulus is encountered as the target, a tag associated with the response to the stimulus is also retrieved. This response tag of a distractor will likely be \"do-not-respond\" tag as opposed to the \"respond\" tag of the target stimulus. Retrieval of the previous \"do-not respond\" tag of the stimulus conflicts with the current \"respond\" tag. This presents a problem of whether to respond or not. Resolving this conflict takes time and produces negative priming effect.\n\nEpisode retrieval model has gained more popularity over the last decade compared to the distractor inhibition model due to the issues with long-term negative priming. Episode retrieval varies from the distractor inhibition model because it claims that the negative priming occurs only when the memory of the stimuli is retrieved and not during the encoding of the distractor stimuli. Recent findings lean towards this model but the model itself is not entirely complete. Its idea of association tags like the \"do-not-respond\" tag is vague and needs concrete evidence to support this model.\n\nDue to the issues found with the distractor inhibition model, Tipper and Houghton modified the distractor inhibition model to account for long-term negative priming effects. The original inhibition account proposed that inhibition occurs only when the distractors are suppressed. The Houghton–Tipper model revised this proposition and claims that inhibition occurs during both the encoding of distractors and the retrieval of that memory. The main reason for this change is to explain the long-term negative priming and justify it using the new combined model. When a repeated distractor becomes the target, processing of this stimulus automatically retrieves the memory of the stimulus being inhibited as a distractor. This model suggests that inhibition occurs when ignoring the distractor and during the memory retrieval of the previous ignorance of the stimulus. Therefore, it incorporates the inhibition account in selective attention and the episode retrieval model.\n\nThis theory proposes that negative priming effect is the result of interference due to the target being located where the distractor was once located. When the target stimulus and distractor stimulus are repeatedly placed in the same location, we know their respective location and pay attention more to the location of the target than the target itself. Our response to the target is also faster because we have already identified where to pay attention. This is called Simon effect, which refers our innate tendency to respond faster and more accurately when stimuli occur in the same location. This can be explained by neuroscience in terms of neural facilitation and short-term plasticity. However, if the positions of the stimuli are not the same as before, it is no longer easy to attend to the target as it once was. The feature mismatch hypothesis states that inhibition occurs when there is a mismatch between the target and its location. \nThis theory is explains the effects of location specific negative priming but lacks in its justification of negative priming when location is not involved. It deviates from the distractor inhibition model to describe location specific negative priming but has more loop holes than the other models.\n\nTemporal discrimination model attempts to blend in both the selective attention and memory retrieval aspects of negative priming in a less complex model. It is based on the assumption that negative priming is caused only at the moment of response to a stimulus that was previously considered distractor. This model explains negative priming as the delayed response due to confusion in classifying a stimulus as old or new. A new stimulus is immediately classified as new and undergoes perceptual processing. A repeated old stimulus is familiar and cues the automatic retrieval of the prior episode. A stimulus that has been repetitively ignored prior to becoming the target is neither entirely new nor old. This ambiguity slows down the processing of the stimuli. The temporal discrimination model points to this ambiguity as the cause of slowed categorization of the stimulus leading to negative priming effect. Like feature mismatch hypothesis, this model also claims that negative priming is not due to selective attention of the target or the inhibition of the distractor. This model argues that \"negative priming is an emergent consequence of a discrimination process that is inherent to memory retrieval\". Temporal discrimination model explains negative priming without reference to inhibition of distractors or the \"do not respond\" tag and by simple discrimination of \"old\", \"new\" and \"in between\" categories.\n\nExperiments on negative priming consist of two main components: prime and probe. Prime trial tries to mimic real life experiences of distractor stimuli in target selection but with more repetition to get quantifiable negative priming data. It comprises the initial presentation and the repetitive trials of the target and the distractor stimuli. It is set up such that a set of distractor stimuli are constantly ignored in the process of target selection. In the previous example provided, prime refers to the repeated perception of the blue pen as the distractor. Probe trial in an experiment refers to the actual testing for negative priming effects. In this trial, the repeated distractor of the prime trial is presented as the target. The reaction time of the response for the probe target (prime distractor) is measured to quantify the negative priming effect.\n\nSome experiments may use additional interferences such as changing the position of the stimuli or presenting completely irrelevant stimuli during either of these trials. The magnitude of negative priming effects are found to be higher with these interferences. Interferences are used to investigate how the response to the distractor changes under conditions of a third interfering stimulus.\n\nThe primary two stimulus modalities used for negative priming research are visual and auditory stimulus materials. The stimulus presented varied from objects or symbols in visual field to human voices or artificial sounds. Stronger negative priming effects are found for auditory stimulus but the standardized effect sizes between the modalities did not vary. Evidence for negative priming has also been found across various modes of response including vocal naming, manual key press, and reaching. Negative priming was observed for various types of judgment such as identification, categorization, matching, counting and localization. The tasks used to find evidence for negative priming includes Stroop color–word task, lexical decision task, identification, matching, and localization tasks. The Stroop color–word task utilizes the Stroop effect to observe the distractor suppression and negative priming. Identification tasks present a set of images, sounds, words, symbols, or letters and require the subject to select the prime target based a particular feature that differentiates the target from the distractor. Lexical decision utilizes semantic knowledge of the subject and tests the subject ability to remember the multiple meanings and uses of one word. For example, the word \"bank\" has multiple meanings and can be referred in different contexts such as \"bank is a place where money is deposited\" or \"banks of a river\". Matching tasks require subjects to respond \"same\" or \"different\" by matching the target letters or shapes with the explicitly specified goal while ignoring the distractor. Localization tasks require some form of movement of subjects to respond to the location of the target stimulus. This type of localization task is especially used to test the feature mismatch hypothesis as it provides evidence for negative priming during the mismatch of the location and target stimuli.\n\nResponse–stimulus interval (RSI) is another form of data that is used to quantify negative priming. RSI is the time difference between the response to prime target and the onset of probe trial. Negative priming effects are observed for delays of 20 millisecond to 8000 millisecond between the prime trial and the probe trial. Several experiments found that negative priming decays rapidly during this delay between prime and probe trials. Many studies have tried to find a rate of this decay but have not been successful. Researchers of both the distractor inhibition model and episode retrieval model use varying results of the RSI effects to justify the decay as a part of their model. More globally accepted research is needed to determine concrete RSI data and establish short-term and long-term negative priming limits.\n\nNeurological evidence of negative priming effects is being researched to help understand the physiological aspects and to develop more accurate models. The most common method to find such neurological evidence is by neuroimaging the brain using fMRI while subjects go through experiments of tasks that prompt negative priming effects. The two primary bases for neurological evidence are the internal representations of stimuli and memory retrieval. Most significantly activated regions of the brain are the left temporal lobe, inferior parietal lobe, and the prefrontal cortex of the frontal lobe. Evidence for internal representations are found in the left anterior temporal cortex, which has been associated with abstract semantic knowledge representations. Left anterolateral temporal cortex was found to be directly related to the magnitude of negative priming effect. The inferior parietal lobe is connected to the shifts in attention that occurs when attending to the distractors and the target. The inferior parietal cortex activated whenever attention shifted from the distractor to target stimulus or vice versa. Another significant area of activation was found in the prefrontal cortex. The superior, inferior, and medial frontal gyri, and the medial prefrontal cortex exhibited activation during the negative priming tasks. Activations in the frontal lobe has been associated with inhibitory network and selective attention. Similarly, evidences for semantic representations and temporal lobe activations are used to support the episode retrieval model. Additional investigations of the neurophysiological data of negative priming are necessary to further clarify the relationship between selective attention and memory in negative priming.\n\nNegative priming is identified as one of the cognitive process necessary for goal directed behaviors. It is associated with many cognitive processes such as inhibition, selective attention, encoding, memory retrieval, and short-term memory. Neuropsychiatric disorders may be due to problems with some of the above-mentioned areas of cognition. Currently, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome are being studied with reference to negative priming. Understanding the paradigm of negative priming can lead to the use of negative priming tasks as diagnosing tools to identify the disorders. Knowledge about the physiological basis of negative priming can also help in designing therapies or treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nAmong the four theories, the feature mismatch hypothesis and the temporal discrimination model lack solid evidence and are inadequate. These two models differ slightly from the distractor inhibition model and episode retrieval model respectively and can be incorporated into the latter two. The distractor inhibition model was the dominant model until recent contradicting findings pointed to a retrieval mechanism in negative priming. The episode retrieval model is gaining more support for the memory based negative priming but lacks in its explanation of the association tags. Perhaps, further research exploring both these models may help to better understand the role of negative priming in attention, memory and cognition.\n\n\n"}

When a sound is followed by another sound separated by a sufficiently short time delay (below the listener's echo threshold), listeners perceive a single auditory event; its perceived spatial location is dominated by the location of the first-arriving sound (the first wave front). The lagging sound also affects the perceived location. However, its effect is suppressed by the first-arriving sound.\n\nThe Haas effect is a psychoacoustical effect, described in 1949 by Helmut Haas in his Ph.D. thesis. It is often equated with the underlying precedence effect.\n\nThe \"law of the first wavefront\" was described and named in 1948 by Lothar Cremer.\n\nThe \"precedence effect\" was described and named in 1949 by Wallach et al. They showed that when two identical sounds are presented in close succession they will be heard as a single fused sound. In their experiments, fusion occurred when the lag between the two sounds was in the range 1 to 5 ms for clicks, and up to 40 ms for more complex sounds such as speech or piano music. When the lag was longer, the second sound was heard as an echo.\n\nAdditionally, Wallach et al. demonstrated that when successive sounds coming from sources at different locations were heard as fused, the apparent location of the perceived sound was dominated by the location of the sound that reached the ears first (i.e. the first-arriving wavefront). The second-arriving sound had only a very small (albeit measurable) effect on the perceived location of the fused sound. They designated this phenomenon as the \"precedence effect\", and noted that it explains why sound localization is possible in the typical situation where sounds reverberate from walls, furniture and the like, thus providing multiple, successive stimuli. They also noted that the precedence effect is an important factor in the perception of stereophonic sound.\n\nWallach et al. did not systematically vary the intensities of the two sounds, although they cited research by Langmuir et al. which suggested that if the second-arriving sound is at least 15 dB louder than the first, the precedence effect breaks down.\n\nThe \"Haas effect\" derives from a 1951 paper by Helmut Haas.\nIn 1951 Haas examined how the perception of speech is affected in the presence of a single, coherent sound reflection. To create anechoic conditions, the experiment was carried out on the rooftop of a freestanding building. Another test was carried out in a room with a reverberation time of 1.6 ms. The test signal (recorded speech) was emitted from two similar loudspeakers at locations 45° to the left and to the right in 3 m distance to the listener.\n\nHaas found that humans localize sound sources in the direction of the first arriving sound despite the presence of a single reflection from a different direction. A single auditory event is perceived. A reflection arriving later than 1 ms after the direct sound increases the perceived level and spaciousness (more precisely the perceived width of the sound source). A single reflection arriving within 5 to 30 ms can be up to 10 dB louder than the direct sound without being perceived as a secondary auditory event (echo). This time span varies with the reflection level. If the direct sound is coming from the same direction the listener is facing, the reflection's direction has no significant effect on the results. A reflection with attenuated higher frequencies expands the time span that echo suppression is active. Increased room reverberation time also expands the time span of echo suppression.\n\nThe precedence effect appears if the subsequent wave fronts arrive between 2 ms and about 50 ms later than the first wave front. This range is signal dependent. For speech the precedence effect disappears for delays above 50 ms, but for music the precedence effect can also appear for delays of some 100 ms.\n\nIn two-click lead–lag experiments, localization effects include aspects of \"summing localization\", \"localization dominance\", and \"lag discrimination suppression\". The last two are generally considered to be aspects of the precedence effect:\n\nFor time delays above 50 ms (for speech) or some 100 ms (for music) the delayed sound is perceived as an echo of the first-arriving sound. Both sound directions are localized correctly. The time delay for perceiving echoes depends on the signal characteristics. For signals with impulse characteristics, echoes are perceived for delays above 50 ms. For signals with a nearly constant amplitude, the echo threshold can be enhanced up to time differences of 1 to 2 seconds.\n\nA special appearance of the precedence effect is the Haas effect. Haas showed that the precedence effect appears even if the level of the delayed sound is up to 10 dB higher than the level of the first wave front. In this case, the range of delays, where the precedence effect works, is reduced to delays between 10 and 30 ms.\n\nThe precedence effect is important for the hearing in enclosed rooms. With the help of this effect, it remains possible to determine the direction of a sound source (e.g. the direction of a speaker) even in the presence of wall reflections.\n\nHaas' findings can be applied to sound reinforcement systems and public address systems. The signal for loudspeakers placed at distant locations from a stage may be delayed electronically by an amount equal to the time sound takes to travel through the air from the stage to the distant location, plus about 10 to 20 milliseconds and played at a level up to 10 dB louder than sound emanating from the stage. The first arrival of sound from the source on stage determines perceived localization whereas the slightly later sound from delayed loudspeakers simply increases the perceived sound level without negatively affecting localization. In this configuration, the listener will localize all sound from the direction of the direct sound, but he will benefit from the higher sound level, which has been enhanced by the loudspeakers.\n\nThe precedence effect can be employed to increase the perception of ambience during the playback of stereo recordings. If two speakers are placed to the left and right of the listener (in addition to the main speakers), and fed with the program material delayed by 10 to 20 milliseconds, the random-phase ambience components of the sound will become sufficiently decorrelated that they cannot be localized. This effectively extracts the recording's existing ambience, while leaving its foreground \"direct\" sounds still appearing to come from the front.\n\nThe effect was taken into account and exploited in the psychoacoustics of the Fosgate Tate 101A SQ decoder, developed by Jim Fosgate in consultation with Peter Scheiber and Martin Willcocks, to produce much better spatiality and directionality in matrix decoding of 4-2-4 audio.\n\nMany older LEDE (\"live end, dead end\") control room designs featured so-called \"Haas kickers\" – reflective panels placed at the rear to create specular reflections which were thought to provide a wider stereo listening area or raise intelligibility. However, what is beneficial for one type of sound is detrimental to others, so Haas kickers, like compression ceilings, are no longer commonly found in control rooms.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18581264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18581264", "title": "Reading", "text": "Reading\n\nReading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning. \n\nSuccess in this process is measured as \"reading comprehension\". Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.\nReaders use a variety of reading strategies to decode (to translate symbols into sounds or visual representations of speech) and comprehension. Readers may use context clues to identify the meaning of unknown words. Readers integrate the words they have read into their existing framework of knowledge or schema.\n\nOther types of reading are not speech based writing systems, such as music notation or pictograms. The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille).\n\nCurrently most reading is either of the printed word from ink or toner on paper, such as in a book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or notebook, or of electronic displays, such as computer displays, television, mobile phones or e-readers. Handwritten text may also be produced using a graphite pencil or a pen.\nShort texts may be written or painted on an object.\n\nOften the text relates to the object, such as an address on an envelope, product info on packaging, or text on a traffic or street sign. A slogan may be painted on a wall. A text may also be produced by arranging stones of a different color in a wall or road. Short texts like these are sometimes referred to as environmental print.\n\nSometimes text or images are in relief, with or without using a color contrast. Words or images can be carved in stone, wood, or metal; instructions can be printed in relief on the plastic housing of a home appliance, or myriad other examples.\n\nA requirement for reading is a good contrast between letters and background (depending on colors of letters and background, any pattern or image in the background, and lighting) and a suitable font size. In the case of a computer screen, it is important to see an entire line of text without scrolling.\n\nThe field of visual word recognition studies how people read individual words. A key technique in studying how individuals read text is eye tracking. This has revealed that reading is performed as a series of eye fixations with saccades between them. Humans also do not appear to fixate on every word in a text, but instead pause on some words mentally while their eyes are moving. This is possible because human languages show certain linguistic regularities.\n\nThe process of recording information to read later is writing. In the case of computer and microfiche storage there is the separate step of displaying the written text. For humans, reading is usually faster and easier than writing.\n\nReading is typically an individual activity, though on occasion a person reads out loud for other listeners. Reading aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension, is a form of intrapersonal communication: in the early 1970s has been proposed the dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud, accordingly to which there were two separate mental mechanisms, or cognitive routes, that are involved in this case, with output of both mechanisms contributing to the pronunciation of a written stimulus.\n\nReading to young children is a recommended way to instill language and expression, and to promote comprehension of text. Personalised books for children are recommended to improve engagement in reading by featuring the child themselves in the story.\n\nBefore the reintroduction of separated text in the late Middle Ages, the ability to read silently was considered rather remarkable.\n\nLiteracy is the ability to use the symbols of a writing system. It is the ability to interpret what the information symbols represent, and re-create those same symbols so that others can derive the same meaning. Illiteracy is the inability to derive meaning from the symbols used in a writing system.\nDyslexia refers to a cognitive difficulty with reading and writing. It is defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read. The term dyslexia can refer to two disorders: developmental dyslexia which is a learning disability. Alexia (acquired dyslexia) refers to reading difficulties that occur following brain damage, stroke, or progressive illness.\n\nMajor predictors of an individual's ability to read both alphabetic and nonalphabetic scripts are phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and verbal IQ. Being taught to read at an early age (such as five years old) does not ultimately result in better reading skills, and if it replaces more developmentally appropriate activities, then it may cause other harms.\n\nMany studies show that increasing reading speed improves comprehension.Reading speed requires a long time to reach adult levels. The table to the right shows how reading-rate varies with age, regardless of the period (1965 to 2005) and the language (English, French, German). The Taylor values probably are higher, for disregarding students who failed the comprehension test. The reading test by the French psychologist Pierre Lefavrais (\"L'alouette\", published in 1967) tested reading aloud, with a penalty for errors, and could, therefore, not be a rate greater than 150 wpm. According to Carver (1990), children's reading speed increases throughout the school years. On average, from grade 2 to college, reading rate increases 14 standard-length words per minute each year (where one standard-length word is defined as six characters in text, including punctuation and spaces). Note that the data from Taylor (English) and Landerl (German) are based on texts of increasing difficulty; other data were obtained when all age groups were reading the same text.\n\nRates of reading include reading for memorization (fewer than 100 words per minute [wpm]); reading for learning (100–200 wpm); reading for comprehension (200–400 wpm); and skimming (400–700 wpm). Reading for comprehension is the essence of the daily reading of most people. Skimming is for superficially processing large quantities of text at a low level of comprehension (below 50%).\n\nAdvice for choosing the appropriate reading-rate includes reading flexibly, slowing when concepts are closely presented and when the material is new, and increasing when the material is familiar and of thin concept. Speed reading courses and books often encourage the reader to continually accelerate; comprehension tests lead the reader to believe his or her comprehension is continually improving; yet, competence-in-reading requires knowing that skimming is dangerous, as a default habit.\n\nScientific studies have demonstrated that reading—defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page—faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.\n\nReading speed has been used as a measure in research to determine the effect of interventions on human vision. A Cochrane Systematic Review used reading speed in words per minute as the primary outcome in comparing different reading aids for adults with low vision.\n\nBoth lexical and sub-lexical cognitive processes contribute to how we learn to read.\n\nSub-lexical reading, involves teaching reading by associating characters or groups of characters with sounds or by using phonics or synthetic phonics learning and teaching methodology, which some argue is in competition with whole language methods.\n\nLexical reading involves acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using whole language learning and teaching methodology. Some argue that this competes with phonics and synthetic phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning to spell.\n\nOther methods of teaching and learning to read have developed, and become somewhat controversial.\n\nLearning to read in a second language, especially in adulthood, may be a different process than learning to read a native language in childhood.\nThere are cases of very young children learning to read without having been taught. Such was the case with Truman Capote who reportedly taught himself to read and write at the age of five. There are also accounts of people who taught themselves to read by comparing street signs or Biblical passages to speech. The novelist Nicholas Delbanco taught himself to read at age six during a transatlantic crossing by studying a book about boats.\n\nBrain activity in young and older children can be used to predict future reading skill. Cross model mapping between the orthographic and phonologic areas in the brain are critical in reading. Thus, the amount of activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus while performing reading tasks can be used to predict later reading ability and advancement. Young children with higher phonological word characteristic processing have significantly better reading skills later on than older children who focus on whole-word orthographic representation.\n\nThere are several types and methods of reading, with differing rates that can be attained for each, for different kinds of material and purposes:\n\n\nReading process is therefore a communication context.\n\n\nSome tests incorporate several of the above components at once. For instance, the Nelson-Denny Reading Test scores readers both on the speed with which they can read a passage, and also their ability to accurately answer questions about this passage. Recent research has questioned the validity of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, especially with regard to the identification of reading disabilities.\n\nReading books and writing are among brain-stimulating activities shown to slow down cognitive decline in old age, with people who participated in more mentally stimulating activities over their lifetimes having a slower rate of decline in memory and other mental capacities. Reading for pleasure has been linked to increased cognitive progress in vocabulary and mathematics during adolescence. \n\nReading from paper and from some screens requires more lighting than many other activities. Therefore, the possibility of doing this comfortably in cafés, restaurants, buses, at bus stops or in parks greatly varies depending on available lighting and time of day.\n\nReading from screens that produce their own light does not depend on external light, except that external light may lessen visual fatigue. For controlling what is on the screen (scrolling, turning the page, etc.), a touch screen or keyboard illumination further reduces dependency on external light.\n\nThe history of reading dates back to the invention of writing during the 4th millennium BC. Although reading print text is now an important way for the general population to access information, this has not always been the case. With some exceptions, only a small percentage of the population in many countries was considered literate before the Industrial Revolution. Some of the pre-modern societies with generally high literacy rates included classical Athens and the Islamic Caliphate.\n\nScholars assume that reading aloud (Latin \"clare legere\") was the more common practice in antiquity, and that reading silently (\"legere tacite\" or \"legere sibi\") was unusual. In his \"Confessions\", Saint Augustine remarks on Saint Ambrose's unusual habit of reading silently in the 4th century AD.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, elite individuals promoted passive reading, rather than creative interpretation. Reading has no concrete laws, but lets readers escape to produce their own products introspectively, promoting deep exploration of texts during interpretation. Some thinkers of that era believed that construction, or the creation of writing and producing a product, was a sign of initiative and active participation in society—and viewed consumption (reading) as simply taking in what constructors made. Also during this era, writing was considered superior to reading in society. They considered readers of that time passive citizens, because they did not produce a product. Michel de Certeau argued that the elites of the Age of Enlightenment were responsible for this general belief. Michel de Certeau believed that reading required venturing into an author's land, but taking away what the reader wanted specifically. This view held that writing was a superior art to reading within the hierarchical constraints of the era.\n\nIn 18th-century Europe, the then new practice of reading alone in bed was, for a time, considered dangerous and immoral. As reading became less a communal, oral practice, and more a private, silent one—and as sleeping increasingly moved from communal sleeping areas to individual bedrooms, some raised concern that reading in bed presented various dangers, such as fires caused by bedside candles. Some modern critics, however, speculate that these concerns were based on the fear that readers—especially women—could escape familial and communal obligations and transgress moral boundaries through the private fantasy worlds in books.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "238114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238114", "title": "Real life", "text": "Real life\n\n\"Real life\" is a phrase used originally in literature to distinguish between the real world and fictional or idealized worlds, and in acting to distinguish between performers and the characters they portray. More recently, it has become a popular term on the Internet to describe events, people, activities, and interactions occurring offline; or otherwise not primarily through the medium of the Internet. It is also used as a metaphor to distinguish life in a vocational setting as opposed to an academic one.\n\nWhen used to distinguish from fictional worlds or universes against the consensus reality of the reader, the term has a long history:\nIn her 1788 work, \"Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness\", author Mary Wollstonecraft employs the term in her title, representing the work's focus on a middle-class ethos which she viewed as superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and the values of chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. As phrased by Gary Kelly, writing about the work, \"The phrase ‘real life’ strengthens ‘original’, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary.\"\n\nSimilarly, the phrase can be used to distinguish an actor from a character, e.g. \"In real life, he has a British accent\" or \"In real life, he lives in Los Angeles.\"\n\nThere is a related but slightly distinct usage among role-players and historical reenactors, to distinguish the fantasy or historical context from the actual world and the role-player or actor from the character, e.g. \"What do you do in real life?\" or \"Where do you live in real life?\"\n\nOn the Internet, \"real life\" refers to life offline. Online, the initialism \"IRL\" stands for \"in real life\", with the meaning \"not on the Internet\". For example, while Internet users may speak of having \"met\" someone that they have contacted via online chat or in an online gaming context, to say that they met someone \"in real life\" is to say that they literally encountered them at a physical location. Some, arguing that the Internet is part of real life, prefer to use \"away from the keyboard\" (AFK), e.g. the documentary \"TPB AFK\".\n\nSome sociologists engaged in the study of the Internet have predicted that someday, a distinction between online and offline worlds may seem \"quaint\", noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and \"reality\".\n\nThe initialism \"RL\" stands for \"real life\" and \"IRL\" for \"in real life.\" For example, one can speak of \"meeting IRL\" someone whom one has met online, such as in \"LMIRL\" (\"let's meet in real life\"). It may also be used to express an inability to use the Internet for a time due to \"RL problems\". Some internet users use the idioms \"face time\", \"meatspace\", or \"meat world\", which contrast with the term \"cyberspace\". \"Meatspace\" has appeared in the \"Financial Times\" and in science fiction literature. Some early uses of the term include a post to the Usenet newsgroup austin.public-net in 1993 and an article in \"The Seattle Times\" about John Perry Barlow in 1995. The term entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 2000.\n\nThe phrase is also used to distinguish academic life from work in other sectors, in a manner similar to the term \"real world\". A person with experience in \"real life\" or the \"real world\" has experience beyond book-learning. It may also be used, often pejoratively, to distinguish other insular subcultures, work environments, or lifestyles from more traditional social and professional activities. The terms \"real life\" and \"the real world\" may also be used to describe adulthood and the adult world as distinct from childhood and adolescence.\n\n"}

{"id": "22388275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22388275", "title": "Repressive desublimation", "text": "Repressive desublimation\n\nRepressive desublimation is a term first coined by philosopher and sociologist Herbert Marcuse in his 1964 work \"One-Dimensional Man\", that refers to the way in which, in advanced industrial society (capitalism), \"the progress of technological rationality is liquidating the oppositional and transcending elements in the “higher culture.” In other words, where art was previously a way to represent \"that which is\" from \"that which is not,\" capitalist society causes the \"flattening out\" of art into a commodity incorporated into society itself. As Marcuse put it in \"One-Dimensional Man\", \"The music of the soul is also the music of salesmanship.\"\n\nBy offering instantaneous, rather than mediated, gratifications, repressive desublimation was considered by Marcuse to remove the energies otherwise available for a social critique; and thus to function as a conservative force \"under the guise of\" liberation.\n\nThe roots of Marcuse's concept have been traced to the earlier writings of Wilhelm Reich and Theodor Adorno, as well as to a shared knowledge of the Freudian idea of the involution of sublimation.\n\nMarcuse's idea fed into the student activism of the 1960s, as well as being debated at a more formal level by figures such as Hannah Arendt and Norman O. Brown. A decade later, Ernest Mandel took up Marcuse's theme in his analysis of how dreams of escape through sex (or drugs) were commodified as part of the growing commercialisation of leisure in late capitalism.\n\nCritical exploration of contemporary Raunch culture has been usefully linked to the notion of repressive desublimation.\n\nBut some postmodernist thought - while accepting repressive desublimation as a fairly accurate description of changing social mores, - see the ensuing depthlessness of postmodernism as something to be celebrated, not (as with Marcuse) condemned. Thus the advertisement-based system of mass sexualised commodification of the nineties meshed comfortably with the conservative, post-political ethos of the times, to create a kind of media-friendly and increasingly pervasive superficial sexuality.\n\nFigures like Slavoj Zizek however have taken up Marcuse's idea in a more critical sense, to explore the postmodern short-circuiting of desire, and effacement of the psychological dimension to sex. Here what has been called the socialisation of the unconscious into mass form of pleasure-drills, and the exercise of control through the command to transgress, rather than to repress, appear as practical instances of repressive desublimation pervading global culture.\n\nMarcuse's idea has been criticized for utopianism in seeking to envisage an alternative to the happy consciousness of repressive desublimation that permeates postmodern culture, as well as for modernist elitism in his appeal for critical leverage to an 'autonomous' sphere of high culture.\n\nFoucault expanded the concept into 'hyper-repressive desublimation', and simultaneously criticized it for ignoring the plurality and extent of competing sexual discourses that emerged from the sexual revolution.\n\nBen Agger, \"A Critical Theory of Public Life\" (1991)\n\nHerbert Marcuse, \"Eros and Civilization\" (1954) Chap X\n\nJeremy Shapiro, \"From Marcuse to Habermas\" \"Continuum\" VIII (1970), 65-76\n\n"}

{"id": "54000872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54000872", "title": "School-related gender-based violence", "text": "School-related gender-based violence\n\nSchool-related gender-based violence (SRGBV) can be defined as acts or threats of sexual, physical or psychological violence happening in and around schools. This type of violence is due to gender norms and stereotypes. It can include verbal abuse, bullying, sexual abuse, harassment and other types of violence. SRGBV is widely spread around the world and is common in many societies. Millions of children and families suffer from this type of violence. Incidents related to SRGBV has been reported in all countries and regions of the world.\n\nMany governments and organizations around the world are working towards getting reliable information regarding SRGBV, as it has been proved to be an urgent matter that should be solved. Based on all the data related to SRGBV around the world collected, it is important to try to find solutions in order to tackle this problematic.\n\nFor instance, UNICEF's report \"Hidden in Plain Sight\" included the largest collection of data relating to violence against children. As aforementioned, this report proofs how physical and sexual abuse takes place at schools. The most common types of abuse include:\n\nSocial beliefs influence gender relations in all countries of the world. In this sense, the root of violence against children depends on social construction and how the populations behave vis-a-vis gender-related issues. Some of the root issues include:\n\nBeing exposed or having experienced SRGBV can have critical impacts on children's development. Especially in terms of mental and physical well-being, including children's health (HIV and early pregnancy). It has been demonstrated that victims of violence are more likely to accept aggressive types of behaviors or be violent themselves after suffering from violence. This creates a vicious circle in which violence becomes wrongly acceptable. SRGBV can have negative and long-term consequences for the future of young people, as it forges their adult personalities.\n\n\n\n\nAddressing SRGBV raises important challenges and is very complex. The concept is not understood by many and is considered sensitive for many. Actors from the education sector, governments and policy-makers and individuals attending schools face several challenges regarding SRGBV. These include:\n\nReporting on SRGBV situations around the world has become especially difficult since social and cultural norms do not promote this practice. Moreover, implicitly they discourage it. Many actors from society including teachers; school directors and policy-makers still avoid talking to children openly about gender; violence and sex. They fear promoting sensitive materials to children because of the taboo present in society. Work, time and patience are required to overcome set-ideas promoted by parents within their communities. It is necessary to start real and honest dialogues with children in order to create guaranty real and long-lasting results.\n\nGender inequalities refer to the devaluation and discrimination of women an girls in a society. This results on giving more power to men and boys, while demeaning women and girls. For instance, a study in Ethiopia highlighted that even though 93 per cent of male students recognized violence against girls to be illegal, about 33 per cent thought it is acceptable for male students to have what they want, and appeal to their charm or force to get. 21 per cent recognized behaving this way.\n\nCapacity constraints in education systems, are also responsible for slowing down the progress related to preventing SRGBV. One of the most important challenges is the training of teachers with the tools and sensitivity to teach curriculum against violence and promote gender equality. In order for real change to happen, it is necessary to introduce these new tools slowly, analyzing who is the best to communicate these elements and what skills and knowledge are needed. What's more, having enough resources will be very important to implement change.\n\nAnother factor that limits the progress related to stopping SRGBV is weak coordination and unreliable monitoring mechanisms. These render difficult the collaboration between ministries of education, police, social services, child protection and more. This is important because if this collaboration is not fluent, it will be difficult to stop SRGBV. A renewal in the organization's cultural landscape will be needed to overcome challenges, including bureaucracy that disrupts the flow of knowledge sharing.\n\nLimited access to quality services, including child protection an social services among others (often absent) are due to the quality of services. This particularly concerns fragile communities.\n\nIn the majority of countries, there is currently no legislation that protects children from violence at school, meaning not much can be done when it happens. However, it is the case that some countries have recently introduced legislations specifically for schools. This said, legislation related aspects have become a real challenge. As to stop SRGBV, perpetrators must be punished.\n\nEmerging, but limited, evidence base on what works, although this is an area that is receiving increasing attention. The few evaluations of SRGBV interventions that currently exist vary greatly in methodology, rigour, scale and scope. This makes it difficult to identify best practice and draw conclusions about effective strategies that can be transferred to other settings. There is also a growing body of promising practices and existing knowledge that has not yet been fully documented.\n\nAs previously mentioned, many challenges slow down the reporting and impact on the quality of providing reliable data regarding certain types of violence. This implies data is incomplete in contexts such as sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability among others. This is important as all of these contexts are important to fight against SRGBV. According to a recent study by USAID, to tackle SRGBV it is necessary to rely on large-scale studies which include findings that can be compared across countries; studies showing different forms of SRGBV, connections between behavior change and a discrepancy between research and practice. It is necessary to invest in strong data management system tools which divide data and will make it easier for people to analyze it.\n\nGovernments should demonstrate leadership at the national level by:\n\nIn order to render schools safer, it is important to adopt whole-school approaches that will create better environments for children. Also different types of stakeholders at the school level should become engaged at local communities and government. There are three specific strategies:\n\nAt the education sector level, students should be taught in a certain way and certain topics. In order to prevent SRGBV, it is important to: \n\n\nSRGBV being a very complex issue, it is necessary to involve many and several types of stakeholders. Thus it is about creating partnerships in order to tackle SRGBV:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3488625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3488625", "title": "Tamga", "text": "Tamga\n\nA tamga or tamgha \"stamp, seal\" (, \"tamga\"; ; Ottoman Turkish: طمغا ) is an abstract seal or stamp used by Eurasian nomadic peoples and by cultures influenced by them. The tamga was normally the emblem of a particular tribe, clan or family.\nThey were common among the Eurasian nomads throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages (including Alans, Mongols, Sarmatians, Scythians and Turkic peoples).\n\nSimilar \"tamga-like\" symbols were sometimes adopted by sedentary peoples adjacent to the Pontic-Caspian steppe both in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Archaeologists prize tamgas as a first-rate source for the study of present and extinct cultures.\n\nSince the time when the ancients, including the Mongol nations have developed into relative groups, origins, and ethnic groups, the symbol and belief of a clan have emerged, and a custom to distinguish their origins and relatives have been established. Consequently, when labor distributions within clans began to develop and people started to manage an economy, various tamgas, drawings, notes and earmarks have been used as an identification sign for labor instruments and utilities as well as in domestication of animals. Every time the clan branched off due to internal clashes, the number of derivative tamghas gradually developed into personal, family, lineage, khans, and state tamghas. Those new tamghas were created through adding new markings on the original tamgha, in order to conserve the tradition. In the Mongol Empire a Tamgha was a seal placed on taxed items, and by extension, a tax on commerce.(and see Eastern Europe below) \n\n\"Tamga\" or \"tamag\" literally means a stamp or seal in the Mongolian language. Tamgas are also stamped using hot irons on domesticated animals such as horses in present-day Mongolia and others to identify that the livestock belongs to a certain family while they graze during the day on their own. In this regard, each family has their own tamga markings for easier identification. Tamga marking in that case is not very elaborate and is just a curved iron differentiating from other families' tamgas. The President of Mongolia also passes the \"tamag\" \"state seal\" when he or she transitions the position to the new president. In the presidential case, the tamag or seal is a little more elaborate and is contained in a wooden box.\n\nThe Turks who remained pastoral nomad kings in eastern Anatolia and Iran however, continued to use their clan tamgas, and in fact they became high-strung nationalistic imagery. The Ak Koyunlu and Kara Koyunlu, like many other royal dynasties in Eurasia, put their tamga on their flags and stamped their coinage with it.\n\nFor those Turks who never left their homeland of Turkestan in the first place it remained and still is what it was originally, a cattle brand and clan identifier.\n\nAmong modern Turkic peoples, the tamga is a design identifying property or cattle belonging to a specific Turkic clan, usually as a cattle brand or stamp.\n\nWhen Turkish clans took over more urban or rural areas, tamgas dropped out of use as pastoral ways of life became forgotten. This is most evident in the Turkish clans who took over western and eastern Anatolia following the Battle of Manzikert. The Turks who took over western Anatolia founded the Sultanate of Rûm and became Roman-style aristocrats. Most of them adopted the (at the time) Muslim symbol of the Seal of Solomon after the Sultanate disintegrated into a mass of feuding ghazi states (see Isfendiyarids, Karamanids). Only the Ottoman ghazi state (later to become the Ottoman Empire) kept its tamga, and this was highly stylized, so much so that the bow was stylized down eventually to a crescent moon.\n\nTamgas of the twenty-two Oghuz tribes according to Mahmud al-Kashgari in Dīwānu l-Luġat al-Turk:\n\nIn Russia, the term \"tamga\" (\"тамга\") survived in state institution of border customs, with associated cluster of terms: \"tamozhnya\" (\"таможня\", customs), \"tamozhennik\" (\"таможенник\", customs officer), \"rastamozhit\"' (\"растаможить\", pay customs duties), derived from the use of tamga as a certificate of state.\n\nColumns of Gediminas, an early coat of arms of Lithuania, may be a tamga.\n\nIn the late medieval Turco-Mongol states, the term \"tamga\" was used for any kind of official stamp or seal. This usage persisted in the early modern Islamic Empires (Ottoman Empire, Mughal Empire), and in some of their modern successor states.\n\nIn the Urdu language (which absorbed Turkic vocabulary), \"Tamgha\" is used as medal. Tamgha-i-Jurat is the fourth highest Military medal of Pakistan. It is admissible to all ranks for gallantry and distinguished services in combat. Tamgha-i-Imtiaz or Tamgha-e-Imtiaz (), which translates as \"medal of excellence\", is fourth highest honour given by the Government of Pakistan to both the military and civilians. Tamgha-i-Khidmat or Tamgha-e-Khidmat (), which translates as \"medal of services\", is seventh highest honour given by the Government of Pakistan to both the military and civilians. It is admissible to non-commissioned officers and other ranks for long meritorious or distinguished services of a non-operational nature.\nIn Egypt, the term \"damgha\" () or \"tamgha\" () is still used in two contexts. One is a tax or fee when dealing with the government. It is normally in the form of stamps that have to be purchased and affixed to government forms, such as a driver license or a registration deed for a contract. The term is derived from the Ottoman damga resmi. Another is a stamp put on every piece of jewelry made from gold or silver to indicate it is genuine, and not made of baser metals.\n\n\n"}

Traffic tickets generally come in two forms, citing a moving violation, such as exceeding the speed limit, or a non-moving violation, such as a parking violation, with the ticket also being referred to as a parking citation, notice of illegal parking or parking ticket.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a traffic ticket constitutes a notice that a penalty, such as a fine or deduction of points, has been or will be assessed against the driver or owner of a vehicle; failure to pay generally leads to prosecution or to civil recovery proceedings for the fine. In others, the ticket constitutes only a citation and summons to appear at traffic court, with a determination of guilt to be made only in court.\n\nIn Australia, traffic laws are made at the state level, usually in their own consolidated Acts of Parliament which have been based upon the Australian Road Rules.\n\nTraffic tickets are known as Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) in NSW. The Roads and Maritime Services (formerly Roads and Traffic Authority) of NSW maintains a database of all registered holders of a driver's licence in NSW, including the driver's traffic history and registered motor vehicles.\nThe Roads and Maritime Services maintain a number of fixed, and mobile, speed cameras and red light cameras across the State. The State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) manages the processing and issuing of traffic tickets detected and issued by these devices. These tickets are deemed to be 'owner onus' tickets with the vehicles registered owner deemed liable unless they nominate another driver via statutory declaration.\nThese are generally issued 'on the spot' by a police officer although there are other authorised officers that can issue traffic infringemnts such as Roads and Maritime Services heavy vehicle inspectors and Traffic Commanders. The infringement notice is written on three carbonised pieces of printed paper, known as Part A, B and C. Part A is the original and is sent to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) by the issuing officer when they return to the station, Part B stays in the infringement book for accountability and Part C is given to the accused person at the scene or via post. Infringement notices issued by Council's or Commercial Clients by way of electronic handheld devices still have as associated application for details provided on a copy of the Part A, to be made available for perusal if required.\n\nIn NSW all Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) and Parking Infringement Notices (PIN's) are part of the Self-Enforcing Infringement Notice Scheme (SEINS). This scheme aims to minimize Court time for people who wish to plead guilty. The accused person can either elect to pay/part pay the infringement by way of a number of online means or through Australia Post, this can be found on the ticket. If the Accused person pays the infringement, they are deemed to have plead guilty and any demerit points will be deducted from their driver's licence. Matters only go to Court if the accused person elects to have the matter heard at Court.\n\nIf the accused person wishes to plead not guilty, they fill the reverse side of Part C out and mail it to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO). Once this is done, a Court date is set for hearing before a Magistrate and the officer is notified. The officer creates a brief of evidence and provides this to the Court and the accused person, this contains a copy of Part A, which includes the facts of the matter i.e. observations and contemporaneous notes, including description of vehicle, and whether or not any photographs of an offending vehicle have been taken. Quite often, an officer will indicate that they have taken only (1) photograph of a vehicle then, when a matter is defended in court and the prosecution provide a brief of evidence with anything up to 4-5 extra photographs this can lead to some of the photographs being excluded as evidence because there is no indication to show on the Part A that they were taken at the time of the offence.\n\nUpon being issued a traffic infringement, or parking infringement notice, (in person or to a vehicle) an accused person will generally receive a penalty reminder notice in the mail approximately 28 days later, if the fine remains unpaid.\n\nUnder the Fines Act of 1996 (NSW) Time for service of penalty reminder notices by post, is (7) days unless it is established that it was not served within (7) days. A due date for payment of Penalty Reminder notices under this Act is (21) days after it is served. Generally from the date of an offence approximately (28) days is given, after which time of the due date they will then have approximately an additional 21 days in which to take action, and finalise the matter. This includes (7) to allow for service, and (14) days for action to be taken.\n\nIf the fine is not actioned by the due date on the penalty reminder notice, an enforcement order will be issued and additional costs apply. If the enforcement order remains unpaid further enforcement action can follow, which may include suspension of the persons driver licence and/or vehicle registration, restrictions on conducting business with Roads and Maritime Services (RMS), garnisheeing of wages, property seizure order or a community service order and additional fees.\n\nIn Canada, most traffic laws are made at the provincial level. However, some serious violations are criminal offences, contrary to the federal Criminal Code. Both levels of government may deal with different aspects of the same misconduct. For example, drinking and driving may be a criminal offence of driving while impaired, or driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. At the same time, most provinces have laws specifying administrative penalties for driving with a blood alcohol level which does not exceed the criminal blood alcohol level of .08, in particular for newly licensed drivers.\n\nEach province maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist has a chance to plead guilty or not guilty with an explanation. The motorist or their representative must attend the court for the town or city in which the violation took place to do so.\n\nIf the motorist pleads not guilty, a trial date is set and both the motorist, or a lawyer/paralegal representing the motorist, and the ticketing officer, are required to attend. If the officer fails to attend, the court judge will often find in favour of the motorist and dismiss the charge, although sometimes the trial date is moved to give the officer another chance to attend. In some provinces, officers are now paid time and a half to attend traffic proceedings. The court will also make provisions for the officer or the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a plea bargain. If no agreement is reached, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge or Justice of Peace, who then decides the matter.\n\nIf the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to conviction after trial. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally given demerit points, under each province's point system. Jail time is sometimes sought in more serious cases such as racing or stunt driving.\n\nIn the province of Ontario, drivers who are convicted of certain driving related offences result in demerit points recorded onto their driving records. It is commonly misconceived that drivers actually \"lose\" points due to convictions for certain traffic offences. In fact, a driver begins with zero demerit points and accumulates demerit points for convictions. Demerit points stay on a driver's record for two years from the original offence date. If a driver accumulates enough points, a suspension/loss of licence can occur.\n\nFor a fully licensed driver in Ontario, the accumulation of six demerit points results in a “warning” letter. At nine points, the driver is scheduled a mandatory interview to discuss their record and give specific reasonings as to why the licence should not be suspended. If a driver fails to attend this meeting, their licence may be automatically suspended. At 15 or more points, a driver’s licence will be suspended for 30 days. Surrendering a licence to the Ministry of Transportation is mandatory at this stage; failure to surrender the licence may result in a suspension/loss for up to two years.\n\nTraffic violations in India are listed out in the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988. The state government has the rights to decide on the officials who are to do traffic rule enforcement and how traffic citations are issued. Generally the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) and Traffic Police (which is part of the general law and order police force) are allowed to book traffic violations. Officers of and above the rank of Asst. Motor Vehicle Inspector (A.MVI) and Sub-Inspector in charge of the Traffic Police wing have the right to levy on-the-spot fines from the violators. This is known as \"compounding\" an offence. Fines would be paid on the spot and a \"Challan\" (receipt) would be given to the driver. Off late officers on Highway Police duty are also authorised to levy spot fines...\n\nOther officers issue a \"Vehicle Check report\" which lists out the violations noticed on the driver or on the vehicle. The notice would contain the relevant sections in which the driver is charged and also a date to appear in court. The accused can plead guilty by sending a Postal Money order (MO) to the court indicating that he is pleading guilty. Otherwise he/she can appear in person in the court and contest the case. The police officers who prepared the check report and charge sheet would be in the court. The court which handles these cases are the Judicial First Class Magistrate Courts and the trial is a \"summary trial\" (which means if a person is found guilty, he/she cannot appeal to higher courts).\n\nFor drivers who drive under the influence of liquor or other narcotic substance, on-the-spot fine cannot be levied. The driver would be taken to a hospital and a medical report made out. The accused should appear in court. A driver can also insist that he/she would not be paying the fine at the spot and the case have to be heard in the magistrate's court. In such a case the Police officer should issue a notice for appearance in the court.\n\nIn the city of Kolkata, certain traffic violations such as breaking a red light results in traffic police sending a ticket to the driver's home address. The ticket has to be paid to a state or central bank.\n\nIndian Police forces do not have mobile credit card readers, so the fine is generally paid in cash.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a traffic ticket (which is mailed out to the driver) is in the form of a notice alleging that some crime — traffic offences are all criminal offences — has been committed, but stating that if a payment of a certain amount is made to the Garda Síochána within 28 days, or the amount increased by 50% is paid within 56 days, the driver will not be prosecuted for the alleged offence. Some tickets carry penalty points as well as the fine.\n\nMost of Scandinavia determines some traffic fines based on income. For example, Finland’s system for calculating fines starts with an estimate of the amount of spending money a Finn has for one day, and then divides that by two. The resulting number is considered a \"reasonable\" amount of spending money to deprive the offender of. Then, based on the severity of the crime, the system has rules for how many days the offender must go without that money. For example, driving about 15 mph over the speed limit results in a multiplier of 12 days. Most reckless drivers pay between $30 and $50 per day, for a total of about $400 or $500. In 2002, a Nokia executive was fined the equivalent of $103,000 for driving at 75 km/h (47 mph) in a 50 km/h (31 mph) zone on his motorcycle.\n\nIn the United States, most traffic laws are codified in a variety of state, county and municipal laws or ordinances, with most minor violations classified as infractions, civil charges or criminal charges. The classification of the charge depends on the violation itself as well as the jurisdiction, with infractions, civil charges and criminal charges relating to different standards of proof, trial rules and punishments.\n\nWhat constitutes a \"minor violation\" or infraction varies, examples include non-moving violations, defective or improper vehicle equipment, seat belt and child-restraint safety violations, and insufficient proof of license, insurance or registration. A trend in the late 1970s and early 1980s also saw an increased tendency for jurisdictions to re-classify certain speeding violations as civil infractions. In contrast, for more \"serious\" violations, traffic violators may be held criminally liable, accused of a misdemeanor or even a felony. Serious violations tend to involve multiple prior offenses, willful disregard of public safety, death or serious bodily injury, or damage to property. A frequently used penalty is a fine, and this is ordinarily a fixed amount of money, instead of being an amount of money determined based on the facts of each individual case.\n\nIf the motorist wishes to contest a traffic infraction, a hearing can be set by the court upon proper request. The hearings are before a magistrate or judge depending on the state or city. Hearing dates may potentially be adjourned, and witnesses or police officers may be subpoenaed to appear in court.\n\nAt any point after the issuance of a ticket, a motorists may retain an attorney to represent them in a traffic infraction. Retaining or consulting an attorney may be beneficial to the motorist because an attorney would better understand how to contest an infraction in any given state or municipality. Attorneys may offer full representation in court, taking a case from inception to disposal and potentially appeals, although it may be possible for a defendant to retain a lawyer to discuss legal options, identify important defenses, and determine a defense strategy without hiring the lawyer to provide in-court representation.\n\nThe motorist may be given the opportunity to schedule a hearing for a time at which the subpoenaed ticketing officer is unable to attend. If the officer or representative fails to attend the trial for a civil infraction, the trial court may adjourn the hearing to a date upon which the officer is able to appear or, particularly if good cause is not shown for the officer's absence, the court judge may dismiss the charge.\n\nAlthough each judge, state, county or municipality handle contested hearings a little differently, the court may make provisions for the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a plea bargain that may reduce the impact from that which would be incurred from pleading guilty without attending court. If no agreement is reached, and the prosecutor feels it is worth his time to charge the motorist, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge, who then decides the matter.\n\nIn some states and for criminal traffic violations, the judge may also order a jury trial, in which case a jury will hear arguments from both sides, and then consider the facts in the case and render a verdict. The motorist may, for example, put forward a reason their alleged violation was justified, such as to \"get out of the way of an ambulance or avoid a collision with another motorist\", and call into doubt the level to which the officer recalls the specific details of the situation among the many tickets they have issued.\n\nIn Washington state, there is a local option for courts to permit a decision on written statements, without the officer's live appearance in court. California offers a procedure in which both the officer and the ticketed driver may appear in writing, through a Trial by Written Declaration.\n\nSome states permit challenging a traffic infraction through a written statement instead of appearing in court. For example, California's Vehicle Code Section 40902 permits individuals to obtain a trial by written declaration instead of making an in-court appearance.\n\nEach state's Department of Motor Vehicles or Bureau of Motor Vehicles maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist is given the option to mail into the local court or the court for the jurisdiction in which the violation is alleged—a plea of guilty, not guilty or nolo contendere within a certain time frame (usually ten to fifteen days, although courts generally provide leniency in this regard). Additionally, the motorist can request a mitigation hearing, which acknowledges that the driver is guilty of a moving violation, but is requesting a hearing with a judge to reduce the fines associated with the ticket.\n\nIf the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to a conviction after the hearing. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally assessed a penalty under each state's point system. If a motorist is convicted of a violation in a state other than the state in which the motorist is registered, information about the ticket is relayed in accord with state policy and agreements between the two states, including the Non-Resident Violator Compact. If the ticket information is not abstracted to the state in which the motorist is licensed, then the record of the conviction remains local to the state where the violation took place.\n\nThe practice of ticket fixing by police officers is a recurring source of controversy in the United States. Police officers in many jurisdictions surreptitiously cancel tickets as a \"professional courtesy\" to the friends and family of other police officers. This practice is not legal in most jurisdictions, but enforcement is often lax, leading to periodic scandals.\n\nThere are many competing claims as to the first speeding ticket ever issued depending whether the claim goes by the first traffic violation or the first \"paper ticket\" ever issued. Great Britain may have the earliest claim with the first person to be convicted of speeding, Walter Arnold of East Peckham, Kent, who on 28 January 1896 was fined for speeding at in a zone. He was fined 1 shilling plus costs. A New York City cab driver named Jacob German was arrested for speeding on May 20, 1899 for driving 12 miles per hour on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. In Dayton, Ohio, police issued a \"paper ticket\" to Harry Myers for going twelve miles per hour on West Third Street in 1904.\n\nAnother early speeding ticket was issued in 1910 to Lady Laurier, the wife of Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, for exceeding the 10 miles per hour speed limit.\n\nThe fastest convicted speeder in the UK was Daniel Nicks, convicted of on a Honda Fireblade motorcycle in 2000. He received six weeks in jail and was banned from driving for two full years. The fastest UK speeder in a car was Timothy Brady, caught driving a 3.6-litre Porsche 911 Turbo at on the A420 in Oxfordshire in January 2007 and jailed for 10 weeks and banned from driving for 3 years.\n\nThe most expensive speeding ticket ever given is believed to be the one given to Jussi Salonoja in Helsinki, Finland, in 2003. Salonoja, the 27-year-old heir to a company in the meat-industry, was fined 170,000 euros for driving 80 km/h in a 40 km/h zone. The uncommonly large fine was due to Finnish speeding tickets (when excess speed is considerable) being relative to the offender's last known income. Salonoja's speeding ticket was not the first ticket given in Finland reaching six figures.\n\n"}
{"id": "38573159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38573159", "title": "Type family", "text": "Type family\n\nIn computer science, a type family associates data types with other data types, using a type-level function defined by an open-ended collection of valid instances of input types and the corresponding output types.\n\nType families are a feature of some type systems that allow partial functions between types to be defined by pattern matching. This is in contrast to data type constructors, which define injective functions from all types of a particular kind to a new set of types, and type synonyms (a.k.a. typedef), which define functions from all types of a particular kind to another existing set of types using a single case.\n\nType families and type classes are closely related: normal type classes define partial functions from types to a collection of named \"values\" by pattern matching on the input types, while type families define partial functions from types to \"types\" by pattern matching on the input types. In fact, in many uses of type families there is a single type class which logically contains both values and types associated with each instance. A type family declared inside a type class is called an associated type.\n\nProgramming languages with support for type families or similar features include Haskell (with a common language extension), Standard ML (through its module system), Scala (under the name \"abstract types\"), and C++ (through use of typedefs in templates).\n\nThe codice_1 extension in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler supports both \"type synonym families\" and \"data families\". Type synonym families are the more flexible (but harder to type-check) form, permitting the types in the codomain of the type function to be any type whatsoever with the appropriate kind. Data families, on the other hand, restrict the codomain by requiring each instance to define a new type constructor for the function's result. This ensures that the function is injective, allowing clients' contexts to deconstruct the type family and obtain the original argument type.\n\nType families are useful in abstracting patterns where a common \"organization\" or \"structure\" of types is repeated, but with different specific types in each case. Typical use cases include describing abstract data types like generic collections, or design patterns like model–view–controller.\n\nOne of the original motivations for the introduction of associated types was to allow abstract data types to be parameterized by their content type such that the data structure implementing the abstract type varies in a \"self-optimizing\" way. Normal algebraic data type parameters can only describe data structures that behave uniformly with respect to all argument types. Associated types, however, can describe a family of data structures that have a uniform interface but vary in implementation according to one or more type parameters. For example, using Haskell's associated types notation, we can declare a type class of valid array element types, with an associated data family representing an array of that element type:\n\nInstances can then be defined for this class, which define both the data structure used and the operations on the data structure in a single location. For efficiency, we might use a packed bit vector representation for arrays of Boolean values, while using a normal array data structure for integer values. The data structure for arrays of ordered pairs is defined recursively as a pair of arrays of each of the element types.\n\nWith these definitions, when a client refers to an codice_2, an implementation is automatically selected using the defined instances.\n\nInverting the previous example, we can also use type families to define a class for collection types, where the type function maps each collection type to its corresponding element type:\n\nIn this example, the use of a type synonym family instead of a data family is essential, since multiple collection types may have the same element type.\n\nFunctional dependencies are another type system feature that have similar uses to associated types. While an associated type adds a named type function mapping the enclosing type class's parameters to another type, a functional dependency lists the result type as another parameter of the type class and adds a constraint between the type parameters (e.g. \"parameter \"a\" uniquely determines parameter \"b\"\", written codice_3). The most common uses of functional dependencies can be directly converted to associated types and vice versa.\n\nType families are regarded as being generally easier to type-check than functional dependencies. Another advantage of associated types over functional dependencies is that the latter requires clients using the type class to state all of the dependent types in their contexts, including ones they do not use; since associated types do not require this, adding another associated type to the class requires updating only the class's instances, while clients can remain unchanged. The main advantages of functional dependencies over type families are in their added flexibility in handling a few unusual cases.\n\n"}

Designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc., the approximately tall sculpture was installed in 1988 in the northwest corner of Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Two thousand people attended its dedication, which was broadcast live nationally from the square by \"Today\" weatherman Willard Scott. The machine cost $60,000.\n\nDuring its daily two-minute sequence, which includes a trumpet fanfare, mist, and flashing lights, the machine displays one of three metal symbols as a prediction of the weather for the following 24-hour period: a sun for clear and sunny weather, a blue heron for drizzle and transitional weather, or a dragon and mist for rainy or stormy weather. The sculpture includes two bronze wind scoops and displays the temperature via vertical colored lights along its stem. The air quality index is also displayed by a light system below the stainless steel globe. Weather predictions are made based on information obtained by employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square from the National Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality. Considered a tourist attraction, \"Weather Machine\" has been called \"bizarre\", \"playful\", \"unique\", and \"wacky\", and has been compared to a giant scepter.\n\n\"Weather Machine\" is a lumino-kinetic bronze sculpture that serves as a weather beacon, designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc. Contributors included Jere and Ray Grimm, Dick Ponzi, who won a 40-entry international competition to design the machine for Pioneer Courthouse Square (1984), and Roger Patrick Sheppard. The group described their efforts as \"collaborative\", but Sheppard considered Ponzi the \"maestro\" of the project. Ponzi did the engineering and hydraulics, and the machine was assembled at his vineyard near Beaverton. The sculpture was inspired by Portland-born-and-based writer Terence O'Donnell, who suffered from osteomyelitis during his childhood, and his \"funny Irish jig\". \"Weather Machine\", which took five years to plan and build and cost $60,000, was installed in the square in August 1988. \"Today\" weatherman Willard Scott broadcast live from the square to dedicate the sculpture on its August 24 opening. Two thousand people were present as early as 4 a.m. for the dedication. Financial contributors included Pete and Mary Mark, the AT&T Foundation, Alyce R. Cheatham, Alexandra MacColl, E. Kimbark MacColl, Meier & Frank, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, David Pugh and Standard Insurance Company. Information about the donors was included on a plaque added to the sculpture's stem in the weeks following the dedication.\n\nEach day at noon, the columnar machine performs a two-minute sequence that begins with a trumpet fanfare of the opening bars of Aaron Copland's \"Fanfare for the Common Man\", and produces mist and flashing lights. It eventually reveals one of three metal symbols: a stylized golden sun (\"helia\") for clear and sunny weather, a blue heron (Portland's official bird) for drizzle and transitional weather, or mist and a \"fierce, open-mouthed\" dragon for heavy rain or stormy weather. The fanciful symbols change at the same time every day, representing weather predictions for the following 24-hour period. \"Helia\", described as \"gleaming\", was designed by Jere Grimm; her design would later be applied to one of her husband's pots, exhibited in 1989. The trumpets are allowed to play at noon due to a waiver of Portland's noise ordinance for that time period. Ray Grimm constructed the blue heron symbol, and the group collaborated on the dragon symbol based on his drawings. In order for the machine to display an accurate weather prediction, as reported by \"The Oregonian\" in 1988, employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square contacted the National Weather Service each morning at 10:30 a.m. for the forecast, and then entered information into the machine's computer, located behind a nearby door.\n\nThe machine, whose height is reported to be between , includes two bronze wind scoops that turn in opposite directions. It also indicates the temperature (when 20 °F or above) via vertical colored lights along the sculpture's stem. Measured by an internal gauge, the machine displays blue lights for below freezing, white lights for above freezing and red lights to mark every ten degrees (°F). Referring to an additional light system (below the stainless steel globe) that indicates air quality, \"The Oregonian\" reported in 1988 that a green light indicates good air quality, amber reflects \"semismoggy\" air and a red light indicates poor air quality. However, in 1998 one writer for \"The Oregonian\" warned: \"you don't want to breathe so much when the white light is on\". Pioneer Courthouse Square employees enter air quality information into the machine's computer following routine checks with the Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nIn addition to its pre-dawn dedication on national television, \"Weather Machine\" had a public dedication at noon on August 24, attended by Mayor Bud Clark and other city officials. On that day, the machine displayed the sun symbol and a green light for good air quality, and indicated a temperature of . Following the fanfare, known officially as \"Fanfare for Weather Machine with Four Trumpets\", jazz singer Shirley Nanette led the crowd in a rendition of \"You Are My Sunshine\". Portland had good weather in the days following its dedication, preventing visitors from seeing all three symbols for an extended length of time (though all three symbols are displayed briefly during the daily two-minute sequence). This prompted the executive director of Pioneer Courthouse Square to consider altering the machine's schedule so that the public would have a chance to see all three symbols. The sculpture maintained good health until winter 1995, when its mechanical performance temporarily began deviating from noon and the temperature gauge had difficulties working properly. In 2012, the machine malfunctioned and stopped operating for about a week.\n\nIn the weeks following \"Weather Machine\" dedication, an estimated 300 to 400 people gathered at the square daily to witness the noon sequence. Following the dedication, \"The Oregonian\" published: \"It takes nothing from its fascination to know that a human on the staff of the square will be making the daily phone calls to the Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality, and pushing the necessary buttons to cue the pillar's performance ... They have given Portland an attraction no other city has. We're going to like it.\"\n\nPonzi described the machine as \"light-hearted . . . active, distinctive—and fun\". O'Donnell, who inspired the sculpture, called it a \"gentle spectacle\" and described the work as \"a cartoon contraption, an odd little thingamajig. It has bells and whistles and other mechanized wonders that confirm rain sometime after the downpour and proudly announce sunshine in the bright light of day.\" In 1994, \"The Oregonian\" reported that O'Donnell regarded \"Weather Machine\" with a \"mixture of wonder and embarrassment\" and stated that he \"[didn't] think it's all that attractive\". The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: \"Practical people may wonder why the square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well . . . And these practical people may be the very ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round.\"\n\nIn 1995, \"The Oregonian\" Jonathan Nicholas wrote, \"To this day, nobody is exactly sure what happens when the thing sounds off each day at noon. It's like having a governor in blue jeans. We can't really explain it: It just happens.\" Grant Butler of \"The Oregonian\" gave the machine's trumpet fanfare as one of three examples of ways in which people could be certain it was noon in Portland.\n\nThe machine is considered a tourist attraction, recommended in visitor guides for Portland and included in walking tours. One travel contributor recommended a visit to the sculpture for people with children seeking a \"perfect family day\". \"Weather Machine\" has been compared to a giant scepter and has been called \"bizarre\", \"eccentric\", \"playful\", \"unique\", \"wacky\", \"whimsical\", \"zany\", and a \"piece of wizardry\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39445442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39445442", "title": "Weiquan lawyers", "text": "Weiquan lawyers\n\nWeiquan lawyers (), or “rights protection” lawyers, refer to a small but influential movement of lawyers, legal practitioners, scholars and activists who help Chinese citizens to assert their constitutional, civil rights and/or public interest through litigation and legal activism. Weiquan lawyers represents many cases regarding labour rights, land rights, official corruption, victims of torture, migrants' rights.\n\nSince the 1980s, as China’s leadership became cognizant of the importance of the legal system and legal profession to advance economic development, training for lawyers dramatically increased. From 1986 to 1992, the number of lawyers in the country more than doubled from 21,500 to 45,000, and by 2008 had reached 143,000.\n\nThe proportion of Weiquan lawyers is very small, relative the number of legal professionals in China. The number of lawyers actively focusing on civil rights issues has been estimated by legal scholar Teng Biao to number \"only a few dozen.\" The lawyers face considerable personal and professional obstacles, and Weiquan lawyering demands substantial commitment to their cause. According to Fu Hualing and Richard Cullen, “Weiquan lawyers act principally out of commitment, not because of any financial concerns. They accept weiquan cases to pursue their cause, and typically charge no legal fees.” The lawyers often face threats, harassment, and even detention when taking on cases, and they find themselves targets of repression ahead of sensitive events.\n\nWeiquan activists include law professors with university teaching positions—including He Weifang, Xu Zhiyong, and Teng Biao—professional lawyers, and “barefoot lawyers,” who are self-taught and often lack any formal legal education. Several of China’s more high-profile Weiquan lawyers fall into the latter category, including Guo Feixiong and Chen Guangcheng. Many barefoot lawyers are peasants who teach themselves enough law to file civil complaints, engage in litigation, and educate fellow citizens about their rights.\n\nBecause corporate law firms are generally not hospitable to Weiquan lawyers and legal aid workers operate within the government system, Weiquan lawyers in large cities tend to work as solo practitioners in partnership firms with other like-minded lawyers. The Beijing Global Law Firm and Yitong Law Firm are examples of such organizations.\n\nRana Siu Inboden and William Inboden note that a disproportionate number of influential Weiquan lawyers identify with the Christian faith, including Gao Zhisheng, Chen Guangcheng, Zheng Enchong, and Li Heping, among others.\n\nThere are at least two distinctive (and sometimes competing) approaches to Weiquan activism. Among Weiquan lawyers, the pragmatists (or consequentialists) are more deferential to the existing legal systems and institutions, and only pursue courses of actions that are likely to produce incremental improvements and reforms. These activists may reject approaches that are liable to be met with official reprisals. By contrast, the \"radical\" Weiquan activists (those adopting a deontological approach) view rights defending as a moral obligation that is to be pursued regardless of potential consequences. Radical lawyers such as Gao Zhisheng are more inclined to take on the most \"sensitive\" cases—such as those of Falun Gong adherents—simply because it is the \"right thing to do,\" even though the prospects of success are minimal. A pragmatist may become radicalized once they encounter the limits of possible reform.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56865853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56865853", "title": "Ākāśa (Jainism)", "text": "Ākāśa (Jainism)\n\nĀkāśa is space in the Jain conception of the cosmos. Akash is one of the six \"dravyas\" (substances) and it accommodates the other five, namely sentient beings or souls (\"jīva\"), non-sentient substance or matter (\"pudgala\"), principle of motion (\"dharma\"), the principle of rest (\"adharma\") and time (\"kāla\")\n\nAkasha provides the space for other substances. Akasha does not act as an obstruction. There are two types of Ākāśa: Lokakasha and Alokakasha. Alokakasha is beyond the Lokakasha and is empty; it has no other substance. \n\nĀkāśa is a compound word of Sanskrit language, wherein \"ā\" refers to \"towards\" and \"kāśa\" refers \"to be visible or to appear\". Thus, Akasha is the subtle “background” against which everything in the material universe becomes perceptible.\n\nSpace provides room to all other substances of the universe. The characteristic of space is to give room to or accommodate the other substances. The special feature of space is that it is not restricted to the universe like other substances but extends beyond the universe to the non-universe. \n\nIts qualities are as follows:\n\nSky and space both are different. We can see the sky because it is modification of the Pudgala whereas space is invisible.\n\nSpace substance is only one substance and as such it is indivisible (akhand). However, universe (lokakasha) and non-universe (alokakasha) are considered its two divisions.\nSpace is divided into two parts:\nThe dimension of Lokakasha is fourteen \"rajlok\" or \"rajju\", however Alokakasha is infinite.\n\nThat portion of space in which all the substances are found is called the universe (lokakash). There are three types of Lokakasha; a) Urdhwa Lok, where beings of higher qualities than us live (Siddha Lok where liberated souls stay is at the top of Urdhwalok), b) Madhya Lok - where human beings and other creatures live, and c) Adho Lok, where the inmates of hell live (it has seven layers).\n\nAt the summit of the \"lokākāśa\" is the \"Siddhashila\" (abode of the liberated souls).\n\nThe \"dharma\" & \"adharma\" \"dravyas\" are present only in \"Lokakasha\" and that is why \"jiva\" and \"pudgal\" are also there in the \"Lokakasha\" only.\n\nThe (empty) infinite space outside the universe is called the non-universe (alokakash). In the non-universe, space alone exists without the other five substances. Actually in non-universe there is nothing but space.\n\nAlokakash is perceptible only to the omniscient.\n"}
