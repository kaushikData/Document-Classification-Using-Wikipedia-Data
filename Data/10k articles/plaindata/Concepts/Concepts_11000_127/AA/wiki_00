The name derives from the \"2 rounds\" of duplication originally hypothesized by Ohno, but refined in a 1994 version, and the term \"2R hypothesis\" was probably coined in 1999. Variations in the number and timings of genome duplications typically still are referred to as examples of the 2R hypothesis. The 2R hypothesis has been the subject of much research and controversy; however, with growing support from genome data, including the human genome, the balance of opinion has shifted strongly in favour of support for the hypothesis. According to Karsten Hokamp, Aoife McLysaght and Kenneth H. Wolfe, the version of the genome duplication hypothesis from which 2R hypothesis takes its name appears in Holland \"et al.\" and the term was coined by Austin L. Hughes.\n\nOhno presented the first version of the 2R hypothesis as part of his larger argument for the general importance of gene duplication in evolution. Based on relative genome sizes and isozyme analysis, he suggested that ancestral fish or amphibians had undergone at least one and possibly more cases of \"tetraploid evolution\". He later added to this argument the evidence that most paralogous genes in vertebrates do not demonstrate genetic linkage. Ohno argued that linkage should be expected in the case of individual tandem duplications (in which a duplicate gene is added adjacent to the original gene on the same chromosome), but not in the case of chromosome duplications.\n\nIn 1977, Schmidtke and colleagues showed that isozyme complexity is similar in lancelets and tunicates, contradicting a prediction of Ohno's hypothesis that genome duplication occurred in the common ancestor of lancets and vertebrates. However, this analysis did not examine vertebrates, so could say nothing about later duplication events. (Furthermore, much later molecular phylogenetics has shown that vertebrates are more closely related to tunicates than to lancelets, thus negating the logic of this analysis.) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons. First, gene mapping data in humans and mice revealed extensive paralogy regions - sets of genes on one chromosome related to sets of genes on another chromosome in the same species, indicative of duplication events in evolution. Paralogy regions were generally in sets of four. Second, cloning of Hox genes in lancelet revealed presence of a single Hox gene cluster, in contrast to the four clusters in humans and mice. Data from additional gene families revealed a common one-to-many rule when lancelet and vertebrate genes were compared. Taken together, these two lines of evidence suggest that two genome duplications occurred in the ancestry of vertebrates, after it had diverged from the cephalochordate evolutionary lineage.\nControversy about the 2R hypothesis hinged on the nature of paralogy regions. It is not disputed that human chromosomes bear sets of genes related to sets of genes on other chromosomes; the controversy centres on whether they were generated by large-scale duplications that doubled all the genes at the same time, or whether a series of individual gene duplications occurred followed by chromosomal rearrangement to shuffle sets of genes together. Hughes and colleagues found that phylogenetic trees built from different gene families within paralogy regions had different shapes, suggesting that the gene families had different evolutionary histories. This was suggested to be inconsistent with the 2R hypothesis. However, other researchers have argued that such 'topology tests' do not test 2R rigorously, because recombination could have occurred between the closely related chromosomes generated by polyploidy, because inappropriate genes had been compared and because different predictions are made if genome duplication occurred through hybridisation between species. In addition, several researchers were able to date duplications of gene families within paralogy regions consistently to the early evolution of vertebrates, after divergence from amphioxus, consistent with the 2R hypothesis. When complete genome sequences became available for vertebrates, \"Ciona intestinalis\" and lancelets, it was found that much of the human genome was arranged in paralogy regions that could be traced to large-scale duplications, and that these duplications occurred after vertebrates had diverged from tunicates and lancelets. This would date the two genome duplications to between 550 and 450 million years ago.\n\nThe controversy raging in the late 1990s was summarized in a 2001 review of the subject by Wojciech Makałowski, who stated that \"the hypothesis of whole genome duplications in the early stages of vertebrate evolution has as many adherents as opponents\".\n\nIn contrast, a more recent review in 2007 by Masanori Kasahara states that there is now \"incontrovertible evidence supporting the 2R hypothesis\" and that \"a long-standing debate on the 2R hypothesis is approaching the end\". Michael Benton, in the 2014 edition of \"Vertebrate Palaeontology\", states, \"It turns out that, in places where amphioxus has a single gene, vertebrates often have two, three, or four equivalent genes as a result of two intervening whole-genome duplication events.\"\n"}

They are believed by theosophists to be encoded in a non-physical plane of existence known as the etheric plane. There are anecdotal accounts but there is no scientific evidence for the existence of the Akashic records.\n\n\"Akasha\" (\"\" ) is the Sanskrit word for 'aether' or 'atmosphere'.\n\nThe Sanskrit term \"akasha\" was introduced to the language of theosophy through H. P. Blavatsky (1831–1891), who characterized it as a sort of life force; she also referred to \"indestructible tablets of the astral light\" recording both the past and future of human thought and action, but she did not use the term \"akashic\". \nThe notion of an akashic \"record\" was further disseminated by Alfred Percy Sinnett in his book \"Esoteric Buddhism\" (1883) when he cites Henry Steel Olcott's \"A Buddhist Catechism\" (1881). Olcott wrote that \"Buddha taught two things are eternal, viz, 'Akasa' and 'Nirvana': everything has come out of Akasa in obedience to a law of motion inherent in it, and, passes away. No thing ever comes out of nothing.\" Olcott further explains that \"Early Buddhism, then, clearly held to a permanency of records in the Akasa and the potential capacity of man to read the same, when he was evoluted to the stage of true individual enlightenment.\"\n\nBy C. W. Leadbeater's \"Clairvoyance\" (1899) the association of the term with the idea was complete, and he identified the akashic records by name as something a clairvoyant could read. \nIn his 1913 \"\", Leadbeater claims to record the history of Atlantis and other civilizations as well as the future society of Earth in the 28th century.\n\nAlice A. Bailey wrote in her book \"Light of the Soul\" on \"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Book 3 – Union achieved and its Results\" (1927): \n\nThe Austrian theosophist and later founder of Anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner, used the Akashic records concept mainly in a series of articles in his journal \"Lucifer-Gnosis\" from 1904 to 1908, where he wrote about Atlantis and Lemuria, topics related to their purported history and civilisation, etc. Besides this, he used the term in the title of lectures on a \"Fifth Gospel\" held in 1913 and 1914, shortly after the foundation of the Anthroposophical Society and Steiner's exclusion from the Theosophical Society Adyar.\n\nLevi H. Dowling's \"Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ\" (1908) offers a version of the youth of Jesus Christ ostensibly based upon \"akashic record\" material.\n\nReferences to the \"Akashic Records\" can be found in few fantasy fictions like \"EvOLv\" by Ryan Sequeira and \"Keepers of the Kalachakra\" by Ashwin Sanghi.\n\n"}
{"id": "6901703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6901703", "title": "Algorithm characterizations", "text": "Algorithm characterizations\n\nAlgorithm characterizations are attempts to formalize the word algorithm. Algorithm does not have a generally accepted formal definition. Researchers are actively working on this problem. This article will present some of the \"characterizations\" of the notion of \"algorithm\" in more detail.\n\nOver the last 200 years the definition of algorithm has become more complicated and detailed as researchers have tried to pin down the term. Indeed, there may be more than one type of \"algorithm\". But most agree that algorithm has something to do with defining generalized processes for the creation of \"output\" integers from other \"input\" integers – \"input parameters\" arbitrary and infinite in extent, or limited in extent but still variable—by the manipulation of distinguishable symbols (counting numbers) with finite collections of rules that a person can perform with paper and pencil.\n\nThe most common number-manipulation schemes—both in formal mathematics and in routine life—are: (1) the recursive functions calculated by a person with paper and pencil, and (2) the Turing machine or its Turing equivalents—the primitive register machine or \"counter machine\" model, the Random Access Machine model (RAM), the Random access stored program machine model (RASP) and its functional equivalent \"the computer\".\n\nWhen we are doing \"arithmetic\" we are really calculating by the use of \"recursive functions\" in the shorthand algorithms we learned in grade-school, for example, adding and subtracting.\n\nThe proofs that every \"recursive function\" we can \"calculate by hand\" we can \"compute by machine\" and vice versa—note the usage of the words \"calculate\" versus \"compute\"—is remarkable. But this equivalence together with the \"thesis\" (unproven assertion) that this includes \"every\" calculation/computation indicates why so much emphasis has been placed upon the use of Turing-equivalent machines in the definition of specific algorithms, and why the definition of \"algorithm\" itself often refers back to \"the Turing machine\". This is discussed in more detail under Stephen Kleene's characterization.\n\nThe following are summaries of the more famous characterizations (Kleene, Markov, Knuth) together with those that introduce novel elements—elements that further expand the definition or contribute to a more precise definition.\n\nThere is more consensus on the \"characterization\" of the notion of \"simple algorithm\".\n\nAll algorithms need to be specified in a formal language, and the \"simplicity notion\" arises from the simplicity of the language. The Chomsky (1956) hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars that generate formal languages. It is used for classifying of programming languages and abstract machines.\n\nFrom the \"Chomsky hierarchy\" perspective, if the algorithm can be specified on a simpler language (than unrestricted), it can be characterized by this kind of language, else it is a typical \"unrestricted algorithm\".\n\nExamples: a \"general purpose\" macro language, like M4 is unrestricted (Turing complete), but the C preprocessor macro language is not, so any algorithm expressed in \"C preprocessor\" is a \"simple algorithm\".\n\nSee also Relationships between complexity classes.\n\nThe following are the features of a good algorithm.\n1. Precision: a good algorithm must have a certain outlined steps. The steps should be exact enough, and not varying.\n2. Uniqueness: each step taken in the algorithm should give a definite result as stated by the writer of the algorithm. The results should not fluctuate by any means.\n3. Feasibility: the algorithm should be possible and practicable in real life. It should not be abstract or imaginary.\n4. Input: a good algorithm must be able to accept a set of defined input.\n5. Output: a good algorithm should be able to produce results as output, preferably solutions.\n6. Finiteness: the algorithm should have a stop after a certain number of instructions.\n7. Generality: the algorithm must apply to a set of defined inputs.\n\nIn early 1870 W. Stanley Jevons presented a \"Logical Machine\" (Jevons 1880:200) for analyzing a syllogism or other logical form e.g. an argument reduced to a Boolean equation. By means of what Couturat (1914) called a \"sort of \"logical piano\" [,] ... the equalities which represent the premises ... are \"played\" on a keyboard like that of a typewriter. ... When all the premises have been \"played\", the panel shows only those constituents whose sum is equal to 1, that is, ... its logical whole. This mechanical method has the advantage over VENN's geometrical method...\" (Couturat 1914:75).\n\nFor his part John Venn, a logician contemporary to Jevons, was less than thrilled, opining that \"it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known \"or likely to be discovered\" really deserve the name of logical machines\" (italics added, Venn 1881:120). But of historical use to the developing notion of \"algorithm\" is his explanation for his negative reaction with respect to a machine that \"may subserve a really valuable purpose by enabling us to avoid otherwise inevitable labor\":\nHe concludes that \"I cannot see that any machine can hope to help us except in the third of these steps; so that it seems very doubtful whether any thing of this sort really deserves the name of a logical engine.\"(Venn 1881:119–121).\n\nThis section is longer and more detailed than the others because of its importance to the topic: Kleene was the first to propose that \"all\" calculations/computations—of \"every\" sort, the \"totality\" of—can \"equivalently\" be (i) \"calculated\" by use of five \"primitive recursive operators\" plus one special operator called the mu-operator, or be (ii) \"computed\" by the actions of a Turing machine or an equivalent model.\n\nFurthermore, he opined that either of these would stand as a definition of algorithm.\n\nA reader first confronting the words that follow may well be confused, so a brief explanation is in order. \"Calculation\" means done by hand, \"computation\" means done by Turing machine (or equivalent). (Sometimes an author slips and interchanges the words). A \"function\" can be thought of as an \"input-output box\" into which a person puts natural numbers called \"arguments\" or \"parameters\" (but only the counting numbers including 0—the nonnegative integers) and gets out a single nonnegative integer (conventionally called \"the answer\"). Think of the \"function-box\" as a little man either calculating by hand using \"general recursion\" or computing by Turing machine (or an equivalent machine).\n\n\"Effectively calculable/computable\" is more generic and means \"calculable/computable by \"some\" procedure, method, technique ... whatever...\". \"General recursive\" was Kleene's way of writing what today is called just \"recursion\"; however, \"primitive recursion\"—calculation by use of the five recursive operators—is a lesser form of recursion that lacks access to the sixth, additional, mu-operator that is needed only in rare instances. Thus most of life goes on requiring only the \"primitive recursive functions.\"\n\nIn 1943 Kleene proposed what has come to be known as Church's thesis:\n\nIn a nutshell: to calculate \"any\" function the only operations a person needs (technically, formally) are the 6 primitive operators of \"general\" recursion (nowadays called the operators of the mu recursive functions).\n\nKleene's first statement of this was under the section title \"12. Algorithmic theories\". He would later amplify it in his text (1952) as follows:\n\nThis is not as daunting as it may sound – \"general\" recursion is just a way of making our everyday arithmetic operations from the five \"operators\" of the primitive recursive functions together with the additional mu-operator as needed. Indeed, Kleene gives 13 examples of primitive recursive functions and Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey add some more, most of which will be familiar to the reader—e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, exponentiation, the CASE function, concatenation, etc., etc.; for a list see Some common primitive recursive functions.\nWhy general-recursive functions rather than primitive-recursive functions?\n\nKleene et al. (cf §55 General recursive functions p. 270 in Kleene 1952) had to add a sixth recursion operator called the minimization-operator (written as μ-operator or mu-operator) because Ackermann (1925) produced a hugely growing function—the Ackermann function—and Rózsa Péter (1935) produced a general method of creating recursive functions using Cantor's diagonal argument, neither of which could be described by the 5 primitive-recursive-function operators. With respect to the Ackermann function:\nBut the need for the mu-operator is a rarity. As indicated above by Kleene's list of common calculations, a person goes about their life happily computing primitive recursive functions without fear of encountering the monster numbers created by Ackermann's function (e.g. super-exponentiation ).\n\nTuring's Thesis hypothesizes the computability of \"all computable functions\" by the Turing machine model and its equivalents.\n\nTo do this in an effective manner, Kleene extended the notion of \"computable\" by casting the net wider—by allowing into the notion of \"functions\" both \"total functions\" and \"partial functions\". A \"total function\" is one that is defined \"for all natural numbers\" (positive integers including 0). A partial function is defined for \"some\" natural numbers but not all—the specification of \"some\" has to come \"up front\". Thus the inclusion of \"partial function\" extends the notion of function to \"less-perfect\" functions. Total- and partial-functions may either be calculated by hand or computed by machine.\n\nWe now observe Kleene's definition of \"computable\" in a formal sense:\n\nThus we have arrived at \"Turing's Thesis\":\n\nAlthough Kleene did not give examples of \"computable functions\" others have. For example, Davis (1958) gives Turing tables for the Constant, Successor and Identity functions, three of the five operators of the primitive recursive functions:\n\nBoolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) give the following as prose descriptions of Turing machines for:\n\nWith regards to the counter machine, an abstract machine model equivalent to the Turing machine:\n\nDemonstrations of computability by abacus machine (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002)) and by counter machine (Minsky 1967):\n\nThe fact that the abacus/counter machine models can simulate the recursive functions provides the proof that: If a function is \"machine computable\" then it is \"hand-calculable by partial recursion\". Kleene's Theorem XXIX :\n\nThe converse appears as his Theorem XXVIII. Together these form the proof of their equivalence, Kleene's Theorem XXX.\n\nWith his Theorem XXX Kleene proves the \"equivalence\" of the two \"Theses\"—the Church Thesis and the Turing Thesis. (Kleene can only hypothesize (conjecture) the truth of both thesis – \"these he has not proven\"):\n\nThus by Kleene's Theorem XXX: either method of making numbers from input-numbers—recursive functions calculated by hand or computated by Turing-machine or equivalent—results in an \"\"effectively calculable/computable\" function\". If we accept the hypothesis that \"every\" calculation/computation can be done by either method equivalently we have accepted both Kleene's Theorem XXX (the equivalence) and the Church–Turing Thesis (the hypothesis of \"every\").\n\nThe notion of separating out Church's and Turing's theses from the \"Church–Turing thesis\" appears not only in Kleene (1952) but in Blass-Gurevich (2003) as well. But while there are agreements, there are disagreements too:\n\nA. A. Markov (1954) provided the following definition of algorithm:\n\nHe admitted that this definition \"does not pretend to mathematical precision\" (p. 1). His 1954 monograph was his attempt to define algorithm more accurately; he saw his resulting definition—his \"normal\" algorithm—as \"equivalent to the concept of a recursive function\" (p. 3). His definition included four major components (Chapter II.3 pp. 63ff):\n\nIn his Introduction Markov observed that \"the entire significance for mathematics\" of efforts to define algorithm more precisely would be \"in connection with the problem of a constructive foundation for mathematics\" (p. 2). Ian Stewart (cf Encyclopædia Britannica) shares a similar belief: \"...constructive analysis is very much in the same algorithmic spirit as computer science...\". For more see constructive mathematics and Intuitionism.\n\nDistinguishability and Locality: Both notions first appeared with Turing (1936–1937) --\n\nLocality appears prominently in the work of Gurevich and Gandy (1980) (whom Gurevich cites). Gandy's \"Fourth Principle for Mechanisms\" is \"The Principle of Local Causality\":\n\n1936: A rather famous quote from Kurt Gödel appears in a \"Remark added in proof [of the original German publication] in his paper \"On the Length of Proofs\" translated by Martin Davis appearing on pp. 82–83 of \"The Undecidable\". A number of authors—Kleene, Gurevich, Gandy etc. -- have quoted the following:\n\n1963: In a \"Note\" dated 28 August 1963 added to his famous paper \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions\" (1931) Gödel states (in a footnote) his belief that \"formal systems\" have \"the characteristic property that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices\" (p. 616 in van Heijenoort). \". . . due to \"A. M. Turing's work a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system can now be given [and] a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible.\" (p. 616). In a 1964 note to another work he expresses the same opinion more strongly and in more detail.\n\n1964: In a Postscriptum, dated 1964, to a paper presented to the Institute for Advanced Study in spring 1934, Gödel amplified his conviction that \"formal systems\" are those that can be mechanized:\n\nThe * indicates a footnote in which Gödel cites the papers by Alan Turing (1937) and Emil Post (1936) and then goes on to make the following intriguing statement:\n\nChurch's definitions encompass so-called \"recursion\" and the \"lambda calculus\" (i.e. the λ-definable functions). His footnote 18 says that he discussed the relationship of \"effective calculatibility\" and \"recursiveness\" with Gödel but that he independently questioned \"effectively calculability\" and \"λ-definability\":\n\nIt would appear from this, and the following, that far as Gödel was concerned, the Turing machine was sufficient and the lambda calculus was \"much less suitable.\" He goes on to make the point that, with regards to limitations on human reason, the jury is still out:\n\nMinsky (1967) baldly asserts that \"an algorithm is \"an effective procedure\" and declines to use the word \"algorithm\" further in his text; in fact his index makes it clear what he feels about \"Algorithm, \"synonym\" for Effective procedure\"(p. 311):\n\nOther writers (see Knuth below) use the word \"effective procedure\". This leads one to wonder: What is Minsky's notion of \"an effective procedure\"? He starts off with:\n\nBut he recognizes that this is subject to a criticism:\n\nHis refinement? To \"specify, along with the statement of the rules, \"the details of the mechanism that is to interpret them\"\". To avoid the \"cumbersome\" process of \"having to do this over again for each individual procedure\" he hopes to identify a \"reasonably \"uniform\" family of rule-obeying mechanisms\". His \"formulation\":\n\nIn the end, though, he still worries that \"there remains a subjective aspect to the matter. Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective\" (p. 107)\n\nBut Minsky is undeterred. He immediately introduces \"Turing's Analysis of Computation Process\" (his chapter 5.2). He quotes what he calls \"Turing's \"thesis\"\"\n\nAfter an analysis of \"Turing's Argument\" (his chapter 5.3)\nhe observes that \"equivalence of many intuitive formulations\" of Turing, Church, Kleene, Post, and Smullyan \"...leads us to suppose that there is really here an 'objective' or 'absolute' notion. As Rogers [1959] put it:\n\nIn his 1967 \"Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability\" Hartley Rogers' characterizes \"algorithm\" roughly as \"a clerical (i.e., deterministic, bookkeeping) procedure . . . applied to . . . symbolic \"inputs\" and which will eventually yield, for each such input, a corresponding symbolic \"output\"\"(p. 1). He then goes on to describe the notion \"in approximate and intuitive terms\" as having 10 \"features\", 5 of which he asserts that \"virtually all mathematicians would agree [to]\" (p. 2). The remaining 5 he asserts \"are less obvious than *1 to *5 and about which we might find less general agreement\" (p. 3).\n\nThe 5 \"obvious\" are:\n\nThe remaining 5 that he opens to debate, are:\n\nKnuth (1968, 1973) has given a list of five properties that are widely accepted as requirements for an algorithm:\n\n\nKnuth offers as an example the Euclidean algorithm for determining the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (cf. Knuth Vol. 1 p. 2).\n\nKnuth admits that, while his description of an algorithm may be intuitively clear, it lacks formal rigor, since it is not exactly clear what \"precisely defined\" means, or \"rigorously and unambiguously specified\" means, or \"sufficiently basic\", and so forth. He makes an effort in this direction in his first volume where he defines \"in detail\" what he calls the \"machine language\" for his \"mythical MIX...the world's first polyunsaturated computer\" (pp. 120ff). Many of the algorithms in his books are written in the MIX language. He also uses tree diagrams, flow diagrams and state diagrams.\n\n\"Goodness\" of an algorithm, \"best\" algorithms: Knuth states that \"In practice, we not only want algorithms, we want \"good\" algorithms...\" He suggests that some criteria of an algorithm's goodness are the number of steps to perform the algorithm, its \"adaptability to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc.\" Given a number of algorithms to perform the same computation, which one is \"best\"? He calls this sort of inquiry \"algorithmic analysis: given an algorithm, to determine its performance characteristcis\" (all quotes this paragraph: Knuth Vol. 1 p. 7)\n\nStone (1972) and Knuth (1968, 1973) were professors at Stanford University at the same time so it is not surprising if there are similarities in their definitions (boldface added for emphasis):\n\nStone is noteworthy because of his detailed discussion of what constitutes an “effective” rule – his robot, or person-acting-as-robot, must have some information and abilities within them, and if not the information and the ability must be provided in \"the algorithm\":\n\nFurthermore, \"...not all instructions are acceptable, because they may require the robot to have abilities beyond those that we consider reasonable.” He gives the example of a robot confronted with the question is “Henry VIII a King of England?” and to print 1 if yes and 0 if no, but the robot has not been previously provided with this information. And worse, if the robot is asked if Aristotle was a King of England and the robot only had been provided with five names, it would not know how to answer. Thus:\n\nAfter providing us with his definition, Stone introduces the Turing machine model and states that the set of five-tuples that are the machine’s instructions are “an algorithm ... known as a Turing machine program” (p. 9). Immediately thereafter he goes on say that a “\"computation\" of a Turing machine is \"described\" by stating:\n\nThis precise prescription of what is required for \"a computation\" is in the spirit of what will follow in the work of Blass and Gurevich.\n\nWhile a student at Princeton in the mid-1960s, David Berlinski was a student of Alonzo Church (cf p. 160). His year-2000 book \"The Advent of the Algorithm: The 300-year Journey from an Idea to the Computer\" contains the following definition of algorithm:\n\nA careful reading of Gurevich 2000 leads one to conclude (infer?) that he believes that \"an algorithm\" is actually \"a Turing machine\" or \"a pointer machine\" doing a computation. An \"algorithm\" is not just the symbol-table that guides the behavior of the machine, nor is it just one instance of a machine doing a computation given a particular set of input parameters, nor is it a suitably programmed machine with the power off; rather \"an algorithm is the machine actually doing any computation of which it is capable\". Gurevich does not come right out and say this, so as worded above this conclusion (inference?) is certainly open to debate:\n\nIn Blass and Gurevich 2002 the authors invoke a dialog between \"Quisani\" (\"Q\") and \"Authors\" (A), using Yiannis Moshovakis as a foil, where they come right out and flatly state:\n\nThis use of the word \"implementation\" cuts straight to the heart of the question. Early in the paper, Q states his reading of Moshovakis:\n\nBut the authors waffle here, saying \"[L]et's stick to \"algorithm\" and \"machine\", and the reader is left, again, confused. We have to wait until Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007 to get the following footnote comment:\n\nBlass and Gurevich describe their work as evolved from consideration of Turing machines and pointer machines, specifically Kolmogorov-Uspensky machines (KU machines), Schönhage Storage Modification Machines (SMM), and linking automata as defined by Knuth. The work of Gandy and Markov are also described as influential precursors.\n\nGurevich offers a 'strong' definition of an algorithm (boldface added):\n\nThe above phrase computation as an evolution of the state differs markedly from the definition of Knuth and Stone—the \"algorithm\" as a Turing machine program. Rather, it corresponds to what Turing called \"the complete configuration\" (cf Turing's definition in Undecidable, p. 118) -- and includes \"both\" the current instruction (state) \"and\" the status of the tape. [cf Kleene (1952) p. 375 where he shows an example of a tape with 6 symbols on it—all other squares are blank—and how to Gödelize its combined table-tape status].\n\nIn Algorithm examples we see the evolution of the state first-hand.\n\nPhilosopher Daniel Dennett analyses the importance of evolution as an algorithmic process in his 1995 book \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\". Dennett identifies three key features of an algorithm:\n\nIt is on the basis of this analysis that Dennett concludes that \"According to Darwin, evolution is an algorithmic process\". (p. 60).\n\nHowever, in the previous page he has gone out on a much-further limb. In the context of his chapter titled \"Processes as Algorithms\", he states:\n\nIt is unclear from the above whether Dennett is stating that the physical world by itself and without observers is intrinsically algorithmic (computational) or whether a symbol-processing observer is what is adding \"meaning\" to the observations.\n\nDaniel Dennett is a proponent of strong artificial intelligence: the idea that the logical structure of an algorithm is sufficient to explain mind. John Searle, the creator of the Chinese room thought experiment, claims that \"syntax [that is, logical structure] is by itself not sufficient for semantic content [that is, meaning]\" . In other words, the \"meaning\" of symbols is relative to the mind that is using them; an algorithm—a logical construct—by itself is insufficient for a mind.\n\nSearle cautions those who claim that algorithmic (computational) processes are intrinsic to nature (for example, cosmologists, physicists, chemists, etc.):\n\nAn example in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (pp. 31–32) demonstrates the precision required in a complete specification of an algorithm, in this case to add two numbers: m+n. It is similar to the Stone requirements above.\n\n(i) They have discussed the role of \"number format\" in the computation and selected the \"tally notation\" to represent numbers:\n\n(ii) At the outset of their example they specify the machine to be used in the computation as a Turing machine. They have previously specified (p. 26) that the Turing-machine will be of the 4-tuple, rather than 5-tuple, variety. For more on this convention see Turing machine.\n\n(iii) Previously the authors have specified that the tape-head's position will be indicated by a subscript to the \"right\" of the scanned symbol. For more on this convention see Turing machine. (In the following, boldface is added for emphasis):\n\nThis specification is incomplete: it requires the location of where the instructions are to be placed and their format in the machine--\n\nThis later point is important. Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey give a demonstration (p. 36) that the predictability of the entries in the table allow one to \"shrink\" the table by putting the entries in sequence and omitting the input state and the symbol.

In addition, he imposes some constraints. First, the input must be encoded as a string (p. 157) and says of numeric encodings in the context of complexity theory:\n\nvan Emde Boas comments on a similar problem with respect to the random access machine (RAM) abstract model of computation sometimes used in place of the Turing machine when doing \"analysis of algorithms\":\n\"The absence or presence of multiplicative and parallel bit manipulation operations is of relevance for the correct understanding of some results in the analysis of algorithms.\n\n\". . .

{"id": "2071113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071113", "title": "Ambivalence", "text": "Ambivalence\n\nAmbivalence is a state of having simultaneous conflicting reactions, beliefs, or feelings towards some object. Stated another way, ambivalence is the experience of having an attitude towards someone or something that contains both positively and negatively valenced components. The term also refers to situations where \"mixed feelings\" of a more general sort are experienced, or where a person experiences uncertainty or indecisiveness.\n\nAlthough attitudes tend to guide attitude-relevant behavior, those held with ambivalence tend to do so to a lesser extent. The less certain an individual is in their attitude, the more impressionable it becomes, hence making future actions less predictable and/or less decisive. Ambivalent attitudes are also more susceptible to transient information (e.g., mood), which can result in a more malleable evaluation. However, since ambivalent people think more about attitude-relevant information, they also tend to be more persuaded by (compelling) attitude relevant information than less ambivalent people.\n\nExplicit ambivalence may or may not be experienced as psychologically unpleasant when the positive and negative aspects of a subject are both present in a person's mind at the same time. Psychologically uncomfortable ambivalence, also known as cognitive dissonance, can lead to avoidance, procrastination, or to deliberate attempts to resolve the ambivalence. People experience the greatest discomfort from their ambivalence at the time when the situation requires a decision to be made. People are aware of their ambivalence to varying degrees, so the effects of an ambivalent state vary across individuals and situations. For this reason, researchers have considered two forms of ambivalence, only one of which is subjectively experienced as a state of conflict.\n\nThe psychological literature has distinguished between several different forms of ambivalence. One, often called subjective ambivalence or felt ambivalence, represents the psychological experience of conflict (affective manifestation), mixed feelings, mixed reactions (cognitive manifestation), and indecision (behavioral manifestation) in the evaluation of some object. Ambivalence is not always acknowledged by the individual experiencing it. Although, when the individual becomes aware to a varying degree, discomfort is felt, which is elicited by the conflicting attitudes about a particular stimulus.\n\nSubjective ambivalence is generally assessed using direct self-report measures regarding one's experience of conflict about the topic of interest. Because subjective ambivalence is a secondary judgment of a primary evaluation (i.e., I'm conflicted \"of\" my positive attitude towards the president), it is considered to be metacognitive. The point of these measures is to find out how much a person experiences ambivalence in a particular evaluation. Their report may be provided in a number of ways.\n\nPriester and Petty, for example, utilized a rating system where they had subjects rate the level of conflict they were experiencing on a scale from 0 (as in the subject experienced \"no conflict at all\") to 10 (as in the subject experienced \"maximum conflict\"). However, people do not like to experience the negative emotions associated with ambivalence and therefore may not acknowledge, or report, their level of conflict as accurately as possible. This makes the measure of felt ambivalence a bit less reliable than a researcher may desire.\n\nAnother measure of ambivalence that has been developed is called objective ambivalence or potential ambivalence, which represents the simultaneous acknowledgement of both positive and negative evaluations regarding a particular stimulus. Objective ambivalence is an indirect measure of attitude conflict that allows individuals to answer questions based on more accessible aspects of their attitude and is therefore generally viewed as an advantageous means of measurement. This indirect measure does not assume that the individual has complete knowledge and/or awareness of their attitudinal conflict and helps to eliminate confounding factors that may be affecting their attitudes.\n\nObjective ambivalence is generally assessed using a method first developed by Kaplan, in which a standard bipolar attitude scale (e.g., extremely negative to extremely positive) is split into two separate scales, each independently assessing the magnitude of one valence (e.g., not at all negative to extremely negative). If a person endorses both positive and negative reactions towards the same object, then at least some objective ambivalence is present.\n\nKaplan initially operationalized ambivalence as the lesser of the two reactions (i.e., positive or negative evaluations), also called conflicting reactions (and contrasted with dominant reactions). For example, if objective ambivalence towards exercising was assessed using two separate 6-point scales, and a person indicated that his or her evaluation was slightly negative (e.g., 2 on a 6-point scale) and extremely positive (e.g., 6 on a 6-point scale), this person's ambivalence would be quantified by the lesser of these two evaluations (i.e., 2 in this example).\n\nKaplan's measure yields the formula: formula_1\n\nHere, S is representative of the smaller rating or reaction, and the L is representative of the larger rating or reaction.\n\nHowever, Kaplan's measure has largely been replaced in practice by one proposed by Thompson et al. Thompson' s formula fulfills the three necessary conditions for any scale measuring ambivalence as suggested by Breckler.\n\nThe three conditions are as follows:\nThompson et al. refined Kaplan's formula to incorporate Breckler's components: formula_2\n\nThe creation of this formula was pivotal because it accounts for both subjective and objective ratings.\n\nResearch has shown only a moderate correlation between felt and potential ambivalence, although, both measures are useful depending on what is being asked. Potential ambivalence is often utilized by ambivalence researchers to gather more information about diversity of attitudes across contexts. Each individual experiences the after-effects of unpleasant feelings in a different way, whether or not associated with ambivalence awareness.\n\nThere are two primary moderators that link felt and potential ambivalence: \"simultaneous accessibility\" and \"preference for consistency\".\n\nSimultaneous accessibility is when potential ambivalence depends on how quickly and uniformly conflicting evaluations come to mind. Positive and negative knowledge regarding beliefs about an attitude object are concurrently known, but not always accessible. Only when the connection of the evaluations are applicable and coinciding to awareness, does potential ambivalence result in felt ambivalence.\n\nPreference for consistency uses incentives to combine incoming stimuli with current variables in order to respond to approaching impulses. In other words, people often review past behaviors when making new decisions; if preference for consistency is high, they are more likely to ignore new information and are thus bias to past behaviors.\n\nTraditionally, attitudes were considered one-dimensional—from positive to negative—but given the rise of research findings, this perspective has lost much of its value. Ambivalence studies were a primary reason that attitudinal assessments demanded a new design. Because the basic assumption of an ambivalent attitude is that it is paradoxical, a one-dimensional perspective is likely to portray faulty information. For instance, a numerical rating of zero can be produced both by someone with a love-hate relationship toward an object, and someone who is completely indifferent about that object. There is a significant difference in the behaviors and experiences of those possessing strong conflicting attitudes, compared to those who are simply neutral. This perspective is unsuitable for examining ambivalence and based on current research does not appear to accurately reflect how attitudes function and are experienced.\n\nThe two-dimensional perspective separately rates positive and negative attitudes toward an attitudinal object. The relative magnitude of positive and negative rankings are recognized by this model, providing a distinction between ambivalence and indifference. By comparing the magnitude of attitudes, the two-dimensional perspective also allows for an approximation of the degree of ambivalence; similarity in the magnitude of an individual’s positive and negative attitude towards an object indicating ambivalence, and the strength of these attitudes reveals its degree. The two-dimensional view can report everything the one-dimensional perspective can, but it has the added ability to account for ambivalence. Though this model of attitude is clearly more useful for understanding and potentially assessing ambivalence than a one dimensional model it still suffers numerous paradoxes which are difficult to argue away without acknowledging that there is more contributing to one's attitudes and their stability than perceptions regarding the object alone. These issues prompt the recent emergence of multidimensional models.\n\nThe Multidimensional model for attitude deviates from the linear perspectives previously mentioned. Conceptually the multidimensional model can be thought of as a network of attitudinal hubs which form a web of contributions contributing to one's attitude about a particular object. Thus ones attitude toward an object is a product of the attitudes one holds for all related objects which are activated consciously or unconsciously when considering the object in question, and is not simply an attribution regarding the object alone in a vacuum. Ambivalence occurs when there are near equal weight of contributions of both positive and negative sources according to this perspective. Note in this view the ambivalent attitude is not tied directly to the object but rather the near equivalence of positive and negative contributing attitudes.\n\nThis model is very useful for understanding why attitude towards an object can fluctuate often within a relatively short span. If this model is accurate than a change in the degree of activation of particular objects related to the attitudinal object in question will alter the degree to which they contribute their attitudinal influence towards one's current attitude regarding the object in question. This allows for variance in attitude towards an object without requiring any permanent change in one's beliefs regarding neither the object nor the objects related to it. According to this model one's attitude towards eating a high calorie dessert food would likely become more positive during times when an individual is hungry, as the centers associated with the satiation property of food are now more active and contributing more influence to the attitude regarding consuming the dessert. The other contributing attitudes do not need to have been suppressed (though they can be) for the temporary change in attitude all that is required, is an increase in the output of one contributor.\n\nContinued or repeated activation of the same related objects to a given attitudinal object will likely be reinforced and over time lend more stability to the attitude, and are likely to diminish the activation of those objects not strongly activated; however it should be noted that the contributing objects are themselves also subject to changes in attitudes regarding\nthem, so no final resolution of stability will necessarily occur. In addition if the same conflicting attitudinal contributors are continuing to “fire together” they will both be reinforced and thus may not contribute towards the resolution of ambivalence.\n\nNot all attitude objects are linked to both positive and negative relations. This model is built on the idea that meta-cognition has to do with \"knowing about knowing.\" The process works if someone has the knowledge about cognition and is also able to control their thoughts. An evaluation creates initial thoughts that are then analyzed by a secondary thought which may vary in strength toward an assessment. Once an evaluation is obtained, the strength of the validity affects how the interpretation is perceived. If a successful univalent attitude is achieved, final evaluations are labelled as either true or false based on varying degrees of confidence.\n\nCognitive consistency theories were established on the premise that individuals prefer dependable and coherent cognition. Inconsistency in one's thoughts, feelings, emotions, values, beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors causes tension. In the past, consistency theorists focused primarily on the instinctive drive to reduce this psychological discomfort and return to a simple, balanced state. Unlike classical approaches, however, theories of attitudinal ambivalence are more concerned with the \"perceived \"paradoxical state itself.\n\nFritz Heider established the first approach in the growing family of consistency theories; balance theory seeks to understand one's thoughts regarding their personal relationship with others and with the environment. Triadic relationships are used to evaluate the structure and quality of attitudes within a given arrangement.\n\nSocial ties, for example, can be analyzed in terms of an individual's perception of the relationships between his or her self \"(p)\", another person \"(o), \"and the topic (e.g., issue, belief, value, object) of focus \"(x)\". According to Heider, a balanced triangle is accomplished when all three links are positive, or two are negative and one is positive (since a positive number is still achieved).\n\nThe overall assumption of balance theory is rooted in the philosophy that unbalanced states have a tendency to wreak havoc. Satisfying relationships require balance, otherwise, it is not uncommon to experience consequences like stress, tension, or ambivalence.\n\nEvaluative-cognitive consistency theory refers to a condition in which one holds opposing attitudes towards an object that are not of equal magnitude; the focus is the overall difference in evaluations, with no regard to magnitude.\n\n“Ambivalence is a function of the \"amount of conflict\" within an attitude, whereas evaluative-cognitive consistency is a function of the \"magnitude of the difference\" between evaluations.”\n\nIn a set of dimension scores, for example, positive 5 and negative 5 have the same degree of consistency as does the set of positive 9 and negative 1. Yet, the degree of ambivalence in each set is vastly different. This distinction is important when examining the implications and effects of ambivalence, since seemingly similar ratings are in fact quite different.\n\nThe two-dimensional perspective of attitudinal assessment can distinguish between ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency. As ratings increase, both ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency have a tendency to be less stable and less effective at predicting behavior.\n\nPast studies have linked ambivalent mental states to slower response times (due to low accessibility) and mild attitudes, although theories of evaluative-cognitive consistency have yet to report such findings.\n\nThe feeling of discomfort that results from inconsistent cognition is a powerful determinant of human behavior. The emergence of research on intellectual tension dates back to the mid-20th century, and has been a hot topic in social psychology ever since. In 1957, Leon Festinger was the first to investigate the phenomenon, thereupon coining the theory of cognitive dissonance. Festinger and other early psychologists held the notion that cognitive dissonance was the result of any \"two \"conflicting thoughts or opinions. Currently, however, research has proven that not all cognitive inconsistencies are equally upsetting, for it is not necessarily the dissonance itself that causes strife, rather, it is the individuals construct of the given contention.\n\nDissonance, then, is characterized as a discrepancy between an attitude held by an individual and the actual behavior that is practiced by that individual, whereas ambivalence is seen as having a disparity within the attitude itself. Though unique, the ambivalent state, still, is closely connected to dissonance theory, being its most common product.\n\nIndividuals seek to satisfy a stable and positive self-image. For this reason, the greatest tension is encountered when there is an incongruity between who one thinks they are and their actual behavior. Such threats to self-esteem evoke motivation to rid oneself of the distress. According to present research, there are three widely accepted methods to reduce cognitive dissonance:\n\nAs noted above, the desire to maintain one's preconceived notions can have vast implications. Studies have shown it is not uncommon for people to distort reality while attempting reduce ambivalence. The manner by which one chooses to replace unwanted thoughts is mostly an unconscious process, yet several factors influence the ability and likelihood of doing so.\n\nInformation processing for ambivalent attitudes is less efficient and takes longer than processing of attitudes that are relatively univalent. The information is less accessible, so it takes longer for a person to integrate multiple viewpoints regarding an attitude object into one cohesive opinion or judgement. The lack of accessibility here does serve to reduce a biased thought process. Yet, since it takes a greater amount of effort to resolve two conflicting attitudes, if one desires to form a conclusion, a more extensive thought process is necessary.\n\nResearchers have sought to understand the relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence. Thompson and his colleagues argue that people with positive and negative evaluations which are of similar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -3) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are of dissimilar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -1). Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose evaluations are more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1).\n\nThe Griffin formula, also known as the similarity-intensity model: formula_3\n\nHere, P and N are the magnitude of positive and negative reactions, respectively.\n\nSome research has stated that as the relative contribution of dominant reactions decreases, the magnitude of conflicting reactions increases. Other studies have found that objective ambivalence predicts subjective ambivalence to a greater extent when both the positive and negative reactions are accessible, or when a decision about the attitude object is imminent. Still, more evidence has demonstrated that objective ambivalence is not the only precursor to subjective ambivalence. For example, interpersonal ambivalence, the presence of attitudes which are in conflict with those of important others, independently predicts subjective ambivalence, as does the mere anticipation of information which may conflict with one's preexisting attitude.\n\nBoth personal and circumstantial aspects must be considered in order to accurately assess relationship sustainability between subjective and objective ambivalence.\n\nIndividual characteristics are essential in deciding the most beneficial coping strategies. Research has shown that certain personality traits may impact an individuals likelihood of experiencing ambivalence. There are certain personality traits that aren't as relevant to ambivalence, such as the need for closure. Other components may alter these traits that may contribute toward ambivalence, such as tolerance to ambiguity. Particularly, those possessing the need for cognition, or the inclination to evaluate the discrepancies between positive and negative emotions, are less likely to experience ambivalence. In other words, the desire to resolve issues, which requires a great deal of cognitive resources, fosters cognitive strength and thus the ability to overcome ambivalence.\n\nAmbivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in non congruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes. Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.\n\nIndividuals with a greater concern for invalidity experience a heightened amount of ambivalence, presumably because they are concerned with making wrongful judgments, and as a result, efforts to adjust attitude become inhibited. Response to ambivalence, then, is affected by an individual's need for consistency; hence, the higher the need for consistency, the more adverse the reaction will be to maintaining two contradictory attitudes simultaneously, whereas someone with a reduced need for consistency will experience less mental frustration Those seeking to rectify inconsistencies and resolve conflict are able to reject ambivalence better than most.\n\nAdditionally, some individuals have a more pronounced fear of invalidity than others. When this fear is experienced to a stronger degree, these individuals will not want to acknowledge the ambivalence as it is especially uncomfortable. Since the ambiguity is not being resolved, it will persist within the person.<nowiki> </nowiki>Gebauer, Maio, and Pakizeh discuss the possibility that many perfectionists, despite the seemingly positive qualities exerted, are at risk of neglecting internal inconsistencies. Consequently, it is not unlikely for those individuals to confront a plethora of unexplained, ambivalent feelings.\n\nAmbivalence will emerge when two (or more) goals valued by an individual are in conflict regarding the same attitudinal object. The individual becomes ambivalent about the object to which they both reference, not as much when regarding the individual goals themselves.\n\nMany decisions as common as food consumption or selection can invoke some degree of ambivalence\nevery day. An action can seem to have pleasant outcomes, but it can simultaneously cause issues as well. Emotions or attitudes that are ambivalent may spark both quick and far-off consequences that are inconsistent. A chronic dieter, for example, may experience ambivalence between the goals of eating enjoyment and weight control. Each of these goals independently are viewed as positive, but when conjoined in regards to actually eating more food, the resulting conflict prompts ambivalence. The object of eating enjoyment and the object of losing weight are both regarded with positive attitude, but these two goals are incongruent with each other and are both activated when considering eating.\n\nThe goal driven ambivalence that produces several forms of behavior modification may have profound implications on the behaviors and outcomes. Some examples are overcoming addiction, procrastination, health maintenance, and many others. Much of the focus of previous work has been concentrated on pain avoidance and pleasure seeking (focus on the ambivalent object itself), and not enough to the \"pleasure\" goal objectives related to and driving the conflict. Under certain circumstances, people who are exposed to unpleasant experiences are motivated to decrease unpleasant feelings toward ambivalence. One way to accomplish such a task is by acquiring new knowledge that can result in more immediate conclusions about the attitude object, or result in an adjustment in the individuals attitudes regarding the contributing goals which prompted the conflict.\n\nAmbivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes and are thought to have less of an influence on behavior. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in incongruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes. Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.\n\nAmbivalence is often the result of conflict arising from personal or social values. Different cultures, and the individuals within them, have different values surrounding race, ethnicity, nationality, class, religion or beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and health status. Social constructs and perceived norms and values within a given society create contradictory feelings for many individuals. If opposing values are activated by the same object they are likely to clash upon encounter.\n\nConflicted value items do not need to come from the same category, but to be considered a contributor of ambivalence, discordance must occur.\n\nThe attitudinal object of women in the workplace could, for example, be affected by religious or political values. The contributing value systems are both held in positive regard but are opposed to each other in reference to the attitudinal ambivalent item. The amount of ambivalence experienced corresponds to the positive regard of each value contributing to the conflict. In other words, weakly held conflicting values should not generate as much ambivalence as strongly held values.\n\nAffective ambivalence (A+/A-) refers to disparity between feelings, whereas cognitive ambivalence (C+/C-) focuses on the disagreement between beliefs. Together, the notion of affective-cognitive ambivalence (A+/C-) or (A-/C+) embodies the commonly known conundrum of “\"the heart vs. mind conflict.\"”\n\nWhen each state is in balance, the influence on attitude is equal (A+/C+). Yet, there is compelling evidence that affect tends to overpower cognition (A+/C-).\n\nThat is to say, the degree of ambivalence construed at any given moment can alter the mechanisms by which one views the world. When ambivalent cognitive states become psychologically agonizing, motivation rises to eliminate distress. Under those circumstances, people generally pay more attention to information that is relevant to their ambivalent state, in particular when it is perceived as having the potential to reduce discomfort.\n\nAmbivalence is often conceptualized as a negative predictor of attitude strength. That is, as an attitude becomes more ambivalent, its strength decreases. Strong attitudes are those that are stable over time, resistant to change, and predict behavior and information processing.\n\nStudies have found that ambivalent attitudes are less stable over time, less resistant to change, and less predictive of behavior.\n\nAmbivalent attitudes are subject to change based on the concepts, feelings, or objects that are salient at the time. Since an ambivalent attitude is one in which positive and negative feelings are held simultaneously, the strength of either may wax or wane depending on what context the individual finds themselves in; different aspects of an attitude may be activated across situations.\n\nAmbivalent attitudes are known to be susceptible to persuasion. Since there is less certainty associated with an ambivalent attitude, both facts and trivial information are assessed, assimilated, and determinant of one's attitude. Accordingly, this may bias or persuade an individual's attitude. Strong attitudes, on the other hand, are less likely to be manipulated because they are essentially \"anchored in knowledge structures\".\n\nArmitage and Conner conducted a study regarding attitudes toward eating a low-fat diet. Attitudes of a high ambivalence group and a low ambivalence group were recorded two times within five months. Following an attitude change intervention the high ambivalence group demonstrated a significant positive change in attitude toward the diet (compared to a control group) whereas the low ambivalence group demonstrated very little change if any.\n\nIn situations that highlight one dimension over the other, individuals who are high in ambivalence are more likely to embrace the clear-cut better aspect of the attitude object.\n\nThe concept of ambivalence was introduced into psychiatric parlance by Eugen Bleuler, who used it in print for the first time in his 1910 article \"Vortrag über Ambivalenz\". Bleuler distinguished three main types of ambivalence: volitional, intellectual, and emotional. Volitional ambivalence refers to an inability to decide on an action—what Montaigne called \"a spirit justly balanced betweene two equal desires\". The concept (if not Bleuler's term) had a long prehistory, reaching back through Buridan's ass, starving between two equally attractive bales of hay in the Middle Ages, to Aristotle. Intellectual ambivalence—the sceptical belief that \"There is no reason but hath a contrary to it\" —also follows a long tradition reaching back through Montaigne to Sextus Empiricus and Pyrrho. (Freud considered Bleuler's stress on intellectual ambivalence particularly appropriate given his own ambivalence towards Freud's intellectual constructs, alternatively praising and criticizing them). Emotional ambivalence involved opposing affective attitudes towards the same object, as with the man who both loved and hated his wife.\n\nWhile mainly dealing with ambivalence in relation to the psychological splitting of schizophrenia, Bleuler also noted how \"in the dreams of healthy persons, affective as well as intellectual ambivalence is a common phenomenon\".\n\nFreud was swift to pickup Bleuler's concept of ambivalence, applying it to areas he had previously dealt with in terms of ambiguous language, or the persistent co-existence of love and hatred aimed at the same person. Freud also extended the scope of Bleuler's term to cover the co-existence of active and passive trends in the same instinctual impulse—what Freud called \"pairs of contrary component instincts\" such as looking and being looked at.\n\nKarl Abraham explored the presence of ambivalence in mourning—something he thought to be a universal phenomenon. Others in psychoanalysis have traced the roots of contradictory impulses (usually love and hate) to very early stages of psychosexual development.\n\nDefences against feeling both of the two contradictory emotions include psychological repression, isolation and displacement. Thus, for example, an analytic patient's love for his father might be quite consciously experienced and openly expressed—while his \"hate\" for the same object might be heavily repressed and only indirectly expressed, and thus only revealed in analysis. A drug addict may feel ambivalently about their drug of choice; they are aware of their drug use as a negative-impact agent in their lives (socially, financially, physically, etc.) while simultaneously seeking and using the drug because of the positive-impact results they receive from the drug's usage (the \"high\"). (More recent discourse of addiction as a mental health concern and chemically-induced/encoded \"imperative\", rather than as a behavioral \"choice\", complicates the notion of ambivalence as it relates to addiction.)\n\nAnother relevant distinction is that whereas the psychoanalytic notion of \"ambivalence\" sees it as engendered by all neurotic conflict, a person's everyday \"mixed feelings\" may easily be based on a quite realistic assessment of the imperfect nature of the thing being considered.\n\nPhilosophers such as Hili Razinsky consider how ambivalence relates to other aspects of the human experience, such as personhood, action, and judgement, and what it means that strict ambivalence is possible.\n\nThe first too write about ambivalence in 2004 was Susan Peabody who donated the concept to Love Addicts Anonymous.\n"}

She was a co-founder of the Jamaican aid organization Save the Children and was the driving force behind the drive for introducing birth control to the island. She received many honours and awards in her career, including the Order of the British Empire, the Jamaican Order of Distinction and the Marcus Garvey Award for Excellence in 1988. In 1990, shortly before her death, she was honoured with the Order of Jamaica.\n\nAmy Beckford Bailey was born on 27 November 1895 in Walderston, Manchester Parish, Jamaica, to Anne (née Lawson) and William Frederick Bailey. Bailey was the fifth of eight children born to her parents who were both teachers. Her father was the founder of the Jamaica Union of Teachers and encouraged all of his children to become teachers, as there were few other opportunities open to black Jamaicans. After attending elementary school at Mount Olivet Primary School, Bailey studied at Shortwood Teacher’s College, graduating in 1917. Soon thereafter, she was stricken with severe dysmenorrhea. While recuperating, she studied on her own to earn accounting, bookkeeping, and shorthand.\n\nIn January 1920, Bailey began teaching at the Kingston Technical High School (KTHS), when she was hired to replace her sister who was taking a three-month leave of absence. Ivy didn't return to the school, and Bailey, who began as a shorthand instructor, remained until 1958. After she retired from KTHS, Bailey taught at the College of Arts Science and Technology between 1958 and 1963.\n\nIn 1936, Bailey and her sister Ina founded the Women’s Liberal Club (WLC), with the goal of helping women improve their employment opportunities, as rarely were women promoted for their qualifications, but instead by having to curry favour from prominent men. They believed that by improving the socio-economic status of women, they would improve their cultural and national pride. In 1939 WLC organized a conference to allow women to discuss the problems they faced. Issues they highlighted were that women were barred from participation in the Legislative Council; could not be appointed as officials, such as inspectors, jurors, justices of the peace, or police officers; were barred from upper positions in civil service jobs; and that racial discrimination impacted their employment opportunity. Bailey formalized these issues into recommendations, which were submitted to the governor in 1941 and led to a law prohibiting sex discrimination. The law allowed women to hold public office and eliminated employment bans for women.\n\nConcerned with the discrimination she saw in the class hierarchy enshrined in Jamaica at the time, Bailey wrote a series of editorials that were published in \"The Gleaner\". She openly addressed the racial discrimination that relegated black-skinned Jamaicans to menial jobs and poverty, brown-skinned Jamaicans to middle-class blue-collar jobs and white Jamaicans to positions of authority. In one article written in 1937, entitled \"Not Wanted—I\", she discussed how it was especially difficult for women to attain positions in line with their skills and training. A few months later, she published \"Discrimination\", in which she urged women to boycott institutions and establishments that did not treat them fairly. These articles drew criticism from some factions of society, which claimed Bailey was trying to start a race war. Bailey countered that she was simply trying to bring the issue into the open and prompt laws to address disparity. Though the WLC conference had proposed a law end to racial discrimination be passed, that was one of the recommendations upon which the government refused to act.\n\nBailey and May Farquharson joined forces in 1937 and began working on other strategies to improve the lives of women. One of the issues they discussed was family planning, and another was an initiative called Save the Children Fund, which they founded in 1938. Joining forces with them were Mary Morris Knibb, Dr. Jai Lal Varma, and Dr. Pengelley. With seed money given by May’s father Arthur Farquharson, Bailey travelled to London with Una Marson to raise funds for providing food, clothing and textbooks to Jamaican school children. The fund drive was a resounding success and the organization is still thriving. While in England, Bailey became the first Jamaican to testify to the Royal Commission headed by Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne about labour unrest, the burgeoning trade union movement, as well as the political unrest plaguing Jamaica at that time. She also met with proponents of family planning, and when she returned to Jamaica a birth control drive was launched in 1939 with a seminar held at the Ward Theater.\n\nLeading up to the meeting, Dr. Varma, an Indian-born doctor who was residing in Jamaica, and several other prominent figures published their views on the matter in \"The Gleaner\". Varma and Dr. William Edward Mcculloch were the only physicians willing to publish their views in favour of controlling the birth rate. Their view was that the extremely high birth rate in Jamaica was a hindrance to economic progress. The doctor's views were refuted by the churches, which though concerned about illegitimacy, felt that birth control was a family matter. Bailey, saw the issue as one that addressed gender and racial inequalities. She organized, with the help of Farquharson and Judith Decordova, a charity worker, a three-month lecture tour throughout Jamaica by Edith How-Martyn, a British feminist and birth control advocate. They established their first clinic in 1939 at 24 East Race Course, and provided nursery care and parenting classes. The women successfully continued the programme, despite the various organizations that disapproved, until the government finally took over Family Planning.\n\nAnother initiative launched in 1938 occurred when Bailey met with Governor Edward Brandis Denham to express her concern about the limited opportunities available to black youths. She expressed the frustration of her students who had graduated with technical skills but were barred from working in civil service jobs. Believing that her outspokenness would result in reprimand, she was surprised when a committee was set up within two weeks of the governor's visit with her to investigate the situation. Meeting between 1938 and 1939, the committee recommended that civil service exams be opened to all graduates of the Technical High School. Beginning in 1939, banking and business employment became open to the students.\n\nIn 1944, the adviser to the Comptroller for Colonial Development and Welfare for the West Indies publicly criticized Jamaican women for their lack of contribution to their nation. Bailey took the words as a call to action and founded the Homecraft Training Centre as a way to build their dignity and self-respect while teaching them skills. In 1946 with her own funds, she made a down-payment on the property at 4 Rosedale Avenue in Kingston and began offering home economics courses. The centre offered training in catering, cooking, domestic skills, and sewing, as well as English language and arithmetic to girls. She headed the centre until 1978, when she retired. \n\nBailey died on 3 October 1990 at Nuttall Memorial Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nThroughout her lifetime, Bailey received many awards and honours. In 1978, she was awarded the Jamaican Order of Distinction for her public service. In January 1988, she was awarded the Marcus Garvey Award for Excellence for her dedication to the development of social programs of Jamaica. In 1990, a documentary on the lives of Bailey and Farquharson, their remarkable friendship, and their work for women's political and economic equality was produced by Sistren Research. On International Women's Day, 8 March 1990, Bailey and Farquharson, were awarded the Order of Jamaica for their contributions to women's rights. A ceremony bestowing the order was held on 5 June 1990.\n\n\n"}

Lynching was used as a tool to repress African Americans. The anti-lynching movement reached its height between the 1890s and 1930s. The movement was composed mainly of African Americans who tried to persuade politicians to put an end to the practice, but after the failure of this strategy, they pushed for anti-lynching legislation. African-American women helped in the formation of the movement and a large part of the movement was composed of women's organizations.\n\nThe first anti-lynching movement was characterized by black convention meets, which were organized in the immediate aftermath of individual incidents. The movement gained wider national support in the 1890s. During this period, two organizations spearheaded the movement - the Afro-American League (AAL) and the National Equal Rights Council (NERC).\n\nOn January 4, 1935, Democratic Senators Edward P. Costigan and Robert F. Wagner together worked and set out a new bill that stated “To assure to persons within the jurisdiction of every state the equal protection of the crime of lynching.” The bill was composed with many sections that protected people from all types of lynching crimes.\n\nIn 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was established. The NAACP formed a special committee in 1916 in order to push for anti-lynching legislation and to enlighten the public about lynching.\n\nThe NAACP youth were part of many rallies. They attended many protest against lynching and wore black in memory of all who had been murdered. They also sold anti-lynching buttons to raise money for the NAACP. The money they raised was to keep the fight against lynching going. They sold a huge amount of buttons that said \"Stop Lynching\" and made about $869.25. The youth also contributed by having demonstrations to raise awareness about the horrors of lynching. They had these demonstrations in seventy eight different cities all over the United States.\n\nAccording to Noralee Frankel, the anti-lynching movement had its origin in the freedom movements after the end of the American Civil War, and that it cannot be described only as a result of the reforms during the Progressive Era.\n\nMany women contributed to the anti-lynching movement through the Dyer Bill including Ida B. Wells, Mary Burnett Talbert and Angelina Grimké. The bill was a foundation that exposed both lynching, and the affects it had on the people.\n\nIda B. Wells was a significant figure in the anti-lynching movement. After the lynchings of her three friends, she condemned the lynchings in the newspapers \"Free Speech\" and \"Headlight\", both owned by her. Wells wrote to reveal the abuse, and race violence African Americans had to go through. She was part of many civil rights organizations such as the NAACP, the Niagara Movement and the Afro-American Council. Wells encourage black women to help work for the Anti-lynching laws to be passed. She was also part of the “First Suffrage Club for Black Women.\" Ida B. Wells asked \"“Is Rape the ‘Cause’ of Lynching?”\" in their circular titled “The Shame of America,” that emphasized the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, when they were in the Anti-Lynching Campaigns. Due to the number of 83 women being lynched in a time frame of 30 years plus 3,353 men that were also lynched. Because of her anti-lynching campaigning she received death threats from racist rioters. After having her children she got out of the organizations but she kept on protesting against lynching. In 1899 she protested the Sam Hose's lynching in Georgia.\n\nMary B. Talbert was president of the National Association of Colored Women from 1916 to 1920. In 1923 she became vise president of the NAACP and her last contribution was leading the Anti- lynching Crusaders during the anti lynching movement . In 1922 Talbert and all the Negro women part of the anti-lynching crusaders raise $10,000 for the NAACP.\n\nAngelina Grimké, one of the many New Negro poets, was one of the many women that wrote about the effects, of lynching. Grimké wrote \"Rachel (play)}Rachel\", one of her most famous plays in which she addresses both the lynching problem and the psychological affects it had on innocence Negro people. This anti-lynching play was first performed in NAACP anti lynching Drama Committee. One of Grimke's main goals she wanted to accomplish with her play \"Rachel\" was to make white women empathize with the Negro women who witnessed the lynching of their husbands and children.\n\nJuanita Jackson was part of the NAACP. She was their national youth director. Mitchell worked mostly with the youth, and did absolutely everything she could to try and get them involved in the NAACP and protesting against lynching. She got the youth to campaign for anti-lynching legislation.She also got to send anti-lynching messages through a radio broadcast. In 1937 Juanita Jackson convinced the National Broadcasting Company to broadcast fifteen minutes on the need for anti-lynching laws.\n\nThe Anti-Lynching Crusaders was a group of women dedicated to stopping lynching. Before the Anti-Lynching Crusaders was founded all these group of Crusaders were involved church that helped them learn how to lead with gender problems and power. The organization was under the guidance of the NAACP and was founded in 1922. The Crusaders women organization started with sixteen members that widened to nine hundred members within three months since the organization was founded. This organization focused specifically on fundraising money to pass the Dyer Bill.\n"}
{"id": "922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=922", "title": "Anxiety", "text": "Anxiety\n\nAnxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behaviour such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death. Anxiety is not the same as fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat, whereas anxiety involves the expectation of future threat. Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue and problems in concentration. Anxiety can be appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.\n\nPeople facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past. There are various types of anxiety. Existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst, an existential crisis, or nihilistic feelings. People can also face mathematical anxiety, somatic anxiety, stage fright, or test anxiety. Social anxiety and stranger anxiety are caused when people are apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, anxiety has been linked with physical symptoms such as IBS and can heighten other mental-health illnesses such as OCD and panic disorder. The first step in the management of a person with anxiety symptoms involves evaluating the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, whose recognition is essential in order to decide the correct treatment. Anxiety symptoms may mask an organic disease, or appear associated with or as a result of a medical disorder.\n\nAnxiety can be either a short-term \"state\" or a long-term \"trait\". Whereas trait anxiety represents worrying about future events, anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety disorders are partly genetic but may also be due to drug use, including alcohol, caffeine, and benzodiazepines (which are often prescribed to treat anxiety), as well as withdrawal from drugs of abuse. They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, eating disorders, major depressive disorder, or certain personality disorders. Common treatment options include lifestyle changes, medication, and therapy. Metacognitive therapy seeks to diminish anxiety through reducing worry, which is seen as a consequence of metacognitive beliefs.\n\nAnxiety is distinguished from fear, which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat. Anxiety is related to the specific behaviors of fight-or-flight responses, defensive behavior or escape. It occurs in situations only perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable, but not realistically so. David Barlow defines anxiety as \"a future-oriented mood state in which one is not ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events,\" and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear. Another description of anxiety is agony, dread, terror, or even apprehension. In positive psychology, anxiety is described as the mental state that results from a difficult challenge for which the subject has insufficient coping skills.\n\nFear and anxiety can be differentiated in four domains: (1) duration of emotional experience, (2) temporal focus, (3) specificity of the threat, and (4) motivated direction. Fear is short lived, present focused, geared towards a specific threat, and facilitating escape from threat; anxiety, on the other hand, is long-acting, future focused, broadly focused towards a diffuse threat, and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping.\n\nAnxiety can be experienced with long, drawn out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life, known as chronic (or generalized) anxiety, or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic, stressful panic attacks, known as acute anxiety. Symptoms of anxiety can range in number, intensity, and frequency, depending on the person. While almost everyone has experienced anxiety at some point in their lives, most do not develop long-term problems with anxiety.\n\nAnxiety may cause psychiatric and physiological symptoms.\n\nThe risk of anxiety leading to depression could possibly even lead to an individual harming themselves, which is why there are many 24-hour suicide prevention hotlines.\n\nThe behavioral effects of anxiety may include withdrawal from situations which have provoked anxiety or negative feelings in the past. Other effects may include changes in sleeping patterns, changes in habits, increase or decrease in food intake, and increased motor tension (such as foot tapping).\n\nThe emotional effects of anxiety may include \"feelings of apprehension or dread, trouble concentrating, feeling tense or jumpy, anticipating the worst, irritability, restlessness, watching (and waiting) for signs (and occurrences) of danger, and, feeling like your mind's gone blank\" as well as \"nightmares/bad dreams, obsessions about sensations, déjà vu, a trapped-in-your-mind feeling, and feeling like everything is scary.\"\n\nThe cognitive effects of anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers, such as fear of dying. \"You may ... fear that the chest pains are a deadly heart attack or that the shooting pains in your head are the result of a tumor or an aneurysm. You feel an intense fear when you think of dying, or you may think of it more often than normal, or can't get it out of your mind.\"\n\nThe physiological symptoms of anxiety may include:\n\nThe philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, in \"The Concept of Anxiety\" (1844), described anxiety or dread associated with the \"dizziness of freedom\" and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing. In \"Art and Artist\" (1932), the psychologist Otto Rank wrote that the psychological trauma of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person's simultaneous fear of – and desire for – separation, individuation, and differentiation.\n\nThe theologian Paul Tillich characterized existential anxiety as \"the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing\" and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety: ontic (fate and death), moral (guilt and condemnation), and spiritual (emptiness and meaninglessness). According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods. Tillich argues that this anxiety can be accepted as part of the human condition or it can be resisted but with negative consequences. In its pathological form, spiritual anxiety may tend to \"drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by tradition and authority\" even though such \"undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of reality\".\n\nAccording to Viktor Frankl, the author of \"Man's Search for Meaning\", when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers, the most basic of all human wishes is to find a meaning of life to combat the \"trauma of nonbeing\" as death is near.\n\nAccording to Yerkes-Dodson law, an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam, performance, or competitive event. However, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, the result is a decline in performance.\n\nTest anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an exam. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of grades with personal worth; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of alienation from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation, debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social phobia. The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.\n\nWhile the term \"test anxiety\" refers specifically to students, many workers share the same experience with regard to their career or profession. The fear of failing at a task and being negatively evaluated for failure can have a similarly negative effect on the adult. Management of test anxiety focuses on achieving relaxation and developing mechanisms to manage anxiety.\n\nHumans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others. Apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments.\n\nAnxiety during social interactions, particularly between strangers, is common among young people. It may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia. \"Stranger anxiety\" in small children is not considered a phobia. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called social anxiety. According to Cutting, social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively.\n\nSocial anxiety varies in degree and severity. For some people, it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (e.g. embracing, shaking hands, etc.), while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. Those suffering from this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including avoidant personality disorder.\n\nTo the extent that a person is fearful of social encounters with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending on the nature of the antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety.\n\nAs is the case the more generalized forms of social anxiety, intergroup anxiety has behavioral, cognitive, and affective effects. For instance, increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high. Indeed, such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory. Additionally recent research has found that implicit racial evaluations (i.e. automatic prejudiced attitudes) can be amplified during intergroup interaction. Negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations, but also avoidant, or antagonistic, behavior such as hostility. Furthermore, when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort (e.g., impression management and self-presentation) in intragroup contexts, levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation.\n\nAnxiety can be either a short-term 'state' or a long-term personality \"trait\". Trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency across the lifespan of responding with acute, state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations (whether they are actually deemed threatening or not). A meta-analysis showed that a high level of neuroticism is a risk factor for development of anxiety symptoms and disorders. Such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious.\n\nPersonality can also be a trait leading towards anxiety and depression. Through experience many find it difficult to collect themselves due to their own personal nature.\n\nAnxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is increasingly being recognized as a problem for individuals and for organizations. In 2004, Capgemini wrote: \"Today we're all faced with greater choice, more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice.\"\n\nIn a decision context, unpredictability or uncertainty may trigger emotional responses in anxious individuals that systematically alter decision-making. There are primarily two forms of this anxiety type. The first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities. The second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities.\n\nAnxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by exaggerated feelings of anxiety and fear responses. Anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder.\nThe cause of anxiety disorders is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Anxiety can stem itself from certain factors: genetics, medicinal side-effects, shortness of oxygen. Risk factors include a history of child abuse, family history of mental disorders, and poverty. Anxiety disorders often occur with other mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, personality disorder, and substance use disorder. To be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning. Other problems that may result in similar symptoms including hyperthyroidism, heart disease, caffeine, alcohol, or cannabis use, and withdrawal from certain drugs, among others.\nWithout treatment, anxiety disorders tend to remain. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, counselling, and medications. Counselling is typically with a type of cognitive behavioural therapy. Medications, such as antidepressants or beta blockers, may improve symptoms.\nAbout 12% of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year and between 5-30% are affected at some point in their life. They occur about twice as often in women than they do in men, and generally begin before the age of 25. The most common are specific phobia which affects nearly 12% and social anxiety disorder which affects 10% at some point in their life. They affect those between the ages of 15 and 35 the most and become less common after the age of 55. Rates appear to be higher in the United States and Europe.\n\nNeural circuitry involving the amygdala (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the HPA Axis and sympathetic nervous system) and hippocampus (which is implicated in emotional memory along with the amygdala) is thought to underlie anxiety. People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala. Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system (which includes the amygdala and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, but this does not appear to have been proven.\n\nResearch upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive, vigilant, and fearful finds that their nucleus accumbens is more sensitive than that in other people when deciding to make an action that determined whether they received a reward. This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people. As researchers note, \"a sense of 'responsibility', or self-agency, in a context of uncertainty (probabilistic outcomes) drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation (i.e., nucleus accumbens) more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents\".\n\nGenetics and family history (e.g., parental anxiety) may predispose an individual for an increased risk of an anxiety disorder, but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation. Genetic differences account for about 43% of variance in panic disorder and 28% in generalized anxiety disorder. Although single genes are neither necessary nor sufficient for anxiety by themselves, several gene polymorphisms have been found to correlate with anxiety: PLXNA2, SERT, CRH, COMT and BDNF. Several of these genes influence neurotransmitters (such as serotonin and norepinephrine) and hormones (such as cortisol) which are implicated in anxiety. The epigenetic signature of at least one of these genes BDNF has also been associated with anxiety and specific patterns of neural activity.\n\nMany medical conditions can cause anxiety. This includes conditions that affect the ability to breathe, like COPD and asthma, and the difficulty in breathing that often occurs near death. Conditions that cause abdominal pain or chest pain can cause anxiety and may in some cases be a somatization of anxiety; the same is true for some sexual dysfunctions. Conditions that affect the face or the skin can cause social anxiety especially among adolescents, and developmental disabilities often lead to social anxiety for children as well. Life-threatening conditions like cancer also cause anxiety.\n\nFurthermore, certain organic diseases may present with anxiety or symptoms that mimic anxiety. These disorders include certain endocrine diseases (hypo- and hyperthyroidism, hyperprolactinemia), metabolic disorders (diabetes), deficiency states (low levels of vitamin D, B2, B12, folic acid), gastrointestinal diseases (celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease), heart diseases, blood diseases (anemia), cerebral vascular accidents (transient ischemic attack, stroke), and brain degenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease), among others.\n\nSeveral drugs can cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, withdrawal or from chronic use. These include alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, sedatives (including prescription benzodiazepines), opioids (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin), stimulants (such as caffeine, cocaine and amphetamines), hallucinogens, and inhalants. While many often report self-medicating anxiety with these substances, improvements in anxiety from drugs are usually short-lived (with worsening of anxiety in the long term, sometimes with acute anxiety as soon as the drug effects wear off) and tend to be exaggerated. Acute exposure to toxic levels of benzene may cause euphoria, anxiety, and irritability lasting up to 2 weeks after the exposure.\n\nPoor coping skills (e.g., rigidity/inflexible problem solving, denial, avoidance, impulsivity, extreme self-expectation, negative thoughts, affective instability, and inability to focus on problems) are associated with anxiety. Anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person's own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity. Temperament (e.g., neuroticism) and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) have been found to be risk factors for anxiety.\n\nCognitive distortions such as overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, mind reading, emotional reasoning, binocular trick, and mental filter can result in anxiety. For example, an overgeneralized belief that something bad \"always\" happens may lead someone to have excessive fears of even minimally risky situations and to avoid benign social situations due to anticipatory anxiety of embarrassment. In addition, those who have high anxiety can also create future stressful life events. Together, these findings suggest that anxious thoughts can lead to anticipatory anxiety as well stressful events, which in turn cause more anxiety. Such unhealthy thoughts can be targets for successful treatment with cognitive therapy.\n\nPsychodynamic theory posits that anxiety is often the result of opposing unconscious wishes or fears that manifest via maladaptive defense mechanisms (such as suppression, repression, anticipation, regression, somatization, passive aggression, dissociation) that develop to adapt to problems with early objects (e.g., caregivers) and empathic failures in childhood. For example, persistent parental discouragement of anger may result in repression/suppression of angry feelings which manifests as gastrointestinal distress (somatization) when provoked by another while the anger remains unconscious and outside the individual's awareness. Such conflicts can be targets for successful treatment with psychodynamic therapy. While psychodynamic therapy tends to explore the underlying roots of anxiety, cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to be a successful treatment for anxiety by altering irrational thoughts and unwanted behaviors.\n\nAn evolutionary psychology explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased vigilance regarding potential threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats. This may cause false positive reactions but an individual suffering from anxiety may also avoid real threats. This may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents.\n\nWhen people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, PET-scans show increased bloodflow in the amygdala. In these studies, the participants also reported moderate anxiety. This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors.\n\nSocial risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma (e.g., physical, sexual or emotional abuse or assault), early life experiences and parenting factors (e.g., rejection, lack of warmth, high hostility, harsh discipline, high parental negative affect, anxious childrearing, modelling of dysfunctional and drug-abusing behaviour, discouragement of emotions, poor socialization, poor attachment, and child abuse and neglect), cultural factors (e.g., stoic families/cultures, persecuted minorities including the disabled), and socioeconomics (e.g., uneducated, unemployed, impoverished (although developed countries have higher rates of anxiety disorders than developing countries).\n\nContextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. The difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.\n\nAnxiety disorder appears to be a genetically inherited neurochemical dysfunction that may involve autonomic imbalance; decreased GABA-ergic tone; allelic polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene; increased adenosine receptor function; increased cortisol.\n\nIn the central nervous system (CNS), the major mediators of the symptoms of anxiety disorders appear to be norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Other neurotransmitters and peptides, such as corticotropin-releasing factor, may be involved. Peripherally, the autonomic nervous system, especially the sympathetic nervous system, mediates many of the symptoms. Increased flow in the right parahippocampal region and reduced serotonin type 1A receptor binding in the anterior and posterior cingulate and raphe of patients are the diagnostic factors for prevalence of anxiety disorder.\n\nThe amygdala is central to the processing of fear and anxiety, and its function may be disrupted in anxiety disorders. Anxiety processing in the basolateral amygdala has been implicated with dendritic arborization of the amygdaloid neurons. SK2 potassium channels mediate inhibitory influence on action potentials and reduce arborization.\n\nJoseph E. LeDoux and Lisa Feldman Barrett have both sought to separate automatic threat responses from additional associated cognitive activity within anxiety.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10283346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10283346", "title": "Backtesting", "text": "Backtesting\n\nBacktesting is a term used in modeling to refer to testing a predictive model on historical data. Backtesting is a type of retrodiction, and a special type of cross-validation applied to previous time period(s).\n\nIn a trading strategy, investment strategy, or risk modeling, backtesting seeks to estimate the performance of a strategy or model if it had been employed during a past period. This requires simulating past conditions with sufficient detail, making one limitation of backtesting the need for detailed historical data. A second limitation is the inability to model strategies that would affect historic prices. Finally, backtesting, like other modeling, is limited by potential overfitting. That is, it is often possible to find a strategy that would have worked well in the past, but will not work well in the future. Despite these limitations, backtesting provides information not available when models and strategies are tested on synthetic data.\n\nBacktesting has historically only been performed by large institutions and professional money managers due to the expense of obtaining and using detailed datasets. However, backtrading is increasingly used on a wider basis, and independent web-based backtesting platforms have emerged. Although the technique is widely used, it is prone to weaknesses. Basel financial regulations require large financial institutions to backtest certain risk models.\n\nIn oceanography and meteorology, \"backtesting\" is also known as \"hindcasting\": a hindcast is a way of testing a mathematical model; researchers enter known or closely estimated inputs for past events into the model to see how well the output matches the known results.\n\nHindcasting usually refers to a numerical-model integration of a historical period where no observations have been assimilated. This distinguishes a hindcast run from a reanalysis. Oceanographic observations of salinity and temperature as well as observations of surface-wave parameters such as the significant wave height are much scarcer than meteorological observations, making hindcasting more common in oceanography than in meteorology. Also, since surface waves represent a forced system where the wind is the only generating force, wave hindcasting is often considered adequate for generating a reasonable representation of the wave climate with little need for a full reanalysis. Hydrologists use hindcasting for model stream flows.\n\nAn example of hindcasting would be entering climate forcings (events that force change) into a climate model. If the hindcast showed reasonably-accurate climate response, the model would be considered successful.\n\nThe ECMWF re-analysis is an example of a combined atmospheric reanalysis coupled with a wave-model integration where no wave parameters were assimilated, making the wave part a hindcast run.\n\nIn 2003, Dake Chen and his colleagues “trained” a computer using the data of the surface temperature of the oceans from the last 20 years. Then, using data that had been collected on the surface temperature of the oceans for the period 1857 to 2003, they went through a hindcasting exercise and discovered that their simulation not only accurately predicted every El Niño event for the last 148 years, it also identified the (up to 2 years) looming foreshadow of every single one of those El Niño events.\n"}

The current address of the theater is 46 North Orange Avenue, and it is located at the southwest corner of Orange Avenue and Washington Street. The building's current lack of impressive architecture is offset by its significant cultural history. The Beacham Theatre was considered an important contributing structure when the Downtown Orlando historic district was created in 1980 and the building was granted local landmark status in 1987.\n\nThe Beacham was once part of the vaudeville circuit and hosted celebrity acts such as John Phillip Sousa, the Ziegfeld Follies and W.C. Fields, whose signature was once visible inside a dressing room. In the eras of silent film and Classical Hollywood cinema, the Beacham was operated as a movie theater that utilized then-current state-of-the-art motion picture technology.\n\nThe Beacham, as it is currently named, has since been used as a series of concert venues and nightclubs thus saving it from demolition. The Beacham Theatre was once home to the late-night underground discotheque Aahz that is recognized internationally as a birthplace and critical component of the electronic dance music movement.\n\nThe Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 by Braxton Beacham Sr., who had previously owned three other Orlando theaters and had served as Mayor of Orlando during 1907. In 1917 Beacham paid approximately $17,500–$20,000 for the property one block southwest of his stately residence on Jefferson Street after Orlando's citizens voted to pave the road to the cemetery instead of purchasing the old jail. The property he purchased had formerly served as the jail for Orange County since about 1873. With a $200,000 investment, the former jail building was torn down in 1919 and Beacham developed a series of connected building units along the west side of Orange Avenue between Washington Street and Oak Street (now Wall Street). The new building was then known as \"Beacham's Block\" and is now known the Beacham Building. The location of Beacham's theater was precisely where several condemned prisoners were executed by hanging. According to local folklore, the Beacham Building is reportedly haunted.\n\nThe Beacham's auditorium features \"square columns adorned with feathered capitals that climb gracefully to a high ceiling decorated with rectangles of intricate plasterwork.\" When constructed, the theater was outfitted with draperies that covered the plaster walls. The draperies had \"mild tan figures delicately woven into the broad white field with an occasional soft blue figure\" that were selected by Mrs. Roberta Holland Beacham, wife of Braxton Beacham Sr.\n\nBeacham outfitted his theater with innovative state-of-the art equipment from the Southern Theater Equipment Company of Atlanta. The Beacham's box office in the lobby featured both an automatic admission ticket vending machine dispenser and ticket chopping machine. A decorative marquee that was unique in Florida extended toward the street and featured an electric changeable sign that flashed the daily program. Two Powers 6B type \"E\" projectors were supplied by the N Power company of New York. The Midas Gold film screen was made especially for the Beacham. A medium-sized pipe organ from the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, Connecticut, was purchased and installed at a cost of $15,000. The organ, Opus 1034 with 3 manuals in a center console, 24 ranks of pipes and 24 stops was played by both Mr. Herman Stuart and Mrs. Roberta Branch Beacham, wife of Braxton Beacham Jr. to accompany silent films and vaudeville acts. Typhoon cooling and ventilating equipment was installed in the theater. The Beacham Building's construction featured numerous fireproofing and fire safety measures. When the theater opened, the auditorium had an operating capacity of 1400.\n\nTunnels from the theater stage trap ran into the basements of two nearby hotels. The tunnels had low ceilings and were sealed during new construction in the early 1980s. The tunnels extended south into the San Juan Hotel, where Mr. Beacham happened to have had an office, and then east under Orange Avenue into the Angebilt Hotel. Historians reason that the purpose of the tunnels may have been either for vaudeville performers to enter the theater from their hotels without being mobbed by crowds, or the tunnels could have been used for the storage and transportation of alcoholic beverages during prohibition as has been discovered at some of the other theaters in the Central Florida area.\n\nOn December 9, 1921, Orlando's premier vaudeville and movie house opened by showing \"The Wonderful Thing\", starring Norma Talmadge, a Pathé News newsreel, and Buster Keaton's \"The Boat\". The Beacham Theatre was originally the only independent theater in Orlando. However, the next year, in 1922, Beacham leased his theater to Mack Sparks of the Sparks Theater Company chain.\n\nThe senior Braxton Beacham died in 1924 after a long illness, and Roberta Holland Beacham died soon after in 1926. Their estate and real property were left to their children, Norma K. Hughes, Roberta Augusta Rogers, Braxton Beacham Jr., and his wife Roberta Branch Beacham.\n\nFlorida and Orlando were on what was referred to by as \"The Straw Hat Circuit.\" The Beacham Theatre was included on the Alexander Pantages, Orpheum, and Keith-Albee vaudeville performance circuits (later combined as the Keith-Albee-Orpheum circuit).\n\nManager Harry Vincent started several promotions at the Beacham Theatre in the summer months of the mid-1920s that included Bank Night, Amateur Night, and Country Store Night, which was supported by dozens of local merchants. An advertisement for the Beacham in 1925 says, \"Don't talk about the hot weather. Beat the heat in a Beacham seat. 'Kum Keep Kumfy Kool at the Beacham' is known to many and you won't enjoy yourself until you too get into the line that leads to comfort.\"\n\nFrank Bell served as manager of the theater with organist Herman Siewart and Ken Guernsey leading the community sing-along at open forum meetings that were held for several months during the winter on Sunday afternoons.\n\nThe Beacham's \"exploitation director\" Frank H. Burns often designed and created large elaborate standing displays that decorated the facade and lobby of the theater in order to advertise new film features. The iconic displays that Burns created for the Beacham Theatre were sometimes complete with coordinated costumes for the employees.\n\nIn 1928 Vitaphone and Movietone \"talkie\" equipment debuted during the city's first \"Progress Week\" during the last week of August. \"The queen of the vamps,\" actress Theda Bara, was in appearance at the Beacham as students from Orlando High School sneaked into the balcony via the fire escape. Sound was provided by two gramophone discs that accompanied each film. Both phonographs were played simultaneously in case the needle skipped during a film. Output could be easily switched so that the film's sound could remain in synchronicity with the picture. William Booth succeeded Frank Bell as manager of the Beacham after Bell was transferred in 1928.\n\nThe city's \"Sunday closing law\" was repealed by voters in 1929 by a majority of only 59 votes. Movie theaters and other businesses in Orlando were then permitted to operate seven days a week. All of Orlando's theaters, including the Beacham, celebrated by showing free films until late into the night.\n\nInterest in silent films began to diminish in 1929 and they were gradually phased out and moved into obsolescence. On Thursday evenings at the Beacham for the Bank Night promotion, $200 was raffled with prizes of $50. On Saturday, December 24, 1931, and on Wednesday, September 28, 1932, a brand new $325 Austin 7 Sport Roadster was given away.\nVaudeville acts continued touring at the Beacham for several more years until approximately 1933. Homer Fuller served as manager of the Beacham during the end of the eras of silent films and vaudeville.\n\nIn 1933 following a bitter lawsuit against Orlando Enterprises over nonpayment of the lease for the building that had been originally negotiated with the senior Braxton Beacham in 1924, the theater was closed for almost three weeks. $8000 in back taxes on Beacham's building was due. Beacham Jr. claimed the closure was deliberate and malicious and sued for $100,000. Two separate judgments were entered against Orlando Enterprises Inc. for $2291.67 each and a payment agreement was reached. Litigation was then withdrawn.\n\nAs a result of the suit the lease was not renewed and Beacham's theater again became Orlando's only independent cinema.\nIn the same year, the theater was soon leased Florida State Theaters. Harry Vincent was named manager of the reopened theater in 1933; however, soon after, Vernon D. Hunter became the theater's manager and remained in that role for the next two decades.\n\nIn August 1937 the Orlando Police Department raided the Beacham Theatre. All of the equipment for the Bank Night marketing promotion was seized after authorities declared it to be a lottery.\n\n\"The Yearling\" was filmed locally in 1946 and the Beacham's projectionist Byram McGee served as an electrician and steward on the film production. Mcgee's wife Lois acted in the role of Ma Forrester and was also the production's wardrobe supervisor. Numerous other local technicians were involved with making the film.\n\n\"The Orlando Story\", filmed by Don Parrisher Motion Picture Productions of New York, contained images of daily life in Orlando. The movie was heavily promoted locally and was shown at the Beacham over three days in August 1949.\n\nIn December 1949 \"The Tom Thumb Follies\" staged radio broadcast performances at the Beacham. When a Santa Claus from the Elks Lodge lifted one young elf into the audience for the last verse, the smell of bourbon whiskey caused her to ponder, \"I wasn't just sure where the night's polka would land us. Maybe Oz?\"\n\nAfter an extensive remodel, CinemaScope equipment was introduced at the \"New\" Beacham Theatre in 1954 with the addition of stereophonic sound, new projection lenses, and a wider screen. CinemaScope had its debut at the Beacham on January 7, 1954, for a two-week showing of the film \"The Robe\". Vernon D. Hunter retired after 20 years as manager of the Beacham Theater. Walther Colby became the executive director of several Orlando theaters including the Beacham.\n\nBraxton Beacham Jr., died in 1961.\n\nDuring the Civil Rights Movement, the Beacham Theatre had frequent stand-in protests by African American citizens of relegation to lesser \"colored theaters\" mandated by Jim Crow laws such as the Florida Constitution of 1885. Reverend Nelson Pinder, of Parramore's Episcopal Church of St. John the Baptist, along with other community leaders such as NAACP Youth Council advisor, Rev. Curtis Jackson, worked with white officials for peaceful integration in Orlando in order to avoid incidents of racial violence that were occurring in other Florida cities. Rev. Pinder organized the church's Liberal Religious Youth group. Rev. Pinder's youth group protests were often joined by local members of the Youth Council of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Each night, activist members of the youth groups quietly stood-in near the Beacham's ticket booth until the theater stopped selling tickets. On May 24, 1962, white supremacists were also picketing the Beacham at the same time as the Liberal Religious Youth group. Orlando police arrested eight teen protestors. The teens were kept in so-called protective custody and were later released to their parents. Following agreements with a biracial committee from Orlando Mayor Bob Carr's office, of which Rev. Pinder was a member, the Beacham Theatre quietly began allowing a limited number of African-American patrons into the balcony for designated showings in 1963. The theater remained racially segregated for African-American patrons until 1965.\n\nIn 1964 the theater was temporarily closed down while Cinerama equipment was installed. A super-wide anamorphic movie screen was added to the auditorium and the stereophonic sound system was upgraded. Two Norelco Universal 70/35mm Motion Picture Projectors and a small restroom for the projectionist were installed in a newly built downstairs projection booth under the balcony that required the removal of two aisles and several seats. Following the Beacham's upgrade to 70 mm film technology, \"The Sound of Music\" had a continuous 14-month run between 1965 and 1966.\n\nOrlando's Chamber of Commerce held open forum meetings at the Beacham Theatre on Sundays during the winter months of 1971-1973 under the direction of W. F. Blackman.\n\nDuring the 1970s Orlando, like many U.S. cites, was experiencing symptoms of urban decay. The rush from the city to the suburbs affected nearly all of the city's businesses. As an effect of the exodus, each of Downtown Orlando's movie theaters closed. Dick Gabel and John Prine were serving as projectionists at several of the theaters. Following a decline in attendance, by 1974 the Beacham Theatre and Florida State Theaters in general were primarily showing exploitation films and B-movie action films. The next year, H. A. Tedder, who was the Orlando executive manager at long-time lessee Florida State Theaters, made the decision that The Beacham Theatre would cease operating as a first-run movie cinema. After showing a Sunday double-feature of \"Return of the Street Fighter\", and \"The Scavengers\", the Beacham Theatre's manager, McKinley Howard, closed the theater's doors as a first-run film cinema for the last time on September 28, 1975. Florida State Theaters remained responsible for paying the monthly lease of $2700 until the theater was sold.\n\nIn 1975 Larry and Sherry Carpenter purchased the Beacham Building from then-owners, Betty Rubles Bray, and Burkett H. Bray Jr. A great-granddaughter of Braxton Beacham, Mrs. Bray, refused to sell the theater by itself without also selling the rest of the building as a package. An extensive $250,000 remodeling and restoration followed that included stunning multi-colored Art Deco revival style graphics painted over the facade and a large multi-story mural of a saxophone and its open case painted on the rear of the theater that faced west and was clearly visible from nearby Interstate 4. Following the restoration the Carpenters opened Orlando's franchise location of The Great Southern Music Hall at the Beacham in 1976. The 700-seat Great Southern Music Hall was a concert venue that hosted approximately 180 prominent national and regional acts at the Beacham. The Great Southern Music Hall was occasionally still used as a movie theater that presented world cinema and classic Hollywood films by film directors such as John Carpenter, Federico Fellini, and Mel Brooks during the week. John Lawson was the acting projectionist and served as stage director for concerts. As The Great Southern Music Hall, only about seven music shows were unprofitable. Nevertheless, Orlando's Great Southern Music Hall closed in 1981 due to the rising costs of hosting concerts for notable musical acts and competition from larger venues.\n\nRoberta Branch Beacham died in 1980.\n\nIn 1981 Sherry Carpenter, then sole owner, leased the theater to Jeff Roberts. Roberts opened Laser World, a futuristic one- and one-half hour laser light show that featured lasers, sound, ballet, costumed modern dance routines and magic illusion, as well as outer space photographs that were projected onto a large viewing screen from behind. Laser World closed in 1982.\n\nOther short-lasting entities followed such as a tourist-oriented laser tag business. \"The Orlando Sentinel\" critic Howard Means, reminded readers, that the 1965 installation of \"then-new Cinerama equipment at the Beacham was the latest testimony to the faith in the future of Downtown Orlando\" and that, \"The Beacham had long been seen as a bellwether of the health of the center city.\" Upon further reflection, he lamented, \"that the Beacham is simply a microcosm of modern downtown realities.\" Means editorialized, by 1982 \"The present state of the Beacham was the latest testament to decay,\" and, \"In the way of dying enterprises, the Beacham's reincarnations became increasingly more short-lived.\"\n\nIn February 1983 Oscar F. Juarez, an Orlando property developer and Republican Party strategist, purchased the building for $1.5 million. Soon after the purchase, a plan was announced to lease it in order to open a bar and French restaurant \"with a Georgetown flair\" that later became Valentyne's Restaurant as well as a new nightclub inside the theater.\n\nA vision for the theater announced in 1983 was for a New York-style nightclub dubbed Studio 46 that emulated the spirit of the legendary \"Studio 54.\" Studio 46 did not come to fruition but the primordial description of Orlando's very own \"Studio 54\" at the Beacham Theater was soon realized just a few years later.\n\nThe theater was next leased by Ellen Hunt, of Orlando, and Roger Lopez, of France in August 1983. Hunt and Lopez opened a cabaret club in the theater named Moulin Orange that featured Las Vegas-style showgirls. Moulin Orange was only open for several months during 1983 and 1984.\n\nIn December 1984 with the hope of operating an expansion to his dinner theater franchise, a five-year lease of the theater was granted to Theatre Management Corporation of Orlando consisting of actor Tom McKinney and Rick Allen, a producer of the Reynolds Theater. The Beacham served as a Celebrity Dinner Theater franchise location in conjunction with Valentyne's restaurant that was next door from 1985 until 1986. Under new management, Valentyne's Celebrity Dinner Theater briefly reopened in 1986 before the dinner theater venture at the Beacham finally ended entirely early in 1987.\n\nThe Beacham Theatre was granted local historic landmark status on September 21, 1987, for its historical significance to the community. Between each new identity for the theater and the occasional concert, the Beacham Theatre sat unoccupied and empty.\n\nDespite the new recognition for the theater by the City of Orlando, Mr. Juarez saw the building as a liability with many pleasant memories surrounding it, but with little economic potential. Citing maintaining the building and rehabilitation of the area, he first announced plans to raze the building for an unspecified mix-use purpose and later to redevelop the former Beacham Block with a new skyscraper that would be used as a combination office building and hotel. In 1988 Juarez received two successive approval Certificate of Appropriateness permits from the City of Orlando Board of Historic Preservation to demolish the Beacham Theatre within 180 days. The \"Bye-bye Beacham Bash\" was promptly organized by Orlando Remembered and attended by former theater doormen, ushers, candy girls, and cashiers on December 9, 1988. However, Mr. Juarez's redevelopment plan and the new construction of a 20-story office building and parking garage fell through at the last moment due to poor timing. Additional parking could have contributed to a revitalized downtown area, but the market for office space in Downtown Orlando was nearly saturated in the late 1980s and there was a general lack of interest from prospective future tenants. Had the project materialized, Mr. Juaraz would have been required to reconstruct a replica of the original Beacham Theatre facade using original building materials of brick, stucco, decorative tile, and pastel colors.\n\nIn 1987 Brad Belletto and then-wife Lisa moved to Orlando from Louisiana. Brad Belletto, then owned a theatrical equipment manufacturing company and had formerly owned Moon Sound, a New Orleans sound and lighting company. The Bellettos, intent on overhauling the music scene in Orlando, were looking for a new venue following operation of a successful club in Baton Rouge. They found the Beacham Theatre and immediately fell in love with it. At that time, the Beacham was being subleased to Clark J, a local record producer, and a brief partnership was formed.\n\nLate in 1988 the lease for the Beacham's theater was secured by the Bellettos under Entertainment Investments International. Several of Lisa's cousins relocated to Orlando to help out with the task of preparing the Beacham for its opening and Brad's mother Bev tended the bar through the entire duration of the lease. The Bellettos also hosted an annual full-service Christmas dinner for hundreds of the city's homeless population at the Beacham Theatre with food donated by Orlando's high-end restaurants and businesses.\n\nThe Bellettos planned to use the Beacham Theatre for theatrical performances and concerts during the week and as a nightclub on the weekends. Frank Carroll, served as the managing artistic director for theatre productions and starred in a Las Vegas-style musical revue tribute to Liberace, \"Viva Liberace, Viva\". A \"Leonard Bernstein opera\" and \"an Edward Albee drama\" were additional production features before theatrical productions ceased.\n\nConcerts were coordinated by Mary Ann D'Arpino of Mary Ann Productions, who had an office at the Beacham; Island Productions; Harry Tiyler of Fat Harry Productions, and Cellar Door Productions. Several prominent musical act concerts of nearly every genre were staged during this time.\n\nSince 1988 the theater has been used as a series of combination nightclub and concert venue enterprises.\n\nIn May 1989 the Beacham Theatre was sold by Oscar Juarez for $1.8 million to a property management firm owned by Longwood businesswoman Missy Casscells and her husband Frank Hamby.\n\nBrad and Lisa Belletto scoured sources across the U.S. and Europe and traveled frequently for new and rare records. During the Second Summer of Love in the United Kingdom that began in 1988, on Friday and Saturday nights the Beacham Theater housed a discotheque that had a progressive dance music format with Lisa Belletto as resident DJ and lighting control operator and Brad Belletto as operating director. Initially the club was to be called \"F/X (or Effects)\" but it opened as Pure Energy.\n\nThe late nights at the Beacham featured DJs, beat matching, rare and obscure dance music on vinyl records, intelligent lighting, and themed decor that at times included original paintings by local artist Rollo. The popularity of dancing throughout the night at the Beacham Theatre initially caught on slowly and many free passes were given out. Soon, the entry queue for \"Late Night\" snaked around the block.\n\nThe conceptual themes for \"Late Night\" were frequently alternated (sometimes weekly) and occasionally repeated. The various themes subsequently included World War III, Aahz, Trancentral, The Haunted Theatre, Egypt, Alphabet City, Psychedelic Babylon, Unity, and Reunion. The all-night dance parties were eventually referred to using the umbrella term \"'Late Night' at the Classic Beacham Theatre.\"\n\nThe Aahz nightclub concept was born after Lisa saw the name at a shop in Los Angeles. The Bellettos and Shayni Howen then created and developed the Aahz concept for the Beacham. Shayni and her team created Aahz's iconic décor which included a painted yellow brick road and a giant paper mache Wizard of Oz head behind the stage. At midnight each night, the stage's curtain was raised and the glowing eyes and smoking mouth of the Wizard were revealed, at which point DJ Lisa always played Rhythm Device's \"Acid Rock\".\n\nEventually the combined tasks of simultaneously playing all of the music and operating the lights became overwhelming for Lisa and as a result Shayni's sister, \"Late night\" veteran Stacey \"StaceBass\" Howen, was brought in to operate the computerized lighting control console and promote the nightclub. By the Summer of 1989, Lisa was expecting her first child and still resident DJ. Only two months before the birth of her son she invited Kimball Collins, who was the DJ in the Beacham Buildings northern unit, to replace her and hired him as Aahz's resident Late Night DJ. Joseph Jilbert (DJ Jo-Edd), Steve McClure (DJ Monk) and Paul Campbell (DJ Stylus) had brief stints as DJ at \"Late Night\" when they were hired to fill in for Lisa or Kimball Collins. Dave Cannalte was quickly brought in as \"Late Night's\" co-resident DJ.\n\nAt this point, Underground music such as Industrial dance music and Gothic rock was played during Orlando's normal bar operating hours from 10 p.m. until just after 2 a.m.\nUpon an announcement at around 2:30 a.m. (or an opening at 3 a.m.) that said simply, \"Welcome to Late Night,\" mixed New Beat, Progressive dance, Balearic beat, and Acid house electronic dance music began that frequently lasted until 8 a.m. and occasionally lasted until as late as 11 a.m.\n\nLocal DJ's Jerry Johnson (\"the Reverend\"), Andy Hughes, Jay Skinner, Robby Clark, Troy Davis, Eddie Pappa (DJ Icey) and DJ Lisa Belletto were occasional guests for special events such as the \"DJ Unity for the World\" dance party in December 1991.\n\nDave Cannalte and Kimball Collins, and Stace presided over and further developed an ever-growing local scene. Chris Fortier later joined the duo of Kimball and Dave Cannalte as an Aahz resident DJ. As it evolved, \"Late Night\" boosted the careers of numerous DJs and producers such as Andy Hughes, Jimmy Van M, AK1200, DJ Icey, DJ Baby Anne, Sean Cusick, and Cosmic Baby, as well as Dave Seaman, Sasha and John Digweed.\n\nThe use of psychedelic drugs such as ecstasy and LSD at the Beacham Theatre during the late 1980s and early 1990s was prevalent and eventually began to attract the attention of law enforcement agencies. After \"warnings\" about increased surveillance of the Beacham that allegedly came from the Drug Enforcement Administration, additional security, pat-downs, new restrictions on reentering, attire, and the behavior for patrons were implemented. Once, during the early 1990s, \"Late Night\" was raided by masked agents of the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation who temporarily stopped the music and turned on the lights while they searched for and detained a suspect.\n\nThe final all-night Aahz-themed events (The Return of Aahz) were held at the Beacham between September 7, 1991, and July 4, 1992, and lasted until Dekko's opened. However, \"Aahz\" was the theme that really stuck with patrons and among participants is still used as a nickname for \"Late Night\" reunion tour events and even for the Beacham Theatre itself. \"Lift\" night soon commenced in the Beacham Building's north-most unit, then called Barbarella's. The Beacham Building's north-most corner unit was once called Beach Club where Kimball Collins was resident DJ in the mid-1980s. \"Late Night\" in the Beacham Theatre returned when Unity presented \"Welcome (Back) to Late Night\" on October 30, 1993. \"Late Night's\" Reunion at the Beacham was then initiated at Dekko's.\n\nThe early mornings at the Beacham Theatre kick started Orlando's own Summer of Love between 1991 and 1992 that helped usher in the increased popularity of the subculture surrounding electronic dance music in Florida and subsequently in the United States. \"Late Night\" organized several music festivals that were held at the Orange County Convention Center such as the \"Infonet\" DJ spinoff on October 24, 1992, the \"Infonet 2\" dance party on December 31, 1992, and \"Infonet 3,\" \"The Underground Explosion,\" on July 3, 1993. Subsequent large-event promoters failed to emulate the spirit of those events. Although, \"raves\" per se were not held in the Theater, the Beacham served as the prototype for nearly all of the larger so-called rave-oriented nightclubs that followed it. In doing so, \"Late Night\" at the Beacham Theatre inspired the genesis of the internationally recognized \"Orlando Sound\" genre that is also known as Florida breaks.\n\nInside \"Late Night\" at the Beacham was always very dark and the auditorium was absolutely filthy. In contrast, initially the scene's \"vibe\" was pure and drugs such as MDMA that were available were relatively unadulterated. As time went on, the beloved Beacham was beautified and remodeled into Dekko's. While the Beacham itself was cleaned up, the overall \"vibe\" of Orlando's scene seemed to darken somewhat just as the quality of club drugs that were still available during that time became tainted.\n\nDuring the summer of 1994, at a \"Late Night\" event featuring a guest appearance DJ Sasha, two female revelers who were attending a Reunion event at the Beacham Theatre collapsed just before sunrise. The women were carried outside to Orange Avenue in front of Dekko's where CPR was administered by an Orlando Police Department officer and paramedics were dispatched. Tragically, one of the young women expired. \"The Orlando Sentinel\" reported the May 1, 1994, passing of 20-year old Teresa Schwartz and that the other young woman was briefly in critical condition. However, she promptly recovered. Substance abuse, related cardiac arrhythmia, or hyperthermia was the suspected cause of death.\n\nThe incident along with those at other venues in Orlando, shocked the underground dance club scene in Central Florida and were followed by a dramatic decrease in attendance. \"Late Night's\" organizers made the responsible decision to end Reunion at Dekko's after their pleas for young club-goers to practice moderation were ignored. The Dekko's concept was sold to a competitor in the following months.\n\nOn Saturday nights during 1995 \"Late Night\" briefly resumed in The Club at Firestone with DJ Robby Clark Kimball Collins, Dave Cannalte, StaceBass and friends. However, the City of Orlando subsequently created a \"Rave Review Task Force\" in 1997 and later passed a local ordinance that contributed to Florida's crackdown on after-hours nightclubs. Central Florida's crackdown led to the eventual passage of an \"anti-rave\" law in Florida that ultimately led to the signing of national Anti-Rave legislation.\n\nThe Aahz Reunion Tour launched in 1998 and as of 2016, reunions of Aahz \"Late Night\" occur nearly biannually and are frequently held in the Beacham Theatre. \"Late Night\" reunions, however, now end promptly before 2:30 a.m.\n\nBy 1992 the future looked brighter for the Beacham Theatre when Mike Berry, staff writer, for \"The Orlando Sentinel\" wrote that, \"The Beacham Theatre is the latest testament to reincarnation.\" Concerts were no longer being held in the auditorium during this time period and the Beacham Theatre was used exclusively as night club through 2010.\n\nIt was 1992 when Orlando Attorney Mark NeJame leased the Beacham Theatre with the option to match the purchase price of any prospective buyers. The Beacham underwent restoration at a cost of in excess of $1,000,000. NeJame then opened \"Dekko's,\" a mainstream \"high-energy dance club.\" \"Dekko's\" is an amalgam of Deco and Gekko. The \"Dekko's\" concept featured a rose-beige exterior with a newly restored Art Deco inspired facade with red neon lighting. Dekko's interior included extensive use of the color purple and a sushi bar in the balcony. The inclusion of a terrarium (vivarium) with live subtropical geckos was planned. \"Dekko's\" was open from late 1992 until the \"high-energy dance club\" concept was bought out in 1994 by Bill Harmening who operated The Edge, a competing nightclub.\n\n\"Zuma Beach Club\" followed Dekko's and opened in 1994. The recently remodeled auditorium was gutted for the change. Redecoration was complete with fishing nets, galvanized watering troughs for beer, and warning signs for sharks. On February 22, 1995, NeJame entered a new partnership with George Maltezos, John SanFelippo and brother, Joseph SanFelippo. Zuma Beach was often described by NeJame as \"the cheesiest club in America.\" \"Rolling Stone\" in 1997 described Zuma Beach as a \"cheesy dive.\" Zuma Beach even hosted an Extreme Championship Wrestling \"hardcore\" professional wrestling match on January 29, 2000. Mercifully, \"Zuma Beach\" closed its doors in late 2000.\n\nFinally, after yet another remodeling of the auditorium, \"Tabu opened in 2001.\" Initially, Tabu was more of an upscale nightclub. Backstreet Boy Howie Dorough, who performed his first musical at the Beacham as one of the Munchkins in the Lollipop Guild for a theatre production of \"The Wizard of Oz\", was a design and talent acquisition advisor for Tabu. However, Tabu later became more mainstream. Tabu had a weekly lineup presentation that with the exception of hosting live music, was similar to the theater's current nightclub iteration. Tabu closed in late 2010 when Mark NeJame and Joseph SanFelippo left the partnership.\n\nIn 2011 leases for the Beacham Theatre were renewed by John SanFelippo and George Maltezos, along with Gerard Mitchell and Michael McRaney, who leased the adjacent unit. Their partnership is named 46/54 North Orange Ave, LLC, and both units are leased from building owners Margaret Casscells and Frank Hamby, of Beacham Theater, LLC.\n\nSince 2011 \"The Beacham\" nightclub has operated in partnership with \"The Social,\" a smaller venue next door at 54 North Orange Avenue. The venues, are connected via a passage and door. The Beacham features disc jockey entertainment and plays Hip hop, Top 40, Latin music, and Reggaeton.\"\n\nThe Live Entertainment era currently continues on stages at both The Beacham and partner The Social. Prominent national and international musical acts perform with fidelity to the countless shows by numerous acts that have previously held performances in the Beacham Theatre from the mid-1970s through the early-1990s.\n\nBeacham's Building is divided into seven rental units using wood frame, brick walls, different facades, and paint. The theater is the south-most unit. The two-story Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 in a simple 20th Century Commercial Style. The structure is constructed of reinforced concrete and brick with stucco out-surface. Utilization of wood in the construction was minimized.\n\nThe facade was decorated with multi-colored tile trim and impregnated with seashell. The first story originally contained two small storefronts, a boxoffice, and lobby entrance to the theater as well the auditorium, stage, dressing rooms, staff restrooms, and a green room. The second story of the theater contained restrooms, windowed offices, a projection booth, and balcony seating section as well as additional dressing rooms accessible by a spiral staircase. Above the stage was the fly system and catwalk.\n\nIn 1936 Art Deco styling with Mediterranean-style tile was added to the facade and extensive neon lighting was installed the on the entrance overhang. Inside, the theater was modernized to provide lighted stairs, air conditioning into the dressing rooms, an enlarged auditorium, and improved seating. Capacity was reduced to 1,051. To diminish echoes from the projectors and recorded sound equipment, the auditorium was carpeted with a floral pattern and the plaster walls were covered with an Ozite material. Vernon Hunter oversaw the modernization.\n\nIn 1954 the look of the theater was modernized once again with the removal of parapets, cornices, and windows. The marquee was replaced with a new porcelain one. The lobby was enclosed with glass doors and the boxoffice was moved to the right side of the lobby exterior and rebuilt. An entirely new stucco sheeting was installed over the facade, a wide screen was installed, and new decorations and push-back seats were added with additional alterations to the floor plan and seating areas. Capacity was reduced to 650.\n\nIn 1964 the proscenium was modified to accommodate the installation of Cinerama widescreen. A new projection room was constructed under the balcony to accommodate 70-mm projectors.\nBy 1975 the theater was no longer being used as a feature cinema. For the 1976 opening of the Great Southern Music Hall, the theater's interior and stage were remodeled, the proscenium was rebuilt, balcony seating was added. The facade was repainted with Art Deco graphics and a large mural was painted on the back of the theater. Capacity was increased to 765.\n\nThe balcony was extended in 1981.\n\nIn 1984 the theater cinema's 765 seats were removed and sold and the sloped auditorium floor was terraced. Buffet dinner tables for 400 and balcony tables for 100 were added. The backstage area was remodeled, and the balcony was restored back to its original shape. Exterior drainage was improved.\n\nThe degraded ceiling plasterwork was repaired and repainted, the roof was replaced and wiring were upgraded in 1988. External air conditioning was being pumped in.\n\nBy 1991 the balcony was renovated and re-extended and the 70 mm film projection room under the balcony had been removed and the air conditioning repaired. Opera boxes were installed on the second floor of either side of the stage and the DJ booth was relocated shortly thereafter.\n\nAs the Beacham was renovated to become Dekkos's in 1992, it was discovered that the stucco sheeting that was installed during a modernization in 1954 could not be economically removed without severely damaging the original facade underneath. Restoration plans for the facade had to be modified.\nAn arched molding was then added to the facade. A sunburst and red neon lighting was subsequently added.\n\nFollowing an effort to \"bring back the aesthetics of the old Beacham Theatre,\" in 2000 owners restored the Beacham's ornate plaster ceiling moldings, facade, and marquee. In addition, the sloping theater floor was made level and the stage was elevated. The original Beacham Theatre sign is awaiting restoration and is being stored on the roof.\n\nAround 2005, the facade was modified by removing a small semi-circular molding in front of the sunburst. The points of the sunburst were also removed leaving a large semi-circular molding and larger arch above it decorating the facade.\n\nThe balcony and upstairs areas were remodeled in 2011 with a beautifully painted ceiling and the addition of two chandeliers. Restrooms were installed in place of the theater's original office area and 35 mm film projection booth. The theater's ornate plaster ceilings are in a state of disrepair with the decorative ceiling concealed behind a black cloth barrier that can retain any pieces of plaster that might fall.\n\nDuring the summer months of 2016 the crumbling arched molding was removed from the facade. The facade was then repaired and repainted and new red and blue neon lighting was installed. Further restoration in the near future is in a discussion and planning stage.\n\nVaudeville acts that have performed at the Beacham Theatre include the Ziegfeld Follies, John Phillip Sousa, W.C. Fields, Irving Berlin's \"Music Box Revue\", Frieda Hempel, Theda Bara, Irving Caesar's \"The Greenwich Village Follies of 1922\", organist \"Professor\" Herman Siewert, Keith's Vaudeville Company, ventriloquist , Flo Ziegfeld's \"Sally\", Gertrude Hoffmann Dancers, \"Artists and Models Super Revue of 1924\", The Cloverleaf Dancers, The Elks Minstrels, \"Fay, Lane, & Barry;\" \"Fay Two Colleys;\" and gymnasts The Kramer Brothers.\n\nBlues and Jazz legends Ray Charles, B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, Johnny Sansone, Delbert McClinton, Leon Russell, Edgar Winter, Leo Kottke, Roy Buchanan, Dr. John, Buckwheat Zydeco, Maynard Ferguson, Billy Cobham, Gato Barbieri, Ramsey Lewis, Freddie Hubbard, and Diane Schuur have performed at the Beacham Theatre.\n\nClassic rock era acts such as The Police, The Pretenders, Rick Derringer, Pat Travers Band, Al Stewart, Dickey Betts, Head East, Sea Level, Utopia, Horslips, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Dave Brubeck, Todd Rundgren, Bill Warheit, Michael Hedges, Earl Scruggs, José Feliciano, Lyle Lovett, Root Boy Slim, and the Ramones have performed at the Beacham.\n\nMetal acts such as Judas Priest, Slayer, Gwar, Dark Angel, 7 seconds, Overkill, and Wolfsbane, and Death Angel have appeared at the Beacham.\n\nReggae acts Pato Banton, Toots Hibbert, The Maytals, Inner Circle, The Wailers, Aswad, and Yellowman have also performed.\n\nIn more recent years Ministry, KMFDM, Fugazi, Revolting Cocks, Devo, Book of Love, Go Radio, Tori Amos, Soundgarden, The Pixies, Good Charlotte, Pink, Lush, David Byrne, Fishbone, The Cramps, Flat Duo Jets, L.A.

The more common plot referred to as a carpet plot is one that illustrates the interaction between two or more independent variables and one or more dependent variables in a two-dimensional plot. Besides the ability to incorporate more variables, another feature that distinguishes a carpet plot from an equivalent contour plot or 3D surface plot is that a carpet plot can be used to more accurately interpolate data points. A conventional carpet plot can capture the interaction of up to three independent variables and three dependent variables and still be easily read and interpolated.\n\nCarpet plots have common applications within areas such as material science for showing elastic modulus in laminates, and within aeronautics.\n\nAnother plot sometimes referred to as a carpet plot is the temporal raster plot. \n\nA carpet plot with two independent variables and one dependent variable is often called a cheater plot for the use of a phantom \"cheater\" axis in lieu of the horizontal axis. As a result of this missing axis, the values can be shifted horizontally such that the intersections line up vertically. This allows for easy interpolation by having fixed horizontal intervals correspond to fixed intervals in both independent variables. The horizontal shift must sometimes be adjusted in order to eliminate or mitigate overlapping. Depending on the data being depicted, eliminating overlapping is not always possible. The common solution is to split the plot into two carpets.\n\nInstead of using the horizontal axis to adjust the plot perspective and align carpet intersections vertically, the horizontal axis can be used to show the effects on an additional dependent variable. In this case the perspective is fixed, and any overlapping cannot be adjusted. Because a true carpet plot represents two independent variables and two dependent variables simultaneously, there is no corresponding way to show the information on a conventional contour plot or 3D surface plot.\n\nTo add an additional dependent variable, isolines that are a function of the two independent variables can be added within the carpet to create a contour plot in the carpet domain. Contours can be added to cheater plots as well as to true carpet plots.\n\nThe effects of an additional independent variable can be visualized via multiple carpets on the same plot corresponding to different values of the third independent variable. If the intersections are connected, a lattice appears. For an intermediate value, a whole carpet can be interpolated using the lattice lines. This technique may result in too much overlapping of carpets in a true carpet plot but is always possible for a cheater plot because the separation of the additional carpets can be adjusted on the phantom horizontal axis.\n\n"}

It was an important step in showing the homology of all insect wings. This system was based on Needham's \"pretracheation theory\" that was later discredited by Frederic Charles Fraser in 1938.\n\nThe Comstock and Needham system attributes different names to the veins on an insect's wing. From the anterior (leading) edge of the wing towards the posterior (rear), the major longitudinal veins are named:\n\nApart from the costal and the anal veins, each vein can be branched, in which case the branches are numbered from anterior to posterior. For example, the two branches of the subcostal vein will be called Sc and Sc.\n\nThe radius typically branches once near the base, producing anteriorly the R and posteriorly the \"radial sector\" Rs. The radial sector may fork twice.\n\nThe media may also fork twice, therefore having four branches reaching the wing margin.\n\nAccording to the Comstock–Needham system, the cubitus forks once, producing the cubital veins Cu and Cu. \nAccording to some other authorities, Cu may fork again, producing the Cu and Cu.\n\nAs there are several anal veins, they are called A1, A2, and so on. They are usually unforked.\n\nCrossveins link the longitudinal veins, and are named accordingly (for example, the medio-cubital crossvein is termed m-cu). Some crossveins have their own name, like the humeral crossvein h and the sectoral crossvein s.\n\nThe cells are named after the vein on the anterior side; for instance, the cell between Sc and R is called Sc.\n\nIn the case where two cells are separated by a crossvein but have the same anterior longitudinal vein, they should have the same name. To avoid this, they are attributed a number. For example, the R cell is divided in two by the radial cross vein: the basal cell is termed \"first R\", and the distal cell \"second R\".\n\nIf a cell is bordered anteriorly by a forking vein, such as R and R, the cell is named after the distal vein, in this case R.\n\n"}
{"id": "698226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=698226", "title": "Concept map", "text": "Concept map\n\nA concept map or conceptual diagram is a diagram that depicts suggested relationships between concepts. It is a graphical tool that instructional designers, engineers, technical writers, and others use to organize and structure knowledge.\n\nA concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in linking phrases such as \"causes\", \"requires\", or \"contributes to\".\n\nThe technique for visualizing these relationships among different concepts is called \"concept mapping\". Concept maps have been used to define the ontology of computer systems, for example with the object-role modeling or Unified Modeling Language formalism.\n\nA concept map is a way of representing relationships between ideas, images, or words in the same way that a sentence diagram represents the grammar of a sentence, a road map represents the locations of highways and towns, and a circuit diagram represents the workings of an electrical appliance. In a concept map, each word or phrase connects to another, and links back to the original idea, word, or phrase. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. An example of the use of concept maps is provided in the context of learning about types of fuel.\n\nConcept maps were developed to enhance meaningful learning in the sciences. A well-made concept map grows within a \"context frame\" defined by an explicit \"focus question\", while a mind map often has only branches radiating out from a central picture. Some research evidence suggests that the brain stores knowledge as productions (situation-response conditionals) that act on declarative memory content, which is also referred to as chunks or propositions. Because concept maps are constructed to reflect organization of the declarative memory system, they facilitate sense-making and meaningful learning on the part of individuals who make concept maps and those who use them.\n\n\nConcept mapping was developed by Joseph D. Novak and his research team at Cornell University in the 1970s as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students. It has subsequently been used as a tool to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. Concept maps have their origin in the learning movement called constructivism. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge.\n\nNovak's work is based on the cognitive theories of David Ausubel, who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn (or \"assimilate\") new concepts: \"The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly.\" Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as \"What is water?\" \"What causes the seasons?\" In his book \"Learning How to Learn\", Novak states that a \"meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures.\"\n\nVarious attempts have been made to conceptualize the process of creating concept maps. Ray McAleese, in a series of articles, has suggested that mapping is a process of \"off-loading\". In this 1998 paper, McAleese draws on the work of Sowa and a paper by Sweller & Chandler. In essence, McAleese suggests that the process of making knowledge explicit, using \"nodes\" and \"relationships\", allows the individual to become aware of what they know and as a result to be able to modify what they know. Maria Birbili applies that same idea to helping young children learn to think about what they know. The concept of the \"knowledge arena\" is suggestive of a virtual space where learners may explore what they know and what they do not know.\n\nConcept maps are used to stimulate the generation of ideas, and are believed to aid creativity. Concept mapping is also sometimes used for brain-storming. Although they are often personalized and idiosyncratic, concept maps can be used to communicate complex ideas.\n\nFormalized concept maps are used in software design, where a common usage is Unified Modeling Language diagramming amongst similar conventions and development methodologies.\n\nConcept mapping can also be seen as a first step in ontology-building, and can also be used flexibly to represent formal argument — similar to argument maps.\n\nConcept maps are widely used in education and business.

Academicians and students in different disciplines like psychology, social science, philosophy of science, scientific method, political science, business management and economics have convened to conduct scientific research and produce applications of science pertaining to human behavior as it is manifested in varying contexts. ELYADAL's perspective regarding scientific inquiry can be summarized as \"disseminating the scientific knowledge accumulated by following curiosity through asking questions and answering them by means of scientific research.\"\n\nELYADAL has two branches to organize interests in two broad topics. The first branch is related to make research on, develop programs to train on, and to provide information about critical thinking and creative thinking for students, faculty members, and organizations. The second branch is organized around behavior, its antecedents and consequences, and research conducted in an interdisciplinary fashion is welcomed.\n\nThe process of establishment have started in March 2002. A core group of academicians have called for colleagues and students to participate in the new-founding laboratory. Following a number of meetings with the initial respondents, ELYADAL Research Group has started its activities on April 13, 2002. In order to test and form the interaction dynamics of the group, three subgroups have been established to work independently on three topics of interest. These topics were chosen so that no group member had previous in-depth knowledge or formal education about them, enabling equidistant amateurship in the beginning. The topics were the number Pi in mathematics, the microscopic organism Volvox colony in biology, and the black hole in physics. The studies of the groups were disseminated by a then-established popular scientific magazine named PiVOLKA (an anagram name including syllables from the three topics). Mini-group studies on natural scientific issues then become a one-step hurdle for the selection of prospective adjoiners and PiVOLKA became a source of dissemination and open forum to students and academicians in other universities as well.\n\nThe ongoing studies by members of ELYADAL include critical thinking, political and economical psychology research and publications, convention papers, the PiVOLKA peer-reviewed quarterly scholarly publication, a booklet about research methods-academic writing, a booklet about statistics, seminars and panels on various topics.\n\nELYADAL has 28 papers that are published in various journals, 33 papers that are presented in various seminars and conferences, 16 talks that are broadcast in media about psychology, social psychology, critical thinking, creative thinking, science against pseudoscience, etc.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The DN model poses scientific explanation as a deductive structure—that is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion—hinged on accurate prediction or postdiction of the phenomenon to be explained.\n\nBecause of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know causality, it was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that \"derive\" the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general laws. Still, DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors. Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers.\n\nWhen logical empiricism fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to modern physics. In the early 1980s, revision to DN model emphasized \"maximal specificity\" for relevance of the conditions and axioms stated. Together with Hempel's inductive-statistical model, the DN model forms scientific explanation's covering law model, which is also termed, from critical angle, subsumption theory.\n\nThe term \"deductive\" distinguishes the DN model's intended determinism from the probabilism of inductive inferences. The term \"nomological\" is derived from the Greek word \"νόμος\" or \"nomos\", meaning \"law\". The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose \"conditions of adequacy\" (CA)—semiformal but stated classically—are \"derivability\" (CA1), \"lawlikeness\" (CA2), \"empirical content\" (CA3), and \"truth\" (CA4).\n\nIn the DN model, a law axiomatizes an unrestricted generalization from antecedent \"A\" to consequent \"B\" by conditional proposition—\"If A, then B\"—and has empirical content testable. A law differs from mere true regularity—for instance, \"George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet\"—by supporting counterfactual claims and thus suggesting what \"must\" be true, while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.\n\nThe phenomenon to be explained is the explanandum—an event, law, or theory—whereas the premises to explain it are explanans, true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum. Thus, given the explanans as initial, specific conditions \"C, C . . . C\" plus general laws \"L, L . . . L\", the phenomenon \"E\" as explanandum is a deductive consequence, thereby scientifically explained.\n\nAristotle's scientific explanation in \"Physics\" resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation. The framework of Aristotelian physics—Aristotelian metaphysics—reflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized vitalism and teleology, an intrinsic morality in nature. With emergence of Copernicanism, however, Descartes introduced mechanical philosophy, then Newton rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within natural philosophy. At 1740, David Hume staked Hume's fork, highlighted the problem of induction, and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality. Hume also highlighted the fact/value gap, as what \"is\" does not itself reveal what \"ought\".\n\nNear 1780, countering Hume's ostensibly radical empiricism, Immanuel Kant highlighted extreme rationalism—as by Descartes or Spinoza—and sought middle ground. Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into \"substance\", \"space\", and \"time\", Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found Newton's theory of motion universally true, yet knowledge of things in themselves impossible. Safeguarding science, then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of scientific realism. Aborting Francis Bacon's inductivist mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the \"noumena\"—metaphysical view of nature's ultimate truths—Kant's transcendental idealism tasked science with simply modeling patterns of \"phenomena\". Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the mind's constants holding also universal moral truths, and launched German idealism, increasingly speculative.\n\nAuguste Comte found the problem of induction rather irrelevant since enumerative induction is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth. Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific—the ultimate stage—rejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable. Comte in the 1830s expounded positivism—the first modern philosophy of science and simultaneously a political philosophy—rejecting conjectures about unobservables, thus rejecting search for \"causes\". Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a \"law\", thereupon applied to benefit human society. From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe. Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's natural selection brought the Copernican Revolution into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to vitalism and teleology.\n\nWhereas Comtean positivism posed science as \"description\", logical positivism emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as \"explanation\", perhaps to better unify empirical sciences by covering not only fundamental science—that is, fundamental physics—but special sciences, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and anthropology. After defeat of National Socialism with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, \"logical empiricism\". All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism, sharing the quest of verificationism.\n\nNeopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline philosophy of science, researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge. Scientific realism takes scientific theory's statements at face value, thus accorded either falsity or truth—probable or approximate or actual. Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as instrumentalism, holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather.\n\nDN model received its most detailed, influential statement by Carl G Hempel, first in his 1942 article \"The function of general laws in history\", and more explicitly with Paul Oppenheim in their 1948 article \"Studies in the logic of explanation\". Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the Humean empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect, as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables. DN model bypasses causality beyond mere constant conjunction: first an event like \"A\", then always an event like \"B\".\n\nHempel held natural laws—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality. In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by \"inductive-statistical model\" (IS model). DN model and IS model—whereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%—together form \"covering law model\", as named by a critic, William Dray. Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to the \"deductive-statistical model\" (DS model). Georg Henrik von Wright, another critic, named the totality \"subsumption theory\".\n\nAmid failure of neopositivism's fundamental tenets, Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise. From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting falsificationism, which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist. Even Popper's 1934 book embraces DN model, widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.\n\nIn the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytology and biochemistry, cell biology arose and established existence of cell organelles besides the nucleus. Launched in the late 1930s, the molecular biology research program cracked a genetic code in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as \"cell and molecular biology\", its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms. Biology became a new model of science, while special sciences were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics.\n\nIn 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal \"conditions of adequacy\", Hempel and Oppenheim acknowledged redundancy of the third, \"empirical content\", implied by the other three—\"derivability\", \"lawlikeness\", and \"truth\". In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, Wesley Salmon called for returning \"cause\" to \"because\", and along with James Fetzer helped replace CA3 \"empirical content\" with CA3' \"strict maximal specificity\".\n\nSalmon introduced \"causal mechanical\" explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such. Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced \"statistical-relevance model\" (SR model). Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in applied sciences, most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific.\n\nAs theory of knowledge, epistemology differs from ontology, which is a subbranch of metaphysics, theory of reality. Ontology poses which categories of being—what sorts of things exist—and so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.\n\nNatural laws, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the \"epistemic\". Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the \"ontic\". Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a \"category mistake\".\n\nDiscarding ontic commitments, including causality \"per se\", DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to—that is, subsumed by—a more fundamental theory's laws. The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws. Thus, the epistemic success of Newtonian theory's law of universal gravitation is reduced to—thus explained by—Einstein's general theory of relativity, although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting Kepler's laws of planetary motion is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing absolute space despite absolute time.\n\nCovering law model reflects neopositivism's vision of empirical science, a vision interpreting or presuming unity of science, whereby all empirical sciences are either fundamental science—that is, fundamental physics—or are special sciences, whether astrophysics, chemistry, biology, geology, psychology, economics, and so on. All special sciences would network via covering law model. And by stating \"boundary conditions\" while supplying \"bridge laws\", any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing—theoretically although generally not practically—to fundamental science. (\"Boundary conditions\" are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur. \"Bridge laws\" translate terms in one science to terms in another science.)\n\nBy DN model, if one asks, \"Why is that shadow 20 feet long?\", another can answer, \"Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at \"x\" angle, and laws of electromagnetism\". Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, \"Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?\", another could answer, \"Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at \"x\" angle, and laws of electromagnetism\", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect. By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, \"Why did that man not get pregnant?\", one could in part answer, among the explanans, \"Because he took birth control pills\"—if he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy—as covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans.\n\nMany philosophers have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation. DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation—successful prediction—but not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance \"Z\" always following \"Y\", but not \"Z\" because of \"Y\", instead \"Y\" and then \"Z\" as an effect of \"X\". By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, Boyle's law permits prediction of an unknown variable—volume, pressure, or temperature—but does not explain \"why\" to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the kinetic theory of gases.\n\nScientific explanations increasingly pose not determinism's universal laws, but probabilism's chance, \"ceteris paribus\" laws. Smoking's contribution to lung cancer fails even the inductive-statistical model (IS model), requiring probability over 0.5 (50%). (Probability standardly ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).) An applied science that applies statistics seeking associations between events, epidemiology cannot show causality, but consistently found higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers versus otherwise similar nonsmokers, although the proportion of smokers who develop lung cancer is modest. Versus nonsmokers, however, smokers as a group showed over 20 times the risk of lung cancer, and in conjunction with basic research, consensus followed that smoking had been scientifically explained as \"a\" cause of lung cancer, responsible for some cases that without smoking would not have occurred, a probabilistic counterfactual causality.\n\nThrough lawlike explanation, fundamental physics—often perceived as fundamental science—has proceeded through intertheory relation and theory reduction, thereby resolving experimental paradoxes to great historical success, resembling covering law model. In early 20th century, Ernst Mach as well as Wilhelm Ostwald had resisted Ludwig Boltzmann's reduction of thermodynamics—and thereby Boyle's law—to statistical mechanics partly \"because\" it rested on kinetic theory of gas, hinging on atomic/molecular theory of matter. Mach as well as Ostwald viewed matter as a variant of energy, and molecules as mathematical illusions, as even Boltzmann thought possible.\n\nIn 1905, via statistical mechanics, Albert Einstein predicted the phenomenon Brownian motion—unexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist Robert Brown. Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real. Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in \"particles\", doubted until this helped resolve atomic theory in the 1910s and 1920s. Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or electromagnetic, whose two theories misaligned. Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous. At experimental paradoxes, physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.\n\nFinding the luminiferous aether a useless hypothesis, Einstein in 1905 \"a priori\" unified all inertial reference frames to state special \"principle\" of relativity, which, by omitting aether, converted space and time into \"relative\" phenomena whose relativity aligned electrodynamics with the Newtonian principle Galilean relativity or invariance. Originally epistemic or instrumental, this was interpreted as ontic or realist—that is, a causal mechanical explanation—and the \"principle\" became a \"theory\", refuting Newtonian gravitation. By predictive success in 1919, general relativity apparently overthrew Newton's theory, a revolution in science resisted by many yet fulfilled around 1930.\n\nIn 1925, Werner Heisenberg as well as Erwin Schrödinger independently formalized quantum mechanics (QM). Despite clashing explanations, the two theories made identical predictions. Paul Dirac's 1928 model of the electron was set to special relativity, launching QM into the first quantum field theory (QFT), quantum electrodynamics (QED). From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's antiparticle, soon discovered and termed \"positron\", but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies. Elsewhere and otherwise, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force were discovered.\n\nIn 1941, Richard Feynman introduced QM's path integral formalism, which if taken toward \"interpretation\" as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's matrix formalism and with Schrödinger's wave formalism, although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions. Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty. As each known fundamental force is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed. Louis de Broglie's waveparticle duality had rendered atomism—indivisible particles in a void—untenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.\n\nMeeting in 1947, Freeman Dyson, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga soon introduced \"renormalization\", a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory, subsuming chemistry, optics, and statistical mechanics. QED thus won physicists' general acceptance. Paul Dirac criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness, and called for an aether. In 1947, Willis Lamb had found unexpected motion of electron orbitals, shifted since the vacuum is not truly empty. Yet \"emptiness\" was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it, even suppressing it. Meanwhile, \"sickened by untidy math, most philosophers of physics tend to neglect QED\".\n\nPhysicists have feared even mentioning \"aether\", renamed \"vacuum\", which—as such—is nonexistent. General philosophers of science commonly believe that aether, rather, is fictitious, \"relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since\" 1905 brought special relativity. Einstein was noncommittal to aether's nonexistence, simply said it superfluous. Abolishing Newtonian motion for electrodynamic primacy, however, Einstein inadvertently reinforced aether, and to explain motion was led back to aether in general relativity. Yet resistance to relativity theory became associated with earlier theories of aether, whose word and concept became taboo. Einstein explained special relativity's compatibility with an aether, but Einstein aether, too, was opposed. Objects became conceived as pinned directly on space and time by abstract geometric relations lacking ghostly or fluid medium.\n\nBy 1970, QED along with weak nuclear field was reduced to electroweak theory (EWT), and the strong nuclear field was modeled as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Comprised by EWT, QCD, and Higgs field, this Standard Model of particle physics is an \"effective theory\", not truly fundamental. As QCD's particles are considered nonexistent in the everyday world, QCD especially suggests an aether, routinely found by physics experiments to exist and to exhibit relativistic symmetry. Confirmation of the Higgs particle, modeled as a condensation within the Higgs field, corroborates aether, although physics need not state or even include aether. Organizing regularities of \"observations\"—as in the covering law model—physicists find superfluous the quest to discover \"aether\".\n\nIn 1905, from special relativity, Einstein deduced mass–energy equivalence, particles being variant forms of distributed energy, how particles colliding at vast speed experience that energy's transformation into mass, producing heavier particles, although physicists' talk promotes confusion. As \"the contemporary locus of metaphysical research\", QFTs pose particles not as existing individually, yet as \"excitation modes\" of fields, the particles and their masses being states of aether, apparently unifying all physical phenomena as the more fundamental causal reality, as long ago foreseen. Yet a \"quantum\" field is an intricate abstraction—a \"mathematical\" field—virtually inconceivable as a \"classical\" field's physical properties. Nature's deeper aspects, still unknown, might elude any possible field theory.\n\nThough discovery of causality is popularly thought science's aim, search for it was shunned by the Newtonian research program, even more Newtonian than was Isaac Newton. By now, most theoretical physicists infer that the four, known fundamental interactions would reduce to superstring theory, whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms. Given uncertainties of scientific realism, some conclude that the concept \"causality\" raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key folk science, but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures. Even epidemiology is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality. Covering law model is among Carl G Hempel's admired contributions to philosophy of science.\n\nTypes of inference\n\nRelated subjects\n\n\n"}

Initially, it was proposed as an explanation to increased response for a habituated behavior by introducing an external stimulus; however, upon further analysis, the focus was conclusively established that a proper analysis of dishabituation should be taken into consideration only when the response is increased by implying the original stimulus.\n\nBased on studies conducted over habituation's dual-process theory which attributed towards dishabituation, it is also determined that the latter was independent of any behavioral sensitization.\n\nAn example of dishabituation is the response of a receptionist in a scenario where a delivery truck arrives at 9:00AM every morning. The first few times it arrives it is noticed by the receptionist, and after weeks, the receptionist does not respond as strongly. One day the truck does not arrive, and the receptionist notices its absence. When it arrives the next day, the receptionist's response is stronger when it arrives as expected.\n\nThe phenomenon was studied by an early scientist Samuel Jackson Holmes in 1912, while he was studying the animal behavior in sea urchins. Later in 1933, George Humphrey—while studying the same effects in human babies and extensively over lower vertebrates—argued that dishabituation is in fact the removal of habituation altogether, to a behavior that was not conditioned to begin with.\n\nAccording to the dual-process theory of habituation, dishabituation is characterized by an increase in responding to a habituated stimulus after introducing a deviant, to sensitize a change in arousal. Further investigations into elicitation and habituation of the electrodermal orienting reflex also showed that dishabituation is independent of sensitization for indifferent stimuli.\n\nA meta-analysis shows that dishabituation is improvised on preterm infants as compared to term infants based on the magnitude of stimulus sensitized.\n\nAs per the Center for Neural Engineering, University of Southern California (Los Angeles), the primordial hippocampus plays an important role in modeling the dishabituation of behavioral response. According to this, the interaction of two processes is dynamically postulated based on synaptic plasticity, which acquires both long and short-term forgetting. Along with that, cumulative shrinking is proposed to map responses from the temporal region of the anterior thalamus that references the spatial positions. The plasticity model combined with the structure of medial pallium model provides a structured network of neural mechanisms, contributing towards dishabituation and habituation alike.\n\nAccordingly, this phenomenon is neither indicative to counteract the emphasis of an existing habituation but instead, organizes an independent neuronal process, nor resulted by facilitation, as the etymology may indicate.\n\nAll the above establish the process of dishabituation, where responding to a repetitive stimulus increases and has been documented in a wide range of organisms - from single-celled animals to primates - which is thought to allow an organism to reflexively either filter out or consider, all forms of information.\n\nIt is also characterized as an emancipation of an existing prey-catching behavior. Sometimes however, the inconsistency in dishabituation of behavioral response is brought-on by mismatch between the 1st and 2nd stimuli, which in-turn is due to the occurrence of inhibition by habituation, to the existing stimulus.\n\nDishabituation shows an increase in reward effectiveness as it produces a heightened behavioral response to sensitization of arousal. Other studies also show that it is caused by mind-wandering, where with distributed working process as opposed to practising in mass, the learning behavior is enhanced.\n\nIn the development of preterm infants, the dishabituation process also provides with an approach for the early diagnosis of cognitive status and most importantly, their mental faculties performances.\n\n\n"}

When the expenses of the state were greater than its revenue, it was usual for the prytaneis to summon an assembly of the people -- \"ecclesia\" -- and, after explaining the necessities of the state, to call upon the citizens to contribute according to their means.\n\nThose who were willing to contribute then rose and said what they would give; while those who were unwilling to give anything, remained silent or retired privately from the assembly. The names of those who had promised to contribute, together with the amount of their contributions, were written on tablets, which were placed before the statues of the Eponymi, where they remained until the amount was paid.\n\nThese voluntary contributions were frequently very large. Sometimes the more wealthy citizens voluntarily undertook a \"trierarchy\", or the expenses of equipping a trireme. We read that the freedman Pasion furnished 1000 shields, together with five triremes, which he equipped at his own expense. Chrysippus presented a talent to the state, when Alexander the Great moved against Thebes during the Battle of Thebes; Aristophanes, son of Nicophemus gave 30,000 drachmae for an expedition against Cyprus; Charidemus and Diotimus, two commanders, made a free gift of 800 shields; and similar instances of liberality are mentioned by German classical scholar August Böckh, from whom the preceding examples have been taken.\n"}

The book examines the history of fascism and based on the growth of big business and big government describes possible political scenarios for a future United States. According to a 1981 review in the journal \"Social Justice\", the book is described as \"timely\" on a subject requiring serious consideration and is about the dangers of fascism, focusing primarily on the United States, but being aware that monopoly capitalism needs to be understood internationally since capitalism \"is not a national mode of production\".\n\nIn 2016, the book prompted the following response right after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States: \"The next wave of fascists will not come with cattle cars and concentration camps, but they'll come with a smiley face and maybe a TV show.

Writing on behalf of \"Eclectica Magazine\", reviewer Dale Wharton comments that the book offers \"faint hope of averting neofascism\", but as a possible offset suggests raising aspirations, notably by \"setting forth clear lofty goals, broad enough to embrace a great majority\". Help may come from insiders since \"bubbling upward from all levels of the Establishment are longings for fulfilling employment disconnected from consumer exploitation, environmental degradation, or militarism\". \n\nReviewer Dennis Phillips notes in the \"Australian Journal of Law & Society\" that Gross wrote \"Friendly Fascism\" before Ronald Reagan had become President of the United States, but Reagan's United States, presumed in part to be a result of neofascist techniques described in the book, had \"proven Bertram Gross to be an amazingly astute prophet .

It has become famous as an early example of conceptual art, containing a series of \"event scores\" that replace the physical work of art – the traditional stock-in-trade of artists – with instructions that an individual may, or may not, wish to enact.\n\nEvent scores were developed by a number of artists attending John Cage's experimental music composition classes at the New School for Social Research in New York. Whilst Ono did not attend these informal lessons, her husband at the time, Ichiyanagi Toshi (an experimental musician), did and Toshi and Ono became regulars of Cage's circle of friends by 1959. Other members of this group included David Tudor, Morton Feldman, Richard Maxfield and Merce Cunningham. Invention of the event score is usually credited to George Brecht, but La Monte Young and Yoko Ono are also cited as amongst the first to experiment with the form. Both Cage and Brecht were deeply influenced by \"Oriental thinking\", and Ono found that her Buddhist-inspired work was, almost accidentally, fêted by the emerging New York counterculture as avant-garde.\n\nOften considered a Fluxus artwork, in fact the work was originally published by Ono's own imprint, Wunternaum Press, in Tokyo in an edition of 500. After leaving New York in 1962 – where she had exhibited at Maciunas' AG Gallery, amongst others – her then-husband Anthony Cox suggested she collect her scores together. George Maciunas, the central personality in Fluxus, had apparently been trying to reach her in Tokyo with the aim of printing a similar book in New York, as part of his series of \"Fluxkits\" (see \"Water Yam\"), but his letters had not reached her; she sent some of the scores and a prepublication advertisement to be published in his Fluxus newspaper in February 1964 when contact was finally established.\n\nThe name \"Grapefruit\" was chosen as title because Ono believed the grapefruit to be a hybrid of an orange and a lemon, and thus a reflection of herself as \"a spiritual hybrid\". It also seems likely that it is a playful allusion to Brecht's \"Water Yam\", itself a pun on Brecht and Watt's \"Yam Festival\", which, culminating in a series of events and performances in May 1963, had been derived from \"May\" backwards.\n\nThe first edition that was published in 1964 in Japan by Wunternaum Press created by Yoko Ono, contains over 150 \"instruction works\"; virtually all are in English, with about a third translated into Japanese. They are divided into five sections; \"Music\", \"Painting\", \"Event\", \"Poetry\" and \"Object\". The instructions are preceded by dedications to figures including John Cage, La Monte Young, Nam June Paik, Isamu Noguchi and Peggy Guggenheim, and also includes documentation relating to Ono's recent exhibitions and performances. The work was originally sold for $3.00 before publication, $6.00 after.\n\n1964\n\nWunternaum Press.

My name is John Lennon. I'd like you to meet Yoko Ono ...\" In the 2000 reissue of Lennon's book, \"In His Own Write\", Ono wrote a similar introduction), the work contained 80 more instruction pieces, and included two more sections, \"Film\" and \"Dance\". The book ends with a collection of Ono's writings including \"To The Wesleyan People\", 1966. There were also paperback versions printed by Sphere and Touchstone around the same time, and a reprint by Simon & Schuster in 2000.

As a cultural category with its sets of associated practices \"hygge\" has more or less the same meanings in Danish and Norwegian, but the notion is more central in Denmark than Norway. The emphasis on \"hygge\" as a part of Danish culture is a recent phenomenon, dating to the late 20th century.\n\nThe word \"hygge\" comes from a Danish word meaning \"to give courage, comfort, joy\". \"Hygge\" stems from \"hyggja\" which means to think in Old Norse. \"Hygge\" is built from the Old Norse word \"hugr\" which later became the \"hug\" which means the soul, mind, consciousness. In Swedish Hygge is a harvested forest area.\n\nBut it is also speculated that \"hygge\" might originate from the word \"hug\". \"Hug\" comes from the 1560s word \"hugge\", which means \"to embrace\". The word \"hugge\" is of unknown origin but is highly associated with an Old Norse term, \"hygga\", which means \"to comfort\", which comes from the word \"hugr\", meaning \"mood\". In turn, the word comes from the Germanic word \"hugyan\", which relates to the Old English \"hycgan\", meaning \"to think, consider\".\n\nIt first appeared in Danish writing in the 19th Century and has since evolved into the cultural idea known in Denmark and Norway today. While hygge has exactly the same meaning in Norwegian as in Danish and is a widely used word in Denmark (including in its derived forms, such as \"hyggelig\"), the emphasis specifically on \"hygge\" as an important part of their cultural identity is mostly a recent Danish phenomenon; in Norway \"hygge\" is just a word, similar in status to \"cozy\" in English-speaking countries.\n\nIn both Danish and Norwegian, \"hygge\" refers to \"a form of everyday togetherness\", \"a pleasant and highly valued everyday experience of safety, equality, personal wholeness and a spontaneous social flow\".\n\nThe noun \"hygge\" includes something nice, cozy, safe and known, referring to a psychological state.\n\n\"Collins\" \"English Dictionary\" defines the word as \"a concept, originating in Denmark, of creating cosy and convivial atmospheres that promote wellbeing\".\n\n\"Collins English Dictionary\" named \"hygge\" the runner-up (after \"Brexit\") as word of the year in the UK in 2016. This followed a period during which several books focusing on \"hygge\" had been marketed in the UK, such as \"The Little Book of Hygge\" by Meik Wiking, \"Hygge: The Danish Art of Happiness\" by Marie Tourell Søderberg, and \"The Book of Hygge: The Danish Art of Living Well\" by Louisa Thomsen Brits.\n\nIn the Broadway musical Frozen, there is a song called ‘Hygge’, which is all about being comfortable.\n\nIn Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\", Jemima Davies-Smythe incorporates Hygge into a resdesign of her half-brother Karl Kennedy's living room.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Michel Foucault, \"The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditation.\nThey also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace).\"\n\nMichel Foucault uses the word in the sense of \"note\", but his translators use the word \"notebook\", which is anachronistic (see codex and wax tablet). Concerning Seneca's discipline of self-knowledge, Foucault writes: \"In this period there was a culture of what could be called personal writing: taking notes on the reading, conversations, and reflections that one hears or engages in oneself; keeping kinds of notebooks on important subjects (what the Greeks call 'hupomnemata'), which must be reread from time to time so as to reactualize their contents.\" In an excerpt from an \"Interview with Michel Foucault\" in \"The Foucault Reader\", he says: \"As personal as they were, the hypomnemata must nevertheless not be taken for intimate diaries or for those accounts of spiritual experience (temptations, struggles, falls, and victories) which can be found in later Christian literature.

It is by means of a series of identifications that the personality is constituted and specified. The roots of the concept can be found in Freud's writings. The three most prominent concepts of identification as described by Freud are: primary identification, narcissistic (secondary) identification and partial (secondary) identification.\n\nWhile \"in the psychoanalytic literature there is agreement that the core meaning of identification is simple – to be like or to become like another\", it has also been adjudged '\"the most perplexing clinical/theoretical area\" in psychoanalysis'.\n\nFreud first raised the matter of identification () in 1897, in connection with the illness or death of one's parents, and the response \"to punish oneself in a hysterical fashion...with the same states [of illness] that they have had. The identification which occurs here is, as we can see, nothing other than a mode of thinking\". The question was taken up again psychoanalytically \"in Ferenczi's article, 'Introjection and Transference', dating from 1909\", but it was in the decade between \"On Narcissism\" (1914) and \"The Ego and the Id\" (1923) that Freud made his most detailed and intensive study of the concept.\n\nFreud distinguished three main kinds of identification. \"First, identification is the original form of emotional tie with an object; secondly, in a regressive way it becomes a substitute for a libidinal object-tie...and thirdly, it may arise with any new perception of a common quality which is shared with some other person\".\n\nPrimary identification is the original and primitive form of emotional attachment to something or someone prior to any relations with other persons or objects: \"an individual's first and most important identification, his identification with the father in his own personal prehistory...with the parents\". This means that when a baby is born he is not capable of making a distinction between himself and important others. The baby has an emotional attachment with his parents and experiences his parents as a part of himself. \"The breast is part of me, I am the breast\".\n\nDuring this process of identification children adopt unconsciously the characteristics of their parents and begin to associate themselves with and copy the behavior of their parents. Freud remarked that identification should be distinguished from imitation, which is a voluntary and conscious act. Because of this process of emotional attachment a child will develop a (super)ego that has similarities to the moral values and guidelines by which the parents live their lives. By this process children become a great deal like their parents and this facilitates learning to live in the world and culture to which they are born.\n\n\"By and large, psychoanalysts grant the importance and centrality of primary identification, even though...the concept varies 'according to each author and his ideas, its meaning in consequence being far from precise' (Etchegoyen 1985)\".\n\nNarcissistic identification is the form of identification following abandonment or loss of an object. This experience of loss starts at a very young age. An example: wearing the clothes or jewellery of a deceased loved one. In \"Mourning and Melancholia\" Freud, having \"shown that identification is a preliminary stage of object-choice\", argued that the experience of loss set in motion a regressive process that \"served to establish an \"identification\" of the ego with the abandoned object\". In \"The Ego and the Id\", he went on to maintain that \"this kind of substitution has a great share in determining the form taken by the ego and that it makes an essential contribution towards building up what is called its 'character'\".\n\nLacan, in his theory of the Imaginary, would develop the latter point into his view of \"the ego is constituted in its nucleus by a series of alienating identifications\" - part of his opposition to any concept of an \"autonomous\" and conflict-free ego.\n\nPartial identification is based on the perception of a special quality of another person. This quality or ideal is often represented in a \"leader figure\" who is identified with. For example: the young boy identifies with the strong muscles of an older neighbour boy. Next to identification with the leader, people identify with others because they feel they have something in common. For example: a group of people who like the same music. This mechanism plays an important role in the formation of groups. It contributes to the development of character and the ego is formed by identification with a group (group norms). Partial identification promotes the social life of persons who will be able to identify with one another through this common bond to one another, instead of considering someone as a rival.\n\nFreud went on to indicate the way \"a path leads from identification by way of imitation to empathy, that is, to the comprehension of the mechanism by which we are enabled to take up any attitude at all towards another mental life\". Otto Fenichel would go on to emphasize how \"trial identifications for the purposes of empathy play a basic part in normal object relationships. They can be studied especially in analyzing the psychoanalyst's ways of working\". Object relations theory would subsequently highlight the use of \"trial identification with the patient in the session\" as part of the growing technique of analysing from the countertransference.\n\nIn her classic book \"The Ego and the Mechanism of Defence\", Anna Freud introduced \"two original defence mechanisms...both of which have become classics of ego psychology\", the one being altruistic surrender, the other identification with the aggressor. Anna Freud pointed out that identification with parental values was a normal part of the development of the superego; but that \"if the child introjects both rebuke and punishment and then regularly projects this same punishment on another, 'then he is arrested at an intermediate stage in the development of the superego'\".\n\nThe concept was also taken up in object relations theory, which particularly explored \"how a patient sometimes places the analyst in the role of victim whilst the patient acts out an identification with the aggressor\" in the analytic situation.\n\nMainstream analytic thought broadly agrees that interpretation took effect \"by utilizing positive transference and transitory identifications with the analyst\". More controversial, however, was the concept of \"the terminal identification\" at the close of analysis, where \"that with which the patient identifies is their strong ego...[or] identification with the analyst's superego\".\n\nLacan took strong exception to \"any analysis that one teaches as having to be terminated by identification with the analyst...There is a beyond to this identification...this crossing of the plane of identification\". Most Lacanians have subsequently echoed his distrust of \"the view of psychoanalysis that relies on identification with the analyst as a central curative factor\". How far the same criticism applies, however, to those who see as a positive therapeutic result \"the development of a self-analytic attitude...[built on] identification with and internalization of the analyst's analytic attitude\" is not perhaps quite clear.\n\nMarion Milner has argued that \"terminal identification\" can be most acute in those analysands who go on to become therapists themselves: \"by the mere fact of becoming analysts we have succeeded in bypassing an experience which our patients have to go through. We have chosen to identify with our analyst's profession and to act out that identification\".\n\nMuch has been written on identification since Freud. Identification has been seen both as a normal developmental mechanism and as a mechanism of defence. Many types of identification have been described by other psychoanalysts, including counter-identification (Fliess,1953), pseudoidentification (Eidelberg, 1938), concordant and complementary identifications (Racker, 1957), and adhesive identification (Bick, 1968): \"the work of Bick and others on adhesive identification, exploring the concept of the 'psychic skin'\".\n"}

Implied licenses may arise by operation of law from actions by the licensor which lead the licensee to believe that it has the necessary permission.\n\nImplied licenses often arise where the licensee has purchased a physical embodiment of some intellectual property belonging to the licensor, or has paid for its creation, but has not obtained permission to use the intellectual property.\n\n\nIn the United States, implied licenses are usually considered to be of two kinds: either they reflect the intention of the parties, which is inferred from a fact-specific inquiry into the surrounding circumstances, or else they are constructive agreements, in which case the intention of the parties is likely to be immaterial. In reality, there is a continuum between these kinds of implied license and it may be difficult to determine whether the license or contract in question is one which the law implies, irrespective of any protests by the unwilling licensor, or instead one inferred from the whole pattern of factual circumstances including the evidence of intent.\n\nIn England, there is more of a tendency to regard all implied licenses as matters of fact and intent, while what would be a license implied by law in the US is treated under some other branch of substantive law such as the doctrine of non-derogation from grants.\n\nIn both countries, the exhaustion doctrine has the effect of creating an implied license to use a product sold under the \"authority\" of the patentee. It is controversial whether and to what extent contractual expedients can successfully limit the scope of such implied licenses.\n\nThe opposite of an implied license is an \"express license\", which, for some forms of intellectual property, must be in writing. Oral exclusive licenses were permitted, however, under US copyright law before 1978. Oral nonexclusive copyright licenses remain valid under US law. Patent licenses may be oral.

{"id": "170586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170586", "title": "Jealousy", "text": "Jealousy\n\nJealousy generally refers to the thoughts or feelings of insecurity, fear, concern, and envy over relative lack of possessions, status or something of great personal value, particularly in reference to a comparator, a rival, or a competitor. \n\nJealousy can consist of one or more emotions such as anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness or disgust. In its original meaning, \"jealousy\" is distinct from envy, though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the English language, with \"jealousy\" now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone.\n\nJealousy is a typical experience in human relationships, and it has been observed in infants as young as five months. Some researchers claim that jealousy is seen in all cultures. However, others claim jealousy is a culture-specific emotion.\n\nJealousy can either be suspicious or reactive, and it is often reinforced as a series of particularly strong emotions and constructed as a universal human experience. Psychologists have proposed several models to study the processes underlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy. Sociologists have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an important role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes socially acceptable expressions of jealousy. Biologists have identified factors that may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy.\n\nThroughout history, artists have also explored the theme of jealousy in photographs, paintings, films, songs, plays, poems, and books, and theologians have offered religious views of jealousy based on the scriptures of their respective faiths.\n\nSexual jealousy may be triggered when a person's significant other displays sexual interest in another person. The feeling of jealousy may be just as powerful if one partner suspects the other is guilty of infidelity. Fearing that their partner will experience sexual jealousy the person who has been unfaithful may lie about their actions in order to protect their partner. Experts often believe that sexual jealousy is in fact a biological imperative. It may be part of a mechanism by which humans and other animals ensure access to the best reproductive partners.\n\nIt seems that male jealousy in heterosexual relationships may be influenced by their female partner's phase in her menstrual cycle. In the period around and shortly before ovulation, males are found to display more mate-retention tactics, which are linked to jealousy. Furthermore, a male is more likely to employ mate-retention tactics if their partner shows more interest in other males, which is more likely to occur in the pre-ovulation phase.\n\nRomantic jealousy arises as a result of romantic interest. It is defined as “\"a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions that follow threats to self-esteem and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship when those threats are generated by the perception of a real or potential romantic attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival.\"” Different from sexual jealousy, romantic jealousy is triggered by threats to self and relationship (rather than sexual interest in another person). Factors, such as feelings of inadequacy as a partner, sexual exclusivity, and having put relatively more effort into the relationship, are positively related to relationship jealousy in both genders.\n\nAs romantic jealousy is a complicated reaction that has multiple components, i.e., thoughts, feelings, and actions, one aspect of romantic jealousy that is under study is communicative responses. Communicative responses serve three critical functions in a romantic relationship, i.e., reducing uncertainty, maintaining or repairing relationship, and restoring self-esteem. If done properly, communicative responses can lead to more satisfying relationships after experiencing romantic jealousy.\n\nThere are two subsets of communicative responses: interactive responses and general behavior responses. Interactive responses is face-to-face and partner-directed while general behavior responses may not occur interactively. Guerrero and colleagues further categorize multiple types of communicative responses of romantic jealousy. Interactive responses can be broken down to six types falling in different places on continua of threat and directness:\nGuerrero and colleagues have also proposed five general behavior responses. The five sub-types differ in whether a response is 1) directed at partner or rival(s), 2) directed at discovery or repair, and 3) positively or negatively valenced:\nWhile some of these communicative responses are destructive and aggressive, e.g., distributive communication and active distancing, some individuals respond to jealousy in a more constructive way. Integrative communication, compensatory restoration, and negative affect expression have been shown to lead to positive relation outcomes. One factor that affects the type of communicative responses elicited in an individual is emotions. Jealousy anger is associated with more aggressive communicative response while irritation tends to lead to more constructive communicative behaviors.\n\nAccording to the Parental Investment Model based on parental investment theory, more men than women ratify sex differences in jealousy. In addition, more women over men consider emotional infidelity (fear of abandonment) as more distressing than sexual infidelity. According to the attachment theory, sex and attachment style makes significant and unique interactive contributions to the distress experienced. Security within the relationship also heavily contributes to one’s level of distress. These findings imply that psychological and cultural mechanisms regarding sex differences may play a larger role than expected (Levy, Blatt, Schachner.) The attachment theory also claims to reveal how infants' attachment patterns are the basis for self-report measures of adult attachment. (Levy, Blatt & Shaner, 1998). Although there are no sex differences in childhood attachment, individuals with dismissing behavior were more concerned with the sexual aspect of relationships (Schachner & shaer, 2004). As a coping mechanism these individuals would report sexual infidelity as more harmful. Moreover, research shows that audit attachment styles strongly conclude with the type of infidelity that occurred. Thus psychological and cultural mechanisms are implied as unvarying differences in jealousy that play a role in sexual attachment.\n\nEmotional jealousy was predicted to be nine times more responsive in females than in males. The emotional jealousy predicted in females also held turn to state that females experiencing emotional jealousy are more violent than men experiencing emotional jealousy.\n\nThere are distinct emotional responses to gender differences in romantic relationships (Buss, Green & Saboni 2004). For example, due to paternity uncertainty in males, jealousy increases in males over sexual infidelity rather than emotional. According to research more women are likely to be upset by signs of resource withdraw (i.e. another female) than by sexual infidelity. A large amount of data supports this notion. However, one must consider for jealousy the life stage or experience one encounters in reference to the diverse responses to infidelity available. Research states that a componential view of jealousy consist of specific set of emotions that serve the reproductive role. However, research shows that both men and women would be equally angry and point the blame for sexual infidelity, but women would be more hurt by emotional infidelity. Despite this fact, anger surfaces when both parties involved is responsible for some type of uncontrollable behavior, sexual conduct is not exempt. (Sabbini and Silver, Averill 1995). Some behavior and actions are controllable such as sexual behavior. However hurt feelings are activated by relationship deviation. No evidence is known to be sexually dimorphic in both college and adult convenience samples. The Jealousy Specific Innate Model (JSIM) proved to not be innate, but may be sensitive to situational factors. As a result, it may only activate at stages in on. One study discovered serious relationships are reserved for older adults rather than undergraduates. For example, Buss \"et al.\" (1992) predicted that male jealousy decreases as females reproductive values decreases.\n\nA second possibility that the JSIM effect is not innate but is from one culture (Desieno \"et al.\", 2002) Kitayana (2004) have highlighted differences in socio-economic status specific such as the divide between high school and collegiate individuals. Moreover, individuals of both genders were angrier and blamed their partners more for sexual infidelities but were more hurt by emotional (Sabini & Green 2004). Jealousy is composed of lower-level emotional states (e.g., anger and hurt) which may be triggered by a variety of events, not by differences in individuals' life stage. Although research has recognized the importance of early childhood experiences for the development of competence in intimate relationships, early family environment is recently being examined as well (Richardson and Guyer, 1998). Research on self-esteem and attachment theory suggest that individuals internalize early experiences within the family which subconsciously translates into their personal view of worth of themselves and the value of being close to other individuals, especially in an interpersonal relationship (Steinberg, Davila, & Fincham, 2006).\n\nA study by researches at the University of California, San Diego, replicated jealousy studies done on humans on canines. They reported, in a paper published in PLOS ONE in 2014, that a significant number of dogs exhibited jealous behaviors when their human companions paid attention to dog-like toys, compared to when their human companions paid attention to nonsocial objects.\n\nThe word stems from the French \"jalousie\", formed from \"jaloux\" (jealous), and further from Low Latin \"zelosus\" (full of zeal), in turn from the Greek word (\"zēlos\"), sometimes \"jealousy\", but more often in a positive sense \"emulation, ardour, zeal\"\n(with a root connoting \"to boil, ferment\"; or \"yeast\"). The \"biblical language\" zeal would be known as \"tolerating no unfaithfulness\" while in middle English zealous is good. One origin word \"gelus\" meant \"Possessive and suspicious\" the word then turned into \"jelus.\" \n\nSince William Shakespeare's use of terms like \"green-eyed monster\", the color green has been associated with jealousy and envy, from which the expressions \"green with envy\", are derived.\n\nPeople do not express jealousy through a single emotion or a single behavior.\nThey instead express jealousy through diverse emotions and behaviors, which makes it difficult to form a scientific definition of jealousy. Scientists instead define jealousy in their own words, as illustrated by the following examples:\n\n\n\n\nThese definitions of jealousy share two basic themes. First, all the definitions imply a triad composed of a jealous individual, a partner, and a perception of a third party or rival. Second, all the definitions describe jealousy as a reaction to a perceived threat to the relationship between two people, or a dyad. Jealous reactions typically involve aversive emotions and/or behaviors that are assumed to be protective for their attachment relationships. These themes form the essential meaning of jealousy in most scientific studies.\n\nPopular culture uses the word jealousy as a synonym for envy. Many dictionary definitions include a reference to envy or envious feelings. In fact, the overlapping use of jealousy and envy has a long history.\n\nThe terms are used indiscriminately in such popular 'feelgood' books as Nancy Friday's \"Jealousy\", where the expression 'jealousy' applies to a broad range of passions, from envy to lust and greed. While this kind of usage blurs the boundaries between categories that are intellectually valuable and psychologically justifiable, such confusion is understandable in that historical explorations of the term indicate that these boundaries have long posed problems. Margot Grzywacz's fascinating etymological survey of the word in Romance and Germanic languages asserts, indeed, that the concept was one of those that proved to be the most difficult to express in language and was therefore among the last to find an unambiguous term. Classical Latin used \"invidia\", without strictly differentiating between envy and jealousy. It was not until the postclassical era that Latin borrowed the late and poetic Greek word \"zelotypia\" and the associated adjective \"zelosus\". It is from this adjective that are derived French \"jaloux\", Provençal \"gelos\", Italian \"geloso\", and Spanish \"celoso\". (Lloyd, 1995, page 4)\n\nPerhaps the overlapping use of jealousy and envy occurs because people can experience both at the same time. A person may envy the characteristics or possessions of someone who also happens to be a romantic rival. In fact, one may even interpret romantic jealousy as a form of envy. A jealous person may envy the affection that his or her partner gives to a rival — affection the jealous person feels entitled to himself or herself. People often use the word jealousy as a broad label that applies to both experiences of jealousy and experiences of envy.\n\nAlthough popular culture often uses jealousy and envy as synonyms, modern philosophers and psychologists have argued for conceptual distinctions between jealousy and envy. For example, philosopher John Rawls distinguishes between jealousy and envy on the ground that jealousy involves the wish to keep what one has, and envy the wish to get what one does not have. Thus, a child is jealous of her parents' attention to a sibling, but envious of her friend's new bicycle. Psychologists Laura Guerrero and Peter Andersen have proposed the same distinction. They claim the jealous person \"perceives that he or she possesses a valued relationship, but is in danger of losing it or at least of having it altered in an undesirable manner,\" whereas the envious person \"does not possess a valued commodity, but wishes to possess it.\" Gerrod Parrott draws attention to the distinct thoughts and feelings that occur in jealousy and envy.\n\nThe common experience of jealousy for many people may involve:\n\nThe experience of envy involves:\n\nParrot acknowledges that people can experience envy and jealousy at the same time. Feelings of envy about a rival can even intensify the experience of jealousy. Still, the differences between envy and jealousy in terms of thoughts and feelings justify their distinction in philosophy and science.\n\nJealousy involves an entire \"emotional episode,\" including a complex \"narrative\": the circumstances that lead up to jealousy, jealousy itself as emotion, any attempt at self regulation, subsequent actions and events and the resolution of the episode (Parrott, 2001, p. 306). The narrative can originate from experienced facts, thoughts, perceptions, memories, but also imagination, guess and assumptions. The more society and culture matter in the formation of these factors, the more jealousy can have a social and cultural origin. By contrast, Goldie (2000, p. 228) shows how jealousy can be a \"cognitively impenetrable state\", where education and rational belief matter very little.\n\nOne possible explanation of the origin of jealousy in evolutionary psychology is that the emotion evolved in order to maximize the success of our genes: it is a biologically based emotion (Prinz after Buss and Larsen, 2004, p. 120) selected to foster the certainty about the paternity of one’s own offspring. A jealous behavior, in men, is directed into avoiding sexual betrayal and a consequent waste of resources and effort in taking care of someone else’s offspring. There are, additionally, cultural or social explanations of the origin of jealousy. According to one, the narrative from which jealousy arises can be in great part made by the imagination. Imagination is strongly affected by a person's cultural milieu. The pattern of reasoning, the way one perceives situations, depends strongly on cultural context. It has elsewhere been suggested that jealousy is in fact a secondary emotion in reaction to one's needs not being met, be those needs for attachment, attention, reassurance or any other form of care that would be otherwise expected to arise from that primary romantic relationship.\n\nWhile mainstream psychology considers sexual arousal through jealousy a paraphilia, some authors on sexuality (Serge Kreutz, \"Instrumental Jealousy\") have argued that jealousy in manageable dimensions can have a definite positive effect on sexual function and sexual satisfaction. Studies have also shown that jealousy sometimes heightens passion towards partners and increases the intensity of passionate sex.\n\nJealousy in children and teenagers has been observed more often in those with low self-esteem and can evoke aggressive reactions. One such study suggested that developing intimate friends can be followed by emotional insecurity and loneliness in some children when those intimate friends interact with others. Jealousy is linked to aggression and low self-esteem. Research by Sybil Hart, Ph.D., at Texas Tech University indicates that children are capable of feeling and displaying jealousy at as young as six months. Infants showed signs of distress when their mothers focused their attention on a lifelike doll. This research could explain why children and infants show distress when a sibling is born, creating the foundation for sibling rivalry.\n\nAnthropologists have claimed that jealousy varies across cultures. Cultural learning can influence the situations that trigger jealousy and the manner in which jealousy is expressed. Attitudes toward jealousy can also change within a culture over time. For example, attitudes toward jealousy changed substantially during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. People in the United States adopted much more negative views about jealousy. As men and women became more equal it became less appropriate or acceptable to express jealousy. \n\nArtistic depictions of jealousy occur in fiction, films, and other art forms such as painting and sculpture. Jealousy is a common theme in literature, art, theatre, and film. Often, it is presented as a demonstration of particularly deep feelings of love, rather than a destructive obsession.\n\nA study done by Ferris, Smith, Greenberg, and Smithlooked into the way people saw dating and romantic relationships based on how many reality dating shows they watched. People who spent a large amount of time watching these reality dating shows \"endorsed\" or supported the \"dating attitudes\" that would be shown on the show. While the other people who do not spend time watching reality dating shows did not mirror the same ideas.This means if someone watches a reality dating show that displays men and women reacting violently or aggressively towards their partner due to jealousy they can mirror that. This is reflected in romantic movies as well.Jessica R. Frampton conducted a study looking into romantic jealousy in movies. The study found that there were \"230 instances of romantic jealousy were identified in the 51 top-grossing romantic comedies from 2002–2014\" Some of the films did not display romantic jealousy however, some featured many examples of romantic jealousy.This was due to the fact that some of the top grossing movies did not contain a rival or romantic competition.While others such as \"Forgetting Sarah Marshal\" was said to contain \"19 instances of romantic jealousy.\"Out of the 230 instances 58% were reactive jealousy while 31% showed possessive jealousy.The last 11% displayed anxious jealousy it was seen the least in all 230 cases. Out of the 361 reactions to the jealousy found 53% were found to be \"Destructive responses.\"Only 19% of responses were constructive while 10% showed avoidant responses.The last 18% were considered \"rival focused responses\" which lead to the finding that \"there was a higher than expected number of rival-focused responses to possessive jealousy.\"\n\nJealousy in religion examines how the scriptures and teachings of various religions deal with the topic of jealousy. Religions may be compared and contrasted on how they deal with two issues: concepts of divine jealousy, and rules about the provocation and expression of human jealousy.\n\nThe Christian New Testament records that the Jewish chief priests and elders had handed Jesus over to Pontius Pilate to be crucified because they were jealous of his popularity.\n\n\"Main Article: Jealousy in Four Nations: A Cross-Cultural Analysis\"A study was done in order to cross examine jealousy among four different cultures. The four cultures were chosen to try to reveal the difference in expression when moving from culture to culture. These four cultures were Ireland, Thailand, India and the United States. The overall findings discovered that in male dominate cultures are more likely to express and reveal jealousy than other cultures. This was proven when the survey found that Thais are less likely to express jealousy then the other three cultures. This is because the men in these cultures are rewarded in a way for showing jealousy due to the fact that some women interpret it as love. This can also be seen when watching romantic comedies when males show they are jealous of a rival or emotionally jealous women perceive it as men caring more.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10216678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10216678", "title": "Mayabheda", "text": "Mayabheda\n\nMayabheda, (Sanskrit:मायाभेद:), means the breaching or removal of Avidya (\"ignorance\"). It means the destruction of the illusion caused by Maya which occurs coinciding with the gain/dawn of Right Knowledge, the knowledge of Brahman. The Rig Veda Sukta R.V.X.177 addressed to Mayabheda in its three Mantras in its own cryptic way serves this purpose. The central theme of this hymn is the discernment of Maya or illusion, the cause of material creation. Mayabheda is also one of the Rigvedic deities.\n\nThe Rig Veda is an ancient anthology of Sanskrit poems mostly in the form of prayers to the Vedic gods. It consists of Ten Books or Mandalas. The Tenth Mandala contains 191 Suktas addressed to Agni, Indra and many other deities. The Purusha sukta (R.V.90), the Hiranyagarbha sukta (R.V.X.121) and the Nasadiya Sukta (R.V.X.129) are a part of this Mandala in which there are many more important hymns.\n\nThe Tenth Mandala of the Rig Veda also contains Sukta R.V.X.177 of Rishi Patanga Prajapati which is addressed to the Vedic deity, Mayabheda. It is a very short \"Sukta\" consisting of just three mantras. The first mantra is in \"Jagati\" \"chhanda\" to be sung or recited in \"Nishad\" \"Swara\", the second mantra is in \"Virat-trishtup\" \" chhanda\" to be sung in \"Dhaivata\" \"Swara\" and the third, in \"Nichrit-trishtup\" \"chhanda\" also to be sung in \"Dhaivata\" \"Swara\". The third mantra also appears in the First Mandala in the \"Riddle Hymn\" as Sukta R.V.I.164.31 in the hymn addressed to the \"Vishwadevas\", in which regard it is said that in this mantra is to be found the culminating point of the whole doctrine of the Transmigration of souls.\n\n(Translated into English a) by Ralph T. H. Griffith and b) by Laurie L. Patton and c) freely as per Swami Dayananda Saraswati’s interpretation.) \n\nAccording to the \"Asvalayana Srauta Sutra\" IV.6, Mantra ||2|| of this Rigvedic hymn is the inviting verse of the immolated to \"Vac\" (speech), and is used in the \"parvargya rites\" along with Mantra ||3||. Mantra ||1|| does refer directly to the Sun. In the Vidhana literature the richness and ambivalence contained within the rite is lost when vide IV.115 it is said that one should constantly mutter that which is destructive of ignorance (\"ajnanabheda\"), and which begins with \"patangam\" (the mantras of R.V.X.177) which hymn is indeed destructive of illusion (\"mayabheda\") and repels all sorts of illusion; and vide IV.116 it is suggested that one should, by means of this hymn, prevent illusion, be that of \"Sambara\" or \"Indrajala\"; one should, by means of this, ward off the illusion caused by unseen beings. Here the enemy is one that can create maya, and interfere with the abilities to discern what is true and what is not.\n\nThe language of the Rig Veda is no ordinary language. Moreover, the meaning that is not found in the ordinary language but is in a poet’s language is to be found in its words. Thus, in the first mantra the Jiva, the individual self, is referred to as \"antah\". The expression \"asurasyah\" refers to Brahman, the Prana of all pranas, the Life-principle, that having entered the body brings it to life as the individual self. Those having already gained the highest knowledge see the individual self within the universal self, meaning, they do not see any difference between the Jiva, the atman, and the Paramatman whom they adore as the Light of all lights. These are the three threads that have been used to weave the entire fabric of Indian thought. In the second mantra the word \"patanga\" stands for the Jiva, the embodied soul, who resorts to speech only when he wants to speak; the Prana, the Life-principle, which governs the mind and all feelings of the heart, infuses meanings and makes speech be heard. The third mantra talks about the learned person who constantly sees (notices) the eternal \"Jivatman\" without undergoing any change passing through many births in accordance with the past karmas. The Sanskrit expression \"gopam\" used in this mantra refers to the controller of the senses Brahman, the Sole Witness of all activities, but this word also refers to those liberated souls who continuously witness the repeated transmigrations of the unliberated souls.\n\nAccording to Wash Edward Hale the first mantra could refer to the myth of the \"Svarbhanu\" hiding the Sun with darkness until it was found by the Atris; if so, this is the only occurrence of \"asura\", in the singular, referring to a mythological evil or demonic being.\n"}

During NIMI, visual engagement or attention leads subconsciously to lower levels of fidgeting (and other non-instrumental movements). Non-Instrumental movements are bodily actions that are not related to the goal of the current task; for example, when in a classroom and the goal is to listen to a lecture, non-instrument (unnecessary) movements include fidgeting, scratching, postural micromovements, and certain emotional expressions. NIMI is important for recognizing boredom during human-robot interaction, human-computer interaction, computer-aided learning with automated tutoring systems, market research, and experience design.\n\nThe original observation that, in a seated audience, interest is associated with diminished fidgeting, and that boredom doubles the amount of human movement, was made by Francis Galton in 1885. Modern experiments suggesting that movement inhibition (and NIMI) were quantifiable and related to flow or interest were suggested by a series of papers regarding automated tutoring systems by Sidney D’Mello and colleagues. Using a non-visual task, Paul Seli and collaborators showed that increased episodes of mind wandering led to an increase in fidgeting, presumably because attention requires comparative stillness (maintaining that stillness is described as “a secondary task”). Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze and colleagues demonstrated that engagement in games (and human computer interaction) could lead to either increased movement or decreased movement, depending on the motivational nature of movement tasks involved with the accomplishment of the task. Harry Witchel and colleagues named the inhibitory phenomenon as NIMI, and demonstrated that the visual aspect of the human-computer interaction task was the most powerful contributor to the inhibitory effect on movement. They also demonstrated that, during individual human computer interaction in instrumentally identical reading comprehension tasks, interest itself was sufficient to diminish movement. This was reflected in experiments by Patrick Healy and colleagues in a seated audience at a dance performance.\n\nWhile it is known that frustration and restlessness can lead to increased movement during human computer interaction, it remains controversial as to whether NIMI that occurs during engagement is actually an inhibition of a baseline amount of physiologically required movement.\n"}

This presumption may be on the part of the individual, the parents, or the physician. Non-paternity may result from sperm donation, undisclosed adoption, intercourse with multiple partners in close succession, non-consensual sex, as well as medical mistakes, for example, mixups during procedures such as in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination. Where there is uncertainty, the most reliable technique for establishing paternity is genetic testing; however, there is still a risk of error due to the potential for gene mutations or scoring errors.\n\nOverall, the incidence of misattributed paternity ranges from about 2% to 12%, though it may be higher in certain populations. The discovery of previously unsuspected or undisclosed non-paternity may have both social and medical consequences. Non-paternity that is due to a previously undisclosed extra-marital relationship often has serious consequences for a marital relationship. Non-paternity is medically relevant when interpreting the results and utility of genetic screening for hereditary illnesses.\n\nBellis et al. (2005) stated that misattributed paternity \"occurs when a child is believed to have been fathered by the husband (or partner) but is actually the progeny of another man.\" Non-paternity events are also sometimes referred to as misattributed paternity, paternal discrepancy or false paternity. Although it is sometimes referred to as paternity fraud, this suggests that the misattribution was deliberate rather than accidental. In a scientific review of non-paternity studies since the 1950s, Bellis et al. (2005) stated that knowingly covering up an accidental pregnancy that resulted from infidelity is often assumed to be the reason for non-paternity, but that there are many other reasons, \"for example, where sex with the long term partner has not produced children a woman might seek conception elsewhere.\" They said other reasons might be undisclosed adoptions, accidental misattribution resulting from multiple relationships in close succession as well as medical mistakes, such as mixups during procedures such as in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination.\n\nIn genetic genealogy the term non-paternity is often used in a wider context to indicate a break in the link between the Y-chromosome and the surname. Such a breakage may occur because of formal or informal adoption, premarital or extramarital intercourse or rape, or when individuals use a different surname than their biological father, such as their mother's maiden name, a stepfather's name, the use of aliases or a legal name change.\n\nThe most reliable test for paternity is genetic testing, sometimes referred to as DNA testing. Requirements for consent and counselling vary by country. However, genetic testing is based on probabilities and is not always definitive. Jones et al. (2010) said, \"Characteristics of the markers and the fact that they are analysed by fallible humans can result in inconsistencies that present problems for parentage analysis.\" False negatives may occur due to low quality samples, gene mutations, or genotyping errors (when a genotype is misread or inaccurately scored). There is a higher probability of accuracy when DNA from both parents can be tested. The accuracy increases even more when DNA from a sibling is available.\n\nIt is difficult to accurately estimate the incidence of misattributed paternity, and there have been large discrepancies in the research published on the topic. Often data on non-paternity rates are reported tangentially to the primary goal of research without sufficient detail, and very few studies involve randomized samples. As such, it is not possible to make valid generalizations based on a large portion of the available literature. Bellis et al. (2005) found that between 1950 and 2004, the rates of misattributed paternity published in scientific journals ranged from 0.8% to 30% with a median of 3.7%. According to a study published in the \"Lancet\", \"High rates have been quoted, but are often unsupported by any published evidence or based on unrepresentative population samples.\"\n\nTuri King and Mark Jobling of the Department of Genetics at University of Leicester called the commonly cited 30% rate of non-paternity an \"urban myth\". According to King and Jobling, the figure is around 2%. They also stated that misattributed paternity is often impacted by cultural and socioeconomic factors and that it occurs more frequently among couples who aren't married. Sociologist Michael Gilding concluded that inflated figures have been circulated by the media, the paternity testing industry, fathers' rights activists and evolutionary psychologists. He traced many of these overestimates back to a 1972 conference where non-paternity rates as high as 30% were discussed. Gilding states that these data only show the incidence of non-paternity in cases where disputed parentage was the \"reason\" for paternity testing. In situations where disputed parentage was the reason for the paternity testing, there were higher levels with an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk of parental discrepancy were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain ethnic and cultural groups.\n\nRarely, genetic testing has revealed children from multiple births to have different fathers, which is known as \"heteropaternal superfecundation\". One study estimated that the incidence of bipaternal twins born to white women in the United States is around one pair in 400. Another study found the prevalence to be approximately one pair in 13,000 cases.\n"}

Shortly after, two Nurbank managers, Zholdas Timraliyev and Aybar Khasenov, were kidnapped, tortured and eventually killed by Aliyev. In May 2007, the criminal proceedings against Aliyev in Almaty began and Kazakhstan sentenced him for forty years.\n\nIn 1992, the Nurbank bank opened for business and became the seventh largest bank in Kazakhstan. \"According to its Website, it is owned by the largest oil, food, publishing and foreign trade firms operating in Kazakhstan, and also currently lends to oil, food, foreign trade, and publishing & information firms.\"\n\nIn January 2007, Rakhat Aliyev became the main owner and acquired about 75% of all Nurbank’s assets. His father owned 6.71% and his 22-year-old son Nurali Aliyev was a sitting board member.\n\nAround January 18, 2007, Zholdas Timraliyev (vice president) and Abilmazhen Gilimov (chairmen of Nurbank) entered into a car and were threatened by Rakhat Aliyev, according to Abilmazhen Gilimov. Rakhat was looking to acquire possession of a prized financial building in Kazakhstan's commercial capital, Almaty by ensuring ownership passed to him. They escaped after 24 hours. During his kidnapping, Timraliyev was able to phone his wife and tell of his abduction. Timraliyev's wife (Armangul Kapasheva/Armangul Qapasheva) reported him missing. They escaped after being held for 24 hours. They both left their positions at Nurbank on January 19.\n\nAccording to newspapers, the building Aliyev wanted them to sell, sold on January 22 for a very low price, four days after the alleged first kidnapping.\n\nOn January 31, Timraliyev disappeared again after receiving summons to speak with the tax police. Him and chairman of the board, Aibar Khasenov were reported missing. After a days of violent acts, both of the bodies were tucked into a metal drum, assailed with chalk and buried on a waste dump.\n\nDuring his kidnapping, Timraliyev was able to phone his wife (Armangul Kapasheva) and tell of his abduction. She reported them missing and her strong public appearance about the disappearance of her husband and mounting pressure against Alivey, the Kazakh authorities finally initiated criminal proceedings on May 10, 2007. The wives of the two missing Nurbank managers establish the TAGDYR association in order to find their husbands.\n\nAs a result, Aliyev brought forth a lawsuit against the two wives, for “insulting his honor and dignity.”\n\nTimraliyev’s wife was interviewed and several news outlets including,Svoboda Slova,\" \"Tasjargan,\" \"Vremya,\" and zonakz.net published her comments and now faced legal suit from Aliyev.\n\nAliyev was quickly appointed the new Kazak ambassador to Austria on February 9, 2007 as a polite way to get him out of the country. While in Austria, Aliyev announced his candidacy for the upcoming Kazakhstan elections and criticized the sitting Kazak President, Nursultan Nazarbayev. A full domestic Kazak investigation began in May 2007 into Aliyev’s activities. His diplomatic passport was cancelled, as was his diplomatic immunity. Kazakhstan filed its first extradition request at this time. The domestic Kazak investigation concluded January 2008 and Kazak courts sentenced Aliyev to 20 years of imprisonment \"in absentia\". His crimes were kidnapping, treason and plotting a coup d'état against his father-in-law Nursultan Nazarbayev.\n\nTheir second request for extradition in 2011 was also rejected, as Austria feared Kazak political persecution of Aliyev. They did however open their own investigation into Aliyev's dealings.\n\nJanuary 2013, Ailyev claimed Kazakhstan was politically persecuting him because he rejected the political system. Viennese supreme court excluded political underpinnings as a reason for persecution, which helped to greatly legitimize legal action brought against him.\n\nRakhat Aliyev (Shoraz) is also suspected of the murder of opposition leader and former Kazak ambassador to Russia Mr Sarsenbayev in early 2006, a complex embezzlement scheme stretching from Germany to Malta and Navis, torturing two Kazak bodyguards in 2001, and the death of his girlfriend Anastasiya Novikova in 2004.\n\n"}

{"id": "45694885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45694885", "title": "Perseverative cognition", "text": "Perseverative cognition\n\nPerseverative cognition is a collective term in scientific psychology for continuous thinking about negative events in the past or in the future (e.g. worry, rumination and brooding, but also mind wandering about negative topics). Perseverative cognition has been shown to have physiological effects, such as increased heart rate, blood pressure and cortisol, in daily life as well as under controlled laboratory conditions. Because of these physiological effects, the psychological concept of perseverative cognition helps to explain how psychological stress, such as work stress and marital stress, leads to disease, such as cardiovascular disease (see below: the 'perseverative cognition hypothesis').\n\nThe definition of perseverative cognition is: \"the repeated or chronic activation of the cognitive representation of one or more psychological stressors\". Worry, rumination and all other forms of thought (cognition) involving stressful events, in the past or in the future, fall under the definition of perseverative cognition. 'Just thinking about your problems, without calling it worrying or rumination', is also perseverative cognition, as is mind wandering when it concerns negative topics. Importantly, there is a large body of knowledge about the typical constituents of perseverative cognition, such as worry, rumination, repetitive thinking and (negative) mind wandering (reviewed in Watkins, 2008).\nPerseverative cognition may partly be unconscious. Just as people are not aware of the larger part of their thoughts (cognition), they may also not be aware of the cognitive representation of stressors.\n\nThe 'perseverative cognition hypothesis holds that stressful events cannot affect people's health, unless they think repetitively or continuously (that is, 'perseverate cognitively') about these stressful events. Stressful events themselves are often too short, as are the physiological responses to them. Therefore the physiological responses during these stressors are unlikely to cause bodily harm. More importantly, many stressful events are merely worried about, or feared in the future, while they often do not happen or do not have the feared consequences. Nevertheless, the body reacts with prolonged physiological responses to continuous thoughts (perseverative cognition) about these stressors. Therefore it is the perseverative cognition, and not the stressors that can eventually lead to disease. In scientific terms, it is said that perseverative cognition is a mediator of the detrimental effects of stress on one's health. Since its publication scientific evidence for this hypothesis has been accumulating.\n\n"}
{"id": "44363108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44363108", "title": "Retirement syndrome", "text": "Retirement syndrome\n\nThe Retirement Syndrome is a term coined by clinical professor of Leadership Development at INSEAD, and author, Manfred F.R Kets de Vries, to describe the difficulties faced by individuals in positions of authority, specifically Chief Executive Officer's (CEO's) as they attempt to \"let go\" at the end of a full career.\nThe syndrome, also classified by Kets de Vries as the \"CEO blues\", is an insistence by individuals in positions of leadership or authority to remain in power, despite reaching a plateau in their careers. Individuals in this position may experience feelings of having accomplished all that can be accomplished, and a lack of creativity, or lack of lustre in their current position. Effects are most strongly felt by those who reach a position of power earlier on in their lifetime as they will spend a much greater amount of time on the down slope towards retirement, as opposed to individuals who reach the \"top\" in their later years.\n\nEffects may also be credited to a realization by CEO's who have reached this plateau of the losses they may endure upon their retirement including:\n\nAs well as a desire to avoid difficult situations in which they may be required to confront the sacrifices they made on their way to the top -a fulfilling personal life, healthy relationships with spouse, children and friends, and time to develop outside contacts and interests.\n\nThe physical effects of aging- wrinkles, gray hair, balding, dental problems, a need for glasses (stronger prescription), are coupled with a self-consciousness about the deterioration of the body. This can lead to a search for outlets that can act as substitutes for attractiveness. For leaders especially, maintaining power may be viewed as a substitute for the attractiveness that has been lost throughout the years. Leaders with narcissistic tendencies, are also more likely to feel the psychological effects of aging as they may experience a heightened sense of injury when the physical effects of aging become apparent.\n\nThe Experience of nothingness is felt by individuals facing retirement if they feel as though their leadership is the only thing they have left, and a loss of this leadership would lead to their demise as a \"somebody\" to a \"nobody\". Many individuals in this position often may not have anyone to turn to for emotional support, and will therefore cling to their position of power for as long as possible.\n\nThe lex talionis or talion principle, often referred to as the \"eye for an eye\" principle can be applied in the case of individuals facing retirement. This principle established in early Babylonian law, expresses the belief that criminals should be punished exactly as they had inflicted upon their victims. In the case of retirees, paranoia may ensue when it comes time for this shift in power, as they are consciously aware as leaders of the individuals who may attempt to retaliate or take revenge against them for leadership decisions taken during their careers that may have affected the happiness or wellbeing of one or more of these individuals.\n\nThe Edifice Complex is a sense that with retirement comes the end of a legacy. More deeply felt when at the unconscious level, leaving a lasting legacy is equated with defeating death. In a way, difficulty in letting go of this legacy, and a desire to remain in power for as long as possible, may be seen in the broader sense as a difficulty facing mortality. When power begins to shift in the organization, a CEO may go through the stages of anger, sadness, and depression, which can lead to serious second thoughts in their decision to retire their position. On the other hand, leaders who are committed to their organization and actively try to find a capable successor to carry on after their retirement generally experience less difficulty in letting go.\n"}
{"id": "25166191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25166191", "title": "Rule of law", "text": "Rule of law\n\nThe rule of law is \"The authority and influence of law in society, especially when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behavior; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes\". The phrase \"the rule of law\" refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule. \n\nUse of the phrase can be traced back to 16th-century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford employed it in arguing against the divine right of kings. John Locke wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty. \"The rule of law\" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers; for example, Aristotle wrote: \"It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens\".\n\nThe rule of law implies that every person is subject to the law, including people who are lawmakers, law enforcement officials, and judges. In this sense, it stands in contrast to a monarchy or oligarchy where the rulers are held above the law. Lack of the rule of law can be found in both democracies and monarchies, for example, because of neglect or ignorance of the law, and the rule of law is more apt to decay if a government has insufficient corrective mechanisms for restoring it.\n\nAlthough credit for popularizing the expression \"the rule of law\" in modern times is usually given to A. V. Dicey, development of the legal concept can be traced through history to many ancient civilizations, including ancient Greece, China, Mesopotamia, India, and Rome.\n\nIn the West, the ancient Greeks initially regarded the best form of government as rule by the best men. Plato advocated a benevolent monarchy ruled by an idealized philosopher king, who was above the law. Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that \"Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state.\" More than Plato attempted to do, Aristotle flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws. In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law:\n\nIt is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws.\n\nThe Roman statesman Cicero is often cited as saying, roughly: \"We are all servants of the laws in order to be free.\" During the Roman Republic, controversial magistrates might be put on trial when their terms of office expired. Under the Roman Empire, the sovereign was personally immune (\"legibus solutus\"), but those with grievances could sue the treasury.\n\nIn China, members of the school of legalism during the 3rd century BC argued for using law as a tool of governance, but they promoted \"rule \"by\" law\" as opposed to \"rule \"of\" law\", meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law. In contrast, the Huang-Lao school of Daoism rejected legal positivism in favor of a natural law that even the ruler would be subject to.\n\nThere has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the Bible on Western constitutional law. In the Old Testament, the book of Deuteronomy imposes certain restrictions on the king, regarding such matters as the numbers of wives he might take and of horses he might acquire (for his own use). According to Professor Bernard M. Levinson, \"This legislation was so utopian in its own time that it seems never to have been implemented...\" The Deuteronomic social vision may have influenced opponents of the divine right of kings, including Bishop John Ponet in sixteenth-century England.\n\nIn Islamic jurisprudence rule of law was formulated in the seventh century, so that no official could claim to be above the law, not even the caliph. However, this was not a reference to secular law, but to Islamic religious law in the form of Sharia law.\n\nAlfred the Great, Anglo-Saxon king in the 9th century, reformed the law of his kingdom and assembled a law code (the Doom Book) which he grounded on biblical commandments. He held that the same law had to be applied to all persons, whether rich or poor, friends or enemies. This was likely inspired by Leviticus 19:15: \"You shall do no iniquity in judgment. You shall not favor the wretched and you shall not defer to the rich. In righteousness you are to judge your fellow.\"\n\nIn 1215, Archbishop Stephen Langton gathered the Barons in England and forced King John and future sovereigns and magistrates back under the rule of law, preserving ancient liberties by Magna Carta in return for exacting taxes. This foundation for a constitution was carried into the United States Constitution.\n\nIn 1481, during the reign of Ferdinand II of Aragon, the \"Constitució de l'Observança\" was approved by the General Court of Catalonia, establishing the submission of royal power (included its officers) to the laws of the Principality of Catalonia.\n\nThe first known use of this English phrase occurred around AD 1500. Another early example of the phrase \"rule of law\" is found in a petition to James I of England in 1610, from the House of Commons:\nAmongst many other points of happiness and freedom which your majesty's subjects of this kingdom have enjoyed under your royal progenitors, kings and queens of this realm, there is none which they have accounted more dear and precious than this, to be guided and governed by the certain \"rule of the law\" which giveth both to the head and members that which of right belongeth to them, and not by any uncertain or arbitrary form of government...\n\nIn 1607, English Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke said in the \"Case of Prohibitions\" (according to his own report) \"that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, \"quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege\" (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.).\"\n\nAmong the first modern authors to use the term and give the principle theoretical foundations was Samuel Rutherford in \"Lex, Rex\" (1644). The title, Latin for \"the law is king\", subverts the traditional formulation \"rex lex\" (\"the king is law\"). James Harrington wrote in \"Oceana\" (1656), drawing principally on Aristotle’s \"Politics\", that among forms of government an “Empire of Laws, and not of Men” was preferable to an “Empire of Men, and not of Laws”.\n\nJohn Locke also discussed this issue in his \"Second Treatise of Government\" (1690):\nThe natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The liberty of man, in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but that established, by consent, in the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells us, Observations, A. 55. a liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws: but freedom of men under government is, to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man: as freedom of nature is, to be under no other restraint but the law of nature.\n\nThe principle was also discussed by Montesquieu in \"The Spirit of the Laws\" (1748). The phrase \"rule of law\" appears in Samuel Johnson's \"Dictionary\" (1755).\n\nIn 1776, the notion that no one is above the law was popular during the founding of the United States. For example, Thomas Paine wrote in his pamphlet \"Common Sense\" that \"in America, \"the law is king\". For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law \"ought\" to be king; and there ought to be no other.\" In 1780, John Adams enshrined this principle in the Massachusetts Constitution by seeking to establish \"a government of laws and not of men.\"\n\nThe influence of Britain, France and the United States contributed to spreading the principle of the rule of law to other countries around the world.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has defined \"rule of law\" this way:\n\nThe authority and influence of law in society, esp. when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behaviour; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes.\n\nRule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for example by divine right.\n\nDespite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been described as \"an exceedingly elusive notion\". Among modern legal theorists, one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a formalist or \"thin\" definition, and a substantive or \"thick\" definition; one occasionally encounters a third \"functional\" conception. Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the \"justness\" of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law. Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, the rule of law.\n\nMost legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics, meaning that the law must be publicly declared (prohibitions or exigencies), with prospective application (punishments or consequences tied to a given prohibition or exigency), and possess the characteristics of generality (usually meaning consistency and comprehensibility), equality (that is, applied equally throughout all society), and certainty (that is, certainty of application for a given situation), but there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law. Others, including a few legal theorists, believe that the rule of law necessarily entails protection of individual rights. Within legal theory, these two approaches to the rule of law are seen as the two basic alternatives, respectively labelled the formal and substantive approaches. Still, there are other views as well. Some believe that democracy is part of the rule of law.\n\nThe \"formal\" interpretation is more widespread than the \"substantive\" interpretation. Formalists hold that the law must be prospective, well-known, and have characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty. Other than that, the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law. This formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights, but recognizes the existence of \"rule of law\" in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights.\n\nThe substantive interpretation holds that the rule of law intrinsically protects some or all individual rights.\n\nThe functional interpretation of the term \"rule of law\", consistent with the traditional English meaning, contrasts the \"rule of law\" with the \"rule of man\". According to the functional view, a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of \"rule of law\", whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of \"rule of law\". Upholding the rule of law can sometimes require the punishment of those who commit offenses that are justifiable under natural law but not statutory law. The rule of law is thus somewhat at odds with flexibility, even when flexibility may be preferable.\n\nThe ancient concept of rule \"of\" law can be distinguished from rule \"by\" law, according to political science professor Li Shuguang: \"The difference ... is that, under the rule of law, the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power. Under rule by law, the law is a mere tool for a government, that suppresses in a legalistic fashion.\"\n\nThe rule of law has been considered as one of the key dimensions that determine the quality and good governance of a country. Research, like the Worldwide Governance Indicators, defines the rule of law as: \"the extent to which agents have confidence and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, the police and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime or violence.\" Based on this definition the Worldwide Governance Indicators project has developed aggregate measurements for the rule of law in more than 200 countries, as seen in the map at right.\n\nThe preamble of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms says \"the governments of European countries which are like-minded and have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law\".\n\nIn France and Germany the concepts of rule of law (\"Etat de droit\" and \"Rechtsstaat\" respectively) are analogous to the principles of constitutional supremacy and protection of fundamental rights from public authorities (see public law), particularly the legislature. France was one of the early pioneers of the ideas of the rule of law. The German interpretation is more \"rigid\" but similar to that of France and the United Kingdom.\n\nFinland's constitution explicitly requires rule of law by stipulating that \"the exercise of public powers shall be based on an Act. In all public activity, the law shall be strictly observed.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom the rule of law is a long-standing principle of the way the country is governed, dating from Magna Carta in 1215 and the Bill of Rights 1689. In the 19th century, A. V. Dicey, a constitutional scholar and lawyer, wrote of the twin pillars of the British constitution in his classic work \"Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution\" (1885); these two pillars are the rule of law and parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nAll government officers of the United States, including the President, the Justices of the Supreme Court, state judges and legislators, and all members of Congress, pledge first and foremost to uphold the Constitution. These oaths affirm that the rule of law is superior to the rule of any human leader. At the same time, the federal government has considerable discretion: the legislative branch is free to decide what statutes it will write, as long as it stays within its enumerated powers and respects the constitutionally protected rights of individuals. Likewise, the judicial branch has a degree of judicial discretion, and the executive branch also has various discretionary powers including prosecutorial discretion.\n\nScholars continue to debate whether the U.S. Constitution adopted a particular interpretation of the \"rule of law\", and if so, which one. For example, John Harrison asserts that the word \"law\" in the Constitution is simply defined as that which is legally binding, rather than being \"defined by formal or substantive criteria\", and therefore judges do not have discretion to decide that laws fail to satisfy such unwritten and vague criteria. Law Professor Frederick Mark Gedicks disagrees, writing that Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed that an unjust law was not really a law at all.\n\nSome modern scholars contend that the rule of law has been corroded during the past century by the instrumental view of law promoted by legal realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes and Roscoe Pound. For example, Brian Tamanaha asserts: \"The rule of law is a centuries-old ideal, but the notion that law is a means to an end became entrenched only in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\"\n\nOthers argue that the rule of law has survived but was transformed to allow for the exercise of discretion by administrators. For much of American history, the dominant notion of the rule of law, in this setting, has been some version of A. V. Dicey's: \"no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.\" That is, individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction. As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place. Even Charles Evans Hughes, a Chief Justice of the United States, believed \"you must have administration, and you must have administration by administrative officers.\" By 1941, a compromise had emerged. If administrators adopted procedures that more or less tracked \"the ordinary legal manner\" of the courts, further review of the facts by \"the ordinary Courts of the land\" was unnecessary. That is, if you had your \"day in commission\", the rule of law did not require a further \"day in court\". Thus Dicey's rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form.\n\nJames Wilson said during the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 that, \"Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect.\" George Mason agreed that judges \"could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course.\" Chief Justice John Marshall (joined by Justice Joseph Story) took a similar position in 1827: \"When its existence as law is denied, that existence cannot be proved by showing what are the qualities of a law.\"\n\nEast Asian cultures are influenced by two schools of thought, Confucianism, which advocated good governance as rule by leaders who are benevolent and virtuous, and Legalism, which advocated strict adherence to law. The influence of one school of thought over the other has varied throughout the centuries. One study indicates that throughout East Asia, only South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have societies that are robustly committed to a law-bound state. According to Awzar Thi, a member of the Asian Human Rights Commission, the rule of law in Thailand, Cambodia, and most of Asia is weak or nonexistent:\n\nApart from a number of states and territories, across the continent there is a huge gulf between the rule of law rhetoric and reality. In Thailand, the police force is an organized crime gang. In Cambodia, judges are proxies for the ruling political party ... That a judge may harbor political prejudice or apply the law unevenly are the smallest worries for an ordinary criminal defendant in Asia. More likely ones are: Will the police fabricate the evidence? Will the prosecutor bother to show up? Will the judge fall asleep? Will I be poisoned in prison? Will my case be completed within a decade?\n\nIn countries such as China and Vietnam, the transition to a market economy has been a major factor in a move toward the rule of law, because the rule of law is important to foreign investors and to economic development. It remains unclear whether the rule of law in countries like China and Vietnam will be limited to commercial matters or will spill into other areas as well, and if so whether that spillover will enhance prospects for related values such as democracy and human rights. The rule of law in China has been widely discussed and debated by both legal scholars and politicians in China.\n\nIn Thailand, a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932, the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practice. Ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings, and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st century. In November 2013, Thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senators.\n\nIn India, the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950. Although the Constitution of India may have been intended to provide details that would limit the opportunity for judicial discretion, the more text there is in a constitution the greater opportunity the judiciary may have to exercise judicial review. According to Indian journalist Harish Khare, \"The rule of law or rather the Constitution [is] in danger of being supplanted by the rule of judges.\"\n\nJapan had centuries of tradition prior to World War II, during which there were laws, but they did not provide a central organizing principle for society, and they did not constrain the powers of government (Boadi, 2001). As the 21st century began, the percentage of people who were lawyers and judges in Japan remained very low relative to western Europe and the United States, and legislation in Japan tended to be terse and general, leaving much discretion in the hands of bureaucrats.\n\nVarious organizations are involved in promoting the rule of law.\n\nThe Statute of the Council of Europe characterizes the rule of law as one of the core principles which the establishment of the organization based on. The paragraph 3 of the preamble of the Statute of the Council of Europe states: \"Reaffirming their devotion to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of their peoples and the true source of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law, principles which form the basis of all genuine democracy.\" The Statute lays the compliance with the rule of law principles as a condition for the European states to be a full member of the organization.\n\nIn 1959, an event took place in New Delhi and speaking as the International Commission of Jurists, made a declaration as to the fundamental principle of the rule of law. The event consisted of over 185 judges, lawyers, and law professors from 53 countries. This later became known as the Declaration of Delhi. During the declaration they declared what the rule of law implied. They included certain rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary and social, economic and cultural conditions conducive to human dignity. The one aspect not included in The Declaration of Delhi, was for rule of law requiring legislative power to be subject to judicial review.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations defines the rule of law as:\n\na principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. It requires, as well, measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness and procedural and legal transparency.\n\nThe General Assembly has considered rule of law as an agenda item since 1992, with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions. The Security Council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law, and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women, peace and security, children in armed conflict, and the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The Peacebuilding Commission has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action also requires the rule of law be included in human rights education.\n\nThe Council of the International Bar Association passed a resolution in 2009 endorsing a substantive or \"thick\" definition of the rule of law:\n\nAn independent, impartial judiciary; the presumption of innocence; the right to a fair and public trial without undue delay; a rational and proportionate approach to punishment; a strong and independent legal profession; strict protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client; equality of all before the law; these are all fundamental principles of the Rule of Law. Accordingly, arbitrary arrests; secret trials; indefinite detention without trial; cruel or degrading treatment or punishment; intimidation or corruption in the electoral process, are all unacceptable. The Rule of Law is the foundation of a civilised society. It establishes a transparent process accessible and equal to all. It ensures adherence to principles that both liberate and protect. The IBA calls upon all countries to respect these fundamental principles. It also calls upon its members to speak out in support of the Rule of Law within their respective communities.\n\nAs used by the World Justice Project, a non-profit organization committed to advancing the rule of law around the world, the rule of law refers to a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld:\n\nThe World Justice Project has developed an Index to measure the extent to which countries adhere to the rule of law in practice. The WJP Rule of Law Index is composed of 9 factors and 52 sub-factors, and covers a variety of dimensions of the rule of law—such as whether government officials are accountable under the law, and whether legal institutions protect fundamental rights and allow ordinary people access to justice.\n\nThe International Development Law Organization (IDLO) is an intergovernmental organization with a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development. It works to empower people and communities to claim their rights, and provides governments with the know-how to realize them. It supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity. It is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in more than 170 countries around the world.\n\nThe International Development Law Organization has a holistic definition of the rule of law:\n\nMore than a matter of due process, the rule of law is an enabler of justice and development. The three notions are interdependent; when realized, they are mutually reinforcing. For IDLO, as much as a question of laws and procedure, the rule of law is a culture and daily practice. It is inseparable from equality, from access to justice and education, from access to health and the protection of the most vulnerable. It is crucial for the viability of communities and nations, and for the environment that sustains them.\n\nIDLO is headquartered in Rome and has a branch office in The Hague and has Permanent Observer Status at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.\n\nThe International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL) is a network of over 3,000 law practitioners from 120 countries and 300 organizations working on rule of law issues in post-conflict and developing countries from a policy, practice and research perspective. INPROL is based at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) in partnership with the US Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Strategic Police Matters Unit, the Center of Excellence for Police Stability Unit, and William and Marry School of Law in the United States. Its affiliate organizations include the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Folke Bernadotte Academy, International Bar Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Women Police, International Corrections and Prisons Association, International Association for Court Administration, International Security Sector Advisory Team at the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, Worldwide Association of Women Forensic Experts (WAWFE), and International Institute for Law and Human Rights.\n\nINPROL provides an online forum for the exchange of information about best practices. Members may post questions, and expect a response from their fellow rule of law practitioners worldwide on their experiences in addressing rule of law issues.\n\nOne important aspect of the rule-of-law initiatives is the study and analysis of the rule of law’s impact on economic development. The rule-of-law movement cannot be fully successful in transitional and developing countries without an answer to the question: does the rule of law matter for economic development or not? Constitutional economics is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the judiciary, which, in many transitional and developing countries, is completely controlled by the executive. It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors.\n\nThe standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process, and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.\n\nThe Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries. To date, the term \"rule of law\" has been used primarily in the English-speaking countries, and it is not yet fully clarified even with regard to such well-established democracies as, for instance, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, or Japan. A common language between lawyers of common law and civil law countries as well as between legal communities of developed and developing countries is critically important for research of links between the rule of law and real economy.\n\nThe \"rule of law\" primarily connotes \"protection of property rights\". The economist F. A. Hayek analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market. Hayek proposed that under the rule of law, individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated: \"under the Rule of Law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by \"ad hoc\" action. Within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts.\"\n\nStudies have shown that weak rule of law (for example, discretionary regulatory enforcement) discourages investment. Economists have found, for example, that a rise in discretionary regulatory enforcement caused US firms to abandon international investments.\n\nThe Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments or Roerich Pact is an inter-American treaty. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the legal recognition that the defense of cultural objects is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military purposes, and the protection of culture always has precedence over any military necessity.\nThe Roerich Pact signed on April 15, 1935 by the representatives of 21 American states in the Oval Office of the White House (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.\nThe Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict is the first international treaty that focuses on the protection of cultural property in armed conflict. It was signed at The Hague, Netherlands on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of June 2017, it has been ratified by 128 states.\n\nThe rule of law can be hampered when there is a disconnect between legal and popular consensus. An example is intellectual property. Under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization, nominally strong copyright laws have been implemented throughout most of the world; but because the attitude of much of the population does not conform to these laws, a rebellion against ownership rights has manifested in rampant piracy, including an increase in peer-to-peer file sharing. Similarly, in Russia, tax evasion is common and a person who admits he does not pay taxes is not judged or criticized by his colleagues and friends, because the tax system is viewed as unreasonable. Bribery likewise has different normative implications across cultures.\n\nThe Rule of Law has been criticised by several scholars, authors, philosophers and activists as unrealistic, hypocritical or dangerous.\n\nAuthor Peter Gelderloos argues that attempting to create a specialised class of judicial authority that is separate from the community will inevitably lead to corruption. He points out that nonviolent drug-related offences receive far more police and media attention than workplace injuries or pollution, which kill far more people each year. He argues that restorative justice is a far more effective and humane alternative to prisons, courts and the police.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1723628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1723628", "title": "Samuel George Morton", "text": "Samuel George Morton\n\nSamuel George Morton (January 26, 1799 – May 15, 1851) was an American physician and natural scientist. Morton, who was reared a Quaker but became Episcopalian in midlife, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, attended Westtown School, and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1820. After earning an advanced degree from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, he began practice in Philadelphia in 1824. He was one of the founders of the Pennsylvania Medical College in Philadelphia and served as its professor of anatomy from 1839 until his resignation 1843. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1844.\n\nMorton was a prolific writer of books on various subjects from 1823 to 1851. He wrote \"Geological Observations\" in 1828, and both \"Synopsis of the Organic Remains of the Cretaceous Group of the United States\" and \"Illustrations of Pulmonary Consumption\" in 1834. His first medical essay, on the user of cornine in intermittent fever, in 1825 was published in the \"Philadelphia Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences\". His bibliography includes \"Hybridity in Animals and Plants\" (1847), \"Additional Observation on Hybridity\" (1851), and \"An Illustrated System of Human Anatomy\" (1849).\n\nSamuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of \"American School\" ethnography, a school of thought in antebellum American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of species rather than variety and is seen by some as the origin of scientific racism.\n\nMorton argued against the single creation story of the Bible (monogenism) and instead supported a theory of multiple racial creations (polygenism). Morton claimed the Bible supported polygenism, and within working in a biblical framework his theory held that each race had been created separately and each was given specific, irrevocable characteristics.\n\nAfter inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since the Bible indicated that Noah's Ark had washed up on Mount Ararat, only a thousand years ago before this, Morton claimed that Noah's sons could not possibly account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of polygenesis, races have been separate since the start.\n\nMorton claimed that he could define the intellectual ability of a race by the skull capacity. A large volume meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. He was reputed to hold the largest collection of skulls, on which he based his research. He claimed that each race had a separate origin, and that a descending order of intelligence could be discerned that placed Caucasians at the pinnacle and Negroes at the lowest point, with various other race groups in between. Morton had many skulls from ancient Egypt, and concluded that the ancient Egyptians were not African, but were Caucasian. His results were published in three volumes between 1839 and 1849: the \"Crania Americana\", \"An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America\" and \"Crania Aegyptiaca\". Morton's skull collection was held at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia until 1966, when it was transferred to the Penn Museum, where it is presently curated.\n\nMorton's theories were very popular in his day, and he was a highly respected physician and scientist. The anthropologist Aleš Hrdlička called Morton \"the father of American physical anthropology\". Crispin Bates has noted that Morton's \"systematic justification\" for the separation of races, along with the work of Louis Agassiz, was also used by those who favoured slavery in the United States, with the \"Charleston Medical Journal\" noting at his death that \"We of the South should consider him as our benefactor for aiding most materially in giving to the negro his true position as an inferior race.\"\n\nMorton claimed in his \"Crania Americana\" that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches (1,426 cc), Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches (1,344 cc) and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches (1,278 cc). Morton believed that the skulls of each race were so different that a wise creator from the beginning had created each race and positioned them in separate homelands to dwell in.\n\nMorton believed that cranial capacity determined intellectual ability, and he used his craniometric evidence in conjunction with his analysis of anthropological literature then available to argue in favor of a racial hierarchy which put Caucasians on the top rung and Africans on the bottom. His skull measurements (by volume) then came to serve as \"evidence\" for racial stereotypes. He described the Caucasian as \"distinguished by the facility with which it attains the highest intellectual endowments\"; Native Americans were described as \"averse to cultivation, and slow in acquiring knowledge; restless, revengeful, and fond of war, and wholly destitute of maritime adventure\" and the Africans he described as \"joyous, flexible, and indolent; while the many nations which compose this race present a singular diversity of intellectual character, of which the far extreme is the lowest grade of humanity\".\n\nMorton's followers, particularly Josiah C. Nott and George Gliddon in their monumental tribute to Morton's work, \"Types of Mankind\" (1854), carried Morton's ideas further and backed up his findings which supported the notion of polygenism – the premise that the different races were separately created by God. The publication of Charles Darwin's \"On The Origin of Species\" in 1859 changed the nature of the scholarly debate.\n\nIn a 1978 paper and later in \"The Mismeasure of Man\" (1981), Stephen Jay Gould asserted that Morton had, perhaps because of an unconscious bias, selectively reported data, manipulated sample compositions, made analytical errors, and mismeasured skulls in order to support his prejudicial views on intelligence differences between different populations. Gould's book became widely read and Morton came to be considered one of the main cases of the effects of unconscious bias in data collection, and as one of the main figures in the early history of scientific racism.\n\nSubsequently, two separate studies of Morton's data and methods, one conducted in 1988 and the other in 2011, argued that Gould had overstated or misrepresented the case, and that Morton's measurement's were essentially correct.\n\nIn the latter study, entitled \"The Mismeasure of Science: Stephen Jay Gould versus Samuel George Morton on Skulls and Bias\" and authored by six anthropologists, it was concluded that the bias came from Gould, who failed to examine and remeasure the crania in order to determine Morton's level of accuracy.\n\nHowever, this study was reviewed in an editorial in \"Nature\", which recommended a degree of caution, stating \"the critique leaves the majority of Gould's work unscathed,\" and noted that \"because they couldn't measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities that Morton reported represent his sample accurately.\" The journal stated that Gould's opposition to racism may have biased his interpretation of Morton's data, but also noted that \"Lewis and his colleagues have their own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the University of Pennsylvania, and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied skull collection freed from the stigma of bias\" and did not accept Gould's theory \"that the scientific method is inevitably tainted by bias.\"\n\nA 2014 review of the paper by University of Pennsylvania philosophy professor Michael Weisberg, tended to support Gould's original accusations, concluding that \"there is prima facie evidence of a racial bias in Morton's measurements\". Weisberg concludes that although Gould did commit mistakes in his own treatment, Morton's work \"remains a cautionary example of racial bias in the science of human differences\".\n\nResearch by Paul Wolff Mitchell in 2018 argues that Morton was nevertheless guilty of bias, though not in data collection. Mitchell argues that Morton's interpretation of his data was erroneous; he investigated averages and ignored variations in skull size so large that there was significant overlap. A contemporary of Morton, Friedrich Tiedemann, had collected similar skull data and drawn conclusions opposite to Morton's on the basis of this overlap. <ref> Ars Technica \"There’s new evidence confirming bias of the “father of scientific racism”<\\ref>\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "723799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=723799", "title": "Sanat Kumara", "text": "Sanat Kumara\n\nAccording to the post-1900 publications of Theosophy, Lord Sunat Kumara is an \"Advanced Being\" at the Ninth level of initiation who is regarded as the 'Lord' or 'Regent' of Earth and of the humanity, and is thought to be the head of the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth who dwells in Shamballah (also known as 'The City of Enoch').\n\nShamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the etheric plane somewhere above the Gobi Desert in the borderlands of Mongolia.\n\nThe Great White Brotherhood is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in Peru, where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).\n\nThese authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (called in the Ascended Master Teachings Ascended Masters) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.\n\nSanat Kumara appears as a rishi in the Hindu religious text the Chandogya Upanishad. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of Kataragama, Sri Lanka. In Sanskrit, \"Sanat Kumara\" is \"Eternal Youth\" (from Sanat \"eternal\", Ku \"with difficulty\" and Mara \"mortal\").\n\nThe Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, Shamballa, the sahasrara of the world. The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called \"Sanatana\"; at the Cosmic plane, it is \"Subrahmanya\"; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is \"Sanaka\"; at the Planetary plane, it is \"Sanandana\"; and on this planet, it is \"Sanath\" Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.\n\nScriptures, especially the Mahabharata, say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when Lord Krishna came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named Pradyumna. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother Rukmini as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of Mahabharata.\n\n\"Shambhala\" (Tib. \"bde 'byung\") in Vajrayana Buddhism (the religion of Tibet) is a Sanskrit term meaning \"place of peace/tranquility/happiness\". Gautama Buddha is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the Kalachakra tantra on request of King Suchandra of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa. The Stanzas of Dzyan from which Madame Blavatsky claimed to have gotten the information in The Secret Doctrine are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words \"Kalachakra tantra\" (\"rGyud-sde\" in Tibetan). Shambhala is ruled over by a line of Kings of Shambhala known as Kulika or Kalki Kings (Tib. \"Rigden\"), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the \"Kalachakra tantra\". In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as \"The King of the World\". Shamballa was thought by the Tibetans to be somewhere north of Lake Manasarovar and its adjacent Mount Kailasa, a sacred mountain in Tibet where it is thought that all the dragon currents intersect.\n\nThe ancient Buddhist temple, Kurama-dera in Japan, is host to a unique bodhisattva, the \"Defender Lord\", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.\n\nSanat Kumara was mentioned briefly by the theosophist Helena Blavatsky. She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the \"Lords of the Flame\", whom Christian tradition has presented as Lucifer and the fallen angels.\n\nSanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague Charles W. Leadbeater wrote that Sanat Kumara was the \"King\" or \"Lord of the World\", and the head of the Great White Brotherhood of Mahatmas who had revealed the principles of theosophy.\n\nLater authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as Alice Bailey and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.\n\nC.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of Theosophy such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the etheric plane of the planet Venus to Earth 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; Elizabeth Clare Prophet of Church Universal and Triumphant does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In Theosophy, the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from Venus are called the \"Lords of the Flame\". C.W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 \"Lords of the Flame\" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony. In the later version of the story promulgated by Guy Ballard, notable \"Lords of the Flame\" include Gautama Buddha, and the World Teacher (the being referred to alternately as Maitreya or Christ by Benjamin Creme). Elizabeth Clare Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought 144,000 souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.\n\nSanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as Skanda/Kartikkeya in Hinduism, Brahma-Sanam Kumar in Buddhism, the Ancient of Days in Judeo-Christian traditions, and identify him as Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is Al Khdir (green man) known to Sufi Muslims (according to Dakshinamurti).\n\nIt is maintained in most of these versions of Theosophy that Venus, the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced planet of our solar system. The beings living on the etheric plane of Venus are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution. It is said that the governing council of Venus – the \"Seven Holy Kumars\" – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.\n\nAccording to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the etheric plane above the Gobi Desert to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.\n\nThe main temple of Shamballa is topped with a golden dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays. These temples are located on a number of wide boulevards resembling the Champs-Elysees. According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, George Washington was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose city planner Pierre L'Enfant to create the city plan of Washington DC which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.\n\nThe most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is \"Lord of the World\". C.W. Leadbeater also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every Wesak (the Full Moon of May) led by Gautama Buddha, and also participated in by the Maitreya (the being Theosophists identify as Christ), in which cosmic energy is focused from the \"Solar Logos\" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance. The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern Tibet (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book \"The Masters and the Path\" has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the etheric body or in the physical body by those who have etheric sight.\n\nParadoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: \"The Ancient of Days\" (because he has been on Earth millions of years) and \"The Youth of Sixteen Summers\" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old). Another of his titles is \"The One Initiator\" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the \"Masters and the Path\" that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual initiation. Alice A. Bailey indicates the same in her writings.\n\nIn the all organizations subscribing to the \"Ascended Master Teachings\", Sanat Kumara is presented as an Ascended Master. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the \"Regent Lord of the World\" in deference to Gautama Buddha having taken the office of \"Lord of the World\". (1956). With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range galactic planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what Joshua David Stone calls the Galactic Confederation of Planets.\n\nSanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as \"Lord of the World\" is a , magic wand called the \"Rod of Power\" made of the metal orichalcum, with cone-shaped diamonds on each end.\n\nThe Bridge to Freedom, Church Universal and Triumphant and all other \"Ascended Master Teachings\" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a \"Divine Complement\" (\"Twin Flame\") (i.e., a \"celestial wife\") – Lady Master Venus – the New Age \"Goddess of Love\". The Ascended \"Lady Master Venus\" is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl. Sanat Kumara is believed to have married Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the Lady Master Meta who they brought with them from Venus. She is said to have incarnated as an Avatar in Atlantis (where she served as the high priestess at the \"Temple of Healing\") and in Sassanian Persia, where she married a mortal and had three children. In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the \"Goddess of Healing\" and is the patron deity of doctors and nurses. Since she is immortal, possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Cha Ara \nwas originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in Sassanian Persia. He became a master alchemist who formulated an elixir of immortality made from rose petals, tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients. This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood. He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people. He is the protector of all Zoroastrians. He works with St. Germain to bring about the New Age in the West Americas. Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy, Lady Master Nada is the \"Chohan of the Sixth Ray\" (see Seven Rays), and is the Ascended Lady Master governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her Ray are purple and gold, and also ruby.\n\nShe is also considered a Member of the Karmic Board; she handles the appeals of those on the third ray. She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha, on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray., thus advancing from the fifth to the sixth level of initiation. She primarily serves at \"Arabian Retreat\" in the Arabian Peninsula, northeast of the Red Sea. Nada serves there with the Brothers and Sisters of the Indigo Cape, as well as with Jesus, his Mother Mary and El Samyam, the Chief of the Arabian Council. She also serves at \"The Rose Temple\", located on the etheric plane above New Bedford, Massachusetts. Designed after the pattern of a rose, with each \"petal\" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the \"Temple of Love\" on Atlantis where Nada once served as a High Priestess. In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a lawyer. She was described as having raised her body and Ascended approximately 2,776 years ago.\n\nAlthough the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her \"retreat\") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the Karmic Board, hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.\n\nAccording to the \"I AM\" Activity, the Church Universal and Triumphant and others, the Ascended Masters (The great beings the original Theosophists called the \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\"), such as the Master Jesus, Saint Germain, Megha Alcorn aka Megan Sebastian on Earth, Kuthumi, Hatton, Gopal Das and others are working for the Spiritual Hierarchy of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, Gautama Buddha, and Maitreya. Many theosophists believe the \"Masters\" utilize the cosmic power of the Seven Rays to advance the \"Plan of the Masters\" to encourage the continual advance of civilization on Earth toward higher levels of consciousness. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the \"Great White Brotherhood\".\n\nThe Theosophist A.E. Powell stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the \"Lord of the World\") is in continuous telepathic rapport with ANNA / Gaia, the \"Spirit of the Earth\" (i.e., the \"Planetary Logos\" – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as Gaia or as Prithivi in Hinduism).C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous telepathic rapport with the Solar Logos (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the Sun). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the Seven Rays from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\" (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us. An intermediate trinity of Pratyeka-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's Spiritual Hierarchy, and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.\n\nAccording to the \"Alice A. Bailey material\", Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called \"The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World\". It is here that he regularly meets with Maitreya, the Maha Chohan, Djwal Khul, St. Germain, the Master Jesus and the other Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing \"The Plan of the Masters\" to bring the human race to higher levels of consciousness. According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from other solar systems.\n\nAccording to the \"Alice A. Bailey material\", Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. \nThese include The Watcher (also called the \"Silent Watcher\" or the \"Great Silent Watcher\"), whose function it is to continually watch the Akashic records and download daily all the information on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the \"Custodian of the Hall of Records\". (the Watcher is part of a special race of beings who fulfill this function that are posted on planets throughout the Cosmos ); the Lords of Karma – Alice A. Bailey mentioned three \"Lords of Karma\" but did not name them; they are called in the Ascended Master Teachings the Karmic Board and they are stated to number seven and each of them is identified by name: The Great Divine Director (1st ray), The Goddess of Liberty (2nd ray), Lady Master Nada (3rd ray), Cyclopea (4th ray), Pallas Athena (5th ray), Lady Master Portia (6th ray), and Kwan Yin (7th ray). The Karmic Board decides when souls that are between lives are to reincarnate again (if a disembodied soul desires to reincarnate somewhere or somewhen else than where they have been assigned, they must file an appeal with the Karmic Board—each person has to file an appeal to the member of the board that handles the appeals for their \"soul ray\"); and the one Alice A. Bailey calls the Custodian of the Hall of Records (called the Keeper of the Scrolls in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the \"Hall of Records\", an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the \"Recording Angels\" and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in Summerland and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced supercomputers on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth. The raw data is first downloaded daily by \"The Watcher\" from the Akashic records and fed by him to the \"Custodian of the Hall of Records\" and thence forwarded to the \"recording angels\" and their volunteer helpers. These imprint records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the \"soul ray\" (see seven rays) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the \"Karmic Board\" if that soul makes an appeal before it.\n\nOmri-Tas, the \"Ruler of the Violet Planet\", is a Galactic level Ascended Master (Spiritual Hierarchy, Cosmic Beings) who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, , is Sanat Kumara's violet flame supplier. The violet flame is composed of a special type of etheric matter particles, which may plausibly be called \"violetrons\", that are capable of cleansing bad karma. \"Omri-Tas\" rules a planet on the etheric plane called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred light years from Earth. The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame. Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the Great Central Sun of the Cosmos via the Galactic Logos to planets in Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy). Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the \"Temple of the Violet Flame\" in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.\n\nBenjamin Creme subscribes to the modern esoteric view that Nordic aliens (like those mentioned by George Adamski – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot flying saucers from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the etheric plane (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the \"etheric plane\", the planet's heat doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the physical plane. Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer? Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where crop circles appear. Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an astrodrome as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus. Since Shamballa is envisioned as a floating city about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped mother ships up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus. According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from Mars, the Moons of Jupiter, Uranus, Sirius, the Pleiades, and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa. Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the Martians (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars), whom he describes as the \"master engineers of the solar system\", Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.\n\nThe Master Ashtar was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by Joshua David Stone in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium Tuella into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the Master Jesus, under his galactic name Sananda (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with Commander Ashtar, flying with Pallas Athena in their own flying saucer within the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet as its \"Commander-in-Chief\". According to Stone, another name used by \"Commander Ashtar\" to denote his flying saucer fleet is \"The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood\". Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions. Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.\n\nAccording to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity Astarte/Ishtar/Isis and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the Satanic forces, then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The Son of God'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.\n\nLourene Altiery, also known as \"Karita\" to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from Joliet, Illinois who now resides in Sun Lakes, Arizona – she set up her website in 2001. According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the Spiritual Hierarchy Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa. These are the Masters Ballerian, who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called \"God's Garage\"; Kumad, an expert linguist who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; Ashlem, a Tibetan Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the Akashic records; and Sutko, the \"space detective\", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases. Elements of the \"Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet\" sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on 'shore leave'.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of Rapid City, South Dakota, who began teaching in 1990, Hatonn, an android Pleiadean Master who flies aboard the flying saucer \"Phoenix\" (one of the flying saucers of the \"Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet\", piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master Soltec), monitors events on Earth for the \"Galactic Hall of Records\" at the galactic core.\n\nHe feeds information about events on Earth via subspace relay to the supercomputers at the \"Galactic Hall of Records\". However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the liaison officer between Sanat Kumara and the Pleiadeans in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in 2012 through the approaching so-called \"photon belt\", said to emanate from the Pleiades.\n\nAccording to many Christians, notably the anti-New Age author Constance Cumbey, New Age Leaders, including Masters of the Illuminati, are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, \"Externalisation of the Hierarchy\", p. 676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, \"The Secret of the Illuminati\", p. 1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the \"life and the forming intelligence\", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (\"The New Age Dictionary\", p. 172) Further, Sanat Kumara is \"the eternal youth from the Planet Venus\". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for Satan or Lucifer. (Cumbey, \"Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow\") [7].\n\nOther New Age leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.\n\nIn the glossary of in the back of the book \"Alchemy\", which Elizabeth Clare Prophet claims was dictated to her by Kuthumi, Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.\n\nThe scholar K. Paul Johnson maintains that the \"Masters\" that Madame Blavatsky wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors. However, \"Sanat Kumara\", although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important \"Master\" that Blavatsky claimed to have met. He was first presented, under the name \"Lord of the World\", as the head of the \"Masters\" by C.W. Leadbeater in his 1925 book \"The Masters and the Path\".\n\nPanelology\nVideo games\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37056", "title": "Sexual revolution", "text": "Sexual revolution\n\nThe sexual revolution, also known as a time of sexual liberation, was a social movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and interpersonal relationships throughout the United States and subsequently, the wider world, from the 1960s to the 1980s. Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of sex outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships (primarily marriage). The normalization of contraception and the pill, public nudity, pornography, premarital sex, homosexuality, and alternative forms of sexuality, and the legalization of abortion all followed.\n\nThe term \"sexual revolution\" has been used since at least the late 1920s. Some early commentators believed the period of 1960–1980 was in fact the second such revolution in America, with the first during the Roaring Twenties after World War I. Indicators of non-traditional sexual behavior (e.g., gonorrhea incidence, births out of wedlock, and births to teenagers) began to rise dramatically in the mid to late 1950s. It brought about profound shifts in attitudes toward women's sexuality, homosexuality, pre-marital sexuality, and the freedom of sexual expression.\n\nPsychologists and scientists such as Wilhelm Reich and Alfred Kinsey influenced the changes. As well, changing mores were both stimulated by and reflected in literature and films, and by the social movements of the period, including the counterculture, the women's movement, and the gay rights movement. The counterculture contributed to the awareness of radical cultural change that was the social matrix of the sexual revolution.\n\nThe sexual revolution was initiated by those who shared a belief in the detrimental impact of sexual repression, a view that had previously been argued by Wilhelm Reich, D. H. Lawrence, Sigmund Freud, and the Surrealist movement. \n\nThe counterculture wanted to explore the body and mind, and free the personal self from the moral and legal sexual confines of modern America, as well as from 1940s-50s morals in general. The sexual revolution of the 1960s was grew from a conviction that the erotic should be celebrated as a normal part of life and not repressed by family, industrialized sexual morality, religion and the state.\n\nThe development of the birth control pill in 1960 gave women access to easy and reliable contraception. Another likely cause was a vast improvement in obstetrics, greatly reducing the number of women who died due to childbearing, thus increasing the life expectancy of women. A third, more indirect cause was the large number of children born in the 1940s and early 1950s all over the western world—the 'Baby Boom Generation'--many of whom would grow up in relatively prosperous and safe conditions, within a middle class on the rise and with better access to education and entertainment than ever before. By their demographic weight and their social and educational background they came to trigger a shift in society towards more permissive and informalized attitudes.\n\nThe discovery of penicillin led to significant reductions in syphilis mortality, which, in turn, spurred an increase in non-traditional sex during the mid to late 1950s.\n\nThere was an increase in sexual encounters between unmarried adults. Divorce rates were dramatically increasing and marriage rates were significantly decreasing in this time period. The number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 4.3 million in 1960 to 9.7 million in 1976. Men and women sought to reshape marriage by instilling new institutions of open marriage, mate swapping, swinging, and communal sex. \n\nSigmund Freud of Vienna believed human behavior was motivated by unconscious drives, primarily by the libido or \"Sexual Energy\". Freud proposed to study how these unconscious drives were repressed and found expression through other cultural outlets. He called this therapy \"psychoanalysis\".\n\nWhile Freud's ideas were sometimes ignored or provoked resistance within Viennese society, his ideas soon entered the discussions and working methods of anthropologists, artists and writers all over Europe, and from the 1920s in the United States. His conception of a primary sexual drive that would not be ultimately curbed by law, education or standards of decorum spelled a serious challenge to Victorian prudishness, and his theory of psychosexual development proposed a model for the development of sexual orientations and desires; children emerged from the Oedipus complex, a sexual desire towards their parent of the opposite sex. The idea of children having their parents as their early sexual targets was particularly shocking to Victorian and early 20th century society.\n\nAccording to Freud's theory, in the earliest stage of a child's psychosexual development, the oral stage, the mother's breast became the formative source of all later erotic sensation. Much of his research remains widely contested by professionals in the field, though it has spurred critical developments in the humanities.\n\nAnarchist Freud scholars Otto Gross and Wilhelm Reich (who famously coined the phrase \"Sexual Revolution\") developed a sociology of sex in the 1910s to 1930s in which the animal-like competitive reproductive behavior was seen as a legacy of ancestral human evolution reflecting in every social relation, as per the freudian interpretation, and hence the liberation of sexual behavior a mean to social revolution.\n\nThe publication of anthropologist Margaret Mead's \"Coming of Age in Samoa\" brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Published in 1928, Mead's ethnography focused on the psychosexual development of Samoan adolescent children on the island of Samoa. She recorded that their adolescence was not in fact a time of \"storm and stress\" as Erikson's stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood. Mead called for a change in suppression of sexuality in America, and her work directly resulted in the advancement of the sexual revolution in the 1930s.\n\nMead's findings were later criticized by anthropologist Derek Freeman, who investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society.\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Alfred C. Kinsey published two surveys of modern sexual behaviour. In 1948 Alfred C. Kinsey and his co-workers, responding to a request by female students at Indiana University for more information on human sexual behavior, published the book \"Sexual behaviour in the Human Male\". They followed this five years later with \"Sexual behaviour in the Human Female\". These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.\n\nIt is said that public morality severely restricted open discussion of sexuality as a human characteristic, and specific sexual practices, especially sexual behaviours that did not lead to procreation. Kinsey's books contained studies about controversial topics such as the frequency of homosexuality, and the sexuality of minors aged two weeks to fourteen years. Scientists working for Kinsey reported data which led to the conclusion that people are capable of sexual stimulation from birth. Furthermore, Kinsey's method of researching sexuality differs significantly from today's methods. Kinsey would watch his research subjects engage in sexual intercourse, sometimes engaging with his subjects as well. He would also encourage his research team to do the same, and encouraged them to engage in intercourse with him, too.\n\nThese books laid the groundwork for Masters and Johnson's life work. A study called \"Human Sexual Response\" in 1966 revealed the nature and scope of the sexual practices of young Americans.\n\nIn 1953, Chicago resident Hugh Hefner founded Playboy, a magazine which aimed to target males between the ages of 21 and 45. The coverpage and nude centerfold in the first edition featured Marilyn Monroe, then a rising sex symbol. The pictures were taken when Monroe was an unknown struggling actress and she received $50 for the photo shoot. The photographs were published without her consent and she received no further compensation from Playboy. Featuring cartoons, interviews, short fiction, Hefner \"Playboy Philosophy\" and - most crucially - half-naked female \"Playmates\" posing provocatively, the magazine became immensely successful. In 1960, Hefner decided to expand his enterprise and opened the first Playboy Club in Chicago. The private clubs, which expanded in numbers throughout the 1960s, offered relaxation for its members, who were waited on by Playboy Bunnies. While Hefner claimed his company contributed to America's more liberal attitude towards sex, others believe he simply exploited it.\n\nIn the United States in the years 1959 through 1966, bans on three books with explicit erotic content were challenged and overturned. This also occurred in the United Kingdom starting with the 1959 Obscene Publications Act and reaching a peak with the LCL court case.\n\nPrior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, the United States Customs Service banned James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" by refusing to allow it to be imported into the United States. The Roman Catholic Church's \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston's Watch and Ward Society, a largely Protestant creation inspired by Anthony Comstock, made \"banned in Boston\" a national by-word.\n\nIn 1959 Grove Press published an unexpurgated version of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" by D. H. Lawrence. The U.S. Post Office confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer Charles Rembar sued the New York City Postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal.\n\nHenry Miller's 1934 novel, \"Tropic of Cancer\", had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the Obelisk Press in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. (, used book dealers asked $7,500 and more for copies of this edition.) In 1961 Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and dozens of booksellers were sued for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1964 decision in \"Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein\".\n\nIn 1963 Putnam published John Cleland's 1750 novel \"Fanny Hill\". This was the turning point, because Charles Rembar appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and won. In \"Memoirs v. Massachusetts\", 383 U.S. 413, the court ruled that sex was \"a great and mysterious motive force in human life\", and that its expression in literature was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nOnly books primarily appealing to \"prurient interest\" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is \"utterly without redeeming social importance\"—meaning that, conversely, any work with redeeming social importance was not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could \"deprave and corrupt\" some readers. This decision was especially significant, because, of the three books mentioned, \"Fanny Hill\" has by far the largest measure of content that seems to appeal to prurient interest, and the smallest measures of literary merit and \"redeeming social importance\". Whereas an expurgated version of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" had actually once been published, no expurgated version of \"Fanny Hill\" had ever been. By permitting the publication of \"Fanny Hill\", the U.S. Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966 decision \"the end of obscenity\".\n\nThe court decisions that legalised the publication of \"Fanny Hill\" had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear more often.\n\nIn 1962, Helen Gurley Brown published \"Sex and the Single Girl: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.\" The title itself would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. (In 1965 she went on to transform \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine into a life manual for young career women.)\n\nIn 1969 Joan Garrity, identifying herself only as \"J.\", published \"The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman\", with information on exercises to improve the dexterity of one's tongue and how to have anal sex.\n\nThe same year saw the appearance of Dr. David Reuben's book \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)\". Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone.\n\nIn 1970 the Boston Women's Health Collective published \"Women and Their Bodies\" (which became far better known a year later under its subsequent title \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\"). Not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book nevertheless included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.\n\nAlex Comfort's \"The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making\" appeared in 1972. In later editions though, Comfort's libertinism was tamed as a response to AIDS.\n\nIn 1975 Will McBride's \"Zeig Mal!\" (Show Me!), written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their sexuality, it scandalised others and eventually it was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. It was followed in 1989 by \"Zeig Mal Mehr!\" (\"Show Me More!\").\n\nThese books had a number of things in common. They were factual and, in fact, educational. They were available to a mainstream readership. They were stacked high on the tables of discount bookstores, they were book club selections, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. People were seen reading them in public.\n\nEarlier books such as \"What Every Girl Should Know\" (Margaret Sanger, 1920) and \"A Marriage Manual\" (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the silence in which many people, women in particular, had grown up in.\n\nBy the 1950s, in the United States, it had become rare for women to go into their wedding nights not knowing what to expect. But the open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was revolutionary. There were practices which, perhaps, some had heard of. But many adults did not know for sure whether they were realities, or fantasies found only in pornographic books.\n\nThe Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980 book by Dr. Irene Kassorla, that \"Nice Girls Do — And Now You Can Too\".\n\nTelevision, the new mass communication device of the age, along with other media outlets such as radio and magazines, could broadcast information in a matter of seconds to millions of people, while only a few wealthy people would control what millions could watch. Some modern historians have theorized that these media outlets helped to spread new ideas, which were considered radical. The struggles, skirmishes and rhetorical confrontations happening in the course of these movements also became directly visible to ordinary people in a way they would never have been before; the sense of involvement in a social and sexual shift happening in the present could rapidly win new converts and spread discussions afield. The counterculture of the 1960s was becoming well known through radio, newspapers, TV, books, music and other media by the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1969, \"Blue Movie\", directed by Andy Warhol, was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. The film helped inaugurate the \"porno chic\" phenomenon in modern American culture. According to Warhol, \"Blue Movie\" was a major influence in the making of \"Last Tango in Paris\", starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after \"Blue Movie\" was made.\n\nIn 1970, \"Mona the Virgin Nymph\" became the second film to gain wide release. The third, \"Deep Throat\", despite being rudimentary by the standards of mainstream filmmaking, achieved major box office success, following mentions by Johnny Carson on \"The Tonight Show\", and Bob Hope on television as well. In 1973, the far-more-accomplished (though still low-budget) \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" was the seventh-most-successful film of the year, and was well-received by major media, including a favorable review by film critic Roger Ebert. \n\nIn 1976, \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\" (based on the play \"Pygmalion\" by George Bernard Shaw) was released theatrically and is considered by Toni Bentley the \"crown jewel\" of \"the golden age of porn.\"\n\nBy the mid-1970s and through the 1980s, newly won sexual freedoms were being exploited by big businesses looking to capitalize on an increasingly permissive society, with the advent of public and hardcore pornography. \n\nThe Industrial Revolution during the nineteenth century and the growth of science and technology, medicine and health care, resulted in better contraceptives being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of rubber made possible the design and production of condoms that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent pregnancy at little cost. Advances in chemistry, pharmacology, and biology, and human physiology led to the discovery and perfection of the first oral contraceptives, popularly known as \"the Pill.\" \n\nAll these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in world literacy and decline in religious observance. Old values such as the biblical notion of \"be fruitful and multiply\" were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the lifestyles of progressive modernizing cultures.\n\nAnother contribution that helped bring about this modern revolution of sexual freedom were the writings of Herbert Marcuse and Wilhelm Reich, who took the philosophy of Karl Marx and similar philosophers.\n\nWhen speaking of sexual revolution, historians make a distinction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution (1870–1910), to caucasians, Victorian morality lost its universal appeal. However, it did not lead to the rise of a \"permissive society\". Exemplary for this period is the rise and differentiation in forms of regulating sexuality.\n\n\"No-fault\" unilateral divorce became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.\n\nThe women's movement redefined sexuality, not in terms of simply pleasing men but recognizing women's sexual satisfaction and sexual desire. \"The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm\" by Anne Koedt illustrates an understanding of a women's sexual anatomy, arguing against Freud's \"assumptions of women as inferior appendage to man, and her consequent social and psychological role.\" The women's movement was able to develop lesbian feminism, freedom from heterosexual act, and freedom from reproduction. Feminist Betty Friedan published the Feminine Mystique in 1963, concerning the many frustrations women had with their lives and with separate spheres which established a pattern of inequality.\nThe Gay Rights Movement started when the Stonewall Riots of 1969 crystallized a broad grass-roots mobilization. New gay liberationist gave political meaning to \"coming out\" by extending the psychological-personal process into public life. During the 1950s the most feared thing of the homosexual culture was \"coming out\", the homosexual culture of the 1950s did everything they could to help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey's research on homosexuality alleged that 39% of the unmarried male population had had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age. The \"coming out\" phenomenon helped mobilize people to live full-time as a homosexual, they no longer had to live in secret. They no longer had to sneak around and occasionally receive the sexual attention that they desire or force themselves into a heterosexual relationship in which they had no interest, and was full of lies. Brad Gooch wrote in the \"Golden Age of Promiscuity\" that the gay male community finally had reached a rich culture of \"easy sex\", sex without commitment, obligation or long-term relationships.\n\nCoinciding with second-wave feminism and the women's liberation movement initiated in the early 1960s, the sexual liberation movement was aided by feminist ideologues in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding female sexuality and queer sexuality. Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women as well as support for women's right to choose her sexual partners free of outside interference or judgement were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective. Since during the early stages of feminism, women's liberation was often equated with sexual liberation rather than associated with it. Many feminist thinkers believed that assertion of the primacy of sexuality would be a major step towards the ultimate goal of women's liberation, thus women were urged to initiate sexual advances, enjoy sex and experiment with new forms of sexuality.\n\nThe feminist movements insisted and focused on the sexual liberation for women, both physical and psychological. The pursuit of sexual pleasure for women was the core ideology, which subsequently was to set the foundation for female independence. Although whether or not sexual freedom should be a feminist issue is currently a much-debated topic, the feminist movement overtly defines itself as the movement for social, political, and economic equality of men and women. Feminist movements are also involved the fight against sexism and since sexism is a highly complex notion, it is difficult to separate the feminist critique toward sexism from its fight against sexual oppression.\n\nThe feminist movement has helped create a social climate in which LGBT people and women are increasingly able to be open and free with their sexuality, which enabled a spiritual liberation of sorts with regards to sex. Rather than being forced to hide their sexual desires or feelings, women and LGBT people have gained and continue to gain increased freedom in this area. Consequently, the feminist movement to end sexual oppression has and continues to directly contribute to the sexual liberation movement.\n\nNevertheless, among many feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on monogamy, had been largely gained by men at women's expense. In \"[Anticlimax (book)|[Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]\", Sheila Jeffreys asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, feminist sex wars broke out due to disagreements on pornography, on prostitution, and on BDSM, as well as sexuality in general.\nAs birth control became widely accessible, men and women began to have more choice in the matter of having children than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable latex condoms for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the Comstock laws in 1936 set the stage for promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the diaphragm and cervical cap; the 1960s introduction of the IUD and oral contraceptives for women gave a sense of freedom from barrier contraception. The opposition of Churches (e.g. \"Humanae vitae\") led to parallel movements of secularization and exile from religion. Women gained much greater access to birth control in the \"girls world\" decision in 1965, in the 1960s and 1970s the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments.\n\nInfluenced by and exposed to the revolution in America, the UK had a similar, though smaller experience.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the new generation growing up after World War II had grown tired of the rationing and austerity of the 1940s and 1950s and the Victorian values of their elders, so the 1960s were a time of rebellion against the fashions and social mores of the previous generation.\n\nAn early inkling of changing attitudes came in 1960, when the government of the day tried unsuccessfully to prosecute Penguin Books for obscenity, for publishing the D. H. Lawrence novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\", which had been banned since the 1920s for what was considered racy content. The prosecution counsel Mervyn Griffith-Jones famously stood in front of the jury and asked, in his closing statement: \"Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?\" When the case collapsed, the novel went on to become a bestseller, selling two million copies.\n\nThe Pill became available free of charge on the National Health Service in the 1960s, at first restricted to married women, but in 1968 its availability was extended to all women.\n\nIn 1967, laws prohibiting abortion and male homosexuality were repealed, although the age of consent for homosexual men was set at 21, in contrast to the heterosexual age of consent of 16. This is how it stayed until 1994, when the male homosexual age of consent was lowered to 18, and then equalised at 16 in 2001. Also in 2001, lesbian sex was recognised in British law for the first time ever, with an age of consent of 16.\n\nBeginning in San Francisco in the mid-1960s, a new culture of \"free love\" emerged, with thousands of young people becoming \"hippies\", inspired by Indian culture, who preached the power of love and the beauty of sex as part of ordinary life. This is part of a counterculture that continues to exist. By the 1970s, it was socially acceptable for colleges to permit co-ed housing.\n\nFree love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations ended abruptly (or at least disappeared from public view) in the mid-1980s when the public first became aware of AIDS, a deadly sexually-transmitted disease.\n\nSwedish filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Vilgot Sjöman contributed to sexual liberation with sexually themed films that challenged conservative international standards. The 1951 film \"Hon dansade en sommar\" (\"She Danced One Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness\") (directed by Arne Mattsson) starring Ulla Jacobsson and Folke Sundquist was notable in this regard for depicting explicit nudity, including nude bathing in a lake.\n\nThis film, as well as Bergman's \"Sommaren med Monika\" (\"The Summer with Monika\", 1951) and \"Tystnaden (The Silence\", 1963), caused an international uproar, not least in the United States, where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sjöman's film \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\", also created waves of international outcry, but it was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, \"491\", highlighted homosexuality among other things. \"Kärlekens språk\" (\"The Language of Love\") was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film, and inevitably it caused intense debate around the world.\n\nFrom these films the concept (or catchphrase) of \"Swedish sin\" (licentiousness and seductive nudity) developed, even though Swedish society in the 1950s was still fairly conservative regarding sex, and the international concept of Swedish sexuality was and is largely exaggerated. The image of \"hot love and cold people\" emerged. Sexual liberalism was seen as part of the modernization process that, by breaking down traditional borders, would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires. These films caused debate there as well. The films eventually progressed the public's attitude toward sex, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others. In Sweden and nearby countries at the time, these films, by virtue of being made by directors who had established themselves as leading names in their generation, helped delegitimize the idea of habitually demanding that films should avoid overtly sexual subject matter. It proved hard to question the seriousness of purpose of Bergman, Sjöman and others, and in their wake a consciously permissive and questioning attitude to sex, nudity and \"difficult\" subject matter in film - and on TV - became the new standard framework.\n\nExplicit sex on screen and frontal nudity of men and women on stage became acceptable in many Western countries, as the twentieth century drew towards its close. Special places of entertainment offering striptease and lap dancing proliferated, and limits to 'acceptable' dress in pop/rock music and at discotheques and live music festivals, especially open-air festivals ever since the flower-power generation and Woodstock (1969), became very vague, both among performers and in the audiences or attendee crowd. The rich use of crossdressing and androgynous attributes and clothes in rock and pop stage costumes and even references to this in song lyrics, to express sexual, fashion or literary themes is also notable, from the Velvet Underground (in Lou Reed's lyrics) and the glam rock wave and onward. All of this persists in the early 21st century.\n\nIn many Western countries, nudity is used as a part of artistic or erotic performance, such as in nude body painting, sex show, striptease, Neo-Burlesque, and in adult-only public events like Folsom Street Fair, Nudes-A-Poppin', Fantasy Fest, etc.\n\nSexual character is closely linked with developments in technology, and the somewhat more open and commercial circulation of pornography was a new phenomenon at the time of the sexual revolution. Pornography operated as a form of \"cultural critique\" insofar as it transgresses societal conventions. Manuel Castells claims that the online communities, which emerged (from the 1980s) around early bulletin board systems originated from the ranks of those who had been part of the counterculture movements and alternative way of life emerging out of the sexual revolution.\n\nLynn Hunt points out that early modern \"pornography\" (18th century) is marked by a \"preponderance of female narrators\", that the women were portrayed as independent, determined, financially successful (though not always socially successful and recognized) and scornful of the new ideals of female virtue and domesticity, and not objectifications of women's bodies as many view pornography today. The sexual revolution was not unprecedented in identifying sex as a site of political potential and social culture. It was suggested during the sexual revolution that the interchangeability of bodies within pornography had radical implications for gender differences and that they could lose their meaning or at least redefine the meaning of gender roles and norms. Porn had portrayed sexual activity honestly and bluntly in fiction, on stage and in movies. It could reinforce the crudest stereotypes of sex roles, standards of beauty, and power dynamics or educate about human desire.\n\nIn 1971 \"Playboy\" stopped airbrushing pubic hair out of its centerfold picture spreads; this new addition caused the magazine to hit its all-time peak circulation of more than seven million copies in 1972 and men started having more choices when it came to magazines.\n\nIn 1972 \"Deep Throat\" became a popular movie for heterosexual couples. The movie played all over America and was the first porn movie to earn a gross of a million dollars.\n\nThe fact that pornography was less stigmatised by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted sexual intercourse as entertainment, was indicative of how normalised sexual revolution had become in society. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular \"Playboy\" and \"Penthouse\" magazines, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures felt safe expressing their fantasies.\n\nFeminists have offered mixed responses to pornography. Some figures in the feminist movement, such as Andrea Dworkin, challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic or \"urban men's\" magazines. Other feminists such as Betty Dodson went on to found the pro-sex feminist movement in response to anti-pornography campaigns.\nIn India, an organization named Indians For Sexual Liberties is advocating the legalization of the porn business in India. The organization's founder, Laxman Singh, questioned the reasoning behind deeming as illegal the depiction of legal acts.\n\nPremarital sex, which had been heavily stigmatised for some time became more widely accepted during the sexual revolution. The increased availability of birth control (and the quasi-legalisation of abortion in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children. By the mid-1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.\n\nThe central part of the sexual revolution was the development of relationships between unmarried adults, which resulted in earlier sexual experimentation reinforced by a later age of marriage. The counterculture and the new left were the source of this later age of marriage. Americans were attending colleges and rebelling against their parents' ideals, which caused them to marry later in age, if at all. This meant that on average, Americans were becoming more sexually experienced before they entered into monogamous relationships. The increasing divorce rate and the decreasing stigma attached to divorce during this era also contributed to sexual experimentation. By 1971, more than 75% of Americans thought that premarital sex was okay, a threefold increase from the 1950s, and the number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 1960 to 1976. Americans were becoming less and less interested in getting married and settling down and less interested in monogamous relationships. In 1971, 35% of the country said they thought marriage was obsolete.\n\nThe idea of marriage being out-of-date came from the new development of casual sex between Americans. With the development of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion in 1973, there was little threat of unwanted children out of wedlock. Also, during this time every sexually transmitted disease was treatable; there was no incurable bacterial STDs, no AIDS.\n\nSwinger clubs were organizing in places ranging from the informal suburban home to disco-sized emporiums that promised a smorgasbord of sexual possibilities and free mouthwash. In New York City in 1977, Larry Levenson opened Plato's Retreat it was probably the closest that heterosexual America has ever gotten to the sexual frenzy of gay bathhouses. The retreat was eventually shut down in 1985 because of the constant hassle from public health authorities.\n\nPolitics in the United States has become intertwined with sexually related issues, called the \"politics of sex\". A differing view of abortion pitted pro-life activists against pro-choice activists.\n\nWomen and men who lived with each other without marriage sought \"palimony\" equal to the alimony. Teenagers assumed their right to a sexual life with whomever they pleased, and bathers fought to be topless or nude at beaches.\n\nFraenkel (1992) believes that the \"sexual revolution\", that the West supposedly experienced in the late 1960s, is indeed a misconception and that sex is not actually enjoyed freely, it is just observed in all the fields of culture; that is a kind of taboo behavior technically called \"repressive desublimation\".\n\nAmong radical feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on monogamy, had been largely gained by men at women's expense. In \"\", Sheila Jeffreys asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, feminist sex wars broke out due to disagreements on pornography, on prostitution, and on BDSM, as well as sexuality in general.\n\nAllyn argues that the sexual optimism of the 1960s waned with the economic crises of the 1970s, the massive commercialization of sex, increasing reports of child exploitation, disillusionment with the counter-culture and the New Left, and a combined left-right backlash against sexual liberation as an ideal. The discovery of herpes escalated anxieties rapidly and set the stage for the nation's panicked response to AIDS.\n\nAlthough the rate of teenage sexual activity is hard to record, the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in developed nations such as Canada and the UK have seen a steady decline since the 1990s. For example, in 1991 there were 61.8 children born per 1,000 teenage girls in the United States. By 2013, this number had declined to 26.6 births per 1,000 teenage girls.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2943008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2943008", "title": "Social alienation", "text": "Social alienation\n\nSocial alienation is \"a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of integration or common values and a high degree of distance or isolation between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment\". It is a sociological concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists. The concept has many discipline-specific uses, and can refer both to a personal psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social relationship (objectively).\n\nThe term \"alienation\" has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings. In ancient history it could mean a metaphysical sense of achieving a higher state of contemplation, ecstasy or union—becoming alienated from a limited existence in the world, in a positive sense. Examples of this usage have been traced to neoplatonic philosophers such as Plotinus (in the Greek \"alloiosis\"). There have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from God and the faithful, alienated in a negative sense. The New Testament mentions the term \"apallotrioomai\" in Greek—\"being alienated from\". Ideas of estrangement from a Golden Age, or due to a fall of man, or approximate equivalents in differing cultures or religions, have also been described as concepts of alienation. A double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as Gnosticism.\n\nAlienation has also had a particular legal-political meaning since at least Ancient Roman times, where to alienate property (\"alienato\") is to transfer ownership of it to someone else. The term alienation itself comes from the Latin \"alienus\" which meant 'of another place or person', which in turn came from \"alius\", meaning \"other\" or \"another\". An alienus in ancient Roman times could refer to someone else's slave. Another usage of the term in Ancient Greco-Roman times was by physicians referring to disturbed, difficult or abnormal states of mind, generally attributed to imbalanced physiology. In Latin \"alienatio mentis\" (mental alienation), this usage has been dated to Asclepiades. Once translations of such works had resurfaced in the West in the 17th century, physicians again began using the term, which is typically attributed to Felix Platter.\n\nIn medieval times, a relationship between alienation and social order has been described, mediated in part by mysticism and monasticism. The Crusades and witch-hunts have been described as forms of mass alienation.\n\nIn the 17th century, Hugo Grotius put forward the concept that everyone has 'sovereign authority' over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good, an early social contract theory. In the 18th century, Hutcheson introduced a distinction between alienable and unalienable rights in the legal sense of the term. Rousseau published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a state of nature due to the expansion of civil society or the nation state.\n\nIn the same century a law of alienation of affection was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away 'their' woman.\n\nIn the history of literature, the German Romantics appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found. Around the start of the 19th century, Hegel popularized a Christian (Lutheran) and Idealist philosophy of alienation. He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the self was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived objective world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good.\n\nAround the same time, Pinel was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his 'medical-philosophical treatise'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his 'moral treatment' approach, and developed related theories. Nevertheless, as Foucault would later write, \"... in an obscure, shared origin, the 'alienation' of physicians and the 'alienation' of philosophers started to take shape—two configurations in which man in any case corrupts his truth, but between which, after Hegel, the nineteenth century stopped seeing any trace of resemblance.\"\n\nTwo camps formed following Hegel, the 'young' or 'left' Hegelians who developed his philosophy to support innovations in politics or religion, and the 'old' or 'right' Hegelians who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously conservative direction. The former camp has had a more lasting influence and, among them, Feuerbach differed from Hegel in arguing that worship of God is itself a form of alienation, because it projects human qualities on to an external idea, rather than realising them as part of the self.\n\nMarx was initially in the Young Hegelian camp and, like Feuerbach, rejected the spiritual basis, and adapted Hegel's dialectic model to a theory of (historical) materialism. Marx's theory of alienation is articulated most clearly in the \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844\" and \"The German Ideology\" (1846). The 'young' Marx wrote more often and directly of alienation than the 'mature' Marx, which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central. There is generally held to be a transition from a philosophical-anthropological (Marxist humanism) concept (e.g. internal alienation from the self) to a structural-historical interpretation (e.g. external alienation by appropriation of labor), accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to exploitation to commodity fetishism and reification. Marx's concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by Kostas Axelos: economic and social alienation, political alienation, human alienation, and ideological alienation.\n\nIn the concept's most prominent use, it refers to the \"economic and social alienation\" aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce. Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Essentially, there is an \"exploitation of men by men\" where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy (Axelos, 1976: 58). His theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging industrial production under capitalism, workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work. Workers never become autonomous, self-realized human beings in any significant sense, except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized. His theory relies on Feuerbach's \"The Essence of Christianity\" (1841), which argues that the idea of God has alienated the characteristics of the human being. Stirner would take the analysis further in \"The Ego and Its Own\" (1844), declaring that even 'humanity' is an alienating ideal for the individual, to which Marx and Engels responded in \"The German Ideology\" (1845). Alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in work each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned, for which each individual functions as an instrument, not as a social being. Kostas Axelos summarizes that for Marx, in capitalism \"work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products.\" \"The malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy...The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work he feels outside himself...Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is avoided like the plague.\". Marx also wrote, in a curtailed manner, that capitalist owners also experience alienation, through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing, exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society.\n\nThe idea of \"Political Alienation\" refers to the idea that \"politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy\" in a way that is alienating because it \"distorts the logic of economic development\".\n\nIn \"Human Alienation\", individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive, where \"they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence\" (Axelos, 1976: 111). Marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls \"historical conditions.\" The first aspect refers to the necessity of food, clothes, shelter, and more. Secondly, Marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more \"needs\" or desires that they will work towards satisfying, hence, humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other.\n\nWhen referring to \"ideological alienation\", Axelos proposes that Marx believes that all religions divert people away from \"their true happiness\" and instead turn them towards \"illusory happiness\".\n\nThere is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word \"alienation\", and similar words such as \"estrangement\", are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, \"\" and \"\". The former means specifically interpersonal estrangement, while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization, relinquishment, or sale (alienation) of property. In general, and contrary to his predecessors, Marx may have used the terms interchangeably, though he also wrote \"\"Entfremdung\"...constitutes the real interest of this \"Entäußerung\".\"\n\nMany sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization. German sociologists Georg Simmel and Ferdinand Tönnies wrote critical works on individualization and urbanization. Simmel's \"The Philosophy of Money\" describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money. Tönnies' \"Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft\" (\"Community and Society\") is about the loss of primary relationships such as familial bonds in favour of goal-oriented, secondary relationships. This idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts, although the term may not be as frequently used. In the context of an individual's relationships within society, alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society. When collective decisions are made, it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account.\n\nThe American sociologist C. Wright Mills conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with \"\" in 1951, describing how modern consumption-capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work. Melvin Seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid-20th century when he published his paper, \"On the Meaning of Alienation\", in 1959 (Senekal, 2010b: 7–8). Seeman used the insights of Marx, Emile Durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement (Seeman, 1959). Seeman later added a sixth element (cultural estrangement), although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work.\n\nIn a broader philosophical context, especially in existentialism and phenomenology, alienation describes the inadequacy of the human being (or the mind) in relation to the world. The human mind (as the subject who perceives) sees the world as an object of perception, and is distanced from the world, rather than living within it. This line of thought is generally traced to the works of Søren Kierkegaard in the 19th century, who, from a Christian viewpoint, saw alienation as separation from God, and also examined the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with life choices. Many 20th-century philosophers (both theistic and atheistic) and theologians were influenced by Kierkegaard's notions of angst, despair and the importance of the individual. Martin Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (angst) and mortality drew from Kierkegaard; he is indebted to the way Kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one's being-in-the-world. Jean-Paul Sartre described the \"thing-in-itself\" which is infinite and overflowing, and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing-in-itself is \"reflective consciousness\". Since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, Sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety (i.e. the human condition). As well, Sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the \"Other\" (meaning beings or objects that are not the self), their self-consciousness has a \"masochistic desire\" to be limited. This is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play \"No Exit\", \"Hell is other people\".\n\nIn the theory of psychoanalysis developed around the start of the 20th century, Sigmund Freud did not explicitly address the concept of alienation, but other analysts subsequently have. It is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and unconscious mind, between different parts of a hypothetical psychic apparatus, and between the self and civilization. It postulates defense mechanisms, including splitting, in both normal and disturbed functioning. The concept of repression has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of false consciousness associated with Marxist theory.\n\nA form of Western Marxism developed during the century, which included influential analyses of false consciousness by György Lukács. Critics of bureaucracy and the Protestant Ethic also drew on the works of Max Weber.\n\nFigures associated with critical theory, in particular with the Frankfurt School, such as Theodor Adorno and Erich Fromm, also developed theories of alienation, drawing on neo-Marxist ideas as well as other influences including neo-Freudian and sociological theories. One approach applies Marxist theories of commodification to the cultural, educational and party-political spheres. Links are drawn between socioeconomic structures, psychological states of alienation, and personal human relationships. In the 1960s the revolutionary group Situationist International came to some prominence, staging 'situations' intended to highlight an alternative way of life to advanced capitalism, the latter conceptualized as a diffuse 'spectacle', a fake reality masking a degradation of human life. The Theory of Communicative Action associated with Jürgen Habermas emphasizes the essential role of language in public life, suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of market forces and state power.\n\nThis critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context, or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms, and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust.\n\nAfter the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s, interest in alienation research subsided (Geyer, 1996: xii), although in sociology it was maintained by the Research Committee on Alienation of the International Sociological Association (ISA). In the 1990s, there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the Soviet Union, globalization, the information explosion, increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts, and post-modernism (see Geyer, 1996). Geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post-modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment. In late 20th and early 21st century sociology, it has been particularly the works of Felix Geyer, Lauren Langman and Devorah Kalekin-Fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world.\n\nAlienation in the sense of a lack of power has been technically defined by Seeman as \"the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks.\" Seeman argues that this is \"the notion of alienation as it originated in the Marxian view of the worker's condition in capitalist society: the worker is alienated to the extent that the prerogative and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs\". More succinctly, Kalekin-Fishman (1996: 97) says, \"A person suffers from alienation in the form of 'powerlessness' when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing\".\n\nIn discussing powerlessness, Seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist Julian Rotter. Rotter distinguishes between internal control and external locus of control, which means \"differences (among persons or situations) in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors (e.g. luck, chance, or powerful others), as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one's personal skills or characteristics\". Powerlessness, therefore, is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals.\n\nMore recently, Geyer remarks that \"a new type of powerlessness has emerged, where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an overchoice of alternatives for action, whose consequences one often cannot even fathom\". Geyer adapts cybernetics to alienation theory, and writes (1996: xxiv) that powerlessness is the result of delayed feedback: \"The more complex one's environment, the later one is confronted with the latent, and often unintended, consequences of one's actions. Consequently, in view of this causality-obscuring time lag, both the 'rewards' and 'punishments' for one's actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random, often with apathy and alienation as a result\".\n\nA sense of meaning has been defined by Seeman as \"the individual's sense of understanding events in which he is engaged\". Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness \"is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made.\" Whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes, this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes. In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to powerlessness; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, \"the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)\".\n\nGeyer (1996: xxiii) believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times: \"With the accelerating throughput of information [...] meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information, but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal-relevant information one needs, as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need, but is bombarded with on a regular basis.\" \"Information overload\" or the so-called \"data tsunami\" are well-known information problems confronting contemporary man, and Geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head.\n\nNormlessness (or what Durkheim referred to as anomie) \"denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour\". This aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather, with what are perceived to be the dominant values of society. Seeman (1959: 788) adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner, \"The anomic situation [...] may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals\". This negative manifestation is dealt with in detail by Catherine Ross and John Mirowski in a series of publications on mistrust, powerlessness, normlessness and crime.\n\nNeal & Collas (2000: 122) write, \"Normlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms. Sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions, and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct\". This is a particular issue after the fall of the Soviet Union, mass migrations from developing to developed countries, and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s (Senekal, 2011). Traditional values that had already been questioned (especially during the 1960s) were met with further scepticism in the 1990s, resulting in a situation where individuals rely more often on their own judgement than on institutions of authority: \"The individual not only has become more independent of the churches, but from other social institutions as well. The individual can make more personal choices in far more life situations than before\" (Halman, 1998: 100). These choices are not necessarily \"negative\": Halman's study found that Europeans remain relatively conservative morally, even though the authority of the Church and other institutions has eroded.\n\nOne concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of parental alienation, where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have divorced or separated). The term is not applied where there is child abuse. The parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the social dynamics of the family as a whole. It can also be understood in terms of attachment, the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver. Adoptees can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents.\n\nFamilial estrangement between parents and adult children \"is attributed to a number of biological, psychological, social, and structural factors affecting the family, including attachment disorders, incompatible values and beliefs, unfulfilled expectations, critical life events and transitions, parental alienation, and ineffective communication patterns.\" The degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma.\n\nAttachment relationships in adults can also involve feelings of alienation. Indeed, emotional alienation is said to be a common way of life for many, whether it is experienced as overwhelming, or is not admitted to in the midst of a socioeconomic race, or contributes to seemingly unrelated problems.\n\nSocial isolation refers to \"The feeling of being segregated from one's community\". Neal and Collas (2000: 114) emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world: \"While social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress, its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world. With increased isolation and atomization, much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships.\"\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, migrants from Eastern Europe and the developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard. This has led to entire communities becoming uprooted: no longer fully part of their homelands, but neither integrated into their adopted communities. Diaspora literature depicts the plights of these migrants, such as Hafid Bouazza in Paravion. Senekal (2010b: 41) argues, \"Low-income communities or religious minorities may feel separated from mainstream society, leading to backlashes such as the civil unrest that occurred in French cities in October 2005. The fact that the riots subsequently spread to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland, illustrates that not only did these communities feel segregated from mainstream society, but also that they found a community in their isolation; they regarded themselves as kindred spirits\".\n\nBecause of intense group solidarity and unique daily hardships brought by combat, many veterans feel alienated from citizens, family, and friends when they return. They often feel they have little in common with civilian peers; issues that concern friends and family seem trivial after combat. There is a clarity of focus and purpose that comes with war that few in civilian life will ever know. Afghanistan veteran Brendon O'Byrne says, \"We were really close. Physically and emotionally close. It's kind of terrifying being in such an emotionally safe environment and then suddenly be expelled into an alienated, fractured society.\" The challenges of re-entering a civilian life where few people have experienced combat may contribute to the sense of loneliness. As filmmaker and war correspondent Sebastian Junger says, \"They didn't want to go back because it was traumatic, but because it was a place where they understood what they were supposed to do. They understood who they were. They had a sense of purpose. They were necessary. All these things that young people strive for are answered in combat.\" Veterans often see their wartime experience as the most selfless and meaningful period of their lives. Some veterans have expressed the sentiment that \"even in the quiet moments, war is brighter, louder, brasher, more fun, more tragic, more wasteful. More. More of everything.\"\n\nThe experience of the Vietnam veteran was distinctly different from that of veterans of other American wars. Once he completed his tour of duty, he usually severed all bonds with his unit and comrades. It was extremely rare for a veteran to write to his buddies who were still in combat, and (in strong contrast to the endless reunions of World War II veterans) for more than a decade it was even rarer for more than two or more of them to get together after the war. Korean War veterans had no memorial and precious few parades, but they fought an invading army and they left behind them the free, healthy, thriving, and grateful nation of South Korea. No one spat on them or called them murderers or baby killers when they returned. Only the veterans of Vietnam have endured a concerted, organized, psychological attack by its own people. Never in American history, perhaps never in all of Western civilization, has an army suffered such an agony from its own people. The Vietnam War was a long, contentious conflict (1955–75) which in the mid to late 1960s started to lose political and domestic support, most notably in academia and film that often portrayed soldiers of this conflict as ignoble adding to their social alienation. That the Vietnam War was ultimately lost on April 30, 1975, furthered the sense of meaninglessness and malaise. It has been demonstrated that as the perception of community alienation increases, an individual's sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation to socially engage.\n\nOne manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from, and a lack of engagement in, the political system. Such political alienation could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message, and could result in revolution, reforming behavior, or abstention from the political process, possibly due to voter apathy.\n\nA similar concept is policy alienation, where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a policy programme being implemented.\n\nSelf-estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology, as recognized by Seeman (1959), although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation. Some, with Marx, consider self-estrangement to be the end result and thus the heart of social alienation. Self-estrangement can be defined as \"the psychological state of denying one's own interests – of seeking out , activities...\". It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of self-knowledge, or authenticity.\n\nSeeman (1959) recognized the problems inherent in defining the \"self\", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely \"self\" constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: \"the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should be replaced by a conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness. On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional discourses themselves\". If the self is relationally constituted, does it make sense to speak of \"self-estrangement\" rather than \"social isolation\"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement \"has not weathered postmodern criticisms of essentialism and economic determinism well\", the concept still has value if a Lacanian reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the concept of self between humanism and antihumanism, structuralism and post-structuralism, or nature and nurture.\n\nUntil early in the 20th century, psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation, implying that a person had become separated from themselves, their reason or the world. From the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance, typically using a broad concept of a 'schizoid' ('splitting') process taken from psychoanalytic theory. The splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life, as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as schizoid personality and schizophrenia. Varied concepts of alienation and self-estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions, without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation. R. D. Laing was particularly influential in arguing that dysfunctional families and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and ontological insecurity in people, which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society.(Laing,[1967] 1959). The specific theories associated with Laing and others at that time are not widely accepted, but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme.\n\nIn a related vein, for Ian Parker, psychology \"normalizes\" conditions of social alienation. While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as critical psychology or liberation psychology, which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Similarly, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context. Slavoj Zizek (drawing on Herbert Marcuse, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to \"enjoy!\" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994).\n\nFrantz Fanon, an early writer on postcolonialism, studied the conditions of objectification and violent oppression (lack of autonomy) believed to have led to mental disorders among the colonized in the Third World (in particular Africans) (Fanon, ([2004] 1961).\n\nA process of 'malignant alienation' has been observed in regard to some psychiatric patients, especially in forensic units and for individuals labeled 'difficult' or who aren't liked by at least some staff, which involves a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship between staff and patients, and which may end in the suicide of the patient. Individuals with long-term mental disorders, which may have originally stemmed from social alienation, can experience particular social and existential alienation within their communities due to other people's and potentially their own negative attitudes towards themselves and 'odd' behavior.\n\nDifferences between persons with disabilities and individuals in relative abilities, or perceived abilities, can be a cause of alienation. One study, \"Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness\", found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience: social rejection by, and alienation from, the larger hearing community. Only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction. This appeared to be related to specific needs, for example for real conversation, for information, the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family. It was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people, sometimes resulting in marginalization of the deaf, which is sometimes challenged. It has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative.\n\nPhysicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities, which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering, and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring.\n\nAlienation is most often represented in literature as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community. In a volume of Bloom's Literary Themes, Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" is described as the 'supreme literary portrait' of alienation, while noting that some may argue for Achilles in the \"Iliad\". In addition, \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\" is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present. Other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are: \"The Bell Jar\", \"Black Boy\", \"Brave New World\", \"The Catcher in the Rye\", \"The Chosen\", \"Dubliners\", \"Othello\", \"Fahrenheit 451\", \"Invisible Man\", \"Mrs Dalloway\", \"Notes from Underground\", \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\", \"The Stranger\" and \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", \"The Trial\", \"The Castle\", \"Waiting for Godot\", \"The Waste Land\", and \"Young Goodman Brown\". Contemporary British works noted for their perspective on alienation include \"The Child in Time\", \"London Fields\", \"Trainspotting\", and \"Regeneration\" (Senekal, 2008 & 2010b: 102–123).\n\nSociologist Harry Dahms has analysed The Matrix Trilogy of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society. He suggests that the central theme of \"The Matrix\" is the \"all-pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today, and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it\".\n\nSee also Langman's study of \"punk, porn, and resistance\" (2008) and Senekal's (2011) study of Afrikaans extreme metal.\n\nBritish progressive rock band Pink Floyd's concept album \"The Wall\" (1979) and British alternative rock band Radiohead's album \"OK Computer\" (1997), both deal with the subject of alienation in their lyrics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50669096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50669096", "title": "Union violence in the United States", "text": "Union violence in the United States\n\nOn various occasions violence has been committed by unions or union members during labor disputes in the United States. When union violence has occurred, it has frequently been in the context of industrial unrest. Violence has ranged from isolated acts by individuals to wider campaigns of organised violence aimed at furthering union goals within an industrial dispute.\n\nAnti-union violence has also occurred frequently in the context of industrial unrest, and has often involved the collusion of management and government authorities, private agencies, or citizens' groups in organising violence against unions and their members.\n\nAccording to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrial nation in the world, and there have been few industries which have been immune. Researchers in industrial relations, criminology, and wider cultural studies have examined violence by workers or trade unions in the context of industrial disputes. The US government has examined violence during industrial disputes.\n\nAccording to a 1969 study, no major labor organization in American history has ever openly advocated violence as a policy, although some, in the early part of the 20th century, systematically used violence, most notably the Western Federation of Miners, and the International Association of Bridge Structural Iron Workers. However, violence does occur in the context of industrial disputes. When violence has been committed by, or in the name of, the union, it has tended to be narrowly focused upon targets which are associated with the employer. Violence was greater in conflicts in which there was a question of whether union recognition would be extended.\n\nBoth employers and workers have each been the aggressor and victim at different times. The \"most virulent\" violence in United States industrial disputes occurred when management tried to destroy a union or deny recognition to a union.\n\nUnion violence most typically occurs in specific situations, and has more frequently been aimed at preventing replacement workers from taking jobs during a strike, than at managers or employers.\n\nProtest and verbal abuse are routinely aimed against union members or replacement workers who cross picket lines (\"blacklegs\") during industrial disputes. The inherent aim of a union is to create a labor monopoly so as to balance the monopsony a large employer enjoys as a purchaser of labor. Strikebreakers threaten that goal and undermine the union's bargaining position, and occasionally this erupts into violent confrontation, with violence committed either by, or against, strikers. Some who have sought to explain such violence observe, if labor disputes are accompanied by violence, it may be because labor has no legal redress. In 1894, some workers declared:\n\n...\"the right of employers to manage their own business to suit themselves,\" is fast coming to mean in effect nothing less than a right to manage the country to suit themselves.\n\nA 1969 study of labor conflict violence in the United States examined the era following the 1947 passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, and concluded that violence had substantially abated. In the 16 years from 1947 through 1962, 29 people died in labor conflicts, a rate much lower than in previous eras. The study noted that attacks on strikers by company guards had all but disappeared. They estimated from NLRB records that 80 to 100 acts of violence by union members or supporters occurred each year, most of the attacks on people being unplanned fights with strikebreakers crossing picket lines. In the 1960s, the most common complaint of union violence was of sabotage during labor disputes. Numerous incidents included dynamite explosions, but targeting property, and without any dynamite-related injuries.\n\nThe great railroad strike of 1877 saw considerable violence by, and against, workers, and occurred before unions were widespread. It started on July 14 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in response to the cutting of wages for the second time in a year by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O). Striking workers would not allow any of the stock to roll until this second wage cut was revoked. The governor sent in state militia units to restore train service, but the soldiers refused to use force against the strikers and the governor called for federal troops.\n\nViolent street battles occurred in Maryland between the striking workers and the Maryland militia. When the outnumbered troops of the 6th Regiment fired on an attacking crowd, they killed 10 and wounded 25. The rioters injured several members of the militia, damaged engines and train cars, and burned portions of the train station. On July 21–22, the President sent federal troops and Marines to Baltimore to restore order.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, strikers threw rocks at militiamen, who bayoneted their antagonists, killing twenty people and wounding twenty-nine others.\nIn Reading, Pennsylvania, workers conducted mass marches, blocked rail traffic, committed trainyard arson, and burned a bridge. The state militia shot sixteen citizens in the Reading Railroad Massacre. The militia responsible for the shootings was mobilized by Reading Railroad management, not by local public officials.\n\nChicago was paralyzed when angry mobs of unemployed citizens wreaked havoc in the rail yards. The strike was eventually suppressed by thousands of vigilantes, National Guard, and federal troops.\n\nIn 1886 the Haymarket affair (also known as the Haymarket massacre or Haymarket riot) was a protest rally and subsequent violence on May 4 at the Haymarket Square in Chicago. The rally supported striking workers. When police began to disperse the public meeting, an unknown person threw a dynamite bomb into their midst. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of eight police officers, mostly from friendly fire, and an unknown number of civilians. In the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight anarchists were tried for murder. Four men were convicted and executed, and one committed suicide in prison, although the prosecution conceded none of the defendants had thrown the bomb.\n\nThe Haymarket affair is generally considered significant for the origin of international May Day observances for workers. The causes of the Haymarket Affair are still controversial, but can be traced in part to an incident the previous day, in which police fired into a crowd of agitated workers during shift change at the McCormick Works, where the regular work force was on strike, and at least two workers were killed. In popular literature, the Haymarket Affair inspired the caricature of \"a bomb-throwing anarchist.\"\n\nIllinois Governor John Peter Altgeld later pardoned the three living survivors of the Haymarket prosecution, concluding (as have subsequent scholars) that there had been a serious miscarriage of justice in their prosecutions.\n\nDuring the 1888 strike against the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, workers were arrested for wrecking a train. When one of those arrested turned out to be a detective, organized labor complained that the detective had incited the others.\n\n\"In the 1890s violent outbreaks occurred in the North, South, and West, in small communities and metropolitan cities, testifying to the common attitudes of Americans in every part of the United States.\" Workers with different ethnic origins who worked under very different conditions in widely separated parts of the United States nonetheless responded with equal ferocity when unions came under attack. \"Serious violence erupted in several major strikes of the 1890s, the question of union recognition being a factor in all of them.\"\n\n1892 in particular was a year of considerable labor unrest. Governors of five states called out the national guard and/or the army to quell unrest—against miners in East Tennessee and in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, where a shooting war followed the discovery of a labor spy, against switchmen in Buffalo, New York, against a general strike in New Orleans, Louisiana, and against the Homestead, Pennsylvania steel strike.\n\nThe strike of 1892 in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho erupted in violence when a union miner was killed by mine guards, and was further inflamed when union miners discovered they had been infiltrated by a Pinkerton agent who had routinely provided union information to the mine owners.\n\nOn Sunday night, July 10, armed union miners gathered on the hills above the Frisco mine. More union miners were arriving from surrounding communities. At five in the morning, shots rang out, and the firing became continuous. Both sides blamed the other for starting the shooting. The union miners, exposed on the logged-off hillside, hadn't positioned themselves for a gunfight, while mine guards were able to shelter in buildings. The union men circled above the mill, and got into a position where they could send a box of black powder down the flume into one of the mine buildings. The building exploded, killing one company man and injuring several others. The union miners fired into a remaining structure where the guards had taken shelter. A second company man was killed, and sixty or so guards surrendered. Union men marched their prisoners to the union hall.\n\nThe violence caused the governor to declare Martial Law, and bring in six companies of the Idaho National Guard to \"suppress insurrection and violence.\" Federal troops also arrived, and they confined six hundred miners in bullpens without any hearings or formal charges. Some were later \"sent up\" for violating injunctions, others for obstructing the United States mail.\n\nOne of the most notorious incidents of violence against management occurred in 1892 during the Homestead Strike—one of the most violent industrial disputes in American history—when Alexander Berkman attempted to assassinate Henry Clay Frick, chairman of the Carnegie Steel Company and manager of the mill where the strike occurred. Frick had locked out the workers, and later hired three hundred armed guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to break the union's picket lines, resulting in gunfire and flaming barges on the Ohio River. There was a consensus of all parties that the presence of the Pinkertons inflamed the attitudes of the strikers. The strikers defeated the Pinkertons, but could not keep the mills from operating after the National Guard was deployed.\n\nBerkman, an avowed anarchist, had no connection to the union involved in the strike, but believed he was acting in the workers' interests. He was motivated by newspaper reports of,\n\n...Henry Clay Frick, whose attitude toward labor is implacably hostile; his secret military preparations while designedly prolonging the peace negotiations with the Amalgamated; the fortification of the Homestead steel-works; the erection of a high board fence, capped by barbed wire and provided with loopholes for sharpshooters; the hiring of an army of Pinkerton thugs; the attempt to smuggle them, in the dead of night, into Homestead; and, finally, the terrible carnage.\n\nBerkman's attack, called an attentat by the anarchists, injured but failed to kill Frick. Having anticipated that his act would launch a worker uprising, Berkman was surprised when a carpenter hit him with a hammer after he had been restrained. The attempted murder alienated the anarchist community from much of the labor movement, as well as dividing the anarchist community itself. Frick had been widely hated, but in at least one analysis, becoming the victim of such an attack transformed him into a \"folk hero\" in the public view.\n\nDuring the Homestead strike, Carnegie Steel Company employees in Duquesne joined the strike that was occurring across the river. A riot broke out, and a number of the workers were arrested. It turned out that two of the strikers were Pinkerton detectives, and convictions were secured.\n\nIn 1897, the Pana Coal Company attempted to import African-American strikebreakers. A train car was intercepted by armed striking miners, and the strikebreakers were sent home unharmed.\n\nThe following year, however, another company, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company, attempted a similar strike-breaking effort, this time with an armed escort on the train car. The result was called the Battle of Virden. Guards fired their rifles as they disembarked from the train. In the ensuing gun battle, fourteen men, including eight strikers, were killed. Governor Tanner criticized the company, and called up the National Guard, who were able to restore order. The National Guard prevented a similar incident by turning away additional strikebreakers the day after the riot.\n\nIn April 1899, as the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was launching an organizing drive of the few locations not yet unionized, superintendent Albert Burch declared that the company would rather \"shut down and remain closed twenty years\" than to recognize the union. He then fired seventeen workers that he believed to be union members and demanded that all other union men collect their back pay and quit.\n\nOn April 29, 250 angry union members belonging to the WFM seized a train in Burke. At each stop through Burke-Canyon, more miners climbed aboard. At Frisco, the train stopped to load eighty wooden boxes, each containing fifty pounds of dynamite. Nearly a thousand men rode the train to Wardner, the site of a $250,000 mill of the Bunker Hill mine. After carrying three thousand pounds of dynamite into the mill, they set their charges and scattered. Two men were killed, one of them a non-union miner, the other a union man accidentally shot by other miners. Their mission accomplished, the miners once again boarded the \"Dynamite Express\" and left the scene.\n\nFrom Kellog to Wallace, ranchers and laboring people lined the tracks and, according to one eyewitness, \"cheered the [union] men lustily as they passed.\"\nOnce again, miners were rounded up and herded into bullpens and held there for months.\n\nDuring the Western Federation of Miners strike of 1903-04, there was considerable violence, including an explosion at the Vindicator mine which killed two, and an explosion at the Independence Depot which killed thirteen. The Cripple Creek Mining District was under occupation by the Colorado National Guard, the Citizens' Alliance was active in the district, and historians continue to debate who was responsible for each incident of violence. One likely perpetrator was convicted assassin Harry Orchard. A major in the National Guard later testified that the militia was responsible for orchestrated beatings of striking miners.\n\nPerhaps the most significant example of a campaign of union violence, the International Association of Bridge Structural Iron Workers employed dynamite attacks and assault from 1906 to 1911 over employers' demands for an open shop. After an initial peace offer, employers refused to talk to the union, and the union leadership adopted violent tactics as a direct response. Approximately one hundred structures were damaged or destroyed by dynamite, and about a hundred non-union workers were assaulted. In the Chicago area alone, there were 12 dynamite attacks on non-union construction sites from 1906 to 1911, six of them taking place in 1910. The attacks on construction sites were aimed at property, not people. Nationwide, nearly 100 dynamite bombs had exploded at non-union iron workers construction sites from 1906 to 1911.\n\nThe most powerful foe of labor unions in Los Angeles was Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the Los Angeles Times. On 1 October 1910, a dynamite bomb exploded at the Los Angeles Times building. The explosion and subsequent fire killed 21 Times workers, and injured 100 more. Ortie McManigal, one of the Iron Workers Union members who participated in the bombing, confessed.\n\nThe next day, a mysterious suitcase was found outside the home of Times publisher Otis; police moved the suitcase away from the building. When they opened it, they heard ticking, and ran. They were 60 feet away when the dynamite went off, creating a crater and rattling windows, but without injuring anyone. Another dynamite bomb was discovered and disarmed at the Los Angeles home of the president of the anti-union Merchants and Manufacturers Association.\n\nThe southern California crew of Ortie McManigal and James B. Macnamara were still not through, and set off eight more explosions, including a Christmas Day 1910 explosion at the Llewellyn Iron Works in Los Angeles.\n\nPolice found bomb-making equipment, including dynamite, at the Ironworkers Union office in San Francisco, and at the union headquarters in Indianapolis. Ortie McManigal confessed and testified against the others. James B. Macnamara pled guilty to placing the Los Angeles Times bomb, and his brother John J. Macnamara, secretary-treasurer of the union, pled guilty to planning the bombing of the Llewellyn Iron Works. In all, 40 members of the Iron Workers Union were convicted in the dynamite campaign, including union president Frank Ryan.\n\nAs of 2016, the Ironworkers Union website on the history of the union commented:\n\nMcNamara, Ryan, Clancy, Butler, Morrin and the others may have done what they thought they had to do to preserve the International Association. And despite other consequences of the dynamite campaign, they did save the Union. The International Officers stretched the limits of zeal in a righteous cause. Their strategy and tactics suffered - not the cause or validity of unionism.\n\nTwo years of conflict between miners and mine owners, characterized by utilization of the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency for infiltrating, sabotaging and attacking the United Mine Workers union, culminated in the Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921. The largest armed insurrection since the American Civil War was touched off by the murders of Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers on the courthouse steps of Welch, West Virginia. The Battle of Blair Mountain was a spontaneous uprising of ten thousand coal miners from throughout West Virginia who fought the coal company's hired guns and their allies, the state police for three days before federal troops intervened.\n\nWilliamson County, Illinois, a county with a \"unique history of violence\" for a rural county, was the location of the Herrin Massacre, one of the most horrific and perplexing incidents of union violence. The 1922 incident is considered the most notorious of the United Mine Workers' struggles in Illinois. The massacre was committed by members (and possibly at the instruction of local leadership) of the United Mine Workers. Three union men died in the exchange of gunfire during an afternoon-long armed siege of a non-union mine. The next day, the non-union miners surrendered and were disarmed in exchange for safe passage out of the county. However, union miners killed 20 men of the 50 strikebreakers and mine guards who surrendered. The ruthless retaliation occurred against the backdrop of broken promises, double dealing, and missed opportunities on both sides.\n\nFalse flag operations are efforts to turn public opinion against an adversary, while pretending to be in the camp of that adversary. Historian J. Bernard Hogg observed of such operations as practiced in 1888:\n\nA detective will join the ranks of the strikers and at once become an ardent champion of their cause. He is next found committing an aggravated assault upon some man or woman who has remained at work, thereby bringing down upon the heads of the officers and members of the assembly or union directly interested, the condemnation of all honest people, and aiding very materially to demoralize the organization and break their ranks.\n\nSome labor spy agencies advertised their false flag operations; for example, Corporations Auxiliary Company, a labor spy agency which boasted 499 corporate clients in the early 1930s, told prospective clients,\n\nIn [the event other methods of sabotaging the union fail, our operative in the union] turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor in Indiana's Johnson County, Carlos Lam, suggested in an email that Wisconsin's Governor Walker mount a \"false flag\" operation to make it appear that the union was committing violence in the 2011 Wisconsin protests. After initially claiming that his email account was hacked, Lam admitted to sending the suggestion and resigned. Governor Walker's office disclaimed support for the proposal.\n\nDuring the Colorado Labor Wars, the Colorado National Guard had been called into the Cripple Creek Mining District to put down a strike, and Colorado National Guard leadership became concerned that the Mine Owners Association had not lived up to their agreement to cover the payroll of the soldiers. In February 1904, General Reardon ordered Major Ellison to shoot up one of the mines. When such violence occurred, the blame would be placed upon the union. In the dark of night, Major Ellison and Sergeant Gordon Walter fired sixty shots from their revolvers into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. The plan worked, and the mine owners paid up.\n\nDuring the same strike, detectives were accused of attempting to frame union leaders for a plot to derail a train. A jury of non-union ranchers and timbermen unanimously acquitted three accused union men, and some testimony during the trial pointed at a plot by the detectives.\n\nFrameups in labor disputes sometimes swung public opinion against the perpetrators. During a 1912 strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, police acting on a tip discovered dynamite and blamed it on the union. National media echoed an anti-union message. Later the police revealed that the dynamite had been wrapped in a magazine addressed to the son of the former mayor. The man had received an unexplained payment from the largest of the employers. Exposed, the plot swung public sympathy to the union.\n\nThe United Farm Workers 1979 strike against Imperial Valley lettuce growers was organized by Cesar Chavez to dispute wages for produce workers. Despite his outspoken calls for peaceful protests and the UFW's policy of non-violence, several instances of widespread violence and damage occurred during the strike. \"UFW pickets engaged in rock-throwing, blocking access to and from grower facilities or fields, rushing into fields towards replacement workers, throwing nail-type devices on the ground to cause flat tires in grower vehicles, overturning grower vehicles, carrying or using sticks, clubs, sling shots or other weapons...There was evidence that the picket captains urged strikers to throw rocks and to vandalize grower equipment. There was evidence that King and the picket captains made threats to kill the replacement workers. There was evidence that the UFW could discipline picketers who violated strike rules by pulling them off the picket line and having them work elsewhere yet the evidence tended to show the UFW rarely disciplined picketers...There was testimony picket captains encouraged strikers to throw rocks and vandalize grower equipment. In particular, there was evidence of a \"Fantasma\" or \"Phantom Crew\" organized by the strikers to intimidate growers and replacement workers. This phantom crew was composed of five or six \"real strong young men\" who would use a black van at night to attack replacement workers and to vandalize irrigation equipment, vehicles and homes belonging to growers and replacement workers.\n\nIn the following years, a judge would later find the actions of the UFW were \"acts of unlawful picketing\" and held them financially liable for damages to the growers.\n\nThe United Mine Workers Union 1985 strike against Massey Energy included attacks on company vehicles with rifle fire. Trucks hauling coal from the mines were fired upon with rifles a number of times, and three drivers had previously been wounded by the rifle fire before June 1985, when another truck convoy was hit by rifle fire, killing driver Hayes West when his truck was hit by at least 21 rifle rounds, and the driver of another truck was wounded.\n\nState and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in the death of Hayes West. Five members of the United Mine Workers Union, including Donnie Thornsbury, president of UMW Local 2496, were indicted by a federal grand jury, arrested, and charged with conspiracy to damage and disable motor vehicles used in interstate commerce. After a trial in federal court, four out of the five were convicted, including union official Thornsbury, and their convictions were upheld on appeal.\n\nDuring protests by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1547 against a non-unionized workforce getting a contract, picketers threatened and assaulted workers, spat at them, sabotaged equipment, and shot guns near workers. In 1999, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the union had engaged in \"ongoing acts of intimidation, violence, destruction of property\", awarding the plaintiff $212,500 in punitive damages.\n\nThree union workers set fire to the Hotel Dupont Plaza in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while other union members staged a fight as a distraction. The union, said to be affiliated with the Teamsters, was having a labor dispute with management over pay and health care. Ninety-seven people were killed, none of whom were union members. Most bodies were burned beyond recognition.\n\nThe 1989 strike by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) against the Pittston Coal Company's mines in Virginia and West Virginia was marked by shots fired at strikebreakers. In July 1989, a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of Pittston headquarters at Lebanon, Virginia.\n\nOn the first day of The \"New York Daily News\" strike, delivery trucks were attacked with stones and sticks, and in some cases burned, with the drivers beaten. Strikers then started threatening newsstands with arson, or stole all copies of the Daily News and burned them in front of the newsstands. James Hoge, publisher of the \"Daily News\", alleged that there had been some 700 serious acts of violence. The New York Police Department claimed knowledge of 229 incidents of violence. Criminal charges under the Hobbs Act were declined, however, citing the aforementioned \"Enmons\" case.\n\nEight members of the striking United Mine Workers Union were arrested after Eddie York was shot and killed in Logan County, West Virginia, as he drove away from the coal mine, through the picket line. York, an employee of an environmental contractor, was at the mine to perform government-mandated maintenance of sedimentation ponds, work unrelated to the labor dispute. In the same incident, a truck driven by a mine guard was struck by rocks thrown by strikers on the picket line, which smashed the windshield. Howard Green, a member of the UMW executive board, accused Arch Corporation mine guards of murdering York, to give bad publicity to the union.\n\nState and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in York's death. The FBI and Justice Department, citing the \"Enmons\" case, decided they could not prosecute under the Hobbs Act. The federal government charged eight of the picketers for interfering with interstate transportation. Seven of the union members, including the president of the local, accepted plea deals in connection with the rock-throwing. The eighth, Jerry Dale Lowe, was charged with firing the fatal shot, and was tried in federal court for illegal use of a firearm to incapacitate a driver involved in interstate commerce (the federal government could not charge him with murder, because murder is not a federal crime). In 1994, a federal jury convicted Jerry Dale Lowe of killing Eddie York, and he was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Although all eight of those charged had violated various UMWA picket-line rules against drinking, masking their faces, rock-throwing, and having guns at the picket line, none were subject to any UMWA discipline. On the contrary, the union successfully fought to get the seven who pled guilty their old jobs back after the strike.\n\nIn Miami, during a 1997 Teamsters Union strike against UPS, a group of men pulled UPS truck driver Rod Carter out of his truck, beat him, and stabbed him six times with an ice pick. Carter had earlier received a threatening phone call from the home of Anthony Cannestro, Sr., president of Teamsters Local 769. Carter sued Teamsters local 769, charging that union officials had encouraged violent behavior by its members. The Teamsters Union settled with Carter by paying an undisclosed sum.\n\nFor years, officials of Laborers Local 91, in Niagara, New York, directed a strongarm squad of union members to make death threats and to commit criminal acts against nonunion construction workers and work sites. In 1997, the union fire-bombed a residence used by non-union workers in Niagara Falls, New York, causing permanent injury to one of the inhabitants. In 1998, union members attacked four tile-layers at a supermarket construction site, beating them so badly that they were all hospitalized, one so badly that he had not returned to work four years later.\n\nState and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in the beatings. After a four-year federal investigation, the FBI arrested 14 union members for the violence, including the local's vice president, business manager, assistant business manager, and a former president. Andrew Shomers confessed to the fire-bombing, and also to the beatings at the supermarket site. Another union member, confessed to driving the getaway car in the fire bombing.\nAnthony Cerrone, a member of local 91, confessed to involvement in the supermarket attack and the fire-bombing.\nIt was reported on September 9, 2011 that members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) frightened security guards, dumped grain, and vandalized property belonging to EGT, LLC, over a labor dispute. No one was hurt, and no one had been arrested at the time the incident was reported. District Judge Ronald Leighton later issued a preliminary injunction against the ILWU citing their reported behavior.\n\nUnion workers protesting right-to-work legislation in Lansing, Michigan destroyed a tent run by Americans for Prosperity. People were inside the tent but managed to escape before the collapse. Additionally, hot dog stand operator Clinton Tarver, a popular vendor around the Capital area who was hired to provide catering for AFP, lost his equipment, condiments, coolers, and food in the collapse. According to Tarver (an African American), union workers, who had incorrectly assumed he was supporting AFP, called Tarver an \"Uncle Tom nigger\". A union worker also punched conservative comedian and Fox News contributor Steven Crowder, resulting in a chipped tooth and a minor cut on the forehead. Another worker threatened to kill Crowder with a gun.\n\nAlthough the violence, property destruction and arson had been going on for years, it intensified after the economic downturn of 2008-2009, as construction work became scarcer. In 2012, Ironworkers union members caused $500,000 in damage to the non-union construction site of a Quaker meetinghouse in Chestnut Hill. In another incident, Ironworkers beat nonunion workers outside a Toys-R-Us store with baseball bats. Some of the violence was directed at union construction sites staffed by other craft unions, such as the Carpenters Union, in an attempt to get the work for the Ironworkers.\n\nAfter an FBI investigation, federal prosecuters filed racketeering and arson charges against ten officers and members of Ironworkers Local 401.\n\nIn 2015, the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority sued the Carpenters Union local in Philadelphia for racketeering, under the federal RICO statute. The Authority charged that the union had engaged in a pattern of \"illegal and disruptive mass picketing and protests; physical intimidation, harassment, stalking, and assault and battery; verbal intimidation, harassment, race-baiting, and threats; and the destruction of property.\" The Carpenters Union denied the charges.\nSometimes, unions are accused of violence or threats of violence by other unions.\n\nIn June 1940, a bus driver member of the Amalgamated Association of Street Railway & Motor Coach Employees, which was not on strike, was killed at the hands of members of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, which claimed to represent the bus drivers. The Railroad Trainmen blamed the bus driver, calling him a strikebreaker. The Street Railway & Motor Coach Employees union later won an NLRB representation election, defeating the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. p. 364\n\nIn 1932, some southern Illinois coal miners dissatisfied with the concessions made by the United Mine Workers Union, and what they regarded as the autocratic ways of its leader, John L. Lewis, broke away and formed the Progressive Miners of America (PMA), later renamed the Progressive Mine Workers of America. The rival unions clashed violently from the start, resulting in numerous deaths on both sides, as well as police officers killed trying to prevent the violence.\n\nThe violence was especially intense in southern Illinois in 1932 and 1933, when PMA picketers tried to stop UMWA members from entering the mines. Officers and members of both unions were shot on the street and bombed in their homes. In addition, PMA members set off bombs to stop rail shipments of UMWA-mined coal, trying to force the companies to recognize the PMA. In 1937 the federal government charged 36 PMA members and officers with racketeering, in connection with 44 dynamite explosions at mines and rail facilities. The PMA maintained that the charges resulted from collusion between the FBI, UMWA, and Peabody Coal, and that their methods were no different from those of the UMWA. All 36 were convicted. Although the prison sentences were no more than 16 months, the fines and legal expenses had drained the PMA treasury, and the verdicts labelled the PMA as an outlaw organization.\n\nThe Progressive Mine Workers union survived, and PMWA-UMWA violence flared up occasionally over the years, as one union would strike while the other continued to work, and they both claimed to represent miners at various coal mines. In 1946, two miners died in clashes between the rival unions at a mine at Benham, Kentucky, which was represented by the Progressive Mine Workers. In 1982, the Progressive Mine Workers of America represented 4,500 coal miners, compared to the UMWA's membership of 160,000 The union dissolved in 1999.\n\nIn the United States, union violence often goes unpunished because of pro-union sympathies, or political pressure not to prosecute. A 1966 study cited numerous examples of local and state police failing to interfere with, and state and local prosecutors failing to prosecute, union violence. The authors concluded:\n\nA public official sees many votes on the picket line; few in the office. Perhaps in 1932 it was true that local officials were ignorant of union objectives and brutal in the extreme toward peaceful picketers. Nothing could be further from the truth in 1966.\n\nAlthough replacement workers have the legal right to be free from violence or intimidation in labor disputes, many law enforcement officials will not interfere with union intimidation, for fear of being accused of being anti-union. When Democratic governor of Arizona Bruce Babbitt sent the national guard to prevent threatened violence by strikers in the Phelps Dodge copper strike of 1982, a union official charged that he was \"in the pocket\" of Phelps Dodge.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce has pointed out that a number of states have made legal exceptions for labor disputes in their criminal laws. For example, California, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Illinois have exempted labor disputes from their laws against stalking.\n\nThe Hobbs act makes extortion a federal crime, but under the United States Supreme Court's 1973 Enmons decision (United States v. Enmons), the actions of union officials in organizing strikes and other united acts of workers are exempt from Hobbs Act prosecutions, as long as the labor dispute is over pay for work performed. This exemption does not confer any immunity from state prosecution for violent acts.\n\nNo American labor union currently has a policy of openly advocating violence, and some, such as the United Mine Workers in the Pittston Coal strike, have publicly emphasized peaceful means; the UMWA has striking members watch videos about the union's rules to assure peaceful picketing. Labor unions have an incentive to keep strikes, and especially picket lines, peaceful, because if an activity organized and supervised by union officials such as picketing, becomes violent, the union itself may be found liable, in addition to the individuals.\n\nSome union sympathizers believe that labor union violence is justified, especially when directed at strikebreakers. Some hold that the law allowing and protecting strikebreakers is unfair, so that violence and intimidation are the only ways labor unionists can stage an effective strike. Others believe that, although violence is wrong, it should be tolerated as an excess done for the greater good. Clarence Darrow voiced this view in his courtroom defense of labor leader Big Bill Haywood, charged with ordering the assassination of the governor of Idaho:\n\nI don't care how many wrongs they committed, I don't care how many crimes these weak, rough, rugged, unlettered men who often know no other power but the brute force of their strong right arm, who find themselves bound and confined and impaired whichever way they turn, who look up and worship the god of might as the only god that they know--I don't care how often they fail, how many brutalities they are guilty of. I know their cause is just.\n\nExamples of local government inaction before or after union violence include the Herrin Massacre, where the county sheriff was a member of the United Mine Workers, and did nothing to prevent or stop the killing of 21 nonstriking workers, after the strikebreakers had given up their weapons on a promise of safe passage out of the county.\n\nDuring a nationwide Teamsters Union strike against UPS in 1987, the president of the Houston policeman's union faxed a message to all Houston police stations, urging them to stop UPS drivers, and \"go into zero tolerance mode, to get the nonstriking drivers off the street.\n\nOn 12 October 1898, at Virden, Illinois, a crowd of strikers armed with rifles tried to prevent a railroad car of strikebreakers from disembarking, and 8 strikers and 6 strikebreakers died in the gunfight. governor Tanner of Illinois ordered in the National Guard, and on his orders, the following day the Guard prevented the companies from bringing in more strikebreakers. Unable to continue operating, the companies gave in. The governor admitted that he had no legal authority for his action in preventing the arrival of strikebreakers, but said that he was doing the will of the people.\n\nWhen local, state, or federal officials try to prosecute union violence, they sometimes find that employers are reluctant to cooperate, for fear of union repraisal.\n\n\nPeople\n\n"}

{"id": "31718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31718", "title": "Utopia", "text": "Utopia\n\nA utopia ( ) is an imagined community or society that possesses highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities for its citizens. The opposite of a utopia is a dystopia. One could also say that utopia is a perfect \"place\" that has been designed so there are no problems.\n\nUtopia focuses on equality in economics, government and justice, though by no means exclusively, with the method and structure of proposed implementation varying based on ideology. According to Lyman Tower Sargent \"there are socialist, capitalist, monarchical, democratic, anarchist, ecological, feminist, patriarchal, egalitarian, hierarchical, racist, left-wing, right-wing, reformist, Naturists/Nude Christians, free love, nuclear family, extended family, gay, lesbian, and many more utopias [...] Utopianism, some argue, is essential for the improvement of the human condition. But if used wrongly, it becomes dangerous. Utopia has an inherent contradictory nature here.\" Sargent argues that utopia's nature is inherently contradictory, because societies are not homogenous, and have desires which conflict and therefore cannot simultaneously be satisfied. If any two desires cannot be simultaneously satisfied, true utopia cannot be attained because in utopia all desires are satisfied.\n\nThe term \"\" was coined from Greek by Sir Thomas More for his 1516 book \"Utopia\", describing a fictional island society in the south Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South America.\n\nThe word comes from (\"not\") and τόπος (\"place\") and means \"no-place\", and strictly describes any non-existent society 'described in considerable detail'. However, in standard usage, the word's meaning has narrowed and now usually describes a non-existent society that is intended to be viewed as considerably better than contemporary society. \"Eutopia\", derived from Greek εὖ (\"good\" or \"well\") and τόπος (\"place\"), means \"good place\", and is strictly speaking the correct term to describe a positive utopia. In English, \"eutopia\" and \"utopia\" are homophonous, which may have given rise to the change in meaning.\n\nChronologically, the first recorded Utopian proposal is Plato's \"Republic\". Part conversation, part fictional depiction, and part policy proposal, \"Republic\" would categorize citizens into a rigid class structure of \"golden,\" \"silver,\" \"bronze\" and \"iron\" socioeconomic classes. The golden citizens are trained in a rigorous 50-year-long educational program to be benign oligarchs, the \"philosopher-kings.\" Plato stressed this structure many times in statements, and in his published works, such as the \"Republic\". The wisdom of these rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources, though the details on how to do this are unclear. The educational program for the rulers is the central notion of the proposal. It has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires mercenaries from among its war-prone neighbors. These mercenaries were deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more warlike populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out, leaving peaceful peoples.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Thomas More's book \"Utopia\" proposed an ideal society of the same name. Readers, including Utopian socialists, have chosen to accept this imaginary society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation, while others have postulated that Thomas More intended nothing of the sort. It is believed that More's \"Utopia\" functions only on the level of a satire, a work intended to reveal more about the England of his time than about an idealistic society. This interpretation is bolstered by the title of the book and nation, and its apparent confusion between the Greek for \"no place\" and \"good place\": \"utopia\" is a compound of the syllable ou-, meaning \"no\", and topos, meaning place. But the homophonic prefix eu-, meaning \"good,\" also resonates in the word, with the implication that the perfectly \"good place\" is really \"no place.\"\n\nEcological utopian society describes new ways in which society should relate to nature.\nThese works perceive a widening gap between the modern Western way of living that destroys nature and a more traditional way of living before industrialization. Ecological utopias may advocate a society that is more sustainable. According to the Dutch philosopher Marius de Geus, ecological utopias could be inspirational sources for movements involving green politics.\n\nParticularly in the early 19th century, several utopian ideas arose, often in response to the belief that social disruption was created and caused by the development of commercialism and capitalism. These ideas are often grouped in a greater \"utopian socialist\" movement, due to their shared characteristics. A once common characteristic is an egalitarian distribution of goods, frequently with the total abolition of money. Citizens only do work which they enjoy and which is for the common good, leaving them with ample time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. One classic example of such a utopia was Edward Bellamy's \"Looking Backward\". Another socialist utopia is William Morris's \"News from Nowhere\", written partially in response to the top-down (bureaucratic) nature of Bellamy's utopia, which Morris criticized. However, as the socialist movement developed, it moved away from utopianism; Marx in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialism he described as utopian. (For more information, see the History of Socialism article.) In a materialist utopian society, the economy is perfect; there is no inflation, and only perfect social and financial equality exists.\n\nIn 1905, H.G. Wells published \"A Modern Utopia\", which was widely read and admired and provoked much discussion. Also consider Eric Frank Russell's book \"The Great Explosion\" (1963) whose last section details an economic and social utopia. This forms the first mention of the idea of Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS).\n\nDuring the \"Khrushchev Thaw\" period, the Soviet writer Ivan Efremov produced the science-fiction utopia \"Andromeda\" (1957) in which a major cultural thaw took place: humanity communicates with a galaxy-wide Great Circle and develops its technology and culture within a social framework characterized by vigorous competition between alternative philosophies.\n\nThe English political philosopher James Harrington, author of the utopian work The Commonwealth of Oceana, published in 1656, inspired English country party republicanism and was influential in the design of three American colonies. His theories ultimately contributed to the idealistic principles of the American Founders. The colonies of Carolina (founded in 1670), Pennsylvania (founded in 1681), and Georgia (founded in 1733) were the only three English colonies in America that were planned as utopian societies with an integrated physical, economic, and social design. At the heart of the plan for Georgia was a concept of “agrarian equality” in which land was allocated equally and additional land acquisition through purchase or inheritance was prohibited; the plan was an early step toward the yeoman republic later envisioned by Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe communes of the 1960s in the United States were often an attempt to greatly improve the way humans live together in communities. The back-to-the-land movements and hippies inspired many to try to live in peace and harmony on farms, remote areas, and to set up new types of governance. Communes like Kaliflower, which existed between 1967 and 1973, attempted to live outside of society's norms and create their own ideal communist based society.\n\nIntentional communities were organized and built all over the world with the hope of making a more perfect way of living together. While many of these new small communities failed, some are growing, such as the Twelve Tribes Communities that started in the United States. Since its start, it has now grown into many groups around the world.\n\nThe inter-religious utopia is similar to a form of multiculturalism where real-world cultures have successfully worked together to create a wider society based on shared values. A transparent ideology of God and religion in an inter-religious utopia is how many people envision God manifesting within such a community. In more extended theories, the formula goes up to the next level, with different religious leaders setting aside their differences and accepting harmony, peace and understanding to unite all religions with one another. Other inter-religious utopias may go even further by describing a religion where humans become God or merge with a primal force that reigned before the birth of the universe. Religion and God could be used as self-motivating factors for people to believe in and to raise themselves out of difficult situations.\n\nIn the United States and Europe, during the Second Great Awakening (ca. 1790–1840) and thereafter, many radical religious groups formed utopian societies in which faith could govern all aspects of members' lives. These utopian societies included the Shakers, who originated in England in the 18th century and arrived in America in 1774. A number of religious utopian societies from Europe came to the United States from the 18th century throughout the 19th century, including the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by Johannes Kelpius (1667–1708)), the Ephrata Cloister (established in 1732), and the Harmony Society, among others. The Harmony Society was a Christian theosophy and pietist group founded in Iptingen, Germany, in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the Lutheran Church and the government in Württemberg, the society moved to the United States on October 7, 1803, settled in Pennsylvania. On February 15, 1805, about 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their goods in common. The group lasted until 1905, making it one of the longest-running financially successful communes in American history. The Oneida Community, founded by John Humphrey Noyes in Oneida, New York, was a utopian religious commune that lasted from 1848 to 1881. Although this utopian experiment has become better known today for its manufacture of Oneida silverware, it was one of the longest-running communes in American history. The Amana Colonies were communal settlements in Iowa, started by radical German pietists, which lasted from 1855 to 1932. The Amana Corporation, manufacturer of refrigerators and household appliances, was originally started by the group. Other examples are Fountain Grove (founded in 1875), Riker's Holy City and other Californian utopian colonies between 1855 and 1955 (Hine), as well as Sointula in British Columbia, Canada. The Amish and Hutterites can also be considered an attempt towards religious utopia. A wide variety of intentional communities with some type of faith-based ideas have also started across the world.\nThe Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible depicts an eschatological time with the defeat of Satan and of evil. The main difference compared to the Old Testament promises is that such a defeat also has an ontological value (: \"Then I saw 'a new heaven and a new earth,' for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea...'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away\") and no longer just gnosiological (Isaiah : \"See, I will create/new heavens and a new earth./The former things will not be remembered,/nor will they come to mind\"). Narrow interpretation of the text depicts Heaven on Earth, or a Heaven brought to Earth without sin. Daily and mundane details of this new Earth, where God and Jesus rule, remain unclear, although it is implied to be similar to the biblical Garden of Eden. Some theological philosophers believe that heaven will not be a physical realm, but instead an incorporeal place for souls.\n\nThough Francis Bacon's \"New Atlantis\" is imbued with a scientific spirit, scientific and technological utopias tend to be based in the future, when it is believed that advanced science and technology will allow utopian living standards; for example, the absence of death and suffering; changes in human nature and the human condition. Technology has affected the way humans have lived to such an extent that normal functions, like sleep, eating or even reproduction, have been replaced by artificial means. Other examples include a society where humans have struck a balance with technology and it is merely used to enhance the human living condition (e.g. \"Star Trek\"). In place of the static perfection of a utopia, libertarian transhumanists envision an \"extropia\", an open, evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer.\n\nMariah Utsawa presented a theoretical basis for technological utopianism and set out to develop a variety of technologies ranging from maps to designs for cars and houses which might lead to the development of such a utopia.\n\nOne notable example of a technological and libertarian socialist utopia is Scottish author Iain Banks' Culture.\n\nOpposing this optimism is the prediction that advanced science and technology will, through deliberate misuse or accident, cause environmental damage or even humanity's extinction. Critics, such as Jacques Ellul and Timothy Mitchell advocate precautions against the premature embrace of new technologies. Both raise questions about changing responsibility and freedom brought by division of labour. Authors such as John Zerzan and Derrick Jensen consider that modern technology is progressively depriving humans of their autonomy, and advocate the collapse of the industrial civilization, in favor of small-scale organization, as a necessary path to avoid the threat of technology on human freedom and sustainability.\n\nThere are many examples of techno-dystopias portrayed in mainstream culture, such as the classics \"Brave New World\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\" often published as \"1984\", which have explored some of these topics.\n\nUtopias have been used to explore the ramifications of genders being either a societal construct, or a biologically \"hard-wired\" imperative, or some mix of the two. Socialist and economic utopias have tended to take the \"woman question\" seriously, and often to offer some form of equality between the sexes as part and parcel of their vision, whether this be by addressing misogyny, reorganizing society along separatist lines, creating a certain kind of androgynous equality that ignores gender, or in some other manner. For example, Edward Bellamy's \"Looking Backward\" (1887) responded, progressively for his day, to the contemporary women's suffrage and women's rights movements. Bellamy supported these movements by incorporating the equality of women and men into his utopian world's structure, albeit by consigning women to a separate sphere of light industrial activity (due to women's lesser physical strength), and making various exceptions for them in order to make room for (and to praise) motherhood. One of the earlier feminist utopias that imagines complete separatism is Charlotte Perkins Gilman's \"Herland\" (1915).\n\nIn science fiction and technological speculation, gender can be challenged on the biological as well as the social level. Marge Piercy's \"Woman on the Edge of Time\" portrays equality between the genders and complete equality in sexuality (regardless of the gender of the lovers). Birth-giving, often felt as the divider that cannot be avoided in discussions of women's rights and roles, has been shifted onto elaborate biological machinery that functions to offer an enriched embryonic experience, When a child is born, it spends most of its time in the children's ward with peers. Three \"mothers\" per child are the norm, and they are chosen in a gender neutral way (men as well as women may become \"mothers\") on the basis of their experience and ability. Technological advances also make possible the freeing of women from childbearing in Shulamith Firestone's \"The Dialectic of Sex\". The fictional aliens in Mary Gentle's \"Golden Witchbreed\" start out as gender-neutral children and do not develop into men and women until puberty, and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, Doris Lessing's \"The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five\" (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In \"My Own Utopia\" (1961) by Elizabeth Mann Borghese, gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex — genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men. \"William Marston's Wonder Woman comics of the 1940s featured Paradise Island, also known as Themyscira, a matriarchal all-female community of peace, loving submission, bondage, and giant space kangaroos.\"\n\nUtopian single-gender worlds or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences. In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female parthenogenic reproduction. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1915 novel approaches this type of separate society. Many feminist utopias pondering separatism were written in the 1970s, as a response to the Lesbian separatist movement; examples include Joanna Russ's \"The Female Man\" and Suzy McKee Charnas's \"Walk to the End of the World\" and \"Motherlines\". Utopias imagined by male authors have often included equality between sexes, rather than separation, although as noted Bellamy's strategy includes a certain amount of \"separate but equal\". The use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from patriarchy. The societies may be lesbian, such as \"Daughters of a Coral Dawn\" by Katherine V. Forrest, or not, and may not be sexual at all — a famous early sexless example being \"Herland\" (1915) by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Charlene Ball writes in \"Women's Studies Encyclopedia\" that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles in future societies has been more common in the United States compared to Europe and elsewhere, although such efforts as Gerd Brantenberg's \"Egalia's Daughters\" and Christa Wolf's portrayal of the land of Colchis in her \"Medea: Voices \"are certainly as influential and famous as any of the American feminist utopias.\n\nIn many cultures, societies, and religions, there is some myth or memory of a distant past when humankind lived in a primitive and simple state, but at the same time one of perfect happiness and fulfillment. In those days, the various myths tell us, there was an instinctive harmony between humanity and nature. People's needs were few and their desires limited. Both were easily satisfied by the abundance provided by nature. Accordingly, there were no motives whatsoever for war or oppression. Nor was there any need for hard and painful work. Humans were simple and pious, and felt themselves close to their God or gods. According to one anthropological theory, hunter-gatherers were the original affluent society.\n\nThese mythical or religious archetypes are inscribed in many cultures, and resurge with special vitality when people are in difficult and critical times. However, in utopias, the projection of the myth does not take place towards the remote past, but either towards the future or towards distant and fictional places, imagining that at some time in the future, at some point in space, or beyond death, there must exist the possibility of living happily.\n\nThese myths of the earliest stage of humankind have been referred to by various cultures, societies, and religions:\n\nThe Greek poet Hesiod, around the 8th century BC, in his compilation of the mythological tradition (the poem \"Works and Days\"), explained that, prior to the present era, there were four other progressively more perfect ones, the oldest of which was the Golden Age.\n\nPlutarch, the Greek historian and biographer of the 1st century, dealt with the blissful and mythic past of the humanity.\n\nFrom Sir Philip Sidney's prose romance \"The Old Arcadia\" (1580), originally a region in the Peloponnesus, Arcadia became a synonym for any rural area that serves as a pastoral setting, a \"locus amoenus\" (\"delightful place\").\n\nThe Biblical Garden of Eden as depicted in the Old Testament Bible's Book of Genesis 2 (Authorized Version of 1611):\n\n\"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. [...]\n\nAnd the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. [...]\n\nAnd the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; [...] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.\"\n\nAccording to the exegesis that the biblical theologian Herbert Haag proposes in the book \"Is original sin in Scripture?\", published soon after the Second Vatican Council, would indicate that Adam and Eve were created from the beginning naked of the divine grace, an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of preternatural gifts () with regard to the ophitic event, Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life.\n\nThe Land of Cockaigne (also Cockaygne, Cokaygne), was an imaginary land of idleness and luxury, famous in medieval stories, and the subject of several poems, one of which, an early translation of a 13th-century French work, is given in George Ellis' \"Specimens of Early English Poets\". In this, \"the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry, and the shops supplied goods for nothing.\" London has been so called (see Cockney), but Boileau applies the same to Paris.\n\nThe Peach Blossom Spring, a prose written by the Chinese writer Tao Yuanming (c. 220 - 589 CE), describes a utopian place. The narrative goes that a fisherman from Wuling sailed upstream a river and came across a beautiful blossoming peach grove and lush green fields covered with blossom petals. Entranced by the beauty, he continued upstream. When he reached the end of the river, he stumbled onto a small grotto. Though narrow at first, he was able to squeeze through the passage and discovered an ethereal utopia, where the people led an ideal existence in harmony with nature. He saw a vast expanse of fertile lands, clear ponds, mulberry trees, bamboo groves, and the like with a community of people of all ages and houses in neat rows. The people explained that their ancestors escaped to this place during the civil unrest of the Qin dynasty and they themselves had not left since or had contact with anyone from the outside. They had not even heard of the later dynasties of bygone times or the then-current Jin dynasty. In the story, the community was secluded and unaffected by the troubles of the outside world. The sense of timelessness was also predominant in the story as a perfect utopian community remains unchanged, that is, it had no decline nor the need to improve. Eventually, the Chinese term \"Peach Blossom Spring\" (桃花源) came to be synonymous for the concept of utopia.\n\nDatong is a traditional Chinese Utopia. The main description of it is found in the Chinese Classic of Rites, in the chapter called \"Li Yun\" (禮運). Later, Datong and its ideal of 'The World Belongs to Everyone/The World is Held in Common' 'Tianxia weigong/天下为公' 'influenced modern Chinese reformers and revolutionaries, such as Kang Youwei.\n\nSchlaraffenland is an analogous German tradition.\n\nAll these myths also express some hope that the idyllic state of affairs they describe is not irretrievably and irrevocably lost to mankind, that it can be regained in some way or other.\n\nOne way might be a quest for an \"earthly paradise\"—a place like Shangri-La, hidden in the Tibetan mountains and described by James Hilton in his utopian novel \"Lost Horizon\" (1933). Christopher Columbus followed directly in this tradition in his belief that he had found the Garden of Eden when, towards the end of the 15th century, he first encountered the New World and its indigenous inhabitants.\n\n\n"}

Founded by Dr. Ramón Artemio Bracho in Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay in 1958, the World Friendship Crusade celebrates Friendship Day every July 30.\n\nOn July 20, 1958, while out to dinner with friends in the town of Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay, Dr. Ramón Artemio Bracho proposed the idea of a World Friendship Day to his colleagues. On that night, the World Crusade of Friendship was founded, as an activist organization that would promote the idea of celebrating worldwide friendship on July 30. The organization lobbied the United Nations for many years, until finally, on July 27, 2011, the General Assembly of the United Nations assigned this date to celebrate the International Friendship Day.\n\n\"Día de la Amistad\" is celebrated every July 30 in Paraguay, where it is a popular festivity in which it is custom among Paraguayans to salute and wish each other's happiness throughout the day, while also exchanging presents.\n\nAnother classic activity during this celebration, particularly among young students, but also among other general groups (coworkers, companies, civil organizations, etc.), is the game of the \"invisible friend\", which is a variation of the popular Secret Santa. One week before the celebration, participants are invited to write their names on a piece of paper and then, after scrambling all these pieces in a basket or container, retrieve one of the names, without revealing it to the others. Participants then become the \"invisible friend\" of the person on that piece of paper, and during the week before the celebration, they are invited to write anonymous small notes or letters to the person whose name they selected. On the day of the celebration, invisible friends bring presents to their friends, and one after the other, reveal their identities before giving their presents.\n\n"}

Arizona's controversial SB 1070 law requiring people to carry identification was dubbed the \"Papers, Please\" law.
