Wilson\n\nAndrew Norman Wilson (born 27 October 1950) is an English writer and newspaper columnist known for his critical biographies, novels and works of popular history. He is an occasional columnist for the \"Daily Mail\" and a former columnist for the \"London Evening Standard\". He has been an occasional contributor to \"The Times Literary Supplement\", \"New Statesman\", \"The Spectator\" and \"The Observer\".\n\nWilson was born in Stone in Staffordshire to a father who became the managing director of Wedgwood, the pottery company. He was educated at Hillstone School, Great Malvern in Worcestershire, and Rugby School from the age of 13, where he read Mao and Marx in his spare time. While at Rugby, he wrote an article for the school magazine arguing that public schools should be abolished. The national press became interested in the story, with the \"Daily Express\" headlining its account \"Red rebel in Tom Brown's school\". \"Reporters arrived at the school gates, wanting to interview me, but my housemaster, wisely, would not let me talk to them,\" Wilson told Hunter Davies in 1993. After New College, Oxford, he taught English at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood for two years and then spent seven years as a lecturer in medieval literature at St Hugh's College and New College, Oxford. He married the Shakespearean scholar Katherine Duncan-Jones in 1971. They had two daughters, Emily Wilson (born 1971) and Beatrice \"Bee\" Wilson (born 1974), and divorced in 1990.\n\nA prolific journalist and author of non-fiction, Wilson has also written over twenty works of fiction, for which he has won the Somerset Maugham Prize and the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. His novels also include such historical works as \"The Potter’s Hand\" (a study of the family life of Josiah Wedgwood), \"Resolution\", a fictional account of Captain James Cook’s second voyage, and \"Scandal\" about the Profumo affair. His 2007 novel \"Winnie and Wolf\", about the relationship between Adolf Hitler and Richard Wagner's English daughter-in-law, was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize. Novels set in the present include \"The Vicar of Sorrows\", about a clergyman who has lost his faith dealing with the death of his mother, and \"Dream Children\" about paedophilia. \n\nIn the early 1990s, in the wake of the Fatwah against Salman Rushdie and the continuing troubles in Northern Ireland, Wilson published a pamphlet, \"Against Religion\", in the Chatto & Windus CounterBlasts series. He wrote biographies of Jesus and St Paul, and a history of atheism in the 19th century entitled \"God's Funeral\", describing its growth as due to influences ranging from David Hume to Sigmund Freud. These and many other of his books such as those on Leo Tolstoy (Whitbread Award for best biography of 1988), C. S. Lewis, Hilaire Belloc are simultaneously sympathetic to religious belief and critical of it.\n\nIn August 2006, Wilson's biography of John Betjeman was published. It was later discovered that another biographer, Bevis Hillier, had sent him a forged letter which was included in the book.\n\nIn 2001 Wilson published \"Dante in Love\" (2011) presenting a study of the great Italian poet, Dante Alighieri, as an artist and philosopher, also depicting an in-depth portrait of medieval Florence to help readers understand the literary and cultural background which engendered the Tuscan's masterpiece, \"The Divine Comedy\".\n\nIn addition to his many biographies, Wilson has written three books covering entire eras, \"The Victorians\" (2002), \"After the Victorians\" (2005), and \"The Elizabethans\" (2011). \n\nThe \"Daily Telegraph\" said that \"Wilson's forte is the character and he brilliantly conveys Betjeman's odd mixture of introspection and sociability, gaiety and melancholia, exhibition and self-disgust...\"\n\n\"The Times\" (London) called his book \"Resolution\" ‘a work of genius’.\n\nKathryn Hughes wrote in \"The Guardian\" of Wilson’s biography of Queen Victoria, \"\", ‘Subtle, thoughtful ... a shimmering and rather wonderful biography.’ Daisy Godwin in \"The Sunday Times\" review stated that, ‘This won't be the last biography of Victoria but it is certainly the most interesting and original in a long time’.\n\nWilson's \"\" was criticised by the historian Richard J. Evans in a review in the \"New Statesman\" for factual inaccuracies, lack of original research and analysis, and personal biases.\n\nWilson's biography \"Charles Darwin, Victorian Mythmaker\", (2017), was criticised by John van Wyhe in the \"New Scientist\" for confusing Darwin's theory of natural selection with Lamarckism at one point, as well as other scientific, historical and editorial errors. Kathryn Hughes in \"The Guardian\" described it as a \"cheap attempt to ruffle feathers\", with a dubious grasp of science and attempted character assassination. In \"The Evening Standard\", Adrian Woolfson says that \"..while for the greater part a lucid, elegantly written and thought-provoking social and intellectual history\" Wilson's \"speculations on evolutionary theory,\" produce a book that is \"fatally flawed, mischievous, and ultimately misleading\". Steve Jones, an emeritus of University College London, commented in \"The Sunday Times\": \"In the classic mould of the contrarian, he despises anything said by mainstream biology in favour of marginal and sometimes preposterous theories.\" The geneticist and former editor of \"Nature\", Adam Rutherford, called the book \"deranged\" and said Wilson \"would fail GCSE biology catastrophically.\"\n\nThe Lampitt Chronicles\n\n"}

Accelerator physics is a field of physics encompassing all the aspects required to design and operate the equipment and to understand the resulting dynamics of the charged particles. There are software packages associated with each such domain. There are a large number of such codes. The 1990 edition of the Los Alamos Accelerator Code Group's compendium provides summaries of more than 200 codes. Certain of those codes are still in use today although many are obsolete. Another index of existing and historical accelerator simulation codes is located at \n\nFor many applications it is sufficient to track a single particle through the relevant electric and magnetic fields.\nOld unmaintained codes include: BETA, AGS, ALIGN, COMFORT, DESIGN, DIMAD, GUINEA-PIG, HARMON, LEGO, LIAR, MAGIC, MARYLIE, PATRICIA, PETROS, PLACET, RACETRACK, SYNCH, TRACY and variants, TRANSPORT, TURTLE, and UAL.\nMaintained codes include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe self interaction (e.g. space charge) of the charged particle beam can cause growth of the beam, such as with bunch lengthening, or intrabeam scattering. Additionally, space charge effects may cause instabilities and associated beam loss. Typically the Poisson equation is solved at intervals during the tracking using Particle-in-cell algorithms. Space charge effects lessen at higher energies so at higher energies the space charge effects may be modeled using simpler algorithms that are computationally much faster than the algorithms used at lower energies.\nCodes that handle low energy space charge effects, including computation of growth values and instability thresholds, include:\n\nAt higher energies, space charge effects include Touschek scattering and coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR). Codes that handle higher energy space charge include:\n\nAn important class of collective effects may be summarized in terms of the beams response to an \"impedance\". An important job is thus the computation of this impedance for the machine. Codes for this computation include\n\nTo control the charged particle beam, appropriate electric and magnetic fields must be created. There are software packages to help in the design and understanding of the magnets, RF cavities, and other elements that create these fields. Codes include\n\nGiven the variety of modelling tasks, there is not one common data format that has developed.\nFor describing the layout of an accelerator and the corresponding elements, one uses a so-called \"lattice file\".\nThere have been numerous attempts at unifying the lattice file formats used in different codes. One unification attempt is the Accelerator Markup Language, and the Universal Accelerator Parser. Another attempt at a unified approach to accelerator codes is the UAL or Universal Accelerator Library.\n\nThe file formats used in\nMAD may be the most common, with translation routines available to convert to an input form needed for a different code. \nAssociated with the Elegant code is a data format called SDDS, with an associated suite of tools. If one uses a Matlab-based code, such as Accelerator Toolbox, one has available all the tools within Matlab.\n\nThere are many applications of particle accelerators. For example, two important applications are elementary particle physics and synchrotron radiation production. When performing a modeling task for any accelerator operation, the results of charged particle beam dynamics simulations must feed into the associated application. Thus, for a full simulation, one must include the codes in associated applications. For particle physics, the simulation may be continued in a detector with a code such as Geant4. \n\nFor a synchrotron radiation facility, for example, the electron beam produces an x-ray beam that then travels down a beamline before reaching the experiment. Thus, the electron beam modeling software must interface with the x-ray optics modelling software such as SRW, Shadow, McXTrace, or Spectra. Bmad can model both X-rays and charged particle beams. The x-rays are used in an experiment which may be modeled and analyzed with various software, such as the DAWN science platform. OCELOT also includes both synchrotron radiation calculation and x-ray propagation models.\n\n"}
{"id": "57621327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57621327", "title": "Antenna efficiency", "text": "Antenna efficiency\n\nIn antenna theory, antenna efficiency is most often used to mean radiation efficiency. In the context of antennas, one often just speaks of \"efficiency.\" It is a measure of the electrical efficiency with which a radio antenna converts the radio-frequency power accepted at its terminals into radiated power. Likewise, in a receiving antenna it describes the proportion of the radio wave's power intercepted by the antenna which is actually delivered as an electrical signal. It is not to be confused with aperture efficiency which applies to aperture antennas such as the parabolic reflector.\n\nRadiation efficiency is defined by IEEE Std 145-1993 \"Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas\" as \"The ratio of the total power radiated by an antenna to the net power accepted by the antenna from the connected transmitter.\" It is sometimes expressed as a percentage (less than 100), and is frequency dependent. It can also be described in decibels. \n\nFor wire antennas which have a defined radiation resistance the radiation efficiency is the ratio of the radiation resistance to the total resistance of the antenna including ground loss (see below) and conductor resistance. In practical cases the resistive loss in any tuning and/or matching network is often included, although network loss is strictly not a property of the antenna. \n\nFor other types of antenna the radiation efficiency is less easy to calculate and is usually determined by measurements. \n\nThe gain of an antenna is the directivity multiplied by the radiation efficiency, as described in Std 145-1993. \n\nFor monopole and other ground-based antennas, ground loss occurs due to ohmic resistance in the antenna's connection to its ground plane/counterpoise, including its mast or stalk and its bonding connections, as well as the ohmic resistance encountered by radio-frequency currents in the ground plane in the vicinity of the antenna.\n\nThis is a distinct concept applied to aperture antennas such as a parabolic antenna and is a measure of the reduction in power gain caused by non-uniform aperture illumination by the feed antenna. In a typical situation the reflector is illuminated with a reduced power-density at the edge compared with the centre, in order to reduce sidelobes and other effects. This causes a reduction in gain: the ratio of the gain of the tapered aperture distribution to the theoretical gain of a uniformly illuminated aperture is the aperture efficiency. \n"}
{"id": "867230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=867230", "title": "ArtRage", "text": "ArtRage\n\nArtRage is a bitmap graphics editor for digital painting created by Ambient Design Ltd. It is currently in version 5.0.5, and supports Windows, macOS and mobile Apple and Android devices and is available in multiple languages. It caters to all ages and skill levels, from children to professional artists. ArtRage 5 was announced for January 2017 and finally released in February 2017.\n\nIt is designed to be used with a tablet PC or graphics tablet, but it can be used with a regular mouse as well. Its mediums include tools such as oil paint, spray paint, pencil, acrylic, and others, using relatively realistic physics to simulate actual painting. Other tools include tracing, smearing, blurring, mixing, symmetry, different types of paper for the \"canvas\" (i.e. crumpled paper, smooth paper, wrinkled tin foil, etc.), as well as special effects, custom brushes and basic digital editing tools.\n\nArtRage is designed to be as realistic as possible. This includes varying thickness and textures of media and canvas, the ability to mix media, and a realistic colour blending option as well as the standard digital RGB blending. It includes a wide array of real life tools, as well as Stencils, scrap layers to use as scrap paper or mixing palettes and the option to integrate reference or tracing images. The later versions (Studio, Studio Pro and ArtRage 4) include more standard digital tools, such as Select, Transform, Cloner, Symmetry, Fill and custom brushes (\"Sticker\").\n\nEach tool is highly customisable, and comes with several presets. It is possible to share custom resources between users and there is a reasonably active ArtRage community that creates and shares presets, canvases, custom brushes, stencils, colour palettes and other resources.\n\nReal colour blending\n\nArtRage offers a realistic colour blending option as well as standard digital RGB based blending. It is turned off by default as it is memory intensive but can be turned on from the Tools menu. The most noticeable effect is that green is produced when yellow and blue are mixed.\n\nThe color picker supports HSL and RGB colors.\n\nOne of the less well known features of ArtRage is the custom resource options. Users can create their own versions of various resources and tools, or record scripts, and share them with other users. Users can save their resource collections as a Package File (.arpack), which acts similar to a ZIP file. It allows folders of resources to be shared and automatically installed. ArtRage can import some Photoshop filters, but not all. It only supports .ttf (TrueType Fonts) which it reads from the computer's fonts folder.\n\nPackage files do not work with versions earlier than 3.5. ArtRage Studio does not support Photoshop filters, or allow sticker creation, and has fewer options overall.\nAlternatively, individual resources can be shared directly. Most of the resources have specific file types.\n\nArtRage comes in seven current editions. The mobile apps are ArtRage for Android, ArtRage Oil Painter Free for Android, ArtRage for iPhone, and ArtRage for iPad. A version called ArtRage Touch is also available in the Windows App Store for Metro devices. The desktop versions are ArtRage Lite and ArtRage 4. A free demo version of ArtRage 4 is also available. ArtRage 1, ArtRage 2, ArtRage Studio and ArtRage Studio Pro have been discontinued.\n\nAmbient Design releases a new edition of ArtRage on three to four yearly upgrade cycle. There is a major free update halfway through this cycle (the X.5 edition) and ongoing free patches and minor updates. Some updates continue for the previous version, although support is slowly phased out over time. For example, backdated upgrades to Studio Pro included bug fixes, DRM removal for Steam users, and a fix to allow it to work properly on OS X Mavericks, and the iPad version was updated to include Retina support.\n\nArtRage is also available through Steam. It was part of the very first non-gaming software launch on Steam, on October 10, 2012. The Steam version does not include DRM and can be used without Steam running.\n\nArtRage 4 is available in several languages, but the manual is only available in English. The other versions have manuals available in assorted languages. Language is chosen when installing the program (except for the ArtRage 2 alternative editions).\n\nJapanese/Chinese are only available as Alternative Editions in ArtRage 2\n\nNew desktop editions of ArtRage are released approximately every three years, with a major .5 update being released halfway through. There is no official release schedule, and new updates are announced as they are ready. The latest edition is ArtRage 4.5, which was released 11 August 2014.\n\nFree demo versions\n\nThese were released alongside their respective editions, as trial software. The earlier editions have been discontinued, and only the current ArtRage 4 demo is now available. Work can only be exported to JPEG format and contains an ArtRage watermark. Images larger than 1280x1024 cannot be saved or exported.\n\n\nArtRage is only sold individually as an online download. It can be bought directly from the company website, or through Steam, but is not sold on any other websites. The free demo is only available from the main site. The mobile (iPad and iPhone) versions can only be bought via the Apple app store and cannot be registered on the ArtRage site. The Android version is available from the GALAXY Gift store for specific Samsung devices, and will be made available on the Samsung Apps and Google Play stores.\n\nUpgrading from ArtRage Lite or any pre-existing desktop editions gives a permanent 50% discount on ArtRage 4 (the most recent full desktop edition). This upgrade discount is handled separately by the Steam and the ArtRage stores, so users cannot currently switch between stores.\n\nTo upgrade, owners must register their serial number in the ArtRage members area (unless it is a Steam or mobile version). This also allows users to download both the macOS and the Windows versions of their software at any time, an unlimited number of times.\n\nSteam and mobile versions are updated through Steam and the App Store.\n\nThe ArtRage for Android app was released as part of a bundle deal with Samsung. It is free for the new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Samsung Galaxy Note Edge smartphones, distributed through the GALAXY Gifts store, and is available for purchase from the Galaxy App store for other Samsung devices. It was released for sale on the Google Play Store in February 2015.\n\nArtRage Lite comes free with the Wacom Intuos Draw tablet.\n\nThe older editions of ArtRage also come as bundled software with various devices.\nArtRage 2 and ArtRage Studio Pro are still available bundled with several WACOM graphics tablets, as well as various other devices, such as ASUS EP121 tablets, Sony VAIO Laptops, and Adesso Cybertablets. The serial numbers in these cases are handled by the companies distributing the hardware. ArtRage is usually provided as a software download, although it can come pre-installed or on an accompanying CD.\n\nA version of ArtRage called \"Ink Art\" was included in Microsoft's Experience Pack for the Tablet PC in 2005 and on some older Wacom tablets. Ink Art contained a subset of features offered in the full ArtRage program. Promethean Planet, an educator community, distributes a free version of ArtRage for classroom use on Promethean's range of interactive whiteboards..\n\nArtRage is included on the following models from the Sony Duo touchscreen range. \n\nArtRage 4.5 has full 64-bit support on Windows and Macs. There are also iOS supported versions for iPhone and iPad.\n\nArtRage for Android supports Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 and later.\n\nArtRage 4 supports various Wacom stylus features, although they may vary depending on the tool being used.\n\nArtRage for iPad supports four Bluetooth stylus brands, as well as the Apple Pencil, which has full pressure and tilt support. \n\nArtRage for Android supports the native Android system for pressure sensitivity, including the Samsung S Pen.\n\nThe desktop editions of ArtRage fully support the following Windows Graphics tablet and Tablet computer drivers:\n\nArtRage uses a proprietary file type, \".ptg\", which stands for \"painting\". It can only save as PTG and can only open PSD and PTG files using the File|Open command. However, images can be exported to the following formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF and Adobe Photoshop's .psd format. ArtRage can import all of these file types using the File > Import Image or Import Image as Layer command. Importing PTG files will open the PNG used for thumbnail images instead (this can be used to rescue images from corrupted PTG files).\n\"*Only when exported as an individual layer\"\n\nTransparency<br>\nArtRage supports transparency on imported files, but not on all exported files (for example, GIF and TIFF). It is often easier to export a transparent image as an individual layer, as the Canvas settings can save as opaque on full saves for some file types and in older editions.\n\nAmbient Design Ltd. is a New Zealand-based software development and publishing firm, specializing in creative applications and user interfaces for artists.

{"id": "3576610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3576610", "title": "Augoeides", "text": "Augoeides\n\nAugoeides is an obscure term meaning \"luminous body\" and thought to refer to the planets. Aleister Crowley considered the term to refer to the Holy Guardian Angel of Abramelin; the Atman of Hinduism the Daemon of the ancient Greeks. Robert Lomas associates the term with the \"Higher Self\" or soul of the individual \n\nIt appears that Porphyry used it and Thomas Taylor commented on it. The term is encountered in the literature of Neo-Platonic theurgy and was popularized in the 19th and 20th centuries by the Theosophists, Freemasons, and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.\n\nTo quote Thomas Taylor's comment on Porphyry:\n\nWe are afterwards sent through ample Elysium, and a few of us possess the joyful plains: till a long period, when the revolving orb of time has perfected its circulation, frees the soul from its concrete stains, and leaves the etherial sense pure, together with the fire (or splendour) of simple ether.\" For here he evidently conjoins the rational soul, or the etherial sense, with its splendid vehicle, or the fire of simple ether; since it is well known that this vehicle, according to Plato, is rendered by proper purgation 'augoeides', or luciform, and divine. It must here however be observed that souls in these meadows of asphodel, or summit of Pluto's empire, are in a falling state; or in other words through the secret influx of matter begin to desire a terrene situation. And this explains the reason why Hercules in the infernal regions is represented by Homer boasting of his terrene exploits and glorying in his pristine valour; why Achilles laments his situation in these abodes; and souls in general are engaged in pursuits similar to their employment on the earth: for all this is the natural consequence of a propensity to a mortal nature, and a desertion of the regions every way lucid and divine. Let the reader too observe, that, according to the arcana of the Platonic doctrine, the first and truest seat of the soul is in the intelligible world, where she lives entirely divested of body, and enjoys the ultimate felicity of her nature. And this is what Homer divinely insinuates when he says: \"after this I saw the Herculean power, or image: but Hercules himself is with the immortal gods, delighting in celestial banquets, and enjoying the beautiful-footed Hebe.\" Since for the soul to dwell with the gods, entirely separated from its vehicle, is to abide in the intelligible world, and to exercise, as Plotinus expresses it, the more sacred contests of wisdom.\n\nTo quote H.P. Blavatsky:\n\nThe most substantial difference consisted in the location of the immortal or divine spirit of man. While the ancient Neoplatonists held that the Augoeides never descends hypostatically into the living man, but only more or less sheds its radiance on the inner man – the astral soul – the Kabalists of the Middle Ages maintained that the spirit, detaching itself from the ocean of light and spirit, entered into man's soul, where it remained through life imprisoned in the astral capsule. This difference was the result of the belief of Christian Kabalists, more or less, in the dead letter of the allegory of the fall of man.\n\nIn referencing of the Hellenic origin of the word, it might be understood to emerge from 'αυγο', meaning 'egg', or 'αυγή', meaning 'dawn', combined of 'είδηση', indicative of 'news' or 'a message', and thus the connection in Aleister Crowley's mind between the 'egg message' and 'the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel' or 'higher & original (egg) genius' associated of one's human being. Combined of 'είδωλο', an 'idol' or 'reflection', one might see in it Plato's 'luminous being', a 'reflection of the dawn'. Such a direct etymology is, however, admittedly speculative and subject to revision or reconfirmation by another.\n\n\n"}

The word, \"Bhūmikā\", refers to a tablet or board for writing, subject, object or a receptacle, theatrical dress or an actor’s costume, decoration of an image, a preface or introduction to a book.\n\nAccording to the \"Sthaviravāda Saravastivada\" tradition of Buddhism amongst the 49/52 mental factors (\"Bhūmikās\") are the ten \"mahā-bhūmikās\" which are common to all consciousness are – \" Vedanā \" (feeling), \" Saññā \" (perception), \" Cetanā \" (volition), \" Phassa \" (contact), \" Chanda \" (desire to act), \" Paññā \" (wisdom), \" Sati \" (mindfulness), \" Manasikāra \" (attention), \" Adhimokkha \" (decision), \" Samādhi \" (mental concentration)or \" Ekaggata \" (one-pointedness),\n\nThe Upanishads speak about the seven \"bhūmikās\" or \"jñānabhūmis\" (fields of knowledge) or the seven stages of development of wisdom, and about the four kinds of \"jivanmuktas\". In Chapter IV of the Varahā Upanishad, with regard to the characteristics of \"jivanmukti\", Ribhu tells Nigadha that the first \"bhūmikā\" or stage of development is \"subhechchha\" or good desires; the second \"bhūmikā\" is \"vichārāna\" or inquiry; the third \"bhūmikā\" is \"tanumānasī\" or pertaining to the thinned mind; the fourth \"bhūmikā\" is \"sattvāpatti\" or the attainment of \"sattva\"; the fifth \"bhūmikā\" is \"asamśakti\" or non-attachment; the sixth \"bhūmikā\" is \"padārthabhāvanā\" or analysis of objects, and the seventh \"bhūmikā\" is \"turiya \" or the final stage. Nigadha is also told that the bhūmikā which is of the form of \"pranava \" is formed of \"akāra\", \"ukāra\", \"makāra\" and the \"ardhamātra\". The \"turiya\" essence of \"akāra\" embraces the first, second and the third \"bhūmikās\" whose function is called \"mumukshu\"; the \"turiya\" essence of \"ukāra\" embraces the fourth bhūmikā when the mind is firmly fixed on the non-dual and is called \"brahmavit\"; the \"turiya\" essence of \"makāra\" embraces the fifth \"bhūmikā\" or \"sushuptipada\" (dreamless sleep) and is called \"brahmavidvara\"; the \"turiya\" essence of \"ardhamātra\" embraces the sixth \"bhūmikā\" (dreamless state) and is called \"brahmavidvariya\", beyond which is the seventh \"bhūmikā\" or \"gudhasupti\" and is called \"brahmavidvarishta\" when one remains in the secondless state without fear and with his consciousness almost annihilated.\n\nYajna bhumika is the altar on which Vedic rituals are conducted.\n"}

When investors perceive that inflation risk or credit risk is rising they demand higher yields to compensate for the added risk. As a result, bond prices fall and yields rise, which increases the net cost of borrowing. The term references the ability of the bond market to serve as a restraint on the government's ability to over-spend and over-borrow.\n\nFrom October 1993 to November 1994 US 10-year yields climbed from 5.2% to just over 8.0% fueled by concerns about federal spending in what became informally known as the \"Great Bond Massacre\". With some guidance from Robert Rubin, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, the Clinton Administration and Congress made an effort to reduce the deficit. 10-year yields dropped to approximately 4% by November 1998. \n\nClinton political adviser James Carville said at the time that “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.\" \n\nDuring the Obama administration some suggest that bond vigilantes were making a return with worries over sustainability and budgetary responsibility. Mark MacQueen, a partner and money manager at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory Services Ltd., said “The vigilante group is different this time around. It’s major foreign creditors. This whole idea that we need to spend our way out of our problems is being questioned.\" However, economist Paul Krugman and other New Keynesians pointed out that there was no evidence for bond vigilante activity by pointing out the fact that 10-year yields remained quite low.\n\nDuring the Eurozone crisis that started in 2009, bond vigilantes were blamed for pushing up the government borrowing in the PIIGS countries. However Ed Yardini, who coined the term Bond Vigilantes in the 1980s, said that actions of central banks were able to keep rates low against the pressure of the vigilantes.\n"}
{"id": "43327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43327", "title": "Borel set", "text": "Borel set\n\nIn mathematics, a Borel set is any set in a topological space that can be formed from open sets (or, equivalently, from closed sets) through the operations of countable union, countable intersection, and relative complement. Borel sets are named after Émile Borel.\n\nFor a topological space \"X\", the collection of all Borel sets on \"X\" forms a σ-algebra, known as the Borel algebra or Borel σ-algebra. The Borel algebra on \"X\" is the smallest σ-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).\n\nBorel sets are important in measure theory, since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all Borel sets of that space. Any measure defined on the Borel sets is called a Borel measure. Borel sets and the associated Borel hierarchy also play a fundamental role in descriptive set theory.\n\nIn some contexts, Borel sets are defined to be generated by the compact sets of the topological space, rather than the open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many well-behaved spaces, including all Hausdorff σ-compact spaces, but can be different in more pathological spaces.\n\nIn the case \"X\" is a metric space, the Borel algebra in the first sense may be described \"generatively\" as follows.\n\nFor a collection \"T\" of subsets of \"X\" (that is, for any subset of the power set P(\"X\") of \"X\"), let\n\nNow define by transfinite induction a sequence \"G\", where \"m\" is an ordinal number, in the following manner:\n\nThe claim is that the Borel algebra is \"G\", where ω is the first uncountable ordinal number. That is, the Borel algebra can be \"generated\" from the class of open sets by iterating the operation\n\nto the first uncountable ordinal.\n\nTo prove this claim, note that any open set in a metric space is the union of an increasing sequence of closed sets. In particular, complementation of sets maps \"G\" into itself for any limit ordinal \"m\"; moreover if \"m\" is an uncountable limit ordinal, \"G\" is closed under countable unions.\n\nNote that for each Borel set \"B\", there is some countable ordinal α such that \"B\" can be obtained by iterating the operation over α. However, as \"B\" varies over all Borel sets, α will vary over all the countable ordinals, and thus the first ordinal at which all the Borel sets are obtained is ω, the first uncountable ordinal.\n\nAn important example, especially in the theory of probability, is the Borel algebra on the set of real numbers. It is the algebra on which the Borel measure is defined. Given a real random variable defined on a probability space, its probability distribution is by definition also a measure on the Borel algebra.\n\nThe Borel algebra on the reals is the smallest σ-algebra on R which contains all the intervals.\n\nIn the construction by transfinite induction, it can be shown that, in each step, the number of sets is, at most, the cardinality of the continuum. So, the total number of Borel sets is less than or equal to\n\nIn fact, the cardinality of the collection of Borel sets is equal to that of the continuum (compare to the number of Lebesgue measurable sets that exist, which is strictly larger and equal to formula_9).\n\nLet \"X\" be a topological space. The Borel space associated to \"X\" is the pair (\"X\",\"B\"), where \"B\" is the σ-algebra of Borel sets of \"X\".\n\nMackey defined a Borel space somewhat differently, writing that it is \"a set together with a distinguished σ-field of subsets called its Borel sets.\" However, modern usage is to call the distinguished sub-algebra \"measurable sets\" and such spaces \"measurable spaces\". The reason for this distinction is that the Borel sets are the σ-algebra generated by \"open\" sets (of a topological space), whereas Mackey's definition refers to a set equipped with an \"arbitrary\" σ-algebra. There exist measurable spaces that are not Borel spaces, for any choice of topology on the underlying space.\n\nMeasurable spaces form a category in which the morphisms are measurable functions between measurable spaces. A function formula_10 is measurable if it pulls back measurable sets, i.e., for all measurable sets \"B\" in \"Y\", formula_11 is a measurable set in \"X\".\n\nTheorem. Let \"X\" be a Polish space, that is, a topological space such that there is a metric \"d\" on \"X\" which defines the topology of \"X\" and which makes \"X\" a complete separable metric space. Then \"X\" as a Borel space is isomorphic to one of\n(This result is reminiscent of Maharam's theorem.)\n\nConsidered as Borel spaces, the real line R, the union of R with a countable set, and R are isomorphic.\n\nA standard Borel space is the Borel space associated to a Polish space. A standard Borel space is characterized up to isomorphism by its cardinality, and any uncountable standard Borel space has the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nFor subsets of Polish spaces, Borel sets can be characterized as those sets which are the ranges of continuous injective maps defined on Polish spaces. Note however, that the range of a continuous noninjective map may fail to be Borel. See analytic set.\n\nEvery probability measure on a standard Borel space turns it into a standard probability space.\n\nAn example of a subset of the reals which is non-Borel, due to Lusin (see Sect. 62, pages 76–78), is described below. In contrast, an example of a non-measurable set cannot be exhibited, though its existence can be proved.\n\nEvery irrational number has a unique representation by an infinite continued fraction\n\nwhere formula_13 is some integer and all the other numbers formula_14 are \"positive\" integers. Let formula_15 be the set of all irrational numbers that correspond to sequences formula_16 with the following property: there exists an infinite subsequence formula_17 such that each element is a divisor of the next element. This set formula_15 is not Borel. In fact, it is analytic, and complete in the class of analytic sets. For more details see descriptive set theory and the book by Kechris, especially Exercise (27.2) on page 209, Definition (22.9) on page 169, and Exercise (3.4)(ii) on page 14.\n\nAnother non-Borel set is an inverse image formula_19 of an infinite parity function formula_20. However, this is a proof of existence (via the axiom of choice), not an explicit example.\n\nAccording to P. Halmos, a subset of a locally compact Hausdorff topological space is called a \"Borel set\" if it belongs to the smallest σ–ring containing all compact sets.\n\nNorberg and Vervaat redefine the Borel algebra of a topological space formula_21 as the formula_22–algebra generated by its open subsets and its compact saturated subsets. This definition is well-suited for applications in the case where formula_21 is not Hausdorff. It coincides with the usual definition if formula_21 is second countable or if every compact saturated subset is closed (which is the case in particular if formula_21 is Hausdorff).\n\n\n\n"}

A chart can represent tabular numeric data, functions or some kinds of qualitative structure and provides different info.\n\nThe term \"chart\" as a graphical representation of data has multiple meanings:\n\nCharts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the relationships between parts of the data. Charts can usually be read more quickly than the raw data. They are used in a wide variety of fields, and can be created by hand (often on graph paper) or by computer using a charting application. Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others. For example, data that presents percentages in different groups (such as \"satisfied, not satisfied, unsure\") are often displayed in a pie chart, but may be more easily understood when presented in a horizontal bar chart. On the other hand, data that represents numbers that change over a period of time (such as \"annual revenue from 1990 to 2000\") might be best shown as a line chart.\n\nA chart can take a large variety of forms, however there are common features that provide the chart with its ability to extract meaning from data.\n\nTypically the data in a chart is represented graphically, since humans are generally able to infer meaning from pictures quicker than from text. Text is generally used only to annotate the data.\n\nOne of the most important uses of text in a graph is the title. A graph's title usually appears above the main graphic and provides a succinct description of what the data in the graph refers to.\n\nDimensions in the data are often displayed on axes. If a horizontal and a vertical axis are used, they are usually referred to as the x-axis and y-axis respectively. Each axis will have a scale, denoted by periodic graduations and usually accompanied by numerical or categorical indications. Each axis will typically also have a label displayed outside or beside it, briefly describing the dimension represented. If the scale is numerical, the label will often be suffixed with the unit of that scale in parentheses. For example, \"Distance traveled (m)\" is a typical x-axis label and would mean that the distance traveled, in units of meters, is related to the horizontal position of the data within the chart.\n\nWithin the graph a grid of lines may appear to aid in the visual alignment of data. The grid can be enhanced by visually emphasizing the lines at regular or significant graduations. The emphasized lines are then called major grid lines and the remainder are minor grid lines.\n\nThe data of a chart can appear in all manner of formats, and may include individual textual labels describing the datum associated with the indicated position in the chart. The data may appear as dots or shapes, connected or unconnected, and in any combination of colors and patterns. Inferences or points of interest can be overlaid directly on the graph to further aid information extraction.\n\nWhen the data appearing in a chart contains multiple variables, the chart may include a legend (also known as a key). A legend contains a list of the variables appearing in the chart and an example of their appearance. This information allows the data from each variable to be identified in the chart.\n\nFour of the most common charts are:\n\nThis gallery shows:\n\nOther common charts are:\n\nExamples of less common charts are:\n\nThis gallery shows:\n\nSome types of charts have specific uses in a certain field\n\nThis gallery shows:\n\nOther examples:\n\nSome of the better-known named charts are:\n\nSome specific charts have become well known by effectively explaining a phenomenon or idea.\n\nThere are dozens of other types of charts.

The individual parts, such as eyes, ears, mouth and nose represent values of the variables by their shape, size, placement and orientation. The idea behind using faces is that humans easily recognize faces and notice small changes without difficulty. Chernoff faces handle each variable differently. Because the features of the faces vary in perceived importance, the way in which variables are mapped to the features should be carefully chosen (e.g. eye size and eyebrow-slant have been found to carry significant weight).\n\nChernoff faces themselves can be plotted on a standard X-Y graph; the faces can be positioned X-Y based on the two most important variables, and then the faces themselves represent the rest of the dimensions for each item. Edward Tufte, presenting such a diagram, says this kind of Chernoff face graph would \"reduce well, maintaining legibility even with individual areas of .05 square inches as shown...with cartoon faces and even numbers becoming data measures, we would appear to have reached the limit of graphical economy of presentation, imagination, and let it be admitted, eccentricity.\"\n\nIn 1981, Bernhard Flury and Hans Riedwyl suggested 'asymmetrical' Chernoff faces; since a face has vertical symmetry (around the y-axis), the left side of the face is identical to the right and is basically wasted space – a point also made by Tufte. One could have the 18 variables that specify the left be one set of data, but use a different set of data for the right side of the face, allowing one face to depict 36 different measurements. They present results showing that such asymmetrical faces are useful in visualizing databases of identical twins, for example, and are useful in grouping as pairs of Chernoff faces would be.\n\nIn \"Visualizing Financial Data\", (), Julie Rodriguez and Piotr Kaczmarek use 'Chernoff Fish' where various parts of a cartoon fish are used to encode different financial details.\n\nIn the Peter Watts novel Blindsight a transhuman character is seen using Chernoff Faces. This is explained by the character as a more efficient method of representing data as a large portion of the human brain is devoted to facial recognition.\n\nIn the sci-fi short story Degrees of Freedom by Karl Schroeder, Chernoff Faces make a prominent appearances as a future technology supporting the communication of aggregate sentiment and perspective.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47971685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47971685", "title": "Extended evolutionary synthesis", "text": "Extended evolutionary synthesis\n\nThe extended evolutionary synthesis consists of a set of theoretical concepts more comprehensive than the earlier modern synthesis of evolutionary biology that took place between 1918 and 1942. The extended evolutionary synthesis was called for in the 1950s by C. H. Waddington, argued for on the basis of punctuated equilibrium by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge in the 1980s, and was reconceptualized in 2007 by Massimo Pigliucci and Gerd B. Müller.\n\nThe extended evolutionary synthesis revisits the relative importance of different factors at play, examining several assumptions of the earlier synthesis, and augmenting it with additional causative factors. It includes multilevel selection, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, niche construction, evolvability, and several concepts from evo-devo.\n\nNot all biologists have agreed on the need for, or the scope of, an extended synthesis. Many have collaborated on another synthesis in evolutionary developmental biology, which concetrates on developmental molecular genetics and evolution to understand how natural selection operated on developmental processes and deep homologies between organisms at the level of highly conserved genes.\n\nThe modern synthesis was the widely accepted early-20th-century synthesis reconciling Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and Gregor Mendel's theory of genetics in a joint mathematical framework. It established evolution as biology's central paradigm. The 19th-century ideas of natural selection by Darwin and Mendelian genetics were united by researchers who included Ronald Fisher, one of the three founders of population genetics, and J. B. S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, between 1918 and 1932. Julian Huxley introduced the phrase \"modern synthesis\" in his 1942 book, \"\".\n\nDuring the 1950s, the English biologist C. H. Waddington called for an extended synthesis based on his research on epigenetics and genetic assimilation. An extended synthesis was also proposed by the Austrian zoologist Rupert Riedl, with the study of evolvability. In 1978, Michael J. D. White wrote about an extension of the modern synthesis based on new research from speciation.\n\nIn the 1980s, the American palaeontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge argued for an extended synthesis based on their idea of punctuated equilibrium, the role of species selection shaping large scale evolutionary patterns and natural selection working on multiple levels extending from genes to species.\nThe ethologist John Endler wrote a paper in 1988 discussing processes of evolution that he felt had been neglected.\n\nSome researchers in the field of evolutionary developmental biology proposed another synthesis. They argue that the modern and extended syntheses should mostly center on genes and suggest an integration of embryology with molecular genetics an evolution, aiming to understand how natural selection operates on gene regulation and deep homologies between organisms at the level of highly conserved genes, transcription factors and signalling pathways. By contrast, a different strand of evo-devo following an organismal approach contributes to the extended synthesis by emphasizing (amongst others) developmental bias (both through facilitation and constraint), evolvability, and inherency of form as primary factors in the evolution of complex structures and phenotypic novelties.\n\nThe idea of an extended synthesis was relaunched in 2007 by Massimo Pigliucci, and Gerd B. Müller with a book in 2010 titled \"Evolution: The Extended Synthesis\", which has served as a launching point for work on the extended synthesis. This includes:\n\n\nOther processes such as evolvability, phenotypic plasticity, reticulate evolution, sex evolution and symbiogenesis are said by proponents to have been excluded or missed from the modern synthesis. The goal of Piglucci's and Müller's extended synthesis is to take evolution beyond the gene-centered approach of population genetics to consider more organism- and ecology-centered approaches. Many of these causes are currently considered secondary in evolutionary causation, and proponents of the extended synthesis want them to be considered first-class evolutionary causes. The biologist Eugene Koonin wrote in 2009 that \"the new developments in evolutionary biology by no account should be viewed as refutation of Darwin. On the contrary, they are widening the trails that Darwin blazed 150 years ago and reveal the extraordinary fertility of his thinking.\"\n\nThe extended synthesis is characterized by its additional set of predictions that differ from the standard modern synthesis theory:\n\n\nThe extended evolutionary synthesis is currently being tested by a group of scientists from eight institutions in Britain, Sweden and the United States. The £7.7 million project is supported by a £5.7 million grant from the John Templeton Foundation.\n\nThe project is headed by Kevin N. Laland at the University of St Andrews and Tobias Uller at Lund University. According to Laland what the extended synthesis \"really boils down to is recognition that, in addition to selection, drift, mutation and other established evolutionary processes, other factors, particularly developmental influences, shape the evolutionary process in important ways.\"\n\nBiologists disagree on the need for an extended synthesis. Opponents contend that the modern synthesis is able to fully account for the newer observations, whereas others criticize that the Extended synthesis is not radical enough. Proponents think that the conceptions of evolution at the core of the modern synthesis are too narrow. Proponents argue that even when the modern synthesis allows for the ideas in the extended synthesis, using the modern synthesis affects the way that biologists think about evolution. For example, Denis Noble says that using terms and categories of the modern synthesis distort the picture of biology that modern experimentation has discovered. Proponents therefore claim that the extended synthesis is necessary to help expand the conceptions and framework of how evolution is considered throughout the biological disciplines.\n\nDefend the extended synthesis\n\nCriticism of the extended synthesis\n\n"}

Even the very earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of agriculture, construction, and trade. Early standard units might only have applied to a single community or small region, with every area developing its own standards for lengths, areas, volumes and masses. Often such systems were closely tied to one field of use, so that volume measures used, for example, for dry grains were unrelated to those for liquids, with neither bearing any particular relationship to units of length used for measuring cloth or land. With development of manufacturing technologies, and the growing importance of trade between communities and ultimately across the Earth, standardized weights and measures became critical. Starting in the 18th century, modernized, simplified and uniform systems of weights and measures were developed, with the fundamental units defined by ever more precise methods in the science of metrology. The discovery and application of electricity was one factor motivating the development of standardized internationally applicable units. \n\nWeights and measures have taken a great variety of forms over the course of history, from simple informal expectations in barter transactions to elaborate state and supranational systems that integrate measures of many different kinds. Weights and measures from the oldest societies can often be inferred at least in part from archaeological specimens, often preserved in museums. The comparison of the dimensions of buildings with the descriptions of contemporary writers is another source of information. An interesting example of this is the comparison of the dimensions of the Greek Parthenon with the description given by Plutarch from which a fairly accurate idea of the size of the Attic foot is obtained. Because of the comparative volume of artifacts and documentation, we know much more about the state-sanctioned measures of large, advanced societies than we do about those of smaller societies or about the informal measures that often coexisted with official ones throughout history. In some cases, we have only plausible theories and we must sometimes select the interpretation to be given to the evidence.\n\nBy studying the evidence given by all available sources, and by correlating the relevant facts, we obtain some idea of the origin and development of the units. We find that they have changed more or less gradually with the passing of time in a complex manner because of a great variety of modifying influences. It is possible to group official measurement systems for large societies into historical systems that are relatively stable over time, including: the Babylonian system, the Egyptian system, the Phileterian system of the Ptolemaic age, the Olympic system of Greece, the Roman system, the British system, and the metric system.\n\nThe earliest known uniform systems of weights and measures seem all to have been created at some time in the 4th and 3rd millennia BC among the ancient peoples of Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, and perhaps also Elam (in Iran) as well.\n\nEarly Babylonian and Egyptian records and the Hebrew Bible indicate that length was first measured with the forearm, hand, or finger and that time was measured by the periods of the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies. When it was necessary to compare the capacities of containers such as gourds or clay or metal vessels, they were filled with plant seeds which were then counted to measure the volumes. When means for weighing were invented, seeds and stones served as standards. For instance, the carat, still used as a unit for gems, was derived from the carob seed.\n\nThe Egyptian cubit, the Indus Valley units of length referred to above and the Mesopotamian cubit were used in the 3rd millennium BC and are the earliest known units used by ancient peoples to measure length. The units of length used in ancient India included the dhanus, or dhanush (bow), the krosa (cry, or cow-call) and the yojana (stage).\n\nThe common cubit was the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. It was divided into the span of the hand or the length between the tip of little finger to the tip of the thumb (one-half cubit), the palm or width of the hand (one sixth), and the digit or width of the middle finger (one twenty-fourth). The Royal Cubit, which was a standard cubit enhanced by an extra palm—thus 7 palms or 28 digits long—was used in constructing buildings and monuments and in surveying in ancient Egypt. The inch, foot, and yard evolved from these units through a complicated transformation not yet fully understood. Some believe they evolved from cubic measures; others believe they were simple proportions or multiples of the cubit. In whichever case, the Greeks and Romans inherited the foot from the Egyptians. The Roman foot (~296 mm) was divided into both 12 \"unciae\" (inches) (~24.7 mm) and 16 digits (~18.5 mm). The Romans also introduced the \"mille passus\" (1000 paces) or double steps, the pace being equal to five Roman feet (~1480 mm). The Roman mile of 5000 feet (1480 m) was introduced into England during the occupation. Queen Elizabeth I (reigned from 1558 to 1603) changed, by statute, the mile to 5280 feet (~1609 m) or 8 furlongs, a furlong being 40 rod (unit)s (~201 m) of 5.5 yards (~5.03 m) each.\n\nThe introduction of the yard (0.9144 m) as a unit of length came later, but its origin is not definitely known. Some believe the origin was the double cubit, others believe that it originated from cubic measure. Whatever its origin, the early yard was divided by the binary method into 2, 4, 8, and 16 parts called the half-yard, span, finger, and nail. The association of the yard with the \"gird\" or circumference of a person's waist or with the distance from the tip of the nose to the end of the thumb of King Henry I (reigned 1100–1135) are probably standardizing actions, since several yards were in use in Britain.\nThere were also Rods, Poles and Perches for measurements of length. The following table lists the equivalents.\n\nThe grain was the earliest unit of mass and is the smallest unit in the apothecary, avoirdupois, Tower, and troy systems. The early unit was a grain of wheat or barleycorn used to weigh the precious metals silver and gold. Larger units preserved in stone standards were developed that were used as both units of mass and of monetary currency. The pound was derived from the mina used by ancient civilizations. A smaller unit was the shekel, and a larger unit was the talent. The magnitude of these units varied from place to place. The Babylonians and Sumerians had a system in which there were 60 shekels in a mina and 60 minas in a talent. The Roman talent consisted of 100 libra (pound) which were smaller in magnitude than the mina. The troy pound (~373.2 g) used in England and the United States for monetary purposes, like the Roman pound, was divided into 12 ounces, but the Roman uncia (ounce) was smaller. The carat is a unit for measuring gemstones that had its origin in the carob seed, which later was standardized at 1/144 ounce and then 0.2 gram. \n\nGoods of commerce were originally traded by number or volume. When weighing of goods began, units of mass based on a volume of grain or water were developed. The diverse magnitudes of units having the same name, which still appear today in our dry and liquid measures, could have arisen from the various commodities traded. The larger avoirdupois pound for goods of commerce might have been based on volume of water which has a higher bulk density than grain.\n\nThe stone, quarter, hundredweight, and ton were larger units of mass used in Britain. Today only the stone continues in customary use for measuring personal body weight. The present stone is 14 pounds (~6.35 kg), but an earlier unit appears to have been 16 pounds (~7.25 kg). The other units were multiples of 2, 8, and 160 times the stone, or 28, 112, and 2240 pounds (~12.7 kg, 50.8 kg, 1016 kg), respectively. The hundredweight was approximately equal to two talents. The ton of 2240 pounds is called the \"long ton\". The \"short ton\" is equal to 2000 pounds (~907 kg). A tonne (t) is equal to 1000 kg.\n\nThe division of the circle into 360 degrees and the day into hours, minutes, and seconds can be traced to the Babylonians who had sexagesimal system of numbers. The 360 degrees may have been related to a year of 360 days. Many other systems of measurement divided the day differently -- counting hours, decimal time, etc. Other calendars divided the year differently.\n\nDecimal numbers are an essential part of the metric system, with only one base unit and multiples created on the decimal base, the figures remain the same. This simplifies calculations. Although the Indians used decimal numbers for mathematical computations, it was Simon Stevin who in 1585 first advocated the use of decimal numbers for everyday purposes in his booklet \"De Thiende\" (old Dutch for 'the tenth'). He also declared that it would only be a matter of time before decimal numbers were used for currencies and measurements. His notation for decimal fractions was clumsy, but this was overcome with the introduction of the decimal point, generally attributed to Bartholomaeus Pitiscus who used this notation in his trigonometrical tables (1595).\n\nIn his \"Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language\", published in 1668, John Wilkins proposed a system of measurement that was very similar in concept to today's metric system. He proposed retaining the second as the basic unit of time and proposed that the length of a pendulum which crossed the zero position once a second (i.e. had a period of two seconds) should be the base unit of length. This length, for which he proposed the name \"standard\", would have been 994 mm. His base unit of mass, which he proposed calling a \"hundred\", would have been the mass of a cubic standard of distilled rainwater. The names that he proposed for decimal multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.\n\nIn 1670, Gabriel Mouton published a proposal that was in essence similar to Wilkins' proposal, except that his base unit of length would have been 1/1000 of a minute of arc (about 1.852 m) of geographical latitude. He proposed calling this unit the virga. Rather than using different names for each unit of length, he proposed a series of names that had prefixes, rather like the prefixes found in SI.\n\nIn 1790, Thomas Jefferson submitted a report to the United States Congress in which he proposed the adoption of a decimal system of coinage and of weights and measures. He proposed calling his base unit of length a \"foot\" which he suggested should be either or of the length of a pendulum that had a period of one second – that is or of the \"standard\" proposed by Wilkins over a century previously. This would have equated to 11.755 English inches (29.8 cm) or 13.06 English inches (33.1 cm). Like Wilkins, the names that he proposed for multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time. The great interest in geodesy during this era, and the measurement system ideas that developed, influenced how the continental US was surveyed and parceled. The story of how Jefferson's full vision for the new measurement system came close to displacing the Gunter chain and the traditional acre, but ended up not doing so, is explored in Andro Linklater's \"Measuring America\".\n\nThe metric system was first described in 1668 and officially adopted by France in 1799. Over nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it became the dominant system worldwide, although several countries, including the United States and China, continue to use their customary units. Among the numerous customary systems, many have been adapted to become an integer multiple of a related metric unit: The Scandinavian mile is now defined as 10 km, the Chinese jin is now defined as 0.5 kg, and the Dutch ons is now defined as 100 g. The American system is unusual in that its units have not been adapted in such a manner.\n\n"}

James Franklin has raised the scholarly issue, and mentions that there is a 17th-century reference in William Chillingworth's \"Religion of Protestants\" (1637), where he accuses unnamed scholastics of debating \"whether a Million of Angels may not fit upon a Needle's point?\"\nThis is earlier than a reference in the 1678 \"The True Intellectual System Of The Universe\" by Ralph Cudworth. HS Lang, author of \"Aristotle's Physics and its Medieval Varieties\" (1992), says (p. 284):\n\nPeter Harrison (2016) has suggested that the first reference to angels dancing on a needle's point occurs in an expository work by the English divine, William Sclater (1575-1626). \nIn \"An exposition with notes vpon the first Epistle to the Thessalonians\" (1619), Sclater claimed that scholastic philosophers occupied themselves with such pointless questions as whether angels \"did occupie a place; and so, whether many might be in one place at one time; and how many might sit on a Needles point; and six hundred such like needlesse points.\" \nHarrison proposes that the reason an English writer first introduced the \"needle’s point\" into a critique of medieval angelology is that it makes for a clever pun on \"needless point\".\n\nA letter written to \"The Times\" in 1975 identified a close parallel in a 14th-century mystical text, the \"Swester Katrei\":\n\nOther possibilities are that it is a surviving parody or self-parody, or a training topic in debating.\n\nIn Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, the conundrum of useless scholarly debates is linked to a similar question of whether angels are sexless or have a sex. \nSpanish jurist José Antonio Ramírez López (1908–1987) said about the story of the Byzantine empire: \"Everybody knows the idiotic and sometimes bloody discussions in that Empire on the sex of angels, about how many could perch at the same time on the head of a pin\".\n\nDorothy L. Sayers argued that the question was \"simply a debating exercise\" and that the answer \"usually adjudged correct\" was stated as, \"Angels are pure intelligences, not material, but limited, so that they have location in space, but not extension.\" Sayers compares the question to that of how many people's thoughts can be concentrated upon a particular pin at the same time. She concludes that infinitely many angels can be located on the head of a pin, since they do not occupy any space there:\n\nThe practical lesson to be drawn from the argument is not to use words like \"there\" in a loose, unscientific way, without specifying whether you mean \"located there\" or \"occupying space there.\"\n\nIn the humoristic magazine \"Annals of Improbable Research\", Anders Sandberg has presented a calculation based on theories of information physics and quantum gravity, establishing an upper bound of 8.6766×10 angels.\nComparing medieval superstition and modern science, George Bernard Shaw wrote in the introduction to the play \"Saint Joan\" that \"The medieval doctors of divinity who did not pretend to settle how many angels could dance on the point of a needle cut a very poor figure as far as romantic credulity is concerned beside the modern physicists who have settled to the billionth of a millimetre every movement and position in the dance of the electrons.\"\n\nIn the satirical novel \"Good Omens\" by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, the angel Aziraphale is said to be the only angel who could dance on the head of a pin, as he learned the gavotte in the 19th century. Also, in \"Carpe Jugulum\" by Terry Pratchett, Granny Weatherwax says the answer is 16 if it's an ordinary house pin.\n\n\"Weather Report Suite Part II: Let It Grow\", a song from the 1973 Grateful Dead album Wake of the Flood, includes the line \"As well to count the angels dancing on a pin.\"\n\nIn the comic book \"The Crow\" by James O'Barr, the main character asks this question to one of his victims before killing them, answering himself, \"Depends on the tune\".\n\nThe song \"Velodrome\" from Minnesota rapper Dessa's 2018 album Chime, references this question in the first verse asking, \"Aquinas, call on me/ How many angels on the/ Head of your pin?\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "506019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=506019", "title": "Image schema", "text": "Image schema\n\nAn image schema is a recurring structure within our cognitive processes which establishes patterns of understanding and reasoning. Image schemas are formed from our bodily interactions, from linguistic experience, and from historical context. The term is explained in Mark Johnson's book \"The Body in the Mind\"; in case study 2 of George Lakoff's \"Women, Fire and Dangerous Things\"; by Rudolf Arnheim in \"Visual Thinking\"; and more recently, by Tim Rohrer's 2006 book chapter \"Image Schemata in the Brain\".\n\nIn contemporary cognitive linguistics, an image schema is considered an embodied prelinguistic structure of experience that motivates conceptual metaphor mappings. Evidence for image schemas (also called \"image schemata\") is drawn from a number of related disciplines, including work on cross-modal cognition in psychology, from spatial cognition in both linguistics and psychology, cognitive linguistics, and from neuroscience.\n\nImage schemas are dynamic embodied patterns—they take place \"in\" and \"through\" time. Moreover, they are multi-modal patterns of experience, not simply visual. For instance, consider how the dynamic nature of the containment schema is reflected in the various spatial senses of the English word \"out\". \"Out\" may be used in cases where a clearly defined trajector (TR) leaves a spatially bounded landmark (LM), as in:\n\nIn the most prototypical of such cases the landmark is a clearly defined container. However, \"out\" may also be used to indicate those cases where the trajector is a mass that spreads out, effectively expanding the area of the containing landmark:\n\nFinally, \"out\" is also often used to describe motion along a linear path where the containing landmark is implied and not defined at all:\n\nExperientially basic and primarily spatial image schemas such as the Containment schema and its derivatives the Out schemas lend their logic to non-spatial situations. For example, one may metaphorically use the term \"out\" to describe non-spatial experiences:\n\nJohnson argues that more abstract reasoning is shaped by such underlying spatial patterns. For example, he notes that the logic of containment is not just a matter of being in or out of the container. For example, if someone is in a \"deep\" depression, we know it is likely to be a long time before they are well. The deeper the trajector is in the container, the longer it will take for the trajector to get out of it. Similarly, Johnson argues that transitivity and the law of the excluded middle in logic are underlaid by preconceptual embodied experiences of the Containment schema.\n\nIn case study two of his book \"Women, Fire and Dangerous Things\", Lakoff re-presented the analysis of the English word \"over\" done by Claudia Brugman in her (1981) master's thesis. Similar to the analysis of \"out\" given by Johnson, Lakoff argued that there were six basic spatial schemas for the English word \"over\". Moreover, Lakoff gave a detailed accounting of how these schemas were interrelated in terms of what he called a \"radial category structure\". For example, these six schemas could be both further specified by other spatial schemas such as whether the trajector was in contact with the landmark or not (as in \"the plane flew over the mountain\" vs. \"he climbed over the mountain\"). Furthermore, Lakoff identified a group of \"transformational\" image schemata such as rotational schemas and path to object mass, as in \"Spider-Man climbed all over the wall\". This analysis raised profound questions about how image schemas could be grouped, transformed, and how sequences of image schemas could be chained together in language, mind and brain.\n\nJohnson indicates that his analysis of \"out\" drew upon a 1981 doctoral dissertation by Susan Lindner in linguistics at UCSD under Ronald Langacker, and more generally by the theory of cognitive grammar put forth by him. For the force group of image schemas Johnson also drew on an early version of the force dynamic schemas put forth by Len Talmy, as used by linguists such as Eve Sweetser. Other influences include Max Wertheimer's gestalt structure theory and Kant's account of schemas in categorization, as well as studies in experimental psychology on the mental rotation of images.\n\nIn addition to the dissertation on \"over\" by Brugman, Lakoff's use of image schema theory also drew extensively on Talmy and Langacker's theories of spatial relations terms as well.\n\nWhile Johnson provided an initial list of image schemas in \"The Body in the Mind\" (p. 126), his diagrams for them are scattered throughout his book and he only diagrammed a portion of those image schemas he listed. In his work, Lakoff also used several additional schemas.\n\n"}

{"id": "634932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=634932", "title": "Infatuation", "text": "Infatuation\n\nInfatuation or being smitten is the state of being carried away by an unreasoned passion, usually towards another person for which one has developed strong romantic or platonic feelings.\n\nCox says that infatuation can be distinguished from romantic love only when looking back on a particular interest. Infatuation may also develop into a mature love. Goldstein and Brandon describe infatuation as the first stage of a relationship before developing into a mature intimacy. Phillips describes how the illusions of infatuations inevitably lead to disappointment when learning the truth about a lover. It is an object of extravagant, short-lived passion or the temporary love of an adolescent.\n\n'It is customary to view young people's dating relationships and first relationships as puppy love or infatuation'; and if infatuation is both an early stage in a deepening sequence of love/attachment, \"and\" at the same time a potential stopping point, it is perhaps no surprise that it is a condition especially prevalent in the first, youthful explorations of the world of relationships. Thus 'the first passionate adoration of a youth for a celebrated actress whom he regards as far above him, to whom he scarcely dares lift his bashful eyes' may be seen as part of an 'infatuation with celebrity especially perilous with the young'.\n\nAdmiration plays a significant part in this, as 'in the case of a schoolgirl crush on a boy or on a male teacher. The girl starts off admiring the teacher..[then] may get hung up on the teacher and follow him around'. Then there may be shame at being confronted with the fact that 'you've got what's called a crush on him...Think if someone was hanging around \"you\", pestering and sighing'. Of course 'sex may come into this...with an infatuated schoolgirl or schoolboy' as well, producing the 'stricken gaze, a compulsive movement of the throat...an \"I'm lying down and I don't care if you walk on me, babe\", expression' of infatuation. Such a cocktail of emotions 'may even falsify the \"erotic sense of reality\": when a person in love estimates his partner's virtues he is usually not very realistic...projection of all his ideals onto the partner's personality'.\n\nIt is this projection that differentiates infatuation from love, according to the spiritual teacher Meher Baba: \"In infatuation, the person is a \"passive victim\" of the spell of conceived attraction for the object. In love there is an \"active appreciation\" of the intrinsic worth of the object of love.\"\n\nDistance from the object of infatuation—as with celebrities—can help maintain the infatuated state. A time-honoured cure for the one who 'has a \"tendre\"...infatuated' is to have 'thrown them continually together...by doing so you will cure...[or] you will know that it is not an infatuation'.\n\nThree types of infatuation have been identified by Brown: the first, and perhaps most common, being a state of 'being 'carried away, without insight or proper evaluative judgement, by blind desire'. The second, 'evaluation...may well be sound although the craving or love remains unaffected by it'; while 'a third type is that of the agent who exhibits bad judgement and misevaluation for reasons such as ignorance or recklessness', regardless of their desire.\n\nIn psychoanalysis, a sign that the method is taking hold is 'the initial infatuation to be observed at the beginning of treatment', the beginning of transference. The patient, in Freud's words, 'develops a special interest in the person of the doctor...never tires in his home of praising the doctor and of extolling ever new qualities in him'. What occurs, 'it is usually maintained...is a sort of false love, a shadow of love', replicating in its course the infatuations of 'what is called true love'.\n\nSome however claim that it is wrong to convince the patient 'that their love is an illusion...that it's not you she loves. Freud was off base when he wrote that. It \"is\" you. Who else could it be?'—thereby taking 'the question of what is called true love...further than it had ever been taken'.\n\nConversely, in countertransference, the therapist may become infatuated with his/her client: 'very good-looking...she was the most gratifying of patients. She made literary allusions and understood the ones he made...He was dazzled by her, a little in love with her. After two years, the analysis ground down to a horrible halt'.\n\nInfatuations need not only involve people, but can extend to objects, activities, and ideas. 'Men are always falling in love with other men...with their war heroes and sport heroes': with institutions, discourses and role models. Thus for example Jung's initial '\"unconditional devotion\" to Freud's theories and his \"no less unconditional veneration\" of Freud's person' was seen at the time by both men as a 'quasi-religious infatuation to...a cult object'; while Freud in turn was 'very attracted by Jung's personality', perhaps 'saw in Jung an idealized version of himself': a mutual admiration society—'intellectually infatuated with one another'.\n\nA woman too might have 'had a hankering for one \"guru\" after another...she loved being a pupil.'\n\nBut there are also collective infatuations: 'we are all prone to being drawn into \"social phantasy systems\" '. Thus for instance 'the recent intellectual infatuation with structuralism and post-structuralism' arguably lasted at least until 'September 11 ended intellectual infatuation with postmodernism' as a whole.\n\nEconomic bubbles thrive on collective infatuations of a different kind: 'all boom-bust processes contain an element of misunderstanding or misconception', whether it is the 'infatuation with...becoming the latest dot.com billionaire', or the one that followed with subprime mortgages, once 'Greenspan had replaced the tech bubble with a housing bubble'. As markets 'swung virtually overnight from euphoria to fear' in the credit crunch, even the most hardened market fundamentalist had to concede that such 'periodic surges of euphoria and fear are manifestations of deep-seated aspects of human nature'—whether these are enacted in home-room infatuations or upon the global stage.\n\nShakespeare's sonnets have been described as a \"Poetics for Infatuation\"; as being dominated by one theme, and 'that theme is infatuation, its initiation, cultivation, and history, together with its peaks of triumph and devastation'—a lengthy exploration of the condition of being 'subject to the appropriate disorders that belong to our infatuation...the condition of infatuation.'\n\n"}

{"id": "6719257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6719257", "title": "Introduction to the mathematics of general relativity", "text": "Introduction to the mathematics of general relativity\n\nThe mathematics of general relativity is complex. In Newton's theories of motion, an object's length and the rate at which time passes remain constant while the object accelerates, meaning that many problems in Newtonian mechanics may be solved by algebra alone. In relativity, however, an object's length and the rate at which time passes both change appreciably as the object's speed approaches the speed of light, meaning that more variables and more complicated mathematics are required to calculate the object's motion. As a result, relativity requires the use of concepts such as vectors, tensors, pseudotensors and curvilinear coordinates.\n\nFor an introduction based on the example of particles following circular orbits about a large mass, nonrelativistic and relativistic treatments are given in, respectively, Newtonian motivations for general relativity and Theoretical motivation for general relativity.\n\nIn mathematics, physics, and engineering, a Euclidean vector (sometimes called a geometric or spatial vector, or – as here – simply a vector) is a geometric object that has both a magnitude (or length) and direction. A vector is what is needed to \"carry\" the point to the point ; the Latin word \"vector\" means \"one who carries\". The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points and the direction refers to the direction of displacement from to . Many algebraic operations on real numbers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and negation have close analogues for vectors, operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of commutativity, associativity, and distributivity.\n\nA tensor extends the concept of a vector to additional dimensions. A scalar, that is, a simple number without a direction, would be shown on a graph as a point, a zero-dimensional object. A vector, which has a magnitude and direction, would appear on a graph as a line, which is a one-dimensional object. A tensor extends this concept to additional dimensions. A two-dimensional tensor would be called a second-order tensor. This can be viewed as a set of related vectors, moving in multiple directions on a plane.\n\nVectors are fundamental in the physical sciences. They can be used to represent any quantity that has both a magnitude and direction, such as velocity, the magnitude of which is speed. For example, the velocity \"5 meters per second upward\" could be represented by the vector (in 2 dimensions with the positive axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is force, since it has a magnitude and direction. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as displacement, acceleration, momentum, and angular momentum. Other physical vectors, such as the electric and magnetic field, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a vector field.\n\nTensors also have extensive applications in physics:\n\nIn general relativity, four-dimensional vectors, or four-vectors, are required. These four dimensions are length, height, width and time. A \"point\" in this context would be an event, as it has both a location and a time. Similar to vectors, tensors in relativity require four dimensions. One example is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nIn physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a tuple, or list of numbers, which depend on some auxiliary coordinate system or reference frame. When the coordinates are transformed, for example by rotation or stretching of the coordinate system, then the components of the vector also transform. The vector itself has not changed, but the reference frame has, so the components of the vector (or measurements taken with respect to the reference frame) must change to compensate.\n\nThe vector is called \"covariant\" or \"contravariant\" depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of coordinates. \n\nIn Einstein notation, contravariant vectors and components of tensors are shown with superscripts, e.g. , and covariant vectors and components of tensors with subscripts, e.g. . Indices are \"raised\" or \"lowered\" by multiplication by an appropriate matrix, often the identity matrix.\n\nCoordinate transformation is important because relativity states that there is no one correct reference point in the universe. On earth, we use dimensions like north, east, and elevation, which are used throughout the entire planet. There is no such system for space. Without a clear reference grid, it becomes more accurate to describe the four dimensions as towards/away, left/right, up/down and past/future. As an example event, take the signing of the Declaration of Independence. To a modern observer on Mount Rainier looking east, the event is ahead, to the right, below, and in the past. However, to an observer in medieval England looking north, the event is behind, to the left, neither up nor down, and in the future. The event itself has not changed, the location of the observer has.\n\nAn oblique coordinate system is one in which the axes are not necessarily orthogonal to each other; that is, they meet at angles other than right angles. When using coordinate transformations as described above, the new coordinate system will often appear to have oblique axes compared to the old system.\n\nA nontensor is a tensor-like quantity that behaves like a tensor in the raising and lowering of indices, but that does not transform like a tensor under a coordinate transformation. For example, Christoffel symbols cannot be tensors themselves if the coordinates don't change in a linear way.\n\nIn general relativity, one cannot describe the energy and momentum of the gravitational field by an energy–momentum tensor. Instead, one introduces objects that behave as tensors only with respect to restricted coordinate transformations. Strictly speaking, such objects are not tensors at all. A famous example of such a pseudotensor is the Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor.\n\nCurvilinear coordinates are coordinates in which the angles between axes can change from point to point. This means that rather than having a grid of straight lines, the grid instead has curvature.\n\nA good example of this is the surface of the Earth. While maps frequently portray north, south, east and west as a simple square grid, that is not in fact the case. Instead, the longitude lines running north and south are curved and meet at the north pole. This is because the Earth is not flat, but instead round.\n\nIn general relativity, gravity has curvature effects on the four dimensions of the universe. A common analogy is placing a heavy object on a stretched out rubber sheet, causing the sheet to bend downward. This curves the coordinate system around the object, much like an object in the universe curves the coordinate system it sits in. The mathematics here are conceptually more complex than on Earth, as it results in four dimensions of curved coordinates instead of three as used to describe a curved 2D surface.\n\nIn a Euclidean space, the separation between two points is measured by the distance between the two points. The distance is purely spatial, and is always positive. In spacetime, the separation between two events is measured by the \"invariant interval\" between the two events, which takes into account not only the spatial separation between the events, but also their temporal separation. The interval, , between two events is defined as:\n\nwhere is the speed of light, and and denote differences of the space and time coordinates, respectively, between the events. The choice of signs for above follows the space-like convention (−+++). A notation like means . The reason is called the interval and not is that can be positive, zero or negative.\n\nSpacetime intervals may be classified into three distinct types, based on whether the temporal separation () or the spatial separation () of the two events is greater: time-like, light-like or space-like.\n\nCertain types of world lines are called geodesics of the spacetime – straight lines in the case of Minkowski space and their closest equivalent in the curved spacetime of general relativity. In the case of purely time-like paths, geodesics are (locally) the paths of greatest separation (spacetime interval) as measured along the path between two events, whereas in Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds, geodesics are paths of shortest distance between two points. The concept of geodesics becomes central in general relativity, since geodesic motion may be thought of as \"pure motion\" (inertial motion) in spacetime, that is, free from any external influences.\n\nThe covariant derivative is a generalization of the directional derivative from vector calculus. As with the directional derivative, the covariant derivative is a rule, which takes as its inputs: (1) a vector, , (along which the derivative is taken) defined at a point , and (2) a vector field, , defined in a neighborhood of . The output is a vector, also at the point . The primary difference from the usual directional derivative is that the covariant derivative must, in a certain precise sense, be independent of the manner in which it is expressed in a coordinate system.\n\nGiven the covariant derivative, one can define the parallel transport of a vector at a point along a curve starting at . For each point of , the parallel transport of at will be a function of , and can be written as , where . The function is determined by the requirement that the covariant derivative of along is 0. This is similar to the fact that a constant function is one whose derivative is constantly 0.\n\nThe equation for the covariant derivative can be written in terms of Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols find frequent use in Einstein's theory of general relativity, where spacetime is represented by a curved 4-dimensional Lorentz manifold with a Levi-Civita connection. The Einstein field equations – which determine the geometry of spacetime in the presence of matter – contain the Ricci tensor. Since the Ricci tensor is derived from the Riemann tensor, which can be written in terms of Christoffel symbols, a calculation of the Christoffel symbols is essential. Once the geometry is determined, the paths of particles and light beams are calculated by solving the geodesic equations in which the Christoffel symbols explicitly appear.\n\nIn general relativity, a geodesic generalizes the notion of a \"straight line\" to curved spacetime. Importantly, the world line of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational force, is a particular type of geodesic. In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.\n\nIn general relativity, gravity can be regarded as not a force but a consequence of a curved spacetime geometry where the source of curvature is the stress–energy tensor (representing matter, for instance). Thus, for example, the path of a planet orbiting around a star is the projection of a geodesic of the curved 4-dimensional spacetime geometry around the star onto 3-dimensional space.\n\nA curve is a geodesic if the tangent vector of the curve at any point is equal to the parallel transport of the tangent vector of the base point.\n\nThe Riemann tensor tells us, mathematically, how much curvature there is in any given region of space. Contracting the tensor produces 3 different mathematical objects:\n\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of the covariant derivative.\n\nThe Einstein tensor is a rank-2 tensor defined over pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. In index-free notation it is defined as\n\nwhere is the Ricci tensor, is the metric tensor and is the scalar curvature. It is used in the Einstein field equations.\n\nThe stress–energy tensor (sometimes stress–energy–momentum tensor or energy–momentum tensor) is a tensor quantity in physics that describes the density and flux of energy and momentum in spacetime, generalizing the stress tensor of Newtonian physics. It is an attribute of matter, radiation, and non-gravitational force fields. The stress–energy tensor is the source of the gravitational field in the Einstein field equations of general relativity, just as mass density is the source of such a field in Newtonian gravity.\n\nThe Einstein field equations (EFE) or Einstein's equations are a set of 10 equations in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity which describe the fundamental interaction of gravitation as a result of spacetime being curved by matter and energy. First published by Einstein in 1915 as a tensor equation, the EFE equate local spacetime curvature (expressed by the Einstein tensor) with the local energy and momentum within that spacetime (expressed by the stress–energy tensor).\n\nThe Einstein Field Equations can be written as\n\nwhere is the Einstein tensor and is the stress–energy tensor.\n\nThis implies that the curvature of space (represented by the Einstein tensor) is directly connected to the presence of matter and energy (represented by the stress–energy tensor).\n\nIn Einstein's theory of general relativity, the Schwarzschild metric (also Schwarzschild vacuum or Schwarzschild solution), is a solution to the Einstein field equations which describes the gravitational field outside a spherical mass, on the assumption that the electric charge of the mass, the angular momentum of the mass, and the universal cosmological constant are all zero. The solution is a useful approximation for describing slowly rotating astronomical objects such as many stars and planets, including Earth and the Sun. The solution is named after Karl Schwarzschild, who first published the solution in 1916.\n\nAccording to Birkhoff's theorem, the Schwarzschild metric is the most general spherically symmetric, vacuum solution of the Einstein field equations. A Schwarzschild black hole or static black hole is a black hole that has no charge or angular momentum. A Schwarzschild black hole is described by the Schwarzschild metric, and cannot be distinguished from any other Schwarzschild black hole except by its mass.\n\n\n"}

He is an associate member of Euskaltzaindia since 1983. Despite being the best known local academic proponent of reversing language shift measures, he has never held a stable university post in the Basque Country.\n\nNicknamed Txepetx (wren in Basque language), he is an Anglo-Germanic Philology graduate from the University of Salamanca and Basque Philology doctorate from the University of the Basque Country, he has served as a Spanish teacher in Scotland, scientific English teacher at the University of Granada, Basque teacher in a rural school of Navarre, and professor of modern languages and literature of Secondary Education in the Basque Autonomous Community and elsewhere in Spain.\n\nHis research on sociolinguistics, the theory of bilingualism and existential linguistics, includes the following works: \"El estado actual del vascuence en la provincia de Navarra (1970)\" [The current state of Basque language in Navarre (1970)] (1972), \"Bilingüismo, diglosia y contacto de lenguas\" [Bilingualism, diglossia, and language contact] (\"ASJU\", 1974), \"Lengua y pueblo\" [Language and people] (1980) with articles from 1977 originally published in \"Punto y Hora de Euskal Herria\" magazine, \"El marco sociológico y espacial en una situación bilingüe\" [The sociological and spatial context in a bilingual setting] (UPV/EHU, 1980), and \"El espacio bilingüe\" [The bilingual space] (1981).\n\nSánchez Carrión's insistence on the necessity of compacting Basque speakers has been often cited by advocates of the territorial principle of linguistic rights. Significantly the only article in the 1982 Basque Autonomous Community Law for the Normalisation of the use of the Basque language based on the territorial principle, was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Spain.\n\nFar removed from the variational sociolinguistics as from ideological interpretations, he attempts to answer with new perspectives to the problem of why and how languages live and die. He's been a proponent of ecolinguistics since the mid-eighties of the 20th century. However, his most notorious work is his doctoral thesis \"Un futuro para nuestro pasado\" [A future for our past] (1987), as it has offered to many Basque language loyalists a theoretical framework for their activity. Further expanding the sociohistorical linguistics approach of his doctoral thesis, he wrote \"Las lenguas vistas desde la historia versus la historia vista desde las lenguas\" [Languages seen from the point of view of history versus history seen from the point of view of languages] (EI-SEV, 1992). In 1999 the Bilbao City Council published Sánchez Carrión's book \"Aplicación sociolingüística de la territorialidad\" [Sociolinguistic application of territoriality].\n\nSánchez Carrión's importance for the Basque studies was stressed early on by scholar Koldo Mitxelena, and this acknowledgment has continued thereafter. The Basque association Garabide Elkartea participated in the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in April 2010, where it presented the book \"The Basque experience\", which makes extensive use of Sánchez Carrión's sociolinguistics.\n\nIn 2013 he published a book about religion and theology entitled \"Le code Jean le Baptiste\" [Code John the Baptist] translated into French by Alain Masson.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "734706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=734706", "title": "Kenosis", "text": "Kenosis\n\nIn Christian theology, kenosis (Greek: , \"kénōsis\", lit. [the act of emptying]) is the 'self-emptying' of Jesus' own will and becoming entirely receptive to God's divine will.\n\nThe word (\"ekénōsen\") is used in Philippians 2:7, \"<nowiki>[</nowiki>Jesus<nowiki>]</nowiki> made himself nothing ...\" (NIV) or \"...[he] emptied himself...\" (NRSV), using the verb form (\"kenóō\") \"to empty\". \n\nEtymology is from Greek (\"kenóō\") \"to empty out\". The Liddell–Scott Greek–English Lexicon gives the following simplified definition simplified for the noun:\n\nThe New Testament does not use the actual noun \"kénōsis\" but the verb form \"kenóō\" occurs five times (Ro.4:14, 1Co.1:17, 9:15, 2Co.9:3, Phil.2:7). Of these five times it is Phil 2:7, in which Jesus is said to have \"emptied himself\", which is the starting point of Christian ideas of kenosis.\n\nJohn the Baptist displayed the attitude when he said of Jesus, \"He must become greater; I must become less.\" (Jn 3:30).\n\nThe kenotic ethic is the ethic of Jesus, considered as the ethic of sacrifice. The Philippians passage urges believers to imitate Christ's self-emptying. In this interpretation, Paul was not primarily putting forth a theory about God in this passage, rather he was using God's humility exhibited in the incarnation event as a call for Christians to be similarly subservient to others.\n\nIn Christian theology, \"kenosis\" is the concept of the 'self-emptying' of one's own will and becoming entirely receptive to God and the divine will. It is used both as an explanation of the Incarnation, and an indication of the nature of God's activity and will. Mystical theologian John of the Cross' work \"Dark Night of the Soul\" is a particularly lucid explanation of God's process of transforming the believer into the icon or \"likeness of Christ\".\n\nThe Orthodox Mystical Theology of the East emphasises following the example of Christ. Kenosis is only possible through humility and presupposes that one seeks union with God. The Poustinia tradition of the Russian Orthodox Church is one major expression of this search.\n\nKenosis is not only a Christological issue in Orthodox theology, it has moreover to do with Pneumatology, namely to do with the Holy Spirit. Kenosis, relative to the human nature, denotes the continual epiklesis and self-denial of one's own human will and desire. With regard to Christ, there is a kenosis of the Son of God, a condescension and self-sacrifice for the redemption and salvation of all humanity. Humanity can also participate in God's saving work through theosis; becoming holy by grace.\n\nTherefore, in Eastern Orthodoxy, theosis never concerns becoming like God in essence or being, which is pantheism; instead, it concerns becoming united to God by grace, through his Energies. Orthodox theology distinguishes between divine Essence and Energies. Kenosis therefore is a paradox and a mystery since \"emptying oneself\" in fact fills the person with divine grace and results in union with God. Kenosis in Orthodox theology is the transcending or detaching of oneself from the world or the passions, it is a component of dispassionation. Much of the earliest debates between the Arian and Orthodox Christians were over kenosis. The need for clarification about the human and divine nature of the Christ (see the hypostatic union) were fought over the meaning and example that Christ set, as an example of kenosis or ekkenosis.\n\nAnother perspective is the idea that God is self-emptying. He poured out himself to create the cosmos and the universe, and everything within it. Therefore, it is our duty to pour out ourselves. (This is similar to C.S. Lewis's statement in \"Mere Christianity\" that a painter pours his ideas out in his work, and yet remains quite a distinct being from his painting.)\n\nPope Pius XII in 1951 wrote \"Sempiternus Rex Christus\", in which he condemns a particular interpretation of Philippians in regards to the kenosis:\n\nThere is another enemy of the faith of Chalcedon, widely diffused outside the fold of the Catholic religion. This is an opinion for which a rashly and falsely understood sentence of St. Paul's Epistle to the Philippians (ii, 7), supplies a basis and a shape. This is called the kenotic doctrine, and according to it, they imagine that the divinity was taken away from the Word in Christ. It is a wicked invention, equally to be condemned with the Docetism opposed to it. It reduces the whole mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption to empty the bloodless imaginations. 'With the entire and perfect nature of man'—thus grandly St. Leo the Great—'He Who was true God was born, complete in his own nature, complete in ours' (Ep. xxviii, 3. PL. Liv, 763. Cf. Serm. xxiii, 2. PL. lvi, 201).\n\nSince some forms of Unitarianism do not accept the personal pre-existence of Christ their interpretations of Phil. 2:7, and the concept of \"kenosis\", Christ \"emptying\" himself, take as a starting point that his \"emptying\" occurred in life, and not before birth. However, as Thomas Belsham put it, there are varying views on when in life this emptying occurred. Belsham took this to be at the crucifixion, whereas Joseph Priestley took this to be in the Garden of Gethsemane when Christ did not resist arrest. The Christadelphian Tom Barling considered that the \"emptying\" of Christ was a continual process which started in the earliest references to Christ's character, Luke 2:40,52, and continued through the temptations of Christ and his ministry.\n\nThe equivalent to kenōsis in Gnostic literature is Christ's withdrawal of his own luminosity into himself, so as to cease dazzling his own disciples. At the request of his disciples, \"Jesus drew to himself the glory of his light\". There are parallels to this voluntary withdrawal of the incarnate deity's light in the literatures of other religions also, such as in Daoism, where when the incarnate deity \"Crane Boy\" came to the world of humans in his incarnation as Han Xiangzi, he \"concealed his auspicious light, left the underworld, and returned to the world of humans.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "19045573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19045573", "title": "Languages of Catalonia", "text": "Languages of Catalonia\n\nThere are four languages with official status in Catalonia (an autonomous community of Spain): Catalan; Spanish- which is official throughout Spain; Aranese, a dialect of Occitan spoken in the Aran Valley; and Catalan Sign Language. Many other languages are spoken in Catalonia as a result of recent immigration from all over the world.\n\nCatalan has enjoyed special status since the approval of the Statute of Autonomy of 1979 which declares it to be the language \"proper to Catalonia\". Spanish had been the only official language for most of the period between the 18th century and 1975.\n\nAccording to a 2008 survey, in everyday use, 45.9% of the population usually spoke Spanish, while 35.6% usually employed Catalan, and 12% of the population used either language habitually.\n\nOver 45% of respondents used Spanish to address their parents (versus 36% who choose Catalan). This is attributed to extensive migration from other areas in Spain during the second half of the 20th century, as a consequence of which many Catalans have one or both parents born outside Catalonia. However, a majority (52.6%) used Catalan with their children (compared to 42.3% for Spanish). This can be attributed to some Spanish-speaking citizens shifting from their native language to Catalan at home.\n\nOutside the family, 48.6% of the population indicated that they addressed strangers exclusively or preferentially in Catalan, while the proportion of those who used Spanish was 41.7%, and 8.6% claimed to use both equally.\n\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia was large-scale migration from the rest of Spain during the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. Spanish has historically been spoken among a minority of civil servants born in other regions in Spain and among segments of the wealthiest bourgeoisie. Spanish has also been spoken as a second language by most Catalans, as it has been the only official language over long periods since the eighteenth century.\n\nIt has been calculated that the total population of Catalonia with no migration would have grown from 2 million people in 1900 to just 2.4 million in 1980, 39% of the real population of 6.1 million for that date, which was over 7.5 million in 2016. As a consequence, there exists a somewhat different identity for those whose native language is Catalan and those whose native language is Spanish, though it has been increasingly difficult to delineate the two groups; furthermore, there is a small but growing number of Catalans who consider both to be their mother tongue. According to anthropologist Kathryn Woolard, who has studied these identities, Catalans tend to classify anyone as either \"castellà\" (that is, having Spanish as their native language) or \"català\" (that is, having Catalan as their native language).\nThe claim that the population would have only increased 20% from 1900 to 1980 is disputable since the population of Spain as a whole doubled from 18 to 37 million even allowing for high levels of emigration from the province to the Western Hemisphere and Europe.\n\nAccording to the linguistic census elaborated by the Government of Catalonia corresponding to 2008, 45.92% of citizens over 15 years old declared Spanish as their [only] habitual language of use, versus 35.64% for Catalan, with 11.95% of complete bilinguals; a larger number claims Catalan as \"their own language\" (37.25% Catalan compared to 46.53% Spanish and 8.81% bilinguals).\n\nLastly, since the Statute of Autonomy of 1979, Aranese—a Gascon Occitan dialect—has been official and subject to special protection in the Aran Valley. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants was the only place where Occitan (spoken mainly in France and some Italian valleys) received full official status. However, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Aranese became official throughout Catalonia.\n\nAccording to the government of Catalonia, Spanish, locally known as Castilian, is currently the most spoken language in Catalonia (45.9% daily users of Spanish vs. 35.6% daily users of Catalan vs. 11% daily users of both Spanish and Catalan) and especially in the Barcelona metropolitan area, as well as native language and usual language of many Catalan citizens. This language is widely prevalent in the press, cinema and in daily life.\n\nSpanish is the language that Catalan citizens can read and write the most, due to the fact that until the 1980s it was the only language used in school and in all official communications.\n\nThe Spanish language developed from Vulgar Latin in the North of the Iberian Peninsula, expanding quickly to the South. It has lexical influences from Arabic and possible substrate influences from Basque and (to a lesser extent) Celtiberian. It has been the only official language in Spain for most periods since the eighteenth century.\n\nAccording to the official government of Catalonia, Catalan is the second most spoken language of the region, after Spanish (over 35% of Catalans use exclusively Catalan as their first language, while 11% of Catalans use equally both Catalan and Spanish). It is the most spoken language in many comarques of Catalonia, with the exception of the Barcelona metropolitan area (Barcelonès plus surrounding comarques) and Camp de Tarragona. Catalan is a compulsory subject in schools and enjoys equals rights with Spanish throughout Catalonia.\n\nSince the death of Franco and the approval of a new democratic Constitution in Spain, Catalan has experienced a new revival in its usage, first, due to the liberalisation and devolution of the Catalan linguistic and cultural institutions, and second, to their promotion. However, some political activists claim that Catalan-speaking people continue suffering some types of discrimination, as explained in the European Parliament on January 29, 2014. \n\nCatalan, a Romance language, is regarded by some Iberian linguists as belonging to the Iberian Romance sub-family (which also includes Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, and Aragonese), while others (especially Occitanists) classify it within the Gallo-Romance sub-family (which includes French, Occitan and Gallo-Italian) languages. It shares attributes with both linguistic groups.\n\nAccording to the 2001 Linguistic Census, about 5,900,000 people in Catalonia (nearly 95% of the population) understand the Catalan language. The percentage of people aged two and older who can speak, read and write Catalan is as follows:\nAs a result of the ongoing linguistic policies favouring Catalan, implemented in various degrees by the autonomous government during the last 20 years, knowledge of Catalan has advanced significantly in all these areas, with the ability to write it having experienced the most pronounced increase, from 31.6% of the population in 1986 to 49.8% in 2001.\n\nBy age groups, those between 10 and 29 have the highest level of Catalan-language literacy (e.g., 98.2% aged 10–14 understand it, and 85.2% can write it); this is attributed to these individuals having received their education in Catalan.\n\nGeographically, Catalan is understood in northwest Catalonia (High Pyrenees, Aran Valley), at 97.4%, followed by south and western Catalonia, whereas Barcelona's metropolitan area sees the lowest knowledge, at 93.8%. The situation is analogous for written-language skills, with central Catalonia scoring the highest percentages (61.4%), and Barcelona the lowest (46.4%).\n\nBarcelona is one of the main centres of the Spanish publishing industry for both Spanish-language and Catalan-language publishing.\n\nAccording to the 2001 Aranese Linguistic Census, knowledge of Aranese in the Occitan-speaking territory of Aran is as follows:\n\nCompared to previous data from 1996, the number of those able to understand Aranese has declined slightly (90.5% in 1996), while at the same time there has been a marginal increase in the number of those able to write it (24.97% in 1996).\n\nBy age groups, the largest percentage of those with knowledge of Aranese is in the 15-19 and 65-69 groups (both above 96%), while those aged 30–34 score lowest (just over 80%). Literacy is higher in the 10-19 group with over 88% declaring themselves able to read, and 76% able to write Aranese. Those over 80 are the least literate, with only about 1.5% of them being able to write the language.\n\nIn everyday use, according to 2008 data, Spanish is the main language in the Aran valley, habitually spoken by 38% of the population, then followed by Aranese, spoken by 23.4% of the population. In Aran, Catalan is the third language, habitually spoken by 16% of the population.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, about 18,000 deaf Catalans use Catalan Sign Language (LSC, \"Llengua de signes catalana\"). Since, like other deaf sign languages, LSC has no generally used written form, there is no literacy data.\n\nAs a part of the intense immigration process which Spain in general and Catalonia in particular have experienced over the last decade, there is a large number of immigrant languages spoken in various cultural communities in Catalonia, of which (Maghrebi) Arabic and Urdu are the most common if Spanish-speaking migrants are not taken into account.\n\nFrom all four Provinces of Catalonia, the largest number of habitual foreign language speakers are located in Girona.\n\nUnder the Franco dictatorship Catalan was, until the 1970s, excluded from the state education system and all other official and governmental use, including the prohibition of baptizing children with certain Catalan names. Rural-urban migration originating in other parts of Spain reduced the social use of the language in urban areas. Lately, a similar sociolinguistic phenomenon has occurred with foreign immigration. In an attempt to reverse this, the re-established self-government institutions of Catalonia embarked on a long term language policy to increase the use of Catalan and has, since 1983, enforced laws which attempt to protect, and extend, the use of Catalan. Some groups consider these efforts a way to discourage the use of Spanish, while some other, including the Catalan government and the European Union consider the policies not only respectful, but also an example which \"should be disseminated throughout the Union\".\n\nToday, Catalan is the language of the Catalan autonomous government and the other public institutions that fall under its jurisdiction. Following Catalan Government rules, businesses are required to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) in Catalan under penalty of legal fines; following Spanish Government rules, there's the same obligation to display this information in Spanish; there is no obligation to display this information in Aranese, although there is no restriction on doing so in these or other languages. The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 linguistic law that aims to increase the use of Catalan. According to the law, both Catalan and Spanish – being official languages – can be used by the citizens without prejudice in all public and private activities even though the Generalitat usually uses only Catalan in its communications and notifications addressed to the general population. The citizens can also receive information from the Generalitat in Spanish if they so request. The various media belonging to Catalan government public broadcasting are monolingual in Catalan. However, except for a few hours in Catalan on La 2 and on some radio station, all the media belonging to the Spanish government are Spanish monolingual in Catalonia, as in the rest of Spain. \nThe language policy favouring Catalan consistently implemented by the successive governments ruling the regional government of Catalonia since the 1980s has become increasingly contentious and controversial during the 2000s, especially in public education.\n\nIn this context, Catalan was the only language of instruction between 1979 and 2012. Thus, pupils were immersed in Catalan except for three hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. However, the most recent Spanish Education Law and some judicial sentences aim at increasing the time of instruction in Spanish for other subjects, if only one child per class asks it, even if the other families don't agree, because of complaints that current policies hinder the right to an education in Spanish.\n\nSome political parties and civic organizations denounce this situation in which a co-official language like Spanish is barred from public education, claiming that this is a severe breach of civic rights and against the spirit of free circulation of people within Spain. In September 2008 a demonstration was held in Barcelona to support full coexistence of both languages without linguistic discrimination of either. In June 2012 the Supreme Court of Spain ruled that schools must also use Spanish as a medium of instruction, if parents wish it, and cannot force Catalan-language education on the entire population, citing the disadvantage of the inability to be educated in the national language and the necessity of maintaining the ability for citizens to move from one part of Spain to another without learning the local language.\n\nPro-Catalan language activists claim that some activities cannot be done in Catalan, because almost 500 different rules are forbidding the use of any language except Spanish or because delegations of the Spanish Government do not accept the use of documents written in Catalan, though it is a co-official language in Catalonia.\n\n"}
{"id": "1144105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1144105", "title": "Legality", "text": "Legality\n\nLegality can be defined as an act, agreement, or contract that is consistent with the law or state of being lawful or unlawful in a given jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to merriam-webster dictionary definition of Legality is 1 : attachment to or observance of law. 2 : the quality or state of being legal Businessdictionary.com, thelawdictionary.org, and mylawdictionary.org definition explains concept of \"attachment to law\" as \"Implied warranty that an act, agreement, or contract strictly adheres to the statutes of a particular jurisdiction. For example, in insurance contracts it is assumed that all risks covered under the policy are legal ventures.\" The second definition cited by Businessdictionary.com \" Legal principle that an accused may not be prosecuted for an act that is not declared a crime in that jurisdiction.\" is actually about Principle of legality which is part of over all concept of legality.\n\nVicki Schultz states that we collectively have a shared knowledge about most concepts. How we interpret the reality of our actual understanding of a concept manifests itself through the different individual narratives that we tell about the origins and meanings of a particular concept. The difference in narratives, about the same set of facts, is what divides us. An individual has the ability to frame, or understand, something very differently than the next person. Evidence does not always lead to a clear attribution of the specific cause or meaning of an issue – meanings are derived through narratives. Reality, and the facts that surround it, are personally subjective and laden with assumptions based on clearly stated facts. Anna-Maria Marshall states, this shift in framing happens because our perceptions depend “on new information and experiences;” this very idea is the basis of Ewick and Sibley definition of legality – our everyday experiences shape our understanding of the law.\n\nEwik and Silbey define Legality more broadly as, \"those meanings, sources of authority, and cultural practices that are in some sense legal although not necessarily approved or acknowledged by official law. The concept of legality the opportunity to consider \"how where and with what effect law is produced in and through commonplace social interactions...How do our roles and statuses our relationships, our obligations, prerogatives and responsibilities, our identities and our behavoiurs bear the imprint of law.\" \n\nIn a paper on Normative Phenomena of Morality, Ethics and Legality', Legality is defined taking states role in to account as, \"The system of laws and regulations of right and wrong behavior that are enforceable by the state (federal, state, or local governmental body in the U.S.) through the exercise of its policing powers and judicial process, with the threat and use of penalties,\nincluding its monopoly on the right to use physical violence. \"\n\nThe \"principle of legality\" is the legal ideal that requires all law to be clear, ascertainable and non-retrospective. It requires decision makers to resolve disputes by applying legal rules that have been declared beforehand, and not to alter the legal situation retrospectively by discretionary departures from established law. It is closely related to legal formalism and the rule of law and can be traced from the writings of Feuerbach, Dicey and Montesquieu.\n\nThe principle has particular relevance in criminal and administrative law. In criminal law it can be seen in the general prohibition on the imposition of criminal sanctions for acts or omissions that were not criminal at the time of their commission or omission. The principle is also thought to be violated when the sanctions for a particular crime are increased with retrospective effect.\n\nIn administrative law it can be seen in the desire for state officials to be bound by and apply the law rather than acting upon whim. As such advocates of the principle are normally against discretionary powers.\n\nThe principle can be varyingly expressed in Latin phrases such as \"Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali\" (No crime can be committed, nor punishment imposed without a pre-existing penal law), \"nulla poena sine lege\" (no penalty without law) and \"nullum crimen sine lege\" (no crime without law). A law that violates the principle by retroactively making actions illegal that were committed before the enactment of the law is called an \"ex post facto law\".\n\nRule of law provides for availability of rules, laws and legal mechanism to implement them. Principle of legality checks for availability and quality of the laws. Legality checks for if certain behaviour is according to law or not. concept of Legitimacy of law looks for fairness or acceptability of fairness of process of implementation of law.\n\nquality of being legal and observance to the law may pertain to lawfullness, i.e. being consistent to the law or it may get discussed in principle of legality or may be discussed as legal legitimacy.\n\nIn contract law, legality of purpose is required of every enforceable contract. One can not validate or enforce a contract to do activity with unlawful purpose.\n\nThe principle of legality can be affected in different ways by different constitutional models. In the United States, laws may not violate the stated provisions of the United States Constitution which includes a prohibition on retrospective laws. In Britain under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty, the legislature can (in theory) pass such retrospective laws as it sees fit, though article 7 of the European convention on human rights, which has legal force in Britain, forbids conviction for a crime which was not illegal at the time it was committed. Article 7 has already had an effect in a number of cases in the British courts.\n\nIn contrast many written constitutions prohibit the creation of retroactive (normally criminal) laws. However the possibility of statutes being struck down creates its own problems. It is clearly more difficult to ascertain what is a valid statute when any number of statutes may have constitutional question marks hanging over them. When a statute is declared unconstitutional, the actions of public authorities and private individuals which were legal under the invalidated statute, are retrospectively tainted with illegality. Such a result could not occur under parliamentary sovereignty (or at least not before Factortame) as a statute was law and its validity could not be questioned in any court.\n\nLegality, in its criminal aspect, is a principle of international human rights law, and is incorporated into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. However the imposition of penalties for offences illegal under international law or criminal according to \"the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\" are normally excluded from its ambit. As such the trial and punishment for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity does not breach international law.\n\nThere is some debate about whether this is really a true exception or not. Some people would argue that it is a derogation or – perhaps somewhat more harshly – an infringement of the principle of legality. While others would argue that crimes such as genocide are contrary to natural law and as such are always illegal and always have been. Thus imposing punishment for them is always legitimate. The exception and the natural law justification for it can be seen as an attempt to justify the Nuremberg trials and the trial of Adolf Eichmann, both of which were criticized for applying retrospective criminal sanctions.\n\nThe territorial principle, generally confining national jurisdiction to a nation’s borders, has been expanded to accommodate extraterritorial, national interest.\n\nIn criminal law, the principle of legality assures the primacy of law in all criminal proceedings.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2792169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2792169", "title": "Lifeworld", "text": "Lifeworld\n\nLifeworld () may be conceived as a universe of what is self-evident or given, a world that subjects may experience together. For Edmund Husserl, the lifeworld is the fundamental for all epistemological enquiries. The concept has its origin in biology and cultural Protestantism.\n\nThe lifeworld concept is used in philosophy and in some social sciences, particularly sociology and anthropology. The concept emphasizes a state of affairs in which the world is experienced, the world is lived (German \"erlebt\"). The lifeworld is a pre-epistemological stepping stone for phenomenological analysis in the Husserlian tradition.\n\nEdmund Husserl introduced the concept of the lifeworld in his \"The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology\" (1936):\n\nThis collective inter-subjective pool of perceiving, Husserl explains, is both universally present and, for humanity's purposes, capable of arriving at 'objective truth,' or at least as close to objectivity as possible. The 'lifeworld' is a grand theatre of objects variously arranged in space and time relative to perceiving subjects, is already-always there, and is the \"ground\" for all shared human experience. Husserl's formulation of the lifeworld was also influenced by Wilhelm Dilthey's \"life-nexus\" (German \"Lebenszusammenhang\") and Martin Heidegger's Being-in-the-world (German \"In-der-Welt-Sein\"). The concept was further developed by students of Husserl such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jan Patočka, and Alfred Schütz. The lifeworld can be thought of as the horizon of all our experiences, in the sense that it is that background on which all things appear as themselves and meaningful. The lifeworld cannot, however, be understood in a purely static manner; it isn't an unchangeable background, but rather a dynamic horizon in which we \"live\", and which \"lives with us\" in the sense that nothing can appear in our lifeworld except as \"lived\".\n\nThe concept represented a turning point in Husserl's phenomenology from the tradition of Descartes and Kant. Up until then, Husserl had been focused on finding, elucidating, and explaining an absolute foundation of philosophy in consciousness, without any presuppositions except what can be found through the reflective analysis of consciousness and what is immediately present to it. Originally, all judgments of the real were to be \"bracketed\" or suspended, and then analyzed to bring to light the role of consciousness in constituting or constructing them. With the concept of the lifeworld, however, Husserl embarked on a different path, which recognizes that, even at its deepest level, consciousness is already embedded in and operating in a world of meanings and pre-judgements that are socially, culturally, and historically constituted. Phenomenology thereby became the study not just of the pure consciousness and meanings of a transcendental ego, as in Husserl's earlier work, but of consciousness and meaning in context. The lifeworld is one of the more complicated concepts in phenomenology, mainly because of its status as both personal and intersubjective.\n\nEven if a person's historicity is intimately tied up with his lifeworld, and each person thus has a lifeworld, this doesn't necessarily mean that the lifeworld is a purely individual phenomenon. In keeping with the phenomenological notion of intersubjectivity, the lifeworld can be intersubjective even though each individual \"necessarily\" carries his own \"personal\" lifeworld (\"homeworld\"); meaning is intersubjectively accessible, and can be communicated (shared by one's \"homecomrades\"). However, a homeworld is also always limited by an alienworld. The internal \"meanings\" of this alienworld \"can\" be communicated, but can never be apprehended \"as alien\"; the alien can only be appropriated or assimilated into the lifeworld, and only understood on the background of the lifeworld.\n\nThe Husserlian elucidation of lifeworld provided a starting point for the phenomenological sociology of Alfred Schütz, who tried to synthesize Husserl's phenomenology of consciousness, meaning, and the life-world with Max Weber's sociology and its focus on subjectively meaningful action. Jürgen Habermas has further developed the concept of the lifeworld in his social theory. For Habermas, the lifeworld is more or less the \"background\" environment of competences, practices, and attitudes representable in terms of one's cognitive horizon. Compared to Husserl with his focus on consciousness, however, Habermas, whose social theory is grounded in communication, focuses on the lifeworld as consisting of socially and culturally sedimented linguistic meanings. It is the lived realm of informal, culturally-grounded understandings and mutual accommodations. Rationalization and colonization of the lifeworld by the instrumental rationality of bureaucracies and market-forces is a primary concern of Habermas's two-volume \"Theory of Communicative Action\".\n\nFor Habermas, communicative action is governed by practical rationality—ideas of social importance are mediated through the process of linguistic communication according to the rules of practical rationality. By contrast, technical rationality governs \"systems\" of instrumentality, like industries, or on a larger scale, the capitalist economy or the democratic political government. Ideas of instrumental importance to a system are mediated according to the rules of that system (the most obvious example is the capitalist economy's use of currency). Self-deception, and thus systematically distorted communication, is possible only when the lifeworld has been 'colonized' by instrumental rationality, so some social norm comes into existence and enjoys legitimate power even though it is not justifiable. This occurs when means of mediating instrumental ideas gains communicative power—as when someone pays a group of people to stay quiet during a public debate, or if financial or administrative resources are used to advertise some social viewpoint. When people take the resulting consensus as normatively relevant, the lifeworld has been colonized and communication has been systematically distorted. The 'colonization' metaphor is used because the use of steering media to arrive at social consensus is not native to the lifeworld—the decision-making processes of the systems world must encroach on the lifeworld in a way that is in a sense imperialistic:\n\nThe fragmentation of consciousness associated with the two Marxist concepts of alienation and false consciousness illustrate why, in Habermas' perspective, they are merely special cases of the more general phenomenon of lifeworld colonization.\n\nSocial coordination and systemic regulation occur by means of shared practices, beliefs, values, and structures of communicative interaction, which may be institutionally based. We are inevitably lifeworldly, such that individuals and interactions draw from custom and cultural traditions to construct identities, define situations, coordinate action, and create social solidarity. Ideally this occurs by communicatively coming to understanding (German \"Verstehen\"), but it also occurs through pragmatic negotiations (compare: Seidman, 1997:197).\n\nThe lifeworld is related to further concepts such as Pierre Bourdieu's notion of \"habitus\" and to the sociological notion of everyday life.\n\nIn the course of recent constructivist discourses a discussion about the lifeworld term took place as well. Björn Kraus' relational-constructivist version of the lifeworld term considers its phenomenological roots (Husserl and Schütz), but expands it within the range of epistemological constructivist theory building. In consequence, a new approach is created, which is not only focusing on the individual perspective upon the lifeworld term, but is also taking account of social and material environmental conditions and their relevance as emphasized for example by Habermas. Essential therefore is Kraus' basic assumption that cognitive development depends on two determining factors. On the one hand a person's own reality is her subjective construct. On the other hand this construct—in spite of all subjectivity—is not random: Since a person is still linked to her environment, her own reality is influenced by the conditions of this environment (German \"Grundsätzliche Doppelbindung menschlicher Strukturentwicklung\").\n\nBuilding up on this point of view, a separation of individual perception and the social and material environmental conditions is made possible. Kraus accordingly picks up the lifeworld term, adds the term \"life conditions\" (German \"Lebenslage\") and opposes the two terms to each other.\n\nBy this means, lifeworld describes a person's subjectively experienced world, whereas life conditions describe the person's actual circumstances in life. Accordingly, it could be said that a person's lifeworld is built depending on their particular life conditions. More precisely, the life conditions include the material and immaterial living circumstances as for example employment situation, availability of material resources, housing conditions, social environment (friends, foes, acquaintances, relatives, etc.) as well as the persons physical condition (fat/thin, tall/small, female/male, healthy/sick, etc.). The lifeworld, in contrast, describes the subjective perception of these conditions. \n\nKraus uses the epistemological distinction between subjective reality and objective reality. Thus, a person's lifeworld correlates with the person's life conditions in the same way than subjective reality correlates with objective reality. The one is the insurmountable, subjective construct built depending on the other one's conditions. \n\nKraus defined lifeworld and life conditions as follows:\n\n\"Life conditions mean a person's material and immaterial circumstances of life.\"\n\n\"Lifeworld means a person's subjective construction of reality, which he or she forms under the condition of his or her life circumstances.\"\n\nThis contrasting comparison provides a conceptual specification, enabling in the first step the distinction between a subjectively experienced world and its material and social conditions and allowing in the second step to focus on these conditions' relevance for the subjective construction of reality.\n\nWith this in mind, Manfred Ferdinand, who is reviewing the lifeworld terms used by Alfred Schütz, Edmund Husserl, Björn Kraus and Ludwig Wittgenstein, concludes: Kraus' \"thoughts on a constructivist comprehension of lifeworlds contours the integration of micro-, meso- and macroscopic approaches, as it is demanded by Invernizzi and Butterwege: This integration is not only necessary in order to relate the subjective perspectives and the objective frame conditions to each other but also because the objective frame conditions obtain their relevance for the subjective lifeworlds not before they are perceived and assessed.\"\n\n\n"}

It is common in both politics and public relations.\n\nSaying \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" to someone who has been offended by a statement is a non-apology apology. It does not admit there was anything wrong with the remarks made, and may imply the person took offense for hypersensitive or irrational reasons. Another form of non-apology does not apologize directly to the injured or insulted party, but generically \"to anyone who might have been offended\".\n\nStatements that use the word \"sorry\" but do not express responsibility for wrongdoing may be meaningful expressions of regret, but such statements can also be used to elicit forgiveness without acknowledging fault.\n\nNon-apology apologizers may be trying to avoid litigation that might result from an admission of guilt or responsibility. Many states, including Massachusetts and California, have laws to prevent a plaintiff from using an apology as evidence of liability. For example, a medical doctor may apologize to a patient for a bad outcome without fearing the apology can be used against them at trial as evidence of negligence.\n\nIn November 2008, the Alberta legislature passed an amendment to the existing Alberta Evidence Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. A-18, geared at protecting apologizing parties from risks of legal liability and loss of insurance coverage. Section 26.1 of the Act provides that an apology does not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability.\n\nThe expression \"mistakes were made\" is commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges a situation was handled poorly or inappropriately but seeks to evade any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by using the passive voice. The acknowledgement of \"mistakes\" is framed in an abstract sense with no direct reference to \"who\" made the mistakes. An active voice construction would be along the lines of \"I made mistakes\" or \"John Doe made mistakes.\" The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word \"mistakes\" also does not imply intent.\n\n\"The New York Times\" has called the phrase a \"classic Washington linguistic construct\". Political consultant William Schneider suggested this usage be referred to as the \"past exonerative\" tense, and commentator William Safire has defined the phrase as \"[a] passive-evasive way of acknowledging error while distancing the speaker from responsibility for it\". A commentator at NPR declared this expression to be \"the king of non-apologies\". While perhaps most famous in politics, the phrase has also been used in business, sports, and entertainment.\n\nAttorney and business ethics expert Lauren Bloom, author of \"The Art of the Apology\", mentions the \"if apology\" as a favorite of politicians, with lines such as \"I apologize if I offended anyone\". Comedian Harry Shearer has coined the term Ifpology for its frequent appearances on \"The Apologies of the Week\" segment of \"Le Show\".\n\nOne of the first references was in the \"New York Times\" by Richard Mooney in his 1992 editorial notebook \"If This Sounds Slippery ... How to Apologize And Admit Nothing\". This was mainly in regard to Senator Bob Packwood: \"Only in the event that someone should choose to take offense, why then he's sorry\". Mooney goes on to cite Bill Clinton, who said of Mario Cuomo: \"If the remarks on the tape left anyone with the impression that I was disrespectful to either Governor Cuomo or Italian-Americans, then I deeply regret it.\" A famous example involved racially insensitive remarks made by golfer Fuzzy Zoeller about Tiger Woods; Zoeller's comments and his half-hearted ifpology were news for days and resulted in his being dropped from a commercial tie-in with K-Mart. According to John Kador in \"Effective Apology\", \"Adding the word \"if\" or any other conditional modifier to an apology makes it a non-apology.\"\n\nA 2014 ifpology was made by \"CNN\"s Don Lemon, who said, \"If my question to her struck anyone as offensive, I am sorry, as that certainly was not my intention.\" This was in reference to his interview with Joan Tarshis where he suggested biting a penis as a way to avoid being orally sexually assaulted.\n\nOn September 16, 2015, Matt Damon made what \"Salon\" termed a \"non-apology\" apology when he said, \"I am sorry that they [his comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood.\" This was in reference to the backlash against Damon after he made comments about diversity to African American film producer Effie Brown on the September 13, 2015 debut of the HBO show \"Project Greenlight\" that were criticized as condescending.\n\nOn July 24, 1991, \"The New York Times\" reported Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans had offered the prime minister of Malaysia \"what might best be described as a non-apology apology\" for what the Malaysian government regarded as an insulting portrayal of Malaysia in an Australian television series, \"Embassy\". Speaking to journalists, Mr Evans said he had \"wanted to acknowledge fault where such acknowledgment is appropriate\".\n\nHumorist Bruce McCall, in a 2001 \"New York Times\" piece entitled \"The Perfect Non-apology Apology\", defined the term as referring to \"sufficiently artful double talk\" designed to enable one to \"get what you want by seeming to express regret while actually accepting no blame,\" and suggested some tongue-in-cheek apologies, such as:\n\nTypologies of apology note they cover a range of situations and degrees of regret, remorse, and contrition, and that success is to be gauged by the result of the apology rather than the degree of contrition involved. Deborah Levi offers the following possibilities:\n\n\nWhile the non-apology apology is clearly unsuited to situations where an expression of remorse, contrition, and future change are obviously desirable (e.g. the \"happy ending\" apology), it may prove extremely useful in situations where little can be done to assuage the apparent offence or prevent its repetition, as when an airline apologises for a delay, in the full knowledge that a future repetition is inevitable. Such tactical apologies may have beneficial effects simply through the validation of the emotions of the offended party: they answer the basic human need for disagreeable emotions to be recognised and acknowledged as important, while protecting the apparently offending party from an expression of remorse. Negotiators often use this tactic to calm tense situations: \"an apology can defuse emotions effectively, even when you do not acknowledge personal responsibility for the action or admit an intention to harm. An apology may be one of the least costly and most rewarding investments you can make.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "49091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49091", "title": "Optical character recognition", "text": "Optical character recognition\n\nOptical character recognition (also optical character reader, OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast).\n\nWidely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records – whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerised receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation – it is a common method of digitising printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.\n\nEarly versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time. Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs. Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.\n\nEarly optical character recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and creating reading devices for the blind. In 1914, Emanuel Goldberg developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code. Concurrently, Edmund Fournier d'Albe developed the Optophone, a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page, produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters.\n\nIn the late 1920s and into the 1930s Emanuel Goldberg developed what he called a \"Statistical Machine\" for searching microfilm archives using an optical code recognition system. In 1931 he was granted USA Patent number 1,838,389 for the invention. The patent was acquired by IBM.\n\nWith the advent of smart-phones and smartglasses, OCR can be used in internet connected mobile device applications that extract text captured using the device's camera. These devices that do not have OCR functionality built into the operating system will typically use an OCR API to extract the text from the image file captured and provided by the device. The OCR API returns the extracted text, along with information about the location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing (such as text-to-speech) or display.\n\nIn 1974, Ray Kurzweil started the company Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and continued development of omni-font OCR, which could recognise text printed in virtually any font (Kurzweil is often credited with inventing omni-font OCR, but it was in use by companies, including CompuScan, in the late 1960s and 1970s). Kurzweil decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine for the blind, which would allow blind people to have a computer read text to them out loud. This device required the invention of two enabling technologiesthe CCD flatbed scanner and the text-to-speech synthesiser. On January 13, 1976, the successful finished product was unveiled during a widely reported news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of the National Federation of the Blind. In 1978, Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. LexisNexis was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload legal paper and news documents onto its nascent online databases. Two years later, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox, which had an interest in further commercialising paper-to-computer text conversion. Xerox eventually spun it off as Scansoft, which merged with Nuance Communications. The research group headed by A. G. Ramakrishnan at the Medical intelligence and language engineering lab, Indian Institute of Science, has developed PrintToBraille tool, an open source GUI frontend that can be used by any OCR to convert scanned images of printed books to Braille books.\n\nIn the 2000s, OCR was made available online as a service (WebOCR), in a cloud computing environment, and in mobile applications like real-time translation of foreign-language signs on a smartphone.\n\nVarious commercial and open source OCR systems are available for most common writing systems, including Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Bengali (Bangla), Devanagari, Tamil, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.\n\nOCR engines have been developed into many kinds of domain-specific OCR applications, such as receipt OCR, invoice OCR, check OCR, legal billing document OCR.\n\nThey can be used for:\n\n\nOCR is generally an \"offline\" process, which analyses a static document. Handwriting movement analysis can be used as input to handwriting recognition. Instead of merely using the shapes of glyphs and words, this technique is able to capture motions, such as the order in which segments are drawn, the direction, and the pattern of putting the pen down and lifting it. This additional information can make the end-to-end process more accurate. This technology is also known as \"on-line character recognition\", \"dynamic character recognition\", \"real-time character recognition\", and \"intelligent character recognition\".\n\nOCR software often \"pre-processes\" images to improve the chances of successful recognition. Techniques include:\n\nSegmentation of fixed-pitch fonts is accomplished relatively simply by aligning the image to a uniform grid based on where vertical grid lines will least often intersect black areas. For proportional fonts, more sophisticated techniques are needed because whitespace between letters can sometimes be greater than that between words, and vertical lines can intersect more than one character.\n\nThere are two basic types of core OCR algorithm, which may produce a ranked list of candidate characters.\n\nMatrix matching involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixel-by-pixel basis; it is also known as \"pattern matching\", \"pattern recognition\", or \"image correlation\". This relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image, and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale. This technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered. This is the technique the early physical photocell-based OCR implemented, rather directly.\n\nFeature extraction decomposes glyphs into \"features\" like lines, closed loops, line direction, and line intersections. The extraction features reduces the dimensionality of the representation and makes the recognition process computationally efficient. These features are compared with an abstract vector-like representation of a character, which might reduce to one or more glyph prototypes. General techniques of feature detection in computer vision are applicable to this type of OCR, which is commonly seen in \"intelligent\" handwriting recognition and indeed most modern OCR software. Nearest neighbour classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbors algorithm are used to compare image features with stored glyph features and choose the nearest match.\n\nSoftware such as Cuneiform and Tesseract use a two-pass approach to character recognition. The second pass is known as \"adaptive recognition\" and uses the letter shapes recognised with high confidence on the first pass to recognise better the remaining letters on the second pass. This is advantageous for unusual fonts or low-quality scans where the font is distorted (e.g. blurred or faded).\n\nThe OCR result can be stored in the standardised ALTO format, a dedicated XML schema maintained by the United States Library of Congress.\n\nFor a list of optical character recognition software see Comparison of optical character recognition software.\n\nOCR accuracy can be increased if the output is constrained by a lexicona list of words that are allowed to occur in a document. This might be, for example, all the words in the English language, or a more technical lexicon for a specific field. This technique can be problematic if the document contains words not in the lexicon, like proper nouns. Tesseract uses its dictionary to influence the character segmentation step, for improved accuracy.\n\nThe output stream may be a plain text stream or file of characters, but more sophisticated OCR systems can preserve the original layout of the page and produce, for example, an annotated PDF that includes both the original image of the page and a searchable textual representation.\n\n\"Near-neighbor analysis\" can make use of co-occurrence frequencies to correct errors, by noting that certain words are often seen together. For example, \"Washington, D.C.\" is generally far more common in English than \"Washington DOC\".\n\nKnowledge of the grammar of the language being scanned can also help determine if a word is likely to be a verb or a noun, for example, allowing greater accuracy.\n\nThe Levenshtein Distance algorithm has also been used in OCR post-processing to further optimize results from an OCR API.\n\nIn recent years, the major OCR technology providers began to tweak OCR systems to better deal with specific types of input. Beyond an application-specific lexicon, better performance can be had by taking into account business rules, standard expression, or rich information contained in color images. This strategy is called \"Application-Oriented OCR\" or \"Customised OCR\", and has been applied to OCR of license plates, invoices, screenshots, ID cards, driver licenses, and automobile manufacturing.\n\nThere are several techniques for solving the problem of character recognition by means other than improved OCR algorithms.\n\nSpecial fonts like OCR-A, OCR-B, or MICR fonts, with precisely specified sizing, spacing, and distinctive character shapes, allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription in bank check processing. Ironically however, several prominent OCR engines were designed to capture text in popular fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman, and are incapable of capturing text in these fonts that are specialized and much different from popularly used fonts. As Google Tesseract can be trained to recognize new fonts, it can recognize OCR-A, OCR-B and MICR fonts.\n\n\"Comb fields\" are pre-printed boxes that encourage humans to write more legiblyone glyph per box. These are often printed in a \"dropout color\" which can be easily removed by the OCR system.\n\nPalm OS used a special set of glyphs, known as \"Graffiti\" which are similar to printed English characters but simplified or modified for easier recognition on the platform's computationally limited hardware. Users would need to learn how to write these special glyphs.\n\nZone-based OCR restricts the image to a specific part of a document. This is often referred to as \"Template OCR\".\n\nCrowdsourcing humans to perform the character recognition can quickly process images like computer-driven OCR, but with higher accuracy for recognising images than is obtained with computers. Practical systems include the Amazon Mechanical Turk and reCAPTCHA. The National Library of Finland has developed an online interface for users correct OCRed texts in the standardised ALTO format. Crowdsourcing has also been used not to perform character recognition directly but to invite software developers to develop image processing algorithms, for example, through the use of rank-order tournaments.\n\nCommissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Information Science Research Institute (ISRI) had the mission to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents, and it conducted the most authoritative of the \"Annual Test of OCR Accuracy\" from 1992 to 1996.\n\nRecognition of Latin-script, typewritten text is still not 100% accurate even where clear imaging is available. One study based on recognition of 19th- and early 20th-century newspaper pages concluded that character-by-character OCR accuracy for commercial OCR software varied from 81% to 99%; total accuracy can be achieved by human review or Data Dictionary Authentication. Other areas—including recognition of hand printing, cursive handwriting, and printed text in other scripts (especially those East Asian language characters which have many strokes for a single character)—are still the subject of active research. The MNIST database is commonly used for testing systems' ability to recognise handwritten digits.\n\nAccuracy rates can be measured in several ways, and how they are measured can greatly affect the reported accuracy rate. For example, if word context (basically a lexicon of words) is not used to correct software finding non-existent words, a character error rate of 1% (99% accuracy) may result in an error rate of 5% (95% accuracy) or worse if the measurement is based on whether each whole word was recognised with no incorrect letters.\n\nAn example of the difficulties inherent in digitising old text is the inability of OCR to differentiate between the \"long s\" and \"f\" characters.\n\nWeb-based OCR systems for recognising hand-printed text on the fly have become well known as commercial products in recent years (see Tablet PC history). Accuracy rates of 80% to 90% on neat, clean hand-printed characters can be achieved by pen computing software, but that accuracy rate still translates to dozens of errors per page, making the technology useful only in very limited applications.\n\nRecognition of cursive text is an active area of research, with recognition rates even lower than that of hand-printed text. Higher rates of recognition of general cursive script will likely not be possible without the use of contextual or grammatical information. For example, recognising entire words from a dictionary is easier than trying to parse individual characters from script. Reading the \"Amount\" line of a cheque (which is always a written-out number) is an example where using a smaller dictionary can increase recognition rates greatly. The shapes of individual cursive characters themselves simply do not contain enough information to accurately (greater than 98%) recognise all handwritten cursive script. \n\nMost programs allow users to set \"confidence rates\". This means that if the software does not achieve their desired level of accuracy, a user can be notified for manual review.\n\nCharacters to support OCR were added to the Unicode Standard in June 1993, with the release of version 1.1.\n\nSome of these characters are mapped from fonts specific to MICR, OCR-A or OCR-B.\n\n"}

The game takes place within a two-dimensional matrix in the tradition of board games and its principle is similar to both Conway's Game of Life and the surrealists' Exquisite corpse.\n\nHowever, it differs from these models in several respects. It is not an algorithm like Conway's, but human players who control in real time the graphic elements of a global matrix, on the basis of one unit per person. Unlike the exquisite corpse, in which there are always hidden parts, here all the players' actions are visible at all times by each of them. Unlike board games, there is no concept of winning or losing, the goal of the game is simply to collectively draw recognizable forms and to observe how we create them together.\n\nThe name \"Poietic Generator\", derived from the concept of autopoiesis in life sciences (Francisco Varela), and of poietic in philosophy of art (Paul Valéry, ), illustrates the process of self-organization at work in the continuous emergence of the global picture. Since its inception, the Poietic Generator has been designed as part of a wider action research to create an \"Art of Speed\".\n\n Every player draws on a small part of a global mosaic formed by the dynamic juxtaposition of those parts, which are manipulated by all the participants (eventually it will be possible for several thousand players to play simultaneously). Every player can therefore change the sign in his/her square, depending on the overall state of the image, which itself depends on the actions of all the individual players. Out of this cybernetic loop emerges a kind of narrative: autonomous forms, sometimes abstract, sometimes figurative, appear in a completely unpredictable manner and tell stories.\n\nIn practice, each player can draw (using a graphics tablet) on a very simple image. This image is limited in size (20×20 pixels) by design. This was done to prevent a single player from drawing figurative signs by himself. The overall image is continuously formed in the style of a spiral, that is to say the sign of the first player occupies the whole image, and the signs of the newcomers are juxtaposed in the first winding around it, and so on. If a player forfeits the game, his/her sign immediately disappears and its position remains empty until another player occupies it. A zoom in/zoom out feature ensures that the image constituted by the juxtaposition of all signs, is permanently visible to all the players.\n\nThe Poietic Generator runs on two types of architecture, a centralized network (for versions 1, 3, 4), or an \"ad hoc\" distributed network capable of implementing the multicast protocol (case version 2). Therefore, no location in the network plays a particular role and according to the rules of the Poietic Generator, an \"all-all\" interaction may take place without the intervention of any kind of control center.\n\nThis latest version is available on the web, via Android mobile phone, iPhone / iPad, via Facebook, and has a reference site.\n\nSince 1987, the Poietic Generator (various versions) inspired many experiments in diverse contexts. The first public experiment was at the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1990 as part of the \"Communication and monumentality\" exhibition. Other museums, art galleries, digital public spaces, festivals, and international conferences, etc. then followed, including the 1991 \"Communicating Machines\" exhibition by the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie (Paris).\nSeveral experiments were performed on the periphery of academic research. For instance, experiments were conducted in particular at Telecom ParisTech (where Olivier Auber was a guest artist between 1994 and 1997), during the Internet Mbone experiment (with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Xerox PARC), and at other laboratories. The subjects of the experiments were diverse: network protocols, the process of emergence of forms, human-machine interfaces, collective intelligence, group behavior, etc.\n\nSince 1997, the Poietic Generator is accessible to everyone on the web as a work of free art (under Free Art License from 2002). At the request of various groups of artists, teachers or researchers, this led to several hundred recorded game sessions, some of them commented. In several of these sessions, 70 players participated simultaneously. Several experiments were in kindergarten, elementary and secondary schools (including one experiment linking multiple classrooms).\n\nThe most recent event was in the spring of 2011 when 70 people responded to a call on the France Culture radio station to finance the mobile version of the Poietic Generator via the crowd-funded platform This version is currently online (2012).\n\nSeveral art historians and theorists, including Don Foresta, , Mario Costa, Caterina Davinio, Jean-Paul Fourmentraux, Louis-José Lestocart, Elisa Giaccardi, and Norbert Hillaire, Annick Bureaud recognize the Poietic Generator as one of the historical works of digital art, interactive art, generative art and Net.art. Note that the Poietic Generator was born at the time of Minitel, before the invention of the Web (1994), and implemented from 1995 onwards on experimental Multicast networks foreshadowing IPv6. The introduction of the Minitel in France, offered, for the first time in the world, an easy way to implement telematic art. Several French artists attempted somewhat similar experiments, but none of them had the durability of Poietic Generator.\n\n, who deals with the mechanisms of the \"system of art\" in several of her works, considers the Poietic Generator to be the prototype of a new \"cognitive art\". This new \"cognitive art\", following Marcel Duchamp, Yves Klein and Andy Warhol, re-institutes the task of questioning again, and in a more radical way, the \"doxa of art\".\nLike in the Renaissance, art becomes (a) heuristic, a type of probe with the task to explore a continent.\n\nSince 1987, the Poietic Generator directly inspired multiple variations and derivative works. Some of them developed by its original author based on his own research process, some of them by other artists and/or researchers, especially and . It has also initiated various experiments with some communities, including some contributors of Wikipedia. As a model, the Poietic Generator directly inspired the work of some architects, planners, social scientists and anthropologists. Indirectly, the Poietic Generator probably inspired many other artists and designers too.\n\nJean-Paul Fourmentraux, in his classification of Net.art devices, quotes the Poietic Generator as one of the few representatives of the \"alteraction\" devices category. These type of devices support processes of pure synchronous human communication, free from algorithmic control or introduction of external data. This alteraction process, envisioned as \"an intermediate action which makes one become other\" (), lies outside the field studied by the general theory of games, as its branch covering multiplayer games (coordination games, cooperative games) which does not consider the emergence of meta-levels: specifically the \"becoming other\". According to testimony, the Poietic Generator has an amazing ability to immerse its players in a learning process of social phenomena: it gives not only the possibility to live a kind of \"conversation\", but in some degree, to access to its model by observing and interpreting autopoietic phenomena, that is to say the \"life\", which takes place there. According to Olivier Auber, there would be in the Poietic Generator, intrusion of eigenfrequencies, similar to those existing in other autopoietic systems (cell, cerebral cortex, etc.). Despite their apparent complexity, these temporal phenomena (oscillations between structure and chaos, complexity and simplicity) could be analyzed, even \"mathematised\", particularly in the light of the simplicity theory (Jean-Louis Dessalles). Structuring phases corresponds to a \"becoming other\" (Quéau) and a greater \"simplicity\" (Dessalles). The emergence of these kinds of paradigm shifts would be both unexpected and deterministic.\n\nThe Poietic Generator may be seen as a generic model of multiple complex systems (informational, urban, economic, ecological, etc.) to which everyone is confronted daily. But unlike these systems, often opaque about their prerequisites, their rules and infrastructure, the Poietic Generator is perfectly transparent: \"everything is known or knowable\", in particular the fact that it operates either centrally or without any center. According to Olivier Auber, these two architectures, centered or not, are achieving some forms of \"perspective\" (within the meaning of the Renaissance) in which the vanishing point lies, in the first case, in a physical center (the server), in the second in a \"code\" under cover of which the network is sharing information (its sign of recognition in some way). He speaks in the first case of a \"temporal perspective\" because it is in the center where emerges moment by moment the \"proper time\" of the network (its rhythmic pulsations). In the second case, he speaks of a \"digital perspective\" because it is a \"code\" (an arbitrary number) which is the guarantor of the emergence of the proper time of the network in each of its nodes. These two perspectives are of course not visual as is the case of the spatial perspective, but they share with it some topological and symbolic attributes. In particular, one can speak of \"legitimate perspective\", as Alberti did in the Renaissance. The Poietic Generator as an Ideal city, implements these two non-visual perspectives, described by Oliver Auber \"anoptical perspectives,\" as perfectly and obvious as possible. Throughout the game, players can gradually take a cognitive step back, and by analogy grasp in thought the nature of the perspectives in question. The hypothesis of Olivier Auber is that these perspectives are exercised within the framework of \"real\" systems, opaque and complex as mentioned above, and that they shape the imagination and judgment, that is to say the doxa of those who are enrolled in it.\n\nIn attempting to uncover the \"anoptical perspectives\", the Poietic Generator positions itself as a metagame which invites a questioning of the processes of social interaction, especially when they are mediated by technological devices interacting with social networks. For Olivier Auber, the Poietic Generator, as a model and experience available to all, could contribute to \"a certain conceptual knowledge (dianoia) of how the doxa is formed and exercised on us, especially through technology\". At a time when technical objects are close to the body and are preparing to invade it, the Poietic Generator could help us by providing \"a set of conceptual tools for the new \"perspecteurs\" (Abraham Bosse) that we could all become\" in order, he says, to \"rethink the imagination of the technology in full light\".\n\nAttempts like this are crucial to emancipate the technology from the status a mere instrument for defined purposes, and to recognize the role that it should have as a creator of culture and practices.\nSince the 1990s, many scientists in all disciplines, mentioned the Poietic Generator as a model which may help to rethink the cultural, even anthropological changing, latent in networks, and especially emphasized the urgency of a \"redefinition of the notion of authorship\". Some of these researchers brought in a personal support to attempts to practice large-scale experiments using channels such as broadcast television stations, museums, public places, etc. Without listening and support from these institutional broadcasters, very few of these projects have been successful. Handicapped by its transdisciplinary or even \"undisciplinary\" nature, and naturally questioning the legitimacy of human organizations to which it is dealing with, the action research on the Poietic Generator has never found any other field to flourish as the Internet itself. Nevertheless, the Poietic Generator and writings of its author are quoted in many academic thesis, and in at least one \"100% plagiarized\".\n\n\n"}

It appeared in plans proposed by German officials as a territory to be annexed by German Empire after an expected German and Central Powers victory. German planners also envisioned forced expulsion and resettlement of the Polish and Jewish population which would be replaced by German colonists.The proposed area of the Border Strip comprised up to 30,000 km² (approximately the size of Belgium), and up to 3 million people were to be ethnicly cleansed by the German Empire to make room for Germans. The strip was also intended to separate the Polish inhabitants of Prussian-held Greater Poland from those in Congress Poland.\n\nThe idea of future \"buffer zone\" to be cleared of Poles and Jews as discussed officially at highest levels as early as 1914\nIn July 1917 the German supreme command under General Ludendorff, as part of the debate and planning regarding the cession of the \"border strip\" to Germany, specified its own designs in a memorandum. It proposed annexing a greatly enlarged \"border strip\" of 20,000 square kilometres, and ethnically cleansing its Polish and Jewish population (numbering between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000) from a territory of 8,000 square kilometres and settling it with ethnic Germans. Poles living in Prussia, especially in the province of Posen, were to be \"encouraged\" by unspecified means to move into the German-ruled puppet state of Kingdom of Poland.\n\nThe German minority living in Congress Poland, which had earlier suggested the annexation of all territory up to Łódź in a letter to the German government, also supported such proposals. The German government developed and agreed to these plans in March 1918, and in April gained support in the Prussian House of Lords; the plans for this were debated and developed across a wide spectrum of political parties and interested groups such as political scientists, industrialists, and nationalist organisations like the Pan-German League.\n\nFriedrich von Schwerin, head of administration in Frankfurt/Oder and chairman of the Society for Inner Colonization stated \"The German people, the greatest colonizing people on earth, have again been given a great colonizing task. The current world war provides the opportunity for Germany to resume in a resolute way its colonizing mission in the East\".\nFor admnistrators like Schwerin the plan was to be accompanied by massive expulsion of Poles as in his words\"\"new land can usually only be won at the expense of those who own the land\". The German nobility in certain versions of the plan were to become \"colonial administration\"\nThe plan has been described by historian Hajo Holborn as the first instance in modern European history of planning the removal of whole populations as a solution to national conflicts. By removing the Polish population all resistance to Germanization of Polish territories would be bypassed \n\nParts of the plans were adopted by Nazi Germany after the war, and implemented in the genocidal Generalplan Ost.\n\n"}

PTV serves more than 300 victims of state-sponsored torture from over 65 countries annually.\n\nThe Program for Torture Victims (PTV) was founded in 1980 by Dr. José Quiroga and Ana Deutsch.\n\nQuiroga and Deutsch, both who sought asylum in the United States, met in Los Angeles in 1979. They began working on a campaign against torture with the Los Angeles Amnesty International Medical Group. The organization was conducting a study documenting cases of torture and the consequences for refugees and asylum-seekers in the United States. Quiroga assessed the medical consequences of torture while Deutsch assessed the victims' psychological well-being. However, Amnesty International decided that they, as an organization, were unable to provide direct treatment to torture survivors. Quiroga and Deutsch knew that the torture survivors with whom they had been working needed rehabilitation services and decided to start the Program for Torture Victims.\n\nAfter the study by the Amnesty International Medical Group was completed, Quiroga presented it to the American Psychological Association. This was among the first research on the medical and psychological consequences of torture. Quiroga and Deutsch quickly became known as professionals treating victims of torture. It wasn’t until 1987, years after PTV began, that the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was enforced and torture was legally recognized and defined for the first time\n\nQuiroga and Deutsch began to treat clients in local clinics and in their own homes. Partnering with organizations such as Clinica Monseñor Oscar A. Romero, El Rescate, CARECEN and Amanecer, PTV quickly became well known in the Central American refugee community. Quiroga, having already been a volunteer at Venice Family Clinic for years, formed a partnership in which he was able to use their facilities to see PTV patients. Based in a small apartment at the time, Venice Family Clinic is now the largest community clinic in the U.S. and still home to PTV’s medical office.\n\nIn 1994, PTV received its first grant from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and was incorporated as a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization. Several years later, in 2000, PTV received a federal grant for $2 million over a four-year period, allowing PTV to add staff and relocate the administrative office from Ms. Deutsch’s home to downtown Los Angeles. With paid staff and a central office, PTV was finally able to expand its scope to include areas like research and evaluation.\n\nAccording to a report by the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), 48,217 refugees were admitted into the U.S. in 2007. Of that total, 2,619 (5.43%) resettled in Florida, 2,978 (6.18%) relocated to New York and 6,699 (13.89%) chose to resettle in California; making California home to more incoming refugees than the next two states combined. Of all those who sought to make California their new home, 4,645 (69%) resettled in the five counties PTV serves - Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. Out of all of the counties in California, The Los Angeles Federal Immigration Court had greatest number of asylum seekers with 4,064. Between 2002 and 2008, the L.A. Federal Immigration Court adjudicated the highest number of asylum applications of any immigration court in California with 69,172 cases - 63% of the state total. As states, Florida and New York had 75,499 and 73,746 applications for asylum, respectively; just a fraction more than L.A. County alone.\n\nThe demographic makeup of PTV's client population is ever-changing, as global, regional, and national sociopolitical dynamics are constantly in flux. Thus far, PTV has served clients from over 65 countries.\n\nThe Program for Torture Victims (PTV) has developed an integrated, comprehensive approach to rehabilitation. Clients see a PTV case manager, physician and psychotherapist. PTV partners with some of the region’s leading service providers, including the Venice Family Clinic, Clinica Oscar Romero, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Public Counsel, among others.\n\nClients are evaluated by a PTV physician. When specialized procedures are needed, a wide network of physicians at the Venice Family Clinic and other local health care organizations are utilized at no cost to the client. PTV also offers ongoing consultation and trains health and mental health care providers on treating survivors of torture.\n\nPTV uses an integrated approach to rehabilitation that addresses the needs of torture survivors. This includes psychological evaluation, individual and family psychotherapy, psychiatric evaluation and follow-up, and psychological affidavits for asylum seekers in immigration court.\n\nMost of PTV's clients seek refuge in the United States as asylum seekers. As the largest port of entry to torture survivors, Los Angeles has the highest number of asylum claims filed in the United States.\n\nPTV's staff prepares forensic medical and psychological evaluations and serve as expert witnesses in federal immigration court. Reliving horrific experiences through testimony can be extremely traumatic to the survivor. The PTV clinical staff prepares the client for the emotional responses they might have on the stand. The presence of a trusted PTV volunteer or staff member can provide the extra moral support a client needs to answer questions clearly and in the necessary detail about the experience.\n\nPTV also works with an extensive network of attorneys to ensure legal assistance for clients.\n\nPTV provides emergency assistance with referrals for temporary shelter, food and other basic needs, as well as support in finding permanent housing and good jobs. They have also established support groups that create a sense of community for clients, address their various needs and help them become spokespeople against torture.\n\nSocial Services offered:\n\nPTV is a resource for research information on torture survivors. They have created an extensive database with information on treatment outcomes for torture survivors, and are working to create a powerful resource for lawmakers to address policy issues related to the asylum process.\n\nPTV initiates public programs to educate the general public about the use of torture worldwide and its consequences for individuals and society. They also engage elected officials and policymakers in efforts to combat torture and advocate for resources to facilitate the healing of torture survivors and their families.\n\nPTV also collaborates with local organizations to host public programs for events such as the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.\n"}
{"id": "49952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49952", "title": "Prudence", "text": "Prudence\n\nPrudence (, contracted from meaning \"seeing ahead, sagacity\") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of reason. It is classically considered to be a virtue, and in particular one of the four Cardinal virtues (which are, with the three theological virtues, part of the seven virtues). Prudentia is an allegorical female personification of the virtue, whose attributes are a mirror and snake, who is frequently depicted as a pair with Justitia, the Roman goddess of Justice.\n\nThe word derives from the 14th-century Old French word \"prudence\", which, in turn, derives from the Latin \"prudentia\" meaning \"foresight, sagacity\". It is often associated with wisdom, insight, and knowledge. In this case, the virtue is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions, not only in a general sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with knowledge, all virtues had to be regulated by it. Distinguishing when acts are courageous, as opposed to reckless or cowardly, is an act of prudence, and for this reason it is classified as a cardinal (pivotal) virtue.\n\nIn modern English, the word has become increasingly synonymous with cautiousness. In this sense, prudence names a reluctance to take risks, which remains a virtue with respect to unnecessary risks, but, when unreasonably extended into over-cautiousness, can become the vice of cowardice.\n\nIn the \"Nicomachean Ethics\", Aristotle gives a lengthy account of the virtue phronesis (), traditionally translated as \"prudence\", although this has become increasingly problematic as the word has fallen out of common usage. More recently ϕρόνησις has been translated by such terms as \"practical wisdom\", \"practical judgment\" or \"rational choice\".\n\nPrudence was considered by the ancient Greeks and later on by Christian philosophers, most notably Thomas Aquinas, as the cause, measure and form of all virtues. It is considered to be the \"auriga virtutum\" or the charioteer of the virtues.\n\nIt is the cause in the sense that the virtues, which are defined to be the \"perfected ability\" of man as a spiritual person (spiritual personhood in the classical western understanding means having intelligence and free will), achieve their \"perfection\" only when they are founded upon prudence, that is to say upon the perfected ability to make right decisions. For instance, a person can live temperance when he has acquired the habit of deciding correctly the actions to take in response to his instinctual cravings.\n\nIts function is to point out which course of action is to be taken in any concrete circumstances. It has nothing to do with directly willing the good it discerns. Prudence has a directive capacity with regard to the other virtues. It lights the way and measures the arena for their exercise. Without prudence, bravery becomes foolhardiness; mercy sinks into weakness, and temperance into fanaticism. Its office is to determine for each in practice those circumstances of time, place, manner, etc. which should be observed, and which the Scholastics comprise under the term \"medium rationis\". So it is that while it qualifies the intellect and not the will, it is nevertheless rightly styled a moral virtue.\n\nPrudence is considered the measure of moral virtues since it provides a model of ethically good actions. \"The work of art is true and real by its correspondence with the pattern of its prototype in the mind of the artist. In similar fashion, the free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the pattern of prudence.\" (Josef Pieper) For instance, a stockbroker using his experience and all the data available to him decides that it is beneficial to sell stock A at 2PM tomorrow and buy stock B today. The content of the decision (e.g., the stock, amount, time, and means) is the product of an act of prudence, while the actual carrying out of the decision may involve other virtues like fortitude (doing it in spite of fear of failure) and justice (doing his job well out of justice to his company and his family). The actual act's \"goodness\" is measured against that original decision made through prudence.\n\nIn Greek and Scholastic philosophy, \"form\" is the specific characteristic of a thing that makes it what it is. With this language, prudence confers upon other virtues the form of its inner essence; that is, its specific character as a virtue. For instance, not all acts of telling the truth are considered good, considered as done with the virtue of honesty. What makes telling the truth a virtue is whether it is done with prudence.\n\nIn Christian understanding, the difference between prudence and cunning lies in the intent with which the decision of the context of an action is made. The Christian understanding of the world includes the existence of God, the natural law and moral implications of human actions. In this context, prudence is different from cunning in that it takes into account the supernatural good. For instance, the decision of persecuted Christians to be martyred rather than deny their faith is considered prudent. \n\nAccording to Thomas Aquinas, judgments using reasons for evil ends or using evil means are considered to be made through \"cunning\" and \"false prudence\" and not through prudence. However \"imprudence\" was not be considered a sin since it was not voluntary.\n\nThe Ancient Greek term for prudence is synonymous with “forethought\". People, the Ancient Greeks believed, must have enough prudence to prepare for worshiping the Olympian gods. Exceptional were the foolish Bacchic cult, who lived an emotional and passionate lifestyle. Believing the antisexual Olympian traditions to be shameful, professors of the Bacchic cult celebrated the irrationality that governed their religion.\n\nPrudence is the application of universal principles to particular situations. \"Integral parts\" of virtues, in Scholastic philosophy, are the elements that must be present for any complete or perfect act of the virtue. The following are the integral parts of prudence:\n\nIn ethics, a \"prudential judgment\" is one where the circumstances must be weighed to determine the correct action. Generally, it applies to situations where two people could weigh the circumstances differently and \"ethically\" come to different conclusions.\n\nFor instance, in the theory of just war, the government of a nation must weigh whether the harms they suffer are more than the harms that would be produced by their going to war against another nation that is harming them; the decision whether to go to war is therefore a prudential judgment.\n\nIn another case, a patient who has a terminal illness with no conventional treatment may hear of an experimental treatment. To decide whether to take it would require weighing on one hand, the cost, time, possible lack of benefit, and possible pain, disability, and hastened death, and on the other hand, the possible benefit and the benefit to others of what could be learned from his case.\n\nPhronesis, or practical wisdom, holds an important place in rhetorical theory as a central aspect of judgment and practice. Aristotle's notion of phronesis fits with his notes on rhetoric because neither, in his estimation, could be reduced to an \"episteme\" or a \"techne\", and both deal with the ability to deliberate about contingent, variable, or indeterminate matters.\n\nCicero defined \"prudentia\" as a rhetorical norm in \"De Oratore\", \"De officiis\", \"De Inventione\", and \"De re publica\". He contrasts the term with \"imprudens\", young men failing to consider the consequences before they act. The \"prudens\", or those who had prudence, knew when to speak and when to stay silent. Cicero maintained that prudence was gained only through experience, and while it was applied in everyday conversation, in public discourse it was subordinated to the broader term for wisdom, \"sapientia\".\n\nIn the contemporary era, rhetorical scholars have tried to recover a robust meaning for the term. They have maintained consistency with the ancient orators, contending that prudence is an embodied persuasive resource. Although sets of principles or rules can be constructed in a particular culture, scholars agree that prudence cannot be derived from a set of timeless principles. Instead, through gauging the situation and through reasoned deliberation, a speaker should determine the set of values and morals by which to base his or her actions. Furthermore, scholars suggest the capacity to take into account the particularities of the situation as vital to prudential practice. For example, as rhetorical scholar Lois Self explains, \"both rhetoric and phronesis are normative processes in that they involve rational principles of choice-making; both have general applicability but always require careful analysis of particulars in determining the best response to each specific situation; both ideally take into account the wholeness of human nature; and finally, both have social utility and responsibility in that both treat matter of the public good\". Robert Hariman, in his examination of Malcolm X, adds that \"aesthetic sensibility, imitation of a performative ideal, and improvisation upon conventions of presentation\" are also components of practical reasoning.\n\nSmall differences emerge between rhetorical scholars regarding definitions of the term and methods of analysis. Hans-Georg Gadamer asserted that prudence materializes through the application of principles and can be evaluated accordingly. In his analysis of Andrew Cuomo's speech to the Catholic Church of Notre Dame, James Jasinski contends that prudence cannot as it is not a \"episteme\" or \"techne\"; instead, it is judged according to embodied rhetorical performance. Thus, while Gadamer would judge prudence based on the execution of contingent principles, Jasinski would examine the artistry of communication in its cultural milieu between accommodation (compromise) and audacity (courage).\n\nIn his study of Machiavelli, examining the relationship between prudence and moderation, rhetorician Eugene Garver holds that there is a middle ground between \"an ethics of principles, in which those principles univocally dictate action\" and \"an ethics of consequences, in which the successful result is all\". His premise stems from Aristotle's theory of virtue as an \"intermediate\", in which moderation and compromise embody prudence. Yet, because valorizing moderation is not an active response, prudence entails the \"transformation of moderation\" into a fitting response, making it a flexible situational norm. Garver also asserts that prudential reasoning differs from \"algorithmic\" and \"heuristic\" reasoning because it is rooted in a political community, the context in which common problems regarding stability and innovation arise and call for prudential reasoning.\n\nEconomists describe a consumer as \"prudent\" if he or she saves more when faced with riskier future income. This additional saving is called precautionary saving. \n\nIf a risk-averse consumer has a utility function formula_1 over consumption \"x\", and if formula_1 is differentiable, then the consumer is not prudent unless the third derivative of utility is positive, that is, formula_3.\n\nThe strength of the precautionary saving motive can be measured by absolute prudence, which is defined as\nformula_4. Similarly, relative prudence is defined as absolute prudence, multiplied by the level of consumption. These measures are closely related to the concepts of absolute and relative risk aversion developed by Kenneth Arrow and John W. Pratt.\n\nIn accounting, prudence was long considered one of the \"fundamental accounting concepts\" in its determination of the time for revenue recognition. The rule of prudence meant that gains should not be anticipated unless their realisation was highly probable. However, recent developments in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have led academic critics to accuse the international standard-setting body IASB of abandoning prudence. In the British reporting standard FRS 18, prudence, along with consistency, was relegated to a \"desirable\" quality of financial information rather than fundamental concept. Prudence was rejected for IFRS because it was seen as compromising accounts' neutrality.\n\nIn a 2011 report on the financial crisis of 2007–08, the British House of Lords bemoaned the demotion of prudence as a governing principle of accounting and audit. Their comments, however, were disputed by some leading practitioners.\n\n\n"}

If defendant uses defensive force because of such a perception, and the perception is not reasonable, the defendant may have an \"imperfect self-defense\" as an excuse.\n\nThe early theories make no distinction between defense of the person and defense of property. Whether consciously or not, this builds on the Roman Law principle of \"dominium\" where any attack on the members of the family or the property it owned was a personal attack on the \"pater familias\" the male head of the household, sole owner of all property belonging to the household, and endowed by law with dominion over all his descendants through the male line no matter their age. The right to self-defense is phrased as the principle of \"vim vi repellere licet\" (\"it is permitted to repel force by force\") in the \"Digest\" of Justitian (6th century).\n\nIn \"Leviathan\" (1651), Hobbes (using the English term \"self-defense\" for the first time) proposed the foundation political theory that distinguishes between a state of nature where there is no authority and a modern state. Hobbes argues that although some may be stronger or more intelligent than others in their natural state, none are so strong as to be beyond a fear of violent death, which justifies self-defense as the highest necessity. In the \"Two Treatises of Government\", John Locke asserts the reason why an owner would give up their autonomy:\n\n...the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.\n\nIn earlier times before the development of national policing, an attack on the family home was effectively either an assault on the people actually inside or an indirect assault on their welfare by depriving them of shelter and/or the means of production. This linkage between a personal attack and property weakened as societies developed but the threat of violence remains a key factor. As an aspect of sovereignty, in his 1918 speech \"Politik als Beruf\" (Politics as a Vocation), Max Weber defined a state as an authority claiming the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force within defined territorial boundaries. Recognizing that the modern framework of nations has emerged from the use of force, Weber asserted that the exercise of power through the institutions of government remained indispensable for effective government at any level which necessarily implies that self-help is limited if not excluded.\n\nFor modern theorists, the question of self-defense is one of moral authority within the nation to set the limits to obedience to the state and its laws given the pervasive dangers in a world full of weapons. In modern societies, states are increasingly delegating or privatizing their coercive powers to corporate providers of security services either to supplement or replace components within the power hierarchy. The fact that states no longer claim a monopoly to police within their borders, enhances the argument that individuals may exercise a right or privilege to use violence in their own defense. Indeed, modern libertarianism characterizes the majority of laws as intrusive to personal autonomy and, in particular, argues that the right of self-defense from coercion (including violence) is a fundamental human right, and in all cases, with no exceptions, justifies all uses of violence stemming from this right, regardless whether in defense of the person or property. In this context, note that Article 12 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:\n\nNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\n\nThe inclusion of defense of one's family and home recognizes the universal benefit claimed to stem from the family's peaceable possession of private property. This general approach implicitly attacks Hohfeld's focus on the correlative relationship between right and duty as an aspect of human interactiveness as opposed to rights deemed implicitly more important because they attach to a person by virtue of his or her ownership of property. Further, it follows that, in this moral balancing exercise, laws must simultaneously criminalize aggression resulting in loss or injury, but decriminalize qualitatively identical violence causing loss or injury because it is used in self-defense. As a resolution of this apparent paradox and in defiance of Hohfeld, Robert Nozick asserted that there are no positive civil rights, only rights to property and the right of autonomy. In this theory, the \"acquisition principle\" states that people are entitled to defend and retain all holdings acquired in a just way and the \"rectification principle\" requires that any violation of the first principle be repaired by returning holdings to their rightful owners as a \"one time\" redistribution. Hence, in default of self-defense in the first instance, any damage to property must be made good either in kind or by value. Similarly, theorists such as George Fletcher and Robert Schopp have adopted European concepts of autonomy in their liberal theories to justify the right-holder using all necessary force to defend his or her autonomy and rights. This right inverts the \"felicitation principle\" of utilitarianism with the responsive violence being the greatest good to the individual, but accurately mirrors Jeremy Bentham who saw property as the driving force to enable individuals to enhance their utilities through stable investment and trade. In liberal theory, therefore, to maximise the utility, there is no need to retreat nor use only proportionate force. The attacker is said to sacrifice legal protection when initiating the attack. In this respect, the criminal law is not the tool of a welfare state which offers a safety net for all when they are injured. Nevertheless, some limits must be recognized as where a minor initial attack simply becomes a pretext for an excessively violent response. The civil law systems have a theory of \"abuse of right\" to explain denial of justification in such extreme cases.\n\nThe rules are the same when force is used to protect \"another\" from danger. Generally, the defendant must have a reasonable belief that the third party is in a position where they have the right of self-defense. For example, a person who unknowingly chances upon two actors practicing a fight would be able to defend their restraint of the one that appeared to be the aggressor. However, in many jurisdictions a person who causes injury in defense of another may be liable to criminal and civil charges if such defence turned out to be unnecessary.\n\nDefense of others is called \"pikuach nefesh\" in Jewish law. One must violate most negative commandments of the Torah in order to save someone's life.\n\nWhen trying to claim a self-defense case it will all depend on the threat. Was it a verbal threat to where the person felt threatened. To where he or she felt like they needed to defend themselves. It will also depend on if the threat was imminent or not. Was the threat about to happen, was the person's life really in danger. Did he or she provoke the person for the attack to happen. When the person attacked the person, did his or hers self-defense match the threat. Was it an overkill to where the person ended up dead. To where you didn't need to put that much force towards a person. Was it a 'castle doctrine' defense. Did they intentionally break in your home and try to harm you or your family to where he or she had to defend themselves or others using deadly force. To claim self-defense one of these things must have happened. \n\nModel Penal Code §3.04 contains an elaborate formulation for use of force, including when it is justified, and limitations on the justification.\n\nIn \"People v. La Voie\", Supreme Court of Colorado, 395 P.2d 1001 (1964), The court wrote, \"When a person has reasonable grounds for believing, and does in fact actually believe, that danger of his being killed, or of receiving great bodily harm, is imminent, he may act on such appearances and defend himself, even to the extent of taking human life when necessary, although it may turn out that the appearances were false, or although he may have been mistaken as to the extent of the real actual danger.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51490", "title": "Rights", "text": "Rights\n\nRights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\nRights are often considered fundamental to civilization, for they are regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", \"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\".\n\nThere is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term \"rights\". It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.\n\nOne way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: \n\nThere are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:\n\nThere has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as philosophy, law, deontology, logic, political science, and religion.\n\n\nSome thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, Jeremy Bentham believed that legal rights were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas Thomas Aquinas held that rights purported by positive law but not grounded in natural law were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights.\n\n\nLiberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a \"liberty right\" to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's \"liberty right\" of walking extends precisely to the point where another's \"claim right\" limits his or her freedom.\n\nIn one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called \"positive rights\". However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called \"negative rights\"; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the United States, citizens have the \"positive right\" to vote and they have the \"negative right\" to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. Australia, however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since voting is compulsory. Accordingly:\n\nThough similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with \"active rights\" (which encompass \"privileges\" and \"powers\") and \"passive rights\" (which encompass \"claims\" and \"immunities\").\n\nThe general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author Ayn Rand who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as Objectivism. However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or \"group rights\". Accordingly:\n\n\nThere can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called closed shop which has a union security agreement, only the union has a \"right\" to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed \"individual rights\" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the \"group rights\" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.\n\nThe Austrian School of Economics holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called methodological individualism and is used by the economists to justify individual rights.\n\nOther distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or family resemblance than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, between which the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into three generations. These distinctions have much overlap with that between negative and positive rights, as well as between individual rights and group rights, but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.\n\nRights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.\n\nRights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights. Issues of concern have historically included labor rights, LGBT rights, reproductive rights, disability rights, patient rights and prisoners' rights. With increasing monitoring and the information society, information rights, such as the right to privacy are becoming more important.\n\nSome examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include animals, and amongst humans, groups such as children and youth, parents (both mothers and fathers), and men and women.\n\nAccordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as \"rights\" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a \"right to medical care\" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the \"right to a fair trial\".\n\nFurther, the term \"equality\" which is often bound up with the meaning of \"rights\" often depends on one's political orientation. Conservatives and libertarians and advocates of free markets often identify equality with equality of opportunity, and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, socialists often identify equality with equality of outcome and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as health care or economic assistance or housing.\n\nIn philosophy, meta-ethics is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being normative ethics and applied ethics.\n\nWhile normative ethics addresses such questions as \"What should one do?\", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as \"What \"is\" goodness?\" and \"How can we tell what is good from what is bad?\", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.\n\nRights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of \"what normative ethics is concerned with\" (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).\nRights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:\n\nRights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.\n\nSome philosophers have criticised rights as ontologically dubious entities. For instance, although in favour of the extension of individual legal rights, the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham opposed the idea of natural law and natural rights, calling them \"nonsense upon stilts\". Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.\n\nThe Modern English word \"right\" derives from Old English \"riht\" or \"reht\", in turn from Proto-Germanic \"*riχtaz\" meaning \"right\" or \"direct\", and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European \"*reg-to-\" meaning \"having moved in a straight line\", in turn from \"*(o)reg'(a)-\" meaning \"to straighten or direct\". In several different Indo-European languages, a single word derived from the same root means both \"right\" and \"law\", such as French \"droit\", Spanish \"derecho\", German \"Recht\", and Italian \"diritto\".\n\nMany other words related to normative or regulatory concepts derive from this same root, including \"correct\", \"regulate\", and \"rex\" (meaning \"king\"), whence \"regal\" and thence \"royal\". Likewise many more geometric terms derive from this same root, such as \"erect\" (as in \"upright\"), \"rectangle\" (literally \"right angle\"), \"straight\" and \"stretch\". Like \"right\", the English words \"rule\" and \"ruler\", deriving still from the same root, have both normative or regulatory and geometric meanings (e.g. a ruler as in a king, or a ruler as in a straightedge).\n\nSeveral other roots have similar normative and geometric descendants, such as Latin \"norma\", whence \"norm\", \"normal\", and \"normative\" itself, and also geometric concepts such as \"normal vectors\"; and likewise Greek \"ortho\" and Latin \"ordo\", meaning either \"right\" or \"correct\" (as in \"orthodox\", meaning \"correct opinion\") or \"straight\" or \"perpendicular\" (as in \"orthogonal\", meaning \"perpendicular angle\"), and thence \"order\", \"ordinary\", etc.\n\nThe specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.\n\nHistorically, many notions of rights were authoritarian and hierarchical, with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to respected from his son did not indicate a right from the son to receive a return from that respect; and the divine right of kings, which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.\n\nIn contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized liberty and equality as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the American and French revolutions.\n\nImportant documents in the political history of rights include:\n\n\n\nOrganisations:\n\n"}
{"id": "6152392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6152392", "title": "Scott–Potter set theory", "text": "Scott–Potter set theory\n\nAn approach to the foundations of mathematics that is of relatively recent origin, Scott–Potter set theory is a collection of nested axiomatic set theories set out by the philosopher Michael Potter, building on earlier work by the mathematician Dana Scott and the philosopher George Boolos.\n\nPotter (1990, 2004) clarified and simplified the approach of Scott (1974), and showed how the resulting axiomatic set theory can do what is expected of such theory, namely grounding the cardinal and ordinal numbers, Peano arithmetic and the other usual number systems, and the theory of relations.\n\nThis section and the next follow Part I of Potter (2004) closely. The background logic is first-order logic with identity. The ontology includes urelements as well as sets, which makes it clear that there can be sets of entities defined by first-order theories not based on sets. The urelements are not essential in that other mathematical structures can be defined as sets, and it is permissible for the set of urelements to be empty.\n\nSome terminology peculiar to Potter's set theory:\n\nThe following three axioms define the theory ZU.\n\nCreation: ∀\"V\"∃\"V' \"(\"V\"∈\"V' \").\n\n\"Remark\": There is no highest level, hence there are infinitely many levels. This axiom establishes the ontology of levels.\n\nSeparation: An axiom schema. For any first-order formula Φ(\"x\") with (bound) variables ranging over the level \"V\", the collection {\"x\"∈\"V\" : Φ(\"x\")} is also a set. (See Axiom schema of separation.)\n\n\"Remark\": Given the levels established by \"Creation\", this schema establishes the existence of sets and how to form them. It tells us that a level is a set, and all subsets, definable via first-order logic, of levels are also sets. This schema can be seen as an extension of the background logic.\n\nInfinity: There exists at least one limit level. (See Axiom of infinity.)\n\n\"Remark\": Among the sets \"Separation\" allows, at least one is infinite. This axiom is primarily mathematical, as there is no need for the actual infinite in other human contexts, the human sensory order being necessarily . For mathematical purposes, the axiom \"There exists an inductive set\" would suffice.\n\nThe following statements, while in the nature of axioms, are not axioms of ZU. Instead, they assert the existence of sets satisfying a stated condition. As such, they are \"existence premises,\" meaning the following. Let X denote any statement below. Any theorem whose proof requires X is then formulated conditionally as \"If X holds, then...\" Potter defines several systems using existence premises, including the following two:\n\nOrdinals: For each (infinite) ordinal α, there exists a corresponding level \"V\".\n\n\"Remark\": In words, \"There exists a level corresponding to each infinite ordinal.\" \"Ordinals\" makes possible the conventional Von Neumann definition of ordinal numbers. \n\nLet τ(\"x\") be a first-order term.\n\nReplacement: An axiom schema. For any collection \"a\", ∀\"x\"∈\"a\"[τ(\"x\") is a set] → {τ(\"x\") : \"x\"∈\"a\"} is a set.\n\n\"Remark\": If the term τ(\"x\") is a function (call it \"f\"(\"x\")), and if the domain of \"f\" is a set, then the range of \"f\" is also a set.\n\nReflection: Let Φ denote a first-order formula in which any number of free variables are present. Let Φ denote Φ with these free variables all quantified, with the quantified variables restricted to the level \"V\".\n\nThen ∃\"V\"[Φ→Φ] is an axiom.\n\n\"Remark\": This schema asserts the existence of a \"partial\" universe, namely the level \"V\", in which all properties Φ holding when the quantified variables range over all levels, also hold when these variables range over \"V\" only. \"Reflection\" turns \"Creation\", \"Infinity\", \"Ordinals\", and \"Replacement\" into theorems (Potter 2004: §13.3).\n\nLet \"A\" and \"a\" denote sequences of nonempty sets, each indexed by \"n\".\n\nCountable Choice: Given any sequence \"A\", there exists a sequence \"a\" such that:\n\n\"Remark\". \"Countable Choice\" enables proving that any set must be one of finite or infinite.\n\nLet \"B\" and \"C\" denote sets, and let \"n\" index the members of \"B\", each denoted \"B\".\n\nChoice: Let the members of \"B\" be disjoint nonempty sets. Then:\n\nThe Von Neumann universe implements the \"iterative conception of set\" by stratifying the universe of sets into a series of \"levels,\" with the sets at a given level being the members of the sets making up the next higher level. Hence the levels form a nested and well-ordered sequence, and would form a hierarchy if set membership were transitive. The resulting iterative conception steers clear, in a well-motivated way, of the well-known paradoxes of Russell, Burali-Forti, and Cantor. These paradoxes all result from the unrestricted use of the principle of comprehension that naive set theory allows. Collections such as \"the class of all sets\" or \"the class of all ordinals\" include sets from all levels of the hierarchy. Given the iterative conception, such collections cannot form sets at any given level of the hierarchy and thus cannot be sets at all. The iterative conception has gradually become more accepted over time, despite an imperfect understanding of its historical origins.\n\nBoolos's (1989) axiomatic treatment of the iterative conception is his set theory \"S\", a two sorted first order theory involving sets and levels.\n\nScott (1974) did not mention the \"iterative conception of set,\" instead proposing his theory as a natural outgrowth of the simple theory of types. Nevertheless, Scott's theory can be seen as an axiomatization of the iterative conception and the associated iterative hierarchy.\n\nScott began with an axiom he declined to name: the atomic formula \"x\"∈\"y\" implies that \"y\" is a set. In symbols:\nHis axiom of \"Extensionality\" and axiom schema of \"Comprehension\" (Separation) are strictly analogous to their ZF counterparts and so do not mention levels. He then invoked two axioms that do mention levels:\n\"Restriction\" also implies the existence of at least one level and assures that all sets are well-founded.\n\nScott's final axiom, the \"Reflection\" schema, is identical to the above existence premise bearing the same name, and likewise does duty for ZF's \"Infinity\" and \"Replacement\". Scott's system has the same strength as ZF.\n\nPotter (1990, 2004) introduced the idiosyncratic terminology described earlier in this entry, and discarded or replaced all of Scott's axioms except \"Reflection\"; the result is ZU. ZU, like ZF, cannot be finitely axiomatized. ZU differs from ZFC in that it:\n\nHence ZU is closer to the Zermelo set theory of 1908, namely ZFC minus Choice, Replacement, and Foundation. It is stronger than this theory, however, since cardinals and ordinals can be defined, despite the absence of Choice, using Scott's trick and the existence of levels, and no such definition is possible in Zermelo set theory. Thus in ZU, an equivalence class of:\n\nSimilarly the natural numbers are not defined as a particular set within the iterative hierarchy, but as models of a \"pure\" Dedekind algebra. \"Dedekind algebra\" is Potter's name for a set closed under a unary injective operation, successor, whose domain contains a unique element, zero, absent from its range. Because the theory of Dedekind algebras is categorical (all models are isomorphic), any such algebra can proxy for the natural numbers.\n\nAlthough Potter (2004) devotes an entire appendix to proper classes, the strength and merits of Scott–Potter set theory relative to the well-known rivals to ZFC that admit proper classes, namely NBG and Morse–Kelley set theory, have yet to be explored.\n\nScott–Potter set theory resembles NFU in that the latter is a recently (Jensen 1967) devised axiomatic set theory admitting both urelements and sets that are not well-founded. But the urelements of NFU, unlike those of ZU, play an essential role; they and the resulting restrictions on Extensionality make possible a proof of NFU's consistency relative to Peano arithmetic. But nothing is known about the strength of NFU relative to \"Creation\"+\"Separation\", NFU+\"Infinity\" relative to ZU, and of NFU+\"Infinity\"+\"Countable Choice\" relative to ZU + \"Countable Choice\".\n\nUnlike nearly all writing on set theory in recent decades, Potter (2004) mentions mereological fusions. His \"collections\" are also synonymous with the \"virtual sets\" of Willard Quine and Richard Milton Martin: entities arising from the free use of the principle of comprehension that can never be admitted to the universe of discourse.\n\n\n\nReviews of Potter (2004):\n"}
{"id": "38871977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38871977", "title": "Sex differences in humans", "text": "Sex differences in humans\n\nSex differences in humans have been studied in a variety of fields. In humans, biological sex is determined by five factors present at birth: the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, the type of gonads, the sex hormones, the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus), and the external genitalia. Genetic sex is determined solely by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome. \n\nSex differences generally refer to traits that are sexually dimorphic. A subset of such differences is hypothesized to be the product of the evolutionary process of sexual selection.\n\nSex differences in medicine include sex-specific diseases, which are diseases that occur \"only\" in people of one sex; and sex-related diseases, which are diseases that are more usual to one sex, or which manifest differently in each sex. For example, certain autoimmune diseases may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of primary biliary cirrhosis cases are women, whereas primary sclerosing cholangitis is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied. The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients. More recently, medical research has started to understand the importance of taking the sex into account as the symptoms and responses to medical treatment may be very different between sexes.\n\nNeither concept should be confused with sexually transmitted diseases, which are diseases that have a significant probability of transmission through sexual contact.\n\nSex-related illnesses have various causes:\nResearch has found that female doctors may be providing better care than male doctors in the U.S. and also in Canada.\n\nSex differences in human physiology are distinctions of physiological characteristics associated with either male or female humans. These can be of several types, including direct and indirect. Direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome, and indirect being a characteristic influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. Sexual dimorphism is a term for the phenotypic difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a bimodal distribution. Through the process of meiosis and fertilization (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression (although the deviations in complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions). These include, most conspicuously, male (vs female) gonads.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by empirical data and statistical analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a bell-curve (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. For example, most males are taller and stronger than females, but an individual female could be taller and stronger than an individual male. The extents of these differences vary across societies.\n\nThe most obvious differences between males and females include all the features related to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physiological and behavioral effects, including gonadal differentiation, internal and external genital and breast differentiation, and differentiation of muscle mass, height, and hair distribution. There are also differences in the structure of specific areas of the brain. For example, on average, the SDN (INAH3 in humans) has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females.\n\nResearch on biological sex differences in human psychology investigates cognitive and behavioral differences between men and women. This research employs experimental tests of cognition, which take a variety of forms. Tests focus on possible differences in areas such as IQ, spatial reasoning, aggression, emotion, and brain structure and function.\n\nChromosomal make up is important in human psychology. Women have two X chromosomes while males have an X and Y chromosomal structure. The X chromosome is much more active than Y and it affects behavior. Genetic researchers theorize that the X chromosome may contain a gene responsible for sociability.\n\nMost IQ tests are constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males. Areas where differences have been found include verbal and mathematical ability. IQ tests that measure fluid \"g\" and have not been constructed to eliminate sex differences also tend to show that sex differences are either non-existent or negligible. 2008 research found that, for grades 2 to 11, there were no significant gender differences in math skills among the general population. Differences in variability of IQ scores have been observed in studies, with more men falling at the extremes of the spectrum.\n\nBecause social and environmental factors affect brain activity and behavior, where differences are found, it can be difficult for researchers to assess whether or not the differences are innate. Studies on this topic explore the possibility of social influences on how both sexes perform in cognitive and behavioral tests. Stereotypes about differences between men and women have been shown to affect a person's behavior (this is called stereotype threat).\n\nIn his book titled \"Gender, Nature, and Nurture\", psychologist Richard Lippa found that there were large differences in women's and men's preferences for realistic occupations (for example, mechanic or carpenters) and moderate differences in their preferences for social and artistic occupations. His results also found that women tend to be more people-oriented and men more thing-oriented.\n\nHartung & Widiger (1998) found that many kinds of mental illnesses and behavioral problems show gender differences in prevalence and incidence. \"Of the 80 disorders diagnosed in adulthood for which sex ratios are provided, 35 are said to be more common in men than in women (17 of which are substance related or a paraphilia), 31 are said to be more common in women than men, and 14 are said to be equally common in both sexes.\"\n\nDifferences in male and female jealousy can also be observed. While female jealousy is more likely to be inspired by emotional infidelity, male jealousy is most likely to be brought on by sexual infidelity. A clear majority of approximately 62% to 86% of women reported that they would be more bothered by emotional infidelity and 47% to 60% of men reported that they would be more bothered by sexual infidelity.\n\nIn 2005, Janet Shibley Hyde from the University of Wisconsin-Madison introduced the gender similarities hypothesis, which suggests that males and females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables. The research focused on cognitive variables (for example, reading comprehension, mathematics), communication (for example, talkativeness, facial expressions), social and personality (for example, aggression, sexuality), psychological well-being, and motor behaviors. Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences. She concludes her article by stating: \"It is time to consider the costs of overinflated claims of gender differences. Arguably, they cause harm in numerous realms, including women’s opportunities in the workplace, couple conflict and communication, and analyses of self-esteem problems among adolescents.\"\n\nHyde also stated elsewhere that \"variations \"within\" genders are greater than variations \"between\" genders.\"\n\nIn 2012 Irina Trofimova reported “middle age – middle sex” phenomenon and suggested that the significant female advantage in verbal fluency and male advantage in physical power fade after age 25 in an asymmetric manner. She pointed out to several other studies on humans and other primates showing a levelling of sex differences in sociability and physical strength. Males and females might indeed have different timings of maturation of physical and verbal systems: according to McGuinness and Pribram (1978) during the first two years of life talking and walking rarely occur simultaneously, which suggests that these two abilities compete for the same set of neural connections, or that one type of neural organization inhibits the other. This coincides with the higher mobility of boys, accompanied by their lower rates of speech development in childhood, in comparison to girls. These different timings in maturation appear as sex differences in early age, and likely level off in later adulthood (Barbu, Cabanes, & Le Maner-Idrissi, 2011). This middle age – middle sex phenomenon might explain why meta-analytic reports and several experimental studies of verbal abilities and dominance using adult participants reported no sex differences.\n\nStatistics have been consistent in reporting that men commit more criminal acts than women. Self-reported delinquent acts are also higher for men than women across many different actions. Many professionals have offered explanations for this sex difference. Some differing explanations include men's evolutionary tendency toward risk and violent behavior, sex differences in activity, social support, and gender inequality.\n\nDespite the difficulty of interpreting them, crime statistics may provide a way to investigate such a relationship from a gender differences perspective. An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, testosterone or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting intimate partner violence find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement. Burton et al. (1998) found that low levels of self control are associated with criminal activity.\n\nSometimes and in some places, there are sex differences in educational achievement. This may be caused by sex discrimination in law or culture, or may reflect natural differences in the interests of the sexes.\n\nResearch has been undertaken to examine whether or not there are sex differences in leadership. Until recently, leadership positions have predominantly been held by men. Women were rarely seen in senior leadership positions leading to a lack of data on how they behave in such positions. The two main lines of research contradict one another, the first being that there are significant sex differences in leadership and the second being that gender does not have an effect on leadership.\n\nWomen and men have been surveyed by Gallup each year concerning workplace topics, and when questioned about preferences of a female boss or a male boss, women chose a preference for a male boss 39% of the time, compared to 26% of men displaying preference for a male boss. Only 27% of females would prefer a boss of the same gender. This preference, among both sexes, for male leadership in the workplace has continued unabated for sixty years, according to the survey results.\n\nSex differences in religion can be classified as either \"internal\" or \"external.\" Internal religious issues are studied from the perspective of a given religion, and might include religious beliefs and practices about the roles and rights of men and women in government, education and worship; beliefs about the sex or gender of deities and religious figures; and beliefs about the origin and meaning of human gender. External religious issues can be broadly defined as an examination of a given religion from an outsider's perspective, including possible clashes between religious leaders and laity; and the influence of, and differences between, religious perspectives on social issues. For example, various religious perspectives have either endorsed or condemned alternative family structures, homosexual relationships, and abortion. External religious issues can also be examined from the \"lens of gender\" perspective embraced by some in feminism or critical theory and its offshoots.\n\nSex differences in social capital are differences between men and women in their ability to coordinate actions and achieve their aims through trust, norms and networks. Social capital is often seen as the missing link in development; as social networks facilitate access to resources and protect the commons, while cooperation makes markets work more efficiently. Social capital has been thought of as women's capital as whereas there are gendered barriers to accessing economic capital, women's role in family, and community ensures that they have strong networks. There is potential that the concept can help to bring women's unpaid 'community and household labor', vital to survival and development, to the attention of economists. However, research analyzing social capital from a gendered perspective is rare, and the notable exceptions are very critical.\n\nSex differences in suicide have been shown to be significant; there are highly asymmetric rates of attempted and completed suicide between males and females. The gap, also called the gender paradox of suicidal behavior, can vary significantly between different countries. Statistics indicate that males die much more often by means of suicide than do females, however reported suicide attempts are 3 times more common among females than males. This paradox is partially explained by the methodology, with females more often choosing medication-induced overdosage, and males more often turning to weapons such as firearms or knives.\n\nSex differences in financial decision making are relevant and significant. Numerous studies have found that women tend to be financially more risk-averse than men and hold safer portfolios. A May 3, 2015 article in the Wall Street Journal by Georgette Jasen reported that \"when it comes to investing, men sometimes have their way of doing things, and women have different ways.\" Scholarly research has documented systematic differences in financial decisions such as buying investments versus insurance, donating to ingroups versus outgroups (such as terrorism victims in Iraq versus USA), spending in stores, and the endowment effect-or asking price for goods people have. The majority of these studies are based on the theory of agency-communion developed by David Bakan in 1966; according to this theory, due to factors such as socialization, males are typically more agentic (focus on self, upside potential, aggressiveness) and females typically more communal (focus on others, downside potential, and nurturing). This framework robustly explains many financial decision making outcomes.\n\n"}

According to such beliefs each subtle body corresponds to a subtle plane of existence, in a hierarchy or great chain of being that culminates in the physical form.\n\nAccording to \"Bhagavad Gita\", one of the most sacred texts of Hinduism, the subtle body is composed of mind, intelligence and ego, which controls the gross physical body. It is also known in other different spiritual traditions: \"the most sacred body\" (\"wujud al-aqdas\") and \"true and genuine body\" (\"jism asli haqiqi\") in Sufism, \"the diamond body\" in Taoism and Vajrayana, \"the light body\" or \"rainbow body\" in Tibetan Buddhism, \"the body of bliss\" in Kriya Yoga, and \"the immortal body\" (\"soma athanaton\") in Hermeticism. The various attributes of the subtle body are frequently described in terms of often obscure symbolism: Tantra features references to the sun and moon as well as various Indian rivers and deities, while Taoist alchemy speaks of cauldrons and cinnabar fields.\n\nThe expression \"subtile body\" appears suddenly in English literature in about 1650, appears erratically until it ceased to be used by about 1840. At that time, the more common term \"subtle body\" comes into use. The latter expression gradually gains in currency through the nineteenth century, and begins a sharp increase in usage from about 1940 until the present time. Further research is needed to clarify the actual authors who used the phrase, and what they meant by it. But the word may have a connection with the Sanskrit Sūkṣma (subtle, unmanifest, dormant) Śarīra (body) which is described in the Vedas.\n\nThe Yogic, Tantric and other systems of Hinduism, Vajrayana Buddhism, as well as Chinese Taoist alchemy contain theories of subtle physiology having a number of focal points (chakras, acupuncture points) connected by a series of channels (nadis, meridians) that convey subtle breath (prana, vayu, ch'i, ki, lung).\n\nThese invisible channels and points are understood to determine the characteristics of the visible physical form. By understanding and mastering the subtlest levels of reality one gains mastery over the physical realm. Through practice of various breathing and visualization exercises one is able to manipulate and direct the flow of vital force, to achieve supernormal powers \"(\"Sanskrit: \"siddhis)\" and attain higher states of consciousness, immortality, or liberation.\n\nEarly mentions of subtle body (Sanskrit: \"sūkṣma śarīra\") concepts appear in the Upanishads, particularly the earliest known theory appears in the Taittiriya Upanishad's (circa 4th or 5th centuries BCE) theory of five bodies or selves. The Taittiriya differentiates between five increasingly subtle body/selves: \nThe Taittiriya also contains passages which suggests a theory of a subtle internal anatomy which includes the concept of a central channel (nadi). In later Vedic texts called samhitas and brahmanas one also finds a theory of five \"winds\" or \"breaths\" (\"vayus, pranas\"):\nA millennium later, these concepts were adapted and refined by various spiritual traditions. The similar concept of the is seen as the vehicle of consciousness in later Samkhya, Vedanta, and Yoga, and is propelled by past-life tendencies, or \"bhavas\". Linga can be translated as \"characteristic mark\" or \"impermanence\" and the term Sarira (Vedanta) as \"form\" or \"mold\". \"Karana\" or \"instrument\" is a synonymous term. In the Classical Samkhya system of Isvarakrsna (ca. 4th century CE), the \"Lińga\" is the characteristic mark of the transmigrating entity. It consists of twenty-five tattvas from eternal consciousness down to the five organs of sense, five of activity (\"buddindriya\" or \"jñānendriya\", and \"karmendriya\" respectively) and the five subtle elements that are the objects of sense (\"tanmatras\") The \"Samkhyakarika\" says:\n\nThe classical Vedanta tradition developed the theory of the five bodies into the theory of the koshas \"sheaths\" or \"coverings\" which surround and obscure the self (atman). In classical Vedanta these are seen as obstacles to realization and traditions like Shankara's Advaita Vedanta had little interest in working with the subtle body.\n\nIn Tantra traditions meanwhile (Shaiva Kaula and Buddhist yoga), the subtle body was seen in a more positive light, offering potential for yogic practices which could lead to liberation. Tantric traditions contain the most complex theories of the subtle body, with sophisticated descriptions of energy nadis (literally \"stream or river\", channels through which \"vayu\" and \"prana\" flows) and chakras (lit. \"circles\") which are points of focus where nadis meet. The main channels, shared by both Hindu and Buddhist systems, are the central (in Hindu systems: \"susumna\"; in Buddhist: \"avadhuti\"), left and right (in Hindu systems: \"ida\" and \"pingala\"; Buddhist: \"lalana\" and \"rasana\"). Further subsidiary channels are said to radiate outwards from the chakras, where the main channels meet. There are various chakra systems depending on the tantra; the \"Netra tantra\" describes six chakras, the \"Kaulajñana-nirnay\"a describes eight, and the \"Kubjikamata Tantra\" describes seven (the most widely known set of chakras).\n\nIn the 19th century, Indian subtle body terminology was adopted by the Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky.\n\nThe modern Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba stated that the subtle body \"is the vehicle of desires and vital forces,\" He held that the subtle body is one of three bodies with which the soul must cease to identify in order to realize God.\n\nIn Buddhist Tantra, the subtle body is termed the ‘innate body’\n(\"nija-deha\") or the ‘uncommon means body’ (\"asadhdrana-upayadeha\"). It is also called \"sūkṣma śarīra\", rendered in Tibetan as \"traway-lu\" (transliterated \"phra ba’i lus\"). \n\nThe subtle body consists of thousands of subtle energy channels (nadis), which are conduits for energies or \"winds\" (lung or prana) and converge at chakras. \nAccording to Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, there are three mains channels (\"nadis\"), central, left and right; \"their beginning point is located between a person's eyebrows. From there, they run upward to the crown chakra. The passage then parallels the spine, running through all seven chakras - the centers of subtle energy - and ending about two inches below the belly button.\" \n\nBuddhist tantras generally describe four or five chakras in the shape of a lotus with varying petals. For example, the Hevajra Tantra (8th century) states:In the Center [i.e. cakra] of Creation [at the sexual organ] a sixty-four petal lotus. In the Center of Essential Nature [at the heart] an eight petal lotus. In the Center of Enjoyment [at the throat] a sixteen petal lotus. In the Center of Great Bliss [at the top of the head] a thirty-two petal lotus.In contrast, the historically later Kalachakra tantra describes six chakras.\n\nIn Vajrayana Buddhism, liberation is achieved through subtle body processes during Completion Stage practices such as the Six yogas of Naropa.\n\nH. P. Blavatsky's Theosophical teaching represented the convergence of 19th century Western occultism, Eastern philosophy, religion, science, and mysticism. \"The Secret Doctrine\", and \"The Key to Theosophy\" combined the Vedantic concept of five koshas with Western esoteric traditions (particularly Neoplatonism). She refers to three subtle bodies:\n\n\nThe \"Linga Sharira\" is the invisible double of the human body, elsewhere referred to as the etheric body, doppelgänger or bioplasmic body and serves as a model or matrix of the physical body, which conforms to the shape, appearance and condition of his \"double\". The linga sarira can be separated or projected a limited distance from the body. When separated from the body it can be wounded by sharp objects. When it returns to the physical frame, the wound will be reflected in the physical counterpart, a phenomenon called \"repercussion\". At death, it is discarded together with the physical body and eventually disintegrates or decomposes.\n\nThe mayavi-rupa is dual in its functions, being:\n\"the vehicle both of thought and of the animal passions and desires, drawing at one and the same time from the lowest terrestrial manas (mind) and Kama, the element of desire\".\n\nThe higher part of this body, containing the spiritual elements gathered during life, merges after death entirely into the causal body; while the lower part, containing the animal elements, forms the Kama-rupa, the source of \"spooks\" or apparitions of the dead.\n\nTheosophy was further systematized in the writings of C.W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant. For example, they divided Blavatsky's dual mayavi-rupa into two different bodies: the emotional and the mental bodies. They also redefined some terms. The Linga Sarira (sometimes called astral body by Blavatsky) was denominated by Annie Besant as Etheric double. C.W. Leadbeater, regarding the emotional body as the seat of the kamic principle of Blavatsky's constitution, denominated it astral body. Therefore, the subtle bodies in a human being are:\n\n\nEach \"body\" has its own aura and set of chakras, and corresponds to a particular plane of existence.\n\nThe later Theosophical arrangement was taken up by Alice Bailey, and from there found its way (with variations) into the New Age worldview. It is also associated with the human aura observed through Kirlian photography and Kilner screens. The anthroposophical view of the human being found in Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophical teachings usually referred to only the Etheric and Astral Bodies. However, Steiner also used a threefold classification of body, soul, and spirit as well as a sevenfold and a ninefold description.\n\nMax Heindel divided the subtle body into: Vital Body made of Ether, our instrument for specializing the vital energy of the sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about an inch and a half outside the body; the Desire body, which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16 inches outside our visible body, related to the Desire World; and the Mental body, which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being is seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold Soul. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.\n\nSamael Aun Weor wrote extensively on the subtle vehicles, organizing them in accordance with the kabbalistic Tree of Life. The common person only contains the lunar vehicles of emotion (astral body), thought (mental body), and will (causal body), concentrations of the collective animalistic intelligence, the evolution of the Essence through the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms. Becoming human means to have a soul, a Solar Astral Body, Solar Mental Body and Solar Causal Body. These bodies are constructed through a form of Tantra called White tantrism.\n\nBarbara Brennan's account of the subtle bodies in her books \"Hands of Light\" and \"Light Emerging\" refers to the subtle bodies as \"layers\" in the \"Human Energy Field\" or aura. Causality proceeds downwards: each of the layers has its own characteristics and can have its own expression of disease, requiring individual healing. As with the Adyar arrangement, each body or aura also has its own complement of chakras, which interrelate to those in the other layers.\n\nMichal Levin describes the relationship between the energy bodies and the chakras in her book Meditation, Path to the Deepest Self.\n\nAn interesting variant on the concept of subtle bodies is found in both Alchemical Taoism and the \"Fourth Way\" teachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, where it is said that one can create a subtle body, and hence achieve post-mortem immortality, through spiritual or yogic exercises. The \"soul\" then is not something one is born with, but something that one has to develop through esoteric practice.\n\nAccording to (Rosenthal, 1997) \"In Gurdjieff's cosmology our nature is tripartite and is composed of the physical (planetary), emotional (astral) and mental (spiritual) bodies; in each person one of these three bodies ultimately achieves dominance.\" The Fourth way as taught by Gurdjieff and Ouspensky is a philosophy of developing the divine body which is gained when one has complete understanding and self perfection. The ultimate task of the fourth way teachings is to harmoniously develop the four bodies into a single way.\n\nThe work of the \"Body of Light\" was part of English author and occultist Aleister Crowley's system of magick, saying in his \"Magick (Book 4)\" that it must be developed by rigid discipline, including rituals and the \"assumption of god-forms\", as well as by practice and experience.\n\nFrom Crowley's \"Magick Without Tears\" (Ch. 81):\n\n\"One passes through the veil of the exterior world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes \"unreal\" by comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument is a better term) called the body of Light; this one develops and controls; it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what is called \"initiation:\" finally, one carries on almost one's whole life in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the Universe.\"\n\n\n\nOther topics\n\n"}

The doctrine is based on economics within environmentalism. Typically, by providing more upfront capital, one can create a system that is less energy intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run. By redeveloping sustainably, long term energy efficiencies can be realized, coupled with highly reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWithin the ideals of nation-building, sustainable redevelopment can take up a greater significance. Post-disaster countries are in a unique situation to deal with these systems of ideals. Within this context, the idea behind initiating post-trauma sustainable redevelopment is that the underlying infrastructure is destroyed or damaged, therefore the situation is ideal for realizing the opportunities inherent to the situation.\n\nSustainable development and redevelopment are closely linked, and several organizations have been implicitly involved with sustainable development. This type of development, in contrast to redevelopment, is not different other than the application to a specified problem. Sustainable development, is a form of development that coexists with existing forms of development.\n\nWhile the systems for recreation on a small/local level are not universally widespread, there are several institutions which engage in sustainable development, that can theoretically be carried over to redevelopment. The Kyoto Protocol's 12th Article speaks to \"flexible mechanisms\". These mechanisms allow countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means, respective, of course, to that country. Theoretically, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment.\n\nThe United Nations Division for Sustainable Development \"provides leadership and is an authoritative source of expertise within the United Nations system on sustainable development\". The Division for Sustainable Development has been essential in the creation of such policies as Agenda 21, and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.\n\nThe United Nations declares that \"Sustainable reconstruction management provides numerous environmental, safety and financial benefits.\"\n\nThe World Bank has been working on sustainable development projects through one of their internal groups, the Sustainable Development Network. These two groups work together to provide key sectors for sustainable development: \"agriculture and rural development, energy, transport, water, environment, urban development, social development, oil, gas, mining, and chemicals, information and communication technologies, and sub-national activities\".\n\nThe Natural Hazards Research and Application Information Center of the University of Colorado at Boulder produced a work catalyzing the process for post-disaster sustainable redevelopment. In their book, “Holistic Disaster Recovery”, is spelled out the “Six Principles of Sustainability”\n\n1. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, its residents quality of life.\n2. Enhance local economic vitality.\n3. Ensure social and intergenerational equity.\n4. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, environmental quality.\n5. Incorporate disaster resilience and mitigation.\n6.

{"id": "4174285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4174285", "title": "The Real", "text": "The Real\n\nIn philosophy, the Real is that which is the authentic, unchangeable truth. It may be considered a primordial, external dimension of experience, referred to as the infinite, absolute or noumenal, as opposed to a reality contingent on sense perception and the material order. The Real is often considered irreducible to the symbolic order of lived experience, but may be gestured to in certain cases, such as the experience of the sublime.\n\nFor Jacques Lacan, the order of the real is not only opposed to the imaginary but is also located beyond the symbolic. Unlike the symbolic, which is constituted in terms of oppositions such as \"presence\" and \"absence\", there is no absence in the real. The symbolic opposition between \"presence\" and \"absence\" implies the possibility that something may be missing from the symbolic, the real is \"always in its place: it carries it glued to its heel, ignorant of what might exile it from there.\" If the symbolic is a set of differentiated signifiers, the real is in itself undifferentiated: \"it is without fissure.\" The symbolic introduces \"a cut in the real,\" in the process of signification: \"it is the world of words that creates the world of things.\" Thus the real emerges as that which is outside language: \"it is that which resists symbolization absolutely.\" The real is impossible because it is impossible to imagine, impossible to integrate into the symbolic order. This character of impossibility and resistance to symbolization lends the real its traumatic quality.\n\nThe primordial Real in which a (pre-Oedipal) human subject is born is differentiated from the real which a subject integrated into the symbolic order experiences. In the former, the real is the continuous, “whole” reality without categories and the differential function of language. Following the mirror stage, however, and the eventual entrance of the imaginary and the symbolic (the split of the subject between the conscious imaginary and the unconscious symbolic), the real may only be experienced as traumatic gaps in the symbolic order. An example of this are traumatic events such as natural disasters, which effectively break down the signification of everyday life and cause a rupture of something alien and unrecognizable, without the usual grammar of the symbolic that conditions how to make meaning of something and how to proceed.\n\nOne of the main methods of psychoanalysis is to drain the traumatic experiences of the real into the symbolic through free association. The analyst searches the analysand’s discourse for sounds, words, or images of fixation and through dialectization attempt to bring these fixations to the regular metonymic flow of the (unconscious) symbolic order, thereby integrating the subject further into their fantasy, usually referred to as “traversing the fantasy.”\n\nContemporary Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek has expanded on Lacan's theories and described (at least) three modalities of the Real:\n\n\"Reality, says Rudolf Christoph Eucken, is an independent spiritual world, unconditioned by the apparent world of sense. To know it and to live in it is man's true destiny. His point of contact with it is personality: the inward fount of his being: his heart, not his head. Man is real, and in the deepest sense alive, in virtue of this free personal life-principle within him; but he is bound and blinded by the ties set up between his surface-intelligence and the sense-world. The struggle for reality must be a struggle on man's part to transcend the sense-world, escape its bondage. He must renounce it, and be 're-born' to a higher level of consciousness; shifting his centre of interest from the natural to the spiritual plane. According to the thoroughness with which he does this, will be the amount of real life he enjoys. The initial break with the 'world,' the refusal to spend one’s life communing with one’s own cinematograph picture, is essential if the freedom of the infinite is to be attained. We are amphibious creatures: our life moves upon two levels at once—the natural and the spiritual. The key to the puzzle of man lies in the fact that he is \"the meeting point of various stages of Reality.\" All his difficulties and triumphs are grounded in this. The whole question for him is, which world shall be central for him—the Real, vital, all-embracing life we call spirit, or the lower life of sense? Shall 'Existence,' the superficial obvious thing, or 'Substance,' the underlying verity, be his home? Shall he remain the slave of the senses with their habits and customs, or rise to a plane of consciousness, of heroic endeavour, in which—participating in the life of spirit—he knows reality because he is real?\" (Evelyn Underhill (1911), \"Mysticism\", p. 40)\n\n\"There are,\" says Plotinus, \"different roads by which this end [apprehension of the Infinite] may be reached. The love of beauty, which exalts the poet; that devotion to the One and that ascent of science which makes the ambition of the philosopher; and that love and those prayers by which some devout and ardent soul tends in its moral purity towards perfection. These are the great highways conducting to that height above the actual and the particular, where we stand in the immediate presence of the Infinite, who shines out as from the deeps of the soul.\" (Plotinus, Letter to Flaccus)\n\nÉdouard Récéjac states: \nIf the mind penetrates deeply into the facts of aesthetics, it will find more and more, that these facts are based upon an ideal identity between the mind itself and things. At a certain point the harmony becomes so complete, and the finality so close that it gives us actual emotion. The Beautiful then becomes the sublime; brief apparition, by which the soul is caught up into the true mystic state, and touches the Absolute, the Real. It is scarcely possible to persist in this Esthetic perception without feeling lifted up by it above things and above ourselves, in an ontological vision which closely resembles the Absolute of the Mystics.

{"id": "39144241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39144241", "title": "Thermodynamic operation", "text": "Thermodynamic operation\n\nA thermodynamic operation is an externally imposed manipulation or change of connection or wall between a thermodynamic system and its surroundings. An externally imposed change in the state of the surroundings of a system can usually be regarded as a virtual thermodynamic operation. It may usually be analyzed as due to changes in the walls that separate the systems in the surroundings. It is assumed in thermodynamics that the operation is conducted in ignorance of any pertinent microscopic information.\n\nA thermodynamic operation requires a contribution from an independent external agency, that does not come from the passive properties of the systems. Perhaps the first expression of the distinction between a thermodynamic operation and a thermodynamic process is in Kelvin's statement of the second law of thermodynamics: \"It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the surrounding objects.\" A sequence of events that occurred other than \"by means of inanimate material agency\" would entail an action by an animate agency, or at least an independent external agency. Such an agency could impose some thermodynamic operations. For example, those operations might create a heat pump, which of course would comply with the second law. A Maxwell's demon conducts an extremely idealized and naturally unrealizable kind of thermodynamic operation.\n\nAn ordinary language expression for a thermodynamic operation is used by Edward A. Guggenheim: \"tampering\" with the bodies.\n\nA typical thermodynamic operation is a removal of an initially separating wall, a manipulation that unites two systems into one undivided system. A typical thermodynamic process consists of a redistribution that spreads a conserved quantity between a system and its surroundings across a previously impermeable but newly unchanging semi-permeable wall between them. More generally, a process can be considered as a transfer of some quantity that is defined by an extensive state variable of the system, so that a transfer balance equation can be written. According to Uffink, \"... thermodynamic processes only take place after an external intervention on the system (such as: removing a partition, establishing thermal contact with a heat bath, pushing a piston, etc.). They do not correspond to the autonomous behaviour of a free system.\"\n\nAs a matter of history, the distinction, between a thermodynamic operation and a thermodynamic process, is not found in these terms in nineteenth century accounts. For example, Kelvin spoke of a \"thermodynamic operation\" when he meant what present-day terminology calls a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process. Again, Planck usually spoke of a \"process\" when our present-day terminology would speak of a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process.\n\nPlanck held that all \"natural processes\" (meaning, in present-day terminology, a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process) are irreversible and proceed in the sense of increase of entropy sum. In these terms, it would be by thermodynamic operations that, if he could exist, Maxwell's demon would conduct unnatural affairs, which include transitions in the sense away from thermodynamic equilibrium. They are physically theoretically conceivable up to a point, but are not natural processes in Planck's sense. The reason is that ordinary thermodynamic operations are conducted in total ignorance of the very kinds of microscopic information that is essential to the efforts of Maxwell's demon.\n\nA thermodynamic cycle is constructed as a sequence of stages or steps. Each stage consists of a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process. For example, an initial thermodynamic operation of a cycle of a Carnot heat engine could be taken as the setting of the working body, at a known high temperature, into contact with a thermal reservoir at the same temperature (the hot reservoir), through a wall permeable only to heat, while it remains in mechanical contact with the work reservoir. This thermodynamic operation is followed by a thermodynamic process, in which the expansion of the working body is so slow as to be effectively reversible, while internal energy is transferred as heat from the hot reservoir to the working body and as work from the working body to the work reservoir. Theoretically, the process terminates eventually, and this ends the stage. The engine is then subject to another thermodynamic operation, and the cycle proceeds into another stage. The cycle completes when the thermodynamic variables (the thermodynamic state) of the working body return to their initial values.\n\nA refrigeration device passes a working substance through successive stages, overall constituting a cycle. This may be brought about not by moving or changing separating walls around an unmoving body of working substance, but rather by moving a body of working substance to bring about exposure to a cyclic succession of unmoving unchanging walls. The effect is virtually a cycle of thermodynamic operations. The kinetic energy of bulk motion of the working substance is not a significant feature of the device, and the working substance may be practically considered as nearly at rest.\n\nFor many chains of reasoning in thermodynamics, it is convenient to think of the combination of two systems into one. It is imagined that the two systems, separated from their surroundings, are juxtaposed and (by a shift of viewpoint) regarded as constituting a new, composite system. The composite system is imagined amid its new overall surroundings. This sets up the possibility of interaction between the two subsystems and between the composite system and its overall surroundings, for example by allowing contact through a wall with a particular kind of permeability. This conceptual device was introduced into thermodynamics mainly in the work of Carathéodory, and has been widely used since then.\n\nIf the thermodynamic operation is entire removal of walls, then extensive state variables of the composed system are the respective sums of those of the component systems. This is called the additivity of extensive variables.\n\nA thermodynamic system consisting of a single phase, in the absence of external forces, in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is homogeneous. This means that the material in any region of the system can be interchanged with the material of any congruent and parallel region of the system, and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged. The thermodynamic operation of \"scaling\" is the creation of a new homogeneous system whose size is a multiple of the old size, and whose intensive variables have the same values. Traditionally the size is stated by the mass of the system, but sometimes it is stated by the entropy, or by the volume. For a given such system , scaled by the real number to yield a new one , a state function, , such that , is said to be extensive. Such a function as is called a homogeneous function of degree 1. There are two different concepts mentioned here, sharing the same name: (a) the mathematical concept of degree-1 homogeneity in the scaling function; and (b) the physical concept of the spatial homogeneity of the system. It happens that the two agree here, but that is not because they are tautologous. It is a contingent fact of thermodynamics.\n\nIf two systems, and  , have identical intensive variables, a thermodynamic operation of wall removal can compose them into a single system, , with the same intensive variables. If, for example, their internal energies are in the ratio , then the composed system, , has internal energy in the ratio of to that of the system . By the inverse thermodynamic operation, the system can be split into two subsystems in the obvious way. As usual, these thermodynamic operations are conducted in total ignorance of the microscopic states of the systems. More particularly, it is characteristic of macroscopic thermodynamics that the probability vanishes, that the splitting operation occurs at an instant when system is in the kind of extreme transient microscopic state envisaged by the Poincaré recurrence argument. Such splitting and recomposition is in accord with the above defined additivity of extensive variables.\n\nThermodynamic operations appear in the statements of the laws of thermodynamics. For the zeroth law, one considers operations of thermally connecting and disconnecting systems. For the second law, some statements contemplate an operation of connecting two initially unconnected systems. For the third law, one statement is that no finite sequence of thermodynamic operations can bring a system to absolute zero temperature.\n\n"}

The victims are predominantly women, including in extreme cases murder both inside and outside the workplace.\n\nWomen working in prostitution experience more levels of violence against them than women working in other fields. In 2004 the homicide rate for female sex workers in the United States was estimated to be 204 per 100,000, although this figure mixes illegal work with legal work. This figure is considerably higher than that for the next riskiest occupations in the United States during a similar period (4 per 100,000 for female liquor store workers and 29 per 100,000 for male taxicab drivers). The prevalence of violence against prostitutes varies by location. A study of female prostitutes in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada over the age of 14 who used illicit drugs other than marijuana found that 57% of prostitutes experienced some form of gender-based violence over an 18-month period. However, a study of 1,000 female (both cisgender and transgender) sex-workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia found 93% of women surveyed had been the victim of rape in the past year.\n\nPhysical violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\". Physical violence is more commonly experienced by outdoor sex-workers with 47% of prostitutes working outdoors reporting being kicked, punched, or slapped in one study. In a study of prostitutes working in San Francisco, 82% of participants reported having experienced some type of physical violence since entering prostitution, with 55% of these assaults being committed by a client. A different study found a slightly rate lower with 74% of sex-workers reported experiencing some form of physical abuse in their lifetime. Regardless, the general consensus among most studies regarding violence against prostitutes is that rates of physical violence against prostitutes is extremely high, particularly among female sex workers (transgender inclusive) who experience higher rates of physical violence than their male counterparts.\n\nPsychological abuse, also referred to as mental abuse or emotional abuse is characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another to behavior that may result in psychological trauma, including anxiety, chronic depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. The United Nations Population Fund says that this type of violence \"includes, but is not limited to, being insulted (e.g. called derogatory names) or made to feel bad about oneself; being humiliated or belittled in front of other people; being threatened with loss of custody of one's children; being confined or isolated from family or friends; being threatened with harm to oneself or someone one cares about; repeated shouting, inducing fear through intimidating words or gestures; controlling behavior; and the destruction of possessions.\" There are certain types of psychological or emotional abuse that sex workers are more prone to such as denial of basic needs, forced drug or alcohol consumption, and being arrested for carrying condoms to name a few. Women working in prostitution are especially vulnerable to psychological abuse, particularly verbal abuse, because many customers and other members of society view them as \"whores\" or as generally undesirable women. Often verbal abuse will occur either while the service is being given, or after it has been given and the customer is not satisfied. In both these cases, verbal abuse can be a precursor to sexual violence from the client. In one study, 78% of sex-workers reported having experienced emotional or psychological abuse in their lifetime.\n\nSexual violence is any sexual act or attempt to obtain a sexual act by violence or coercion, unwanted sexual comments or advances, acts to traffic a person or acts directed against a person's sexuality, regardless of the relationship to the victim. The risks of sexual abuse are overall lower than the risks of physical abuse. with the exception of indoor prostitutes who report a higher rate of rape or attempted rape than any one type of physical violence. In one study, 44% of sex-workers reported having experienced sexual abuse in their lifetime. Rates of sexual assault and rape are higher among women (including transgender women) than among men, though the overall rate is high with one study finding that 68% of respondents had been raped since entering prostitution. These high levels of sexual violence suffered by sex workers have very traumatic effects on the men and women working as prostitutes. High levels of rape other forms of sexual violence while working as a prostitute have been linked to higher levels of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\n\nStudies have shown that younger sex-workers tend to experience more client violence than their older colleagues. Furthermore, cisgender and transgender female sex workers are also more likely to experience violence committed by a client than their male sex worker counterparts.\n\nLaws prohibiting prostitution can make it difficult for the men and women engaging in prostitution to report any violence they may experience while on the job. Often transactions or arrangements to meet up with clients must be made in secret in places where prostitution is illegal. The decriminalization of sex work in New Zealand has shown that violence is reduced when sex workers are not forced to work alone, or in isolated places. Sex work was always legal in New Zealand but decriminalization removed laws that increased danger.\nThere are substantial differences in rates of victimization between street prostitutes and indoor sex workers who work as call girls, or in brothels and massage parlors. Women who work legally in licensed brothels are much less likely to be victimized, as are indoor workers in countries where sex work is legal. A 1999 study of 240 prostitutes found that half of sex-workers working outside faced some type of violence in the past six months, compared to a quarter of those working indoors.\n\nPerpetrators may include violent clients and pimps. Clients oftentimes attempt to maintain a power balance that favors them over the prostitutes. This is often done through different methods of violence such as sexual, emotional, and physical. Though pimps may be perpetrators of violence against sex workers with 53% of sex workers in one study reporting that violence at the hands of pimps is a major problem, 33% of subjects interviewed in that same study reported that the main benefit to having a pimp is the protection from potential assault.\n\nBecause of the illegality of sex work in many parts of the world, sex workers often have to service clients in discreet and isolated spaces where they are less likely to get caught by the police. Because of this isolation, sex workers are made more vulnerable to attacks by their clients. According to a study conducted on one hundred and thirty people working in San Francisco as street sex workers, 82% had been physically assaulted, 83% had been threatened with a weapon and 68% had been raped while working as prostitutes.\n\nIn countries such as the United States sex work is illegal, and so sex workers are not able to report violence done against them in fear of being arrested themselves. In certain states anti-prostitution mandates carry a minimum sentence and can increase to felony charge after multiple arrests, which leads to difficulty finding housing and employment, and disqualification for welfare benefits. Additionally sex workers may be registered as sex offenders, or face deportation if they have precarious migratory or citizenship status.\n\nBecause of the stigma that exists around sex work, police are less likely to investigate attacks on sex workers. As one sex worker in South Africa reports \"to gather evidence of a crime against a sex worker, they have to first take it seriously,”. “If we go to the police to report abuse, we’re made fun of, we’re told ‘you deserve it.’ They chase you away,” notes another sex worker.\n\nPolice officers themselves are common perpetrators of violence against prostitutes. A study of sex-workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia found that half of the women had been beaten by police and about a third had been gang-raped by police. \"In South Africa, where sex work has been illegal since the former apartheid regime criminalized it in 1957, police officers often fine sex workers inordinate sums of money and pocket the cash, resulting in a pattern of economic extortion of sex workers by state agents.\"\n\nSex workers (particularly those engaging in street prostitution) are also sometimes targeted by serial killers, who may consider them easy targets and less likely to be missed, or who use the religious and social stigma associated with sex workers as justification for their murder.\n\nThe unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper killed at least five sex workers in London in 1888. Due to the frequent murders of prostitutes at that time and place, however, it is difficult to be certain of the number killed by Jack the Ripper. These particular murders are distinguished from other murders of sex workers during the same time period due to the post-mortem mutilations that occurred, and it is for that reason that other murders of prostitutes are not usually attributed to the Ripper, or are disputed.\n\nPeter Sutcliffe (aka the Yorkshire Ripper) murdered 13 women, some of whom were sex workers, from 1975-1980 in Northern England.\n\nGary Ridgway (aka the Green River Killer), confessed to killing 48 sex workers from 1982 to 1998, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in U.S. history.\n\nRobert Hansen murdered between 15 and 21 sex workers, near Anchorage, Alaska, between 1980 and 1983.\n\nJoel Rifkin confessed to killing 17 sex workers in the New York area between 1989 and 1993, without there having been a missing persons report filed on any of the women during that time.\n\nRobert Pickton, a Canadian who lived near Vancouver, made headlines after the remains of numerous missing sex workers were found on his family farm. He has now been convicted of the murders of 6 women who went missing from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, and is suspected by police of killing at least twenty more (though no charges have been filed in relation to their deaths). In December 2007 he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years.\n\nIn December 2006, Steve Wright murdered five sex workers in Ipswich, England (see Ipswich serial murders).\n\nMost efforts to advocate for prostitutes have focused on prevention of the spread of AIDS/HIV+ among the general population rather than focusing on how certain policies would benefit the prostitutes themselves. This focus has neglected many of the issues of violence facing sex workers. Recently, however, there has been an effort to eradicate violence against prostitutes from a wider perspective. The United Nations Population Fund, in conjunction with several other organizations, recommends community empowerment, led by sex workers, as a way to combat violence against sex-workers. UNPF also advocates for changing perceptions to view sex work as work, rather than an illegal activity. One issue facing efforts to prevent violence against prostitutes is that there is a low level of reporting violence among prostitutes. A study of female sex-workers in India found that 54% of female sex-workers do not report violence committed against them, and only 36% shared their experience with NGOs or a peer or family member.\n\nBecause of the increased risk of violence associated with working in sex work, many sex workers have begun adopting their own personal policies to reduce the likelihood of becoming the victims of violence. A study by Maureen A. Norton-Hawk found that \"40% percent of sex workers have a policy of refusing to provide services in an alley, 54% refuse to provide services in a drug house, and 68% refuse to provide services in an abandoned building.\" Often sex workers must rely on themselves or each other for support in ending violence as many campaigns to end violence against women ignore the needs of sex workers.\n\nUN Women supports the decriminalization of sex work in order to protect sex-workers from violence and abuse and encourages the criminalization of forms of violence, coercion and exploitation in sex work. Currently, however, the United States of America requires that all countries it gives aid to for AIDS/HIV+ prevention and relief agree to an \"anti-prostitution pledge\" that dictates that the country receiving aid must adopt policy that treats sex work and prostitution the same as sex trafficking. This policy has resulted in inadequate attention being paid to the health needs of prostitutes and limits the ability of the government to address the specific needs that sex workers have. Furthermore, in the United States, many states have mandatory minimum sentencing laws that require judges to give anyone convicted of prostitution a mandatory minimum prison sentence. This can, in turn, make it less likely that prostitutes take legal action against the perpetrators of violence against them because doing so could be risking jail time. One possible policy option that the Netherlands has done would be to designate specific places for sex workers and clients to meet up and arrange and engage in sexual activities. This would provide a safe and secure place for sexual services to be sold without having to remain in private which can be a risk factor for violence against prostitutes. Some organizations have even suggested forming support groups composed of sex workers in the area as a way to give sex workers the support they often lack.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "208144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208144", "title": "X chromosome", "text": "X chromosome\n\nThe X chromosome is one of the two sex-determining chromosomes (allosomes) in many organisms, including mammals (the other is the Y chromosome), and is found in both males and females. It is a part of the XY sex-determination system and X0 sex-determination system. The X chromosome was named for its unique properties by early researchers, which resulted in the naming of its counterpart Y chromosome, for the next letter in the alphabet, following its subsequent discovery.\n\nIt was first noted that the X chromosome was special in 1890 by Hermann Henking in Leipzig. Henking was studying the testicles of \"Pyrrhocoris\" and noticed that one chromosome did not take part in meiosis. Chromosomes are so named because of their ability to take up staining (\"chroma\" in Greek means \"color\"). Although the X chromosome could be stained just as well as the others, Henking was unsure whether it was a different class of object and consequently named it \"X element\", which later became X chromosome after it was established that it was indeed a chromosome.\n\nThe idea that the X chromosome was named after its similarity to the letter \"X\" is mistaken. All chromosomes normally appear as an amorphous blob under the microscope and only take on a well defined shape during mitosis. This shape is vaguely X-shaped for all chromosomes. It is entirely coincidental that the Y chromosome, during mitosis, has two very short branches which can look merged under the microscope and appear as the descender of a Y-shape.\n\nIt was first suggested that the X chromosome was involved in sex determination by Clarence Erwin McClung in 1901. After comparing his work on locusts with Henking's and others, McClung noted that only half the sperm received an X chromosome. He called this chromosome an \"accessory chromosome\", and insisted (correctly) that it was a \"proper\" chromosome, and theorized (incorrectly) that it was the male-determining chromosome.\n\nLuke Hutchison noticed that a number of possible ancestors on the X chromosome inheritance line at a given ancestral generation follows the Fibonacci sequence. A male individual has an X chromosome, which he received from his mother, and a Y chromosome, which he received from his father. The male counts as the \"origin\" of his own X chromosome (formula_1), and at his parents' generation, his X chromosome came from a single parent (formula_2). The male's mother received one X chromosome from her mother (the son's maternal grandmother), and one from her father (the son's maternal grandfather), so two grandparents contributed to the male descendant's X chromosome (formula_3). The maternal grandfather received his X chromosome from his mother, and the maternal grandmother received X chromosomes from both of her parents, so three great-grandparents contributed to the male descendant's X chromosome (formula_4). Five great-great-grandparents contributed to the male descendant's X chromosome (formula_5), etc. (Note that this assumes that all ancestors of a given descendant are independent, but if any genealogy is traced far enough back in time, ancestors begin to appear on multiple lines of the genealogy, until eventually, a population founder appears on all lines of the genealogy.)\n\nThe X chromosome in humans spans more than 153 million base pairs (the building material of DNA). It represents about 800 protein-coding genes compared to the Y chromosome containing about 70 genes, out of 20,000–25,000 total genes in the human genome.\nEach person usually has one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell. Females have two X chromosomes, whereas males have one X and one Y chromosome. Both males and females retain one of their mother's X chromosomes, and females retain their second X chromosome from their father. Since the father retains his X chromosome from his mother, a human female has one X chromosome from her paternal grandmother (father's side), and one X chromosome from her mother. This inheritance pattern follows the Fibonacci numbers at a given ancestral depth.\n\nGenetic disorders that are due to mutations in genes on the X chromosome are described as X linked.\n\nThe X chromosome carries hundreds of genes but few, if any, of these have anything to do directly with sex determination. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in nearly all somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). This phenomenon is called X-inactivation or Lyonization, and creates a Barr body. If X-inactivation in the somatic cell meant a complete de-functionalizing of one of the X-chromosomes, it would ensure that females, like males, had only one functional copy of the X chromosome in each somatic cell. This was previously assumed to be the case. However, recent research suggests that the Barr body may be more biologically active than was previously supposed.\n\nThe following are some of the gene count estimates of human X chromosome. Because researchers use different approaches to genome annotation their predictions of the number of genes on each chromosome varies (for technical details, see gene prediction). Among various projects, the collaborative consensus coding sequence project (CCDS) takes an extremely conservative strategy. So CCDS's gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein-coding genes.\n\nThe following is a partial list of genes on human chromosome X. For complete list, see the link in the infobox on the right.\n\nIt is theorized by Ross et al. 2005 and Ohno 1967 that the X chromosome is at least partially derived from the autosomal (non-sex-related) genome of other mammals, evidenced from interspecies genomic sequence alignments.\n\nThe X chromosome is notably larger and has a more active euchromatin region than its Y chromosome counterpart. Further comparison of the X and Y reveal regions of homology between the two. However, the corresponding region in the Y appears far shorter and lacks regions that are conserved in the X throughout primate species, implying a genetic degeneration for Y in that region. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are more likely to have an X chromosome-related disease.\n\nIt is estimated that about 10% of the genes encoded by the X chromosome are associated with a family of \"CT\" genes, so named because they encode for markers found in both tumor cells (in cancer patients) as well as in the human testis (in healthy patients).\n\nKlinefelter syndrome:\n\nTriple X syndrome (also called 47,XXX or trisomy X):\n\nTurner syndrome:\n\nSex linkage was first discovered in insects, e.g., T. H. Morgan's 1910 discovery of the pattern of inheritance of the white eyes mutation in Drosophila melanogaster. Such discoveries helped to explain x-linked disorders in humans, e.g., haemophilia A and B, adrenoleukodystrophy, and red-green color blindness.\n\nXX male syndrome is a rare disorder, where the SRY region of the Y chromosome has recombined to be located on one of the X chromosomes. As a result, the XX combination after fertilization has the same effect as a XY combination, resulting in a male. However, the other genes of the X chromosome cause feminization as well.\n\nX-linked endothelial corneal dystrophy is an extremely rare disease of cornea associated with Xq25 region. Lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy is associated with Xp22.3.\n\nMegalocornea 1 is associated with Xq21.3-q22\n\nAdrenoleukodystrophy, a rare and fatal disorder that is carried by the mother on the x-cell. It affects only boys between the ages of 5 and 10 and destroys the protective cell surrounding the nerves, myelin, in the brain. The female carrier hardly shows any symptoms because females have a copy of the x-cell. This disorder causes a once healthy boy to lose all abilities to walk, talk, see, hear, and even swallow. Within 2 years after diagnosis, most boys with Adrenoleukodystrophy die.\n\nThe X-chromosome has played a crucial role in the development of sexually selected characteristics for over 300 million years. During that time it has accumulated a disproportionate number of genes concerned with mental functions. For reasons that are not yet understood, there is an excess proportion of genes on the X-chromosome that are associated with the development of intelligence, with no obvious links to other significant biological functions. . In other words, a significant proportion of genes associated with intelligence is passed on to the male offspring from the maternal side and to the female offspring from either/both maternal and paternal side.There has also been interest in the possibility that haploinsufficiency for one or more X-linked genes has a specific impact on development of the Amygdala and its connections with cortical centres involved in social–cognition processing or the ‘social brain'.\n\n\n"}
