{"id": "31582696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31582696", "title": "Ahmet Güneştekin", "text": "Ahmet Güneştekin\n\nAhmet Güneştekin (born December 22, 1966) is a Kurdish visual artist, whose works span painting, conceptual art and constructions sculpture. For Ahmet Güneştekin, a self-taught artist, art is a passion which has driven him since his childhood. He left the town of Batman for Istanbul in 1991, but had to wait several years before he found his own style at the beginning of the 2000s. He then abandoned the figurative to launch himself into a “narrative abstraction”. This kind of production is loaded with the recollection of a vernacular art, the memory of motifs such as carpets, lamps, Ottoman copperware in which geometry is the leading force.\n\nGüneştekin uses a unique technique with an individual method and precision. After establishing a complex web of black acrylic paint, he fills each of the small spaces with a layer of oil paint, ranging from the light to the dark. Then, using a sort of pen with a rubber tip, he engraves into the paint, and writes as a calligrapher would on a book. He writes on his paintings by removing material, a principle which has more in common with sculpture than painting.\n\nAfter the agreement he signed with the London-based Marlborough Gallery – one of the world’s top five reputable galleries – in 2013, Ahmet Güneştekin made room for himself in the international art market. Marlborough’s first move was to open an exhibition in the same timeframe as the 55th Venice Biennial. When Massimiliano Gioni, listed Güneştekin’s ‟Momentum of Memory” exhibition among the ‟Top 10 exhibitions to see,” the media couldn’t remain indifferent. Güneştekin’s works appeared in high circulation Italian dailies such as Il Manifesto, La Repubblica, La Stampa. Naturally, his works drew the attention of the art circle. \nIn November 2013, Marlborough Gallery opened its doors in New York to Güneştekin. After making a flamboyant introduction for Güneştekin with a solo exhibition, “Ahmet Güneştekin: Recent Paintings” between 26 November and 4 January 2014, Marlborough Gallery prepared an intensive program for 2014. The exhibitions that began in January with Arco Madrid was followed by the New York Armory Show, Art Breda, and Art Basel Hong Kong. Afterward Marlborough Monaco Gallery opened a solo exhibition by Ahmet Güneştekin from 18 September to 14 November. His works are on display at the Marlborough Galleries in Barcelona, Madrid, Monaco and New York at their permanent exhibition halls all the year round.\n\nGüneştekin’s works can be briefly described as the interpretation of the oral narratives, legends and mythology from Anatolian, Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations using free technique. He creates optical and vibrant works, with the solar disc as one of his occurring motifs. The figurative way of expression is present in all his oeuvres, even though in an abstract stylized way. In all his contemporaneous works, the characters, symbols and scenes are taken out of ancient times, and these characters are symbolic, woven in symbolic tales about the essential questions of mankind.\n\nAhmet Güneştekin realizes his works by adopting diverse methods. Gradient optics, dimensional canvases, flat canvases, sun explosions and installations expose his main approach that is to stay out of conventional practices applied on canvas. His art works are composed of charming colours, intricately combined layers, and the tales of the ancient times. The Kurdish artist thinks that mythology is the source of all beginnings. Yedizim, as of a dualist religion, has first emerged in the ancient Mesopotamia, rests on the belief that people make distinctions between the good and the evil. The narratives of the culture and its peculiar imitations spontaneously offer precise choices.\n\nHowever, Güneştekin aims not only to convey messages, also he tries to reveal his own mythology and truths, by expressing himself painting and narrating the diversity of the culture. The characters of the myths he draw are also the ancient characters of the Greek mythology. For Güneştekin, there actually appears no difference between Shahmeran, one of the ancient mythological creatures of Mesopotamia and Medusa in Greek mythology. The effect of embroidery can be best observed in artist’s recent paintings. The drawings and the circles are combined in one geometric structure, and the uses of the colours radically effect the eye. They also provide a narrative, for the symbols and emotions put forward all these elements in the paintings. The refined and meticulously cultivated colour palettes and drawings which they have comprised in harmony are the base of Güneştekin’s works.\n\nMesopotamia, where the artist was born, and Anatolia, the mythological creatures such as Phoenix or the Peacock Angel, form Güneştekin’s most important source of inspiration. The glowing sun marks his peculiar signature. His method of oil painting is a model that reveals itself in adopting embroiderer’s patient work that is to knit and adorn, and to make a drawing model out of it. The diverse uses of the light, the thickness of the lines and the colours, and their density pave the way to gross geometric forms. His oil paintings are the outcome of a hard and dense work process, and give the impression that they are magnified by sculpturing. His colossal works and his paintings resemble the historical art works that are consist of archaeological fragments and figures. However, the most enchanting form he adopts is the glitter of his genuine light globes.\n\nFor Ahmet Güneştekin's gallery visit the site: www.ahmetgunestekin.com\n\n2014\n\n\n2013\n\n\n2012\n2010 – 2011\n2009\n2007- 2008\n2005- 2006\n2003 – 2004\n\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2011 – 2012\n\n\nStéphanie Pioda, \"The Heir to the Solar Disk\", Marlborough Gallery Inc., Monaco, September, 2014.\n\nBertjan ter Braak, \"Faces of the Sun\", Mark Peet Visser Gallery, Den Bosch, The Netherlands, April, 2014.\n\nDonald Kuspit, \"The Uses of Mysticism: Ahmet Güneştekin’s Abstractions\", Marlborough Gallery, New York, November, 2013.\n\nBeral Madra, \"Momentum of Memory\", GSM Publications, Istanbul, May 2013.\n\nJohannes Odenthal, \"Abstraction and Mythos, Anatolia’s Cultural Memory within Contemporary Art: About Ahmet Güneştekin’s Artworks\", GSM Publications, Istanbul, September, 2012.\n\nYalçın Sadak, \"Following the Traces of Sun: A Myth Ahmet Güneştekin\", GSM Publications, Istanbul, November, 2010.\n\nKaya Özsezgin, \"Authentic Archaism in Ahmet Güneştekin’s Paintings\", GSM Publications, Istanbul, November, 2009.\n\nGülseli İnal, \"Antique Modern\", GSM Publications, Istanbul, March, 2007.\n\nAhmet Güneştekin traced and compiled ancient myths, oral narratives and legends of Anatolia and Mesopotamia as of 1997. He took excursions to the villages and towns of Anatolia and Mesopotamia and conducted in-depth researches since 2003. He set up art exhibitions in the historical sights and public spaces together with many artists from contemporary art, sculpture and photography. The series of the exhibition titled \"Following the Traces of the Sun with the Masters\" brought about his first major exhibition, \"The Colors after Darkness\".\n\nGüneştekin became the art director of the news show Haberci, produced and directed by Coşkun Aral in 2005. Afterwards he produces his own documentary series titled \"Following the Traces of the Sun\" for TRT 1 and the series came to be the first documentary films to focus on art in Turkey.\n\nIn his excursions to Anatolia and Mesopotamia, Ahmet Güneştekin provided painting classes to the children so that they can learn how to express themselves in visual arts. In classes, Güneştekin taught children about art concepts and techniques by exposing them to many different kinds of art materials. Güneştekin met over 5,000 children and introduced them the world of painting.\n\n"}
{"id": "32585342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32585342", "title": "Analytical quality control", "text": "Analytical quality control\n\nAnalytical quality control, commonly shortened to AQC refers to all those processes and procedures designed to ensure that the results of laboratory analysis are consistent, comparable, accurate and within specified limits of precision. Constituents submitted to the analytical laboratory must be accurately described to avoid faulty interpretations, approximations, or incorrect results. The qualitative and quantitative data generated from the laboratory can then be used for decision making. In the chemical sense, quantitative analysis refers to the measurement of the amount or concentration of an element or chemical compound in a matrix that differs from the element or compound. Fields such as industry, medicine, and law enforcement can make use of AQC.\n\nAQC processes are of particular importance in laboratories analysing environmental samples where the concentration of chemical species present may be extremely low and close to the detection limit of the analytical method. In well managed laboratories, AQC processes are built into the routine operations of the laboratory often by the random introduction of known standards into the sample stream or by the use of spiked samples.\n\nQuality control begins with sample collection and ends with the reporting of data. AQC is achieved through laboratory control of analytical performance. Initial control of the complete system can be achieved through specification of laboratory services, instrumentation, glassware, reagents, solvents, and gases. However, evaluation of daily performance must be documented to ensure continual production of valid data. A check should first be done to ensure that the data should be seen is precise and accurate. Next, systematic daily checks such as analysing blanks, calibration standards, quality control check samples, and references must be performed to establish the reproducibility of the data. The checks help certify that the methodology is measuring what is in the sample.\n\nThe quality of individual AQC efforts can be variable depending on the training, professional pride, and importance of a particular project to a particular analyst. The burden of an individual analyst originating AQC efforts can be lessened through the implementation of quality assurance programs. Through the implementation of established and routine quality assurance programs, two primary functions are fulfilled: the determination of quality, and the control of quality. By monitoring the accuracy and precision of results, the quality assurance program should increase confidence in the reliability of the reported analytical results, thereby achieving adequate AQC.\n\nValidation of analytical procedures is imperative in demonstrating that a drug substance is suitable for a particular purpose. Common validation characteristics include: accuracy, precision (repeatability and intermediate precision), specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, linearity, range, and robustness. In cases such as changes in synthesis of the drug substance, changes in composition of the finished product, and changes in the analytical procedure, revalidation is necessary to ensure quality control.\n\nAll analytical procedures should be validated. Identification tests are conducted to ensure the identity of an analyte in a sample through comparison of the sample to a reference standard through methods such as spectrum, chromatographic behavior, and chemical reactivity. Impurity testing can either be a quantitative test or a limit test. Both tests should accurately measure the purity of the sample. Quantitative tests of either the active moiety or other components of a sample can be conducted through assay procedures. Other analytical procedures such as dissolution testing or particle size determination may also need to be validated and are equally important.\n\nBecause of the complex inter-relationship between analytical method, sample concentration, limits of detection and method precision, the management of Analytical Quality Control is undertaken using a statistical approach to determine whether the results obtained lie within an acceptable statistical envelope.\n\nIn circumstances where more than one laboratory is analysing samples and feeding data into a large programme of work such as the Harmonised monitoring scheme in the UK, AQC can also be applied to validate one laboratory against another. In such cases the work may be referred to as inter-laboratory calibration.\n"}

However, Cassirer claimed that man's outstanding characteristic is not in his metaphysical or physical nature, but rather in his work. Humanity cannot be known directly, but has to be known through the analysis of the symbolic universe that man has created historically. Thus man should be defined as \"animal symbolicum\" (a symbol-making or symbolizing animal). \nOn this basis, Cassirer sought to understand human nature by exploring symbolic forms in all aspects of a human being's experience. His work is represented in his three-volume \"Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen\" (1923–9, translated as \"The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms\") and is summarized in his \"An Essay on Man\". W. J. T. Mitchell used this term in his essay on \"representation\" to say that\n\"man, for many philosophers both ancient and modern, is the \"representational animal,\" \"homo symbolicum\" , the creature whose distinctive character is the creation and manipulation of signs - things that stand for or take the place of something else.\" \n"}

{"id": "43582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43582", "title": "Begging the question", "text": "Begging the question\n\nBegging the question is a logical fallacy that occurs when an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it. It is a type of circular reasoning and an informal fallacy: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.\n\nThe phrase \"begging the question\" originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the Latin \",\" which actually translates to \"assuming the initial point\". In modern vernacular usage, \"begging the question\" is frequently used to mean \"raising the question\" or \"dodging the question\". In contexts that demand strict adherence to a technical definition of the term, many consider these usages incorrect.\n\nBoth these arguments are logically valid in that, assuming the initial premise is correct, the conclusion logically follows. But they are nonetheless unpersuasive because assuming the initial premise to be correct also means assuming the conclusion is correct.\n\nThe original phrase used by Aristotle from which \"begging the question\" descends is: τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς (or sometimes ἐν ἀρχῇ) αἰτεῖν, \"asking for the initial thing.\" Aristotle's intended meaning is closely tied to the type of dialectical argument he discusses in his \"Topics\", book VIII: a formalized debate in which the defending party asserts a thesis that the attacking party must attempt to refute by asking yes-or-no questions and deducing some inconsistency between the responses and the original thesis.\n\nIn this stylized form of debate, the proposition that the answerer undertakes to defend is called \"the initial thing\" (τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς, τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ) and one of the rules of the debate is that the questioner cannot simply ask for it (that would be trivial and uninteresting). Aristotle discusses this in \"Sophistical Refutations\" and in \"Prior Analytics\" book II, (64b, 34–65a 9, for circular reasoning see 57b, 18–59b, 1).\n\nThe stylized dialectical exchanges Aristotle discusses in the \"Topics\" included rules for scoring the debate, and one important issue was precisely the matter of \"asking for the initial thing\"—which included not just making the actual thesis adopted by the answerer into a question, but also making a question out of a sentence that was too close to that thesis (for example, \"PA\" II 16).\n\nThe term was translated into English from Latin in the 16th century. The Latin version, ', \"asking for the starting point\", can be interpreted in different ways. ' (from '), in the post-classical context in which the phrase arose, means \"assuming\" or \"postulating\", but in the older classical sense means \"petition\", \"request\" or \"beseeching\". ', genitive of ', means \"beginning\", \"basis\" or \"premise\" (of an argument). Literally ' means \"assuming the premise\" or \"assuming the original point\".\n\nThe Latin phrase comes from the Greek (\"\", \"asking the original point\") in Aristotle's \"Prior Analytics\" II xvi 64b28–65a26:\n\nAristotle's distinction between apodictic science and other forms of non-demonstrative knowledge rests on an epistemology and metaphysics wherein appropriate first principles become apparent to the trained dialectician:\nThomas Fowler believed that ' would be more properly called ', which is literally \"begging the question\".\n\nTo \"beg the question\" is to put forward an argument whose validity requires that its own conclusion is true.\n\nAlso called \"\", the fallacy is an attempt to support a claim with a premise that itself presupposes the claim. It is an attempt to prove a proposition while simultaneously taking the proposition for granted.\n\nGiven the single variable C (claim), \"begging the question\" is an attempt to assert that . In two variables, and , it attempts to pass as the valid claim . This is a form of circular reasoning, and may involve any number of variables.\n\nWhen the fallacy involves only a single variable, it is sometimes called a \"hysteron proteron\", as in the statement:\n\n\nThis form of the fallacy may not be immediately obvious. Linguistic variations in syntax, sentence structure and literary device may conceal it, as may other factors involved in an argument's delivery. It may take the form of an unstated premise which is essential but not identical to the conclusion, or is \"controversial or questionable for the same reasons that typically might lead someone to question the conclusion\":\n\nFor example, one can obscure the fallacy by first making a statement in concrete terms, then attempting to pass off an identical statement, delivered in abstract terms, as evidence for the original. One could also \"bring forth a proposition expressed in words of Saxon origin, and give as a reason for it the very same proposition stated in words of Norman origin\", as here:\n\n\nWhen the fallacy of begging the question is committed in more than one step, some authors dub it \"\" (\"reasoning in a circle\") or, more commonly, \"circular reasoning\".\n\nBegging the question is not considered a formal fallacy (an argument that is defective because it uses an incorrect deductive step). Rather, it is a type of informal fallacy that is logically valid but unpersuasive, in that it fails to prove anything other than what is already assumed.\n\nClosely connected with begging the question is the fallacy of circular reasoning (\"\"), a fallacy in which the reasoner begins with the conclusion. The individual components of a circular argument can be logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true, and does not lack relevance. However, circular reasoning is not persuasive because a listener who doubts the conclusion also doubts the premise that leads to it.\n\nBegging the question is similar to the \"complex question\" (also known as \"trick question\" or \"fallacy of many questions\"): a question that, to be valid, requires the truth of another question that has not been established. For example, \"Which color dress is Mary wearing?\" may be fallacious because it presupposes that Mary is wearing a dress. Unless it has previously been established that her outfit is a dress, the question is fallacious because she could be wearing a pantsuit.\n\nAnother related fallacy is \"ignoratio elenchi\" or \"irrelevant conclusion\": an argument that fails to address the issue in question, but appears to do so. An example might be a situation where A and B are debating whether the law permits A to do something. If A attempts to support his position with an argument that the law \"ought\" to allow him to do the thing in question, then he is guilty of '.\n\nMany modern English speakers use \"beg the question\" to mean \"bear the question\", \"suggest the question,\" \"raise the question\", \"invite the question\", \"evade the question\", or even \"ignore the question\", and follow that phrase with the question, for example: \"I weigh 120 kg and have severely clogged arteries, which begs the question: why have I not started exercising?\" For grammatical reasons and because the term has a specific, different meaning in philosophy, logic, and law, some commenters note that such usage is mistaken, or at best, unclear even as sources such as the Meriam Webster Dictionary and non-prescriptivist critics acknowledge the usage of the phrase as a synonym for “raises the question” as popularly accepted.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14655547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14655547", "title": "Cassandra (metaphor)", "text": "Cassandra (metaphor)\n\nThe Cassandra metaphor (variously labelled the Cassandra \"syndrome\", \"complex\", \"phenomenon\", \"predicament\", \"dilemma\", or \"curse\") occurs when valid warnings or concerns are dismissed or disbelieved.\n\nThe term originates in Greek mythology. Cassandra was a daughter of Priam, the King of Troy. Struck by her beauty, Apollo provided her with the gift of prophecy, but when Cassandra refused Apollo's romantic advances, he placed a curse ensuring that nobody would believe her warnings. Cassandra was left with the knowledge of future events, but could neither alter these events nor convince others of the validity of her predictions.\n\nThe metaphor has been applied in a variety of contexts such as psychology, environmentalism, politics, science, cinema, the corporate world, and in philosophy, and has been in circulation since at least 1949 when French philosopher Gaston Bachelard coined the term 'Cassandra Complex' to refer to a belief that things could be known in advance.\n\nThe Cassandra metaphor is applied by some psychologists to individuals who experience physical and emotional suffering as a result of distressing personal perceptions, and who are disbelieved when they attempt to share the cause of their suffering with others.\n\nIn 1963, psychologist Melanie Klein provided an interpretation of Cassandra as representing the human moral conscience whose main task is to issue warnings. Cassandra as moral conscience, \"predicts ill to come and warns that punishment will follow and grief arise\". Cassandra's need to point out moral infringements and subsequent social consequences is driven by what Klein calls \"the destructive influences of the cruel super-ego\", which is represented in the Greek myth by the god Apollo, Cassandra's overlord and persecutor. Klein's use of the metaphor centers on the moral nature of certain predictions, which tends to evoke in others \"a refusal to believe what at the same time they know to be true, and expresses the universal tendency toward denial, [with] denial being a potent defence against persecutory anxiety and guilt\".\n\nIn a 1988 study, Jungian analyst Laurie Layton Schapira, explored what she called the \"Cassandra Complex\" in the lives of two of her analysands.\nBased on clinical experience, she delineates three factors which constitute the Cassandra complex: \n\nLayton Schapira views the Cassandra complex as resulting from a dysfunctional relationship with what she calls the \"Apollo archetype\", an archetype which refers to any individual's or culture's pattern that is dedicated to, yet bound by, order, reason, intellect, truth and clarity that disavows itself of anything occult or irrational. The intellectual specialization of this archetype creates emotional distance and can predispose relationships to a lack of emotional reciprocity and consequent dysfunctions. She further states that a \"Cassandra woman\" is very prone to hysteria because she \"feels attacked not only from the outside world but also from within, especially from the body in the form of somatic, often gynaecological, complaints.\"\n\nAddressing the metaphorical application of the Greek Cassandra myth, Layton Schapira states that:\n\nIn 1989, Jean Shinoda Bolen, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California, published an essay on the god Apollo in which she detailed a psychological profile of the \"Cassandra woman\" whom she suggested referred to someone suffering—as happened in the mythological relationship between Cassandra and Apollo—a dysfunctional relationship with an \"Apollo man\". Bolen added that the Cassandra woman may exhibit \"hysterical\" overtones, and may be disbelieved when attempting to share what she knows.\n\nAccording to Bolen, the archetypes of Cassandra and Apollo are not gender-specific. She states that \"women often find that a particular [male] god exists in them as well, just as I found that when I spoke about goddesses men could identify a part of themselves with a specific goddess. Gods and goddesses represent different qualities in the human psyche. The pantheon of Greek deities together, male and female, exist as archetypes in us all ... There are gods and goddesses in every person.\"\n\n\"As an archetype, Apollo personifies the aspect of the personality that wants clear definitions, is drawn to master a skill, values order and harmony, and prefers to look at the surface rather than at what underlies appearances. The Apollo archetype favors thinking over feeling, distance over closeness, objective assessment over subjective intuition.\"\n\nOf what she describes as the negative Apollonic influence, Dr. Bolen writes:\n\nBolen suggests that a Cassandra woman (or man) may become increasingly hysterical and irrational when in a dysfunctional relationship with a negative Apollo, and may experience others' disbelief when describing her experiences.\n\nForeseeing potential future directions for a corporation or company is sometimes called \"visioning\". Yet achieving a clear, shared vision in an organization is often difficult due to a lack of commitment to the new vision by some individuals in the organization, because it does not match reality as they see it. Those who support the new vision are termed \"Cassandras\"—able to see what is going to happen, but not believed. Sometimes the name Cassandra is applied to those who can predict rises, falls, and particularly crashes on the global stock market, as happened with Warren Buffett, who repeatedly warned that the 1990s stock market surge was a bubble, attracting to him the title of \"Wall Street Cassandra\". Andy Grove, in his book \"Only The Paranoid Survive\", reminds the reader of the Helpful Cassandras that sense the winds of change before others and are critical to managing through Strategic Inflection Points.\n\nMany environmentalists have predicted looming environmental catastrophes including climate change, rise in sea levels, irreversible pollution, and an impending collapse of ecosystems, including those of rainforests and ocean reefs. Even though much of this has since come to pass, individuals sometimes acquire the label of 'Cassandras', whose warnings of impending environmental disaster are disbelieved or mocked. Environmentalist Alan Atkisson wrote in 1999 that to understand that humanity is on a collision course with the laws of nature is to be stuck in what he calls the 'Cassandra dilemma' in which one can see the most likely outcome of current trends and can warn people about what is happening, but the vast majority cannot, or will not respond, and later if catastrophe occurs, they may even blame you, as if your prediction set the disaster in motion. Occasionally there may be a \"successful\" alert, though the succession of books, campaigns, organizations, and personalities that we think of as the environmental movement has more generally fallen toward the opposite side of this dilemma: a failure to \"get through\" to the people and avert disaster. In the words of Atkisson: \"too often we watch helplessly, as Cassandra did, while the soldiers emerge from the Trojan horse just as foreseen and wreak their predicted havoc. Worse, Cassandra's dilemma has seemed to grow more inescapable even as the chorus of Cassandras has grown larger.\"\n\nThere are examples of the Cassandra metaphor being applied in the contexts of medical science, the media, to feminist perspectives on reality, and in politics. There are also examples of the metaphor being used in popular music lyrics, such as the 1982 ABBA song \"Cassandra\", Emmy the Great's \"Cassandra\", and Star One's \"Cassandra Complex\". The five-part The Mars Volta song \"Cassandra Gemini\" may reference this syndrome, as well as the film \"12 Monkeys\" or in Dead and Divine's \"Cassandra Syndrome\". The Ohio band Curse of Cassandra is named after the metaphor.\n\nThere are also distinct parallels to Old Testament prophets such as Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Amos - prophets who called attention to the failure of those who thought of themselves as God's people to forsake meaningless sacrifices and devote themselves to caring for \"orphans and widows in their distress.\" The prophets called their societies to thereby honor God and avoid social / political disasters. Their \"prophecies\" were not well-received; Jeremiah, for example, being thrown into a deep well as well as put in wooden stocks.\n\n\n"}

In some cases the champion has the right to refuse a challenge; in others, this results in forfeiting the title. The challenge system derives from duelling and its code of honour. While many competitive sports use some form of tournament to determine champions, a challenge match is the normal way of deciding professional boxing titles and the World Chess Championship. Some racket sports clubs have a reigning champion who may be challenged by any other club member; a ladder tournament extends the challenge concept to all players, not just the reigning champion. At élite-level competition, there is usually some governing body which authorises and regulates challenges, such as FIDE in chess. In some cases there is a challengers' tournament, the winner of which gains the right to play the challenge round against the reigning champion; in tennis this was the case at Wimbledon until 1922 and in the Davis Cup until 1972. The FA Cup's official name remains the \"Football Association Challenge Cup\", although not since its second season in 1873 has the reigning champion receive a bye to the final. The America's Cup is contested according to the terms of its 1887 deed of gift between yachts representing the champion yacht club and a challenging club. Since 1970, the usual practice, by mutual consent, is for an initial formal \"challenger of record\" replaced by the actual challenger after a qualifying tournament. However, in 1988 and 2010 there were court cases arising from non-consensual challenges.\n\nWhen the champion dies or otherwise vacates the title, a tournament among leading contenders may be used to crown a new champion prior to the resumption of challenges.\n\n"}

Internet security software provides initial protection by setting up a firewall, as well as scanning computers for malware, viruses, Trojan horses, worms and spyware. However information at most risk includes personal details such as birthdates, phone numbers, bank account and schooling details, sexuality, religious affiliations, email addresses and passwords. This information is often openly revealed in social networking sites leaving Internet users vulnerable to social engineering and possibly Internet crime. Mobile devices, especially those with Wi-Fi, allow this information to be shared inadvertently.\n\nDigital self-defense requires Internet users to take an active part in guarding their own personal information. Four key strategies are frequently suggested to assist that protection.\n\nComputer security in this context is referring to Internet security software. The ongoing security of private information requires frequent updating of virus and spyware definitions so that ongoing developments in malicious software cannot interfere with, or copy, private information.\n\nThe practice of utilising more than one email account to separate personal and business usage from recreational usage is a strategy commonly used to manage personal privacy. The free and ready availability of email accounts from sites such as Yahoo, Google or Hotmail allows the protection of personal identity through the use of different names to identify each email account. These throw-away accounts can be discarded or replaced at will, providing another level of protection.\n\nA username is required to set up email accounts and to open accounts for various official, commercial, recreational and social networking sites. In many cases, an email address may also be utilised as a username. Usernames that correlate with personal information such as names or nicknames are more at risk than ones that are cryptic or anonymous, particularly on social and recreational sites.\n\nA password is a mandatory security measure that accompanies usernames. The use of personal data to construct passwords i.e. family members’ names, pet’s names or birth dates increases the risk to confidential information and are easier to crack than long complicated passwords so password strength is a key strategy for protecting personal information. A password can be weak or strong:a weak password is \"cutekittens\", a strong password is \"?lACpAs56IKMs\".\n\nAccording to Microsoft an ideal password should be at least 14 characters in length and have letters, punctuation, symbols, and numbers, where complexity is added by the inclusion of uppercase letters.\n\nSocial networking sites offer greater security risks to personal electronic information because sensitive, private or confidential information such as personal identifiers are routinely used to create public profiles.

{"id": "9545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9545", "title": "Empirical research", "text": "Empirical research\n\nEmpirical research is research using empirical evidence. It is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience. Empiricism values such research more than other kinds. Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data). Research design varies by field and by the question being investigated. Many researchers combine qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis to better answer questions which cannot be studied in laboratory settings, particularly in the social sciences and in education.\n\nIn some fields, quantitative research may begin with a research question (e.g., \"Does listening to vocal music during the learning of a word list have an effect on later memory for these words?\") which is tested through experimentation. Usually, a researcher has a certain theory regarding the topic under investigation. Based on this theory, statements or hypotheses will be proposed (e.g., \"Listening to vocal voice has a negative effect on learning a word list.\"). From these hypotheses, predictions about specific events are derived (e.g., \"People who study a word list while listening to vocal music will remember fewer words on a later memory test than people who study a word list in silence.\"). These predictions can then be tested with a suitable experiment. Depending on the outcomes of the experiment, the theory on which the hypotheses and predictions were based will be supported or not, or may need to be modified and then subjected to further testing.\n\nThe term empirical was originally used to refer to certain ancient Greek practitioners of medicine who rejected adherence to the dogmatic doctrines of the day, preferring instead to rely on the observation of phenomena as perceived in experience. Later empiricism referred to a theory of knowledge in philosophy which adheres to the principle that knowledge arises from experience and evidence gathered specifically using the senses. In scientific use, the term empirical refers to the gathering of data using only evidence that is observable by the senses or in some cases using calibrated scientific instruments. What early philosophers described as empiricist and empirical research have in common is the dependence on observable data to formulate and test theories and come to conclusions.\n\nThe researcher attempts to describe accurately the interaction between the instrument (or the human senses) and the entity being observed. If instrumentation is involved, the researcher is expected to calibrate his/her instrument by applying it to known standard objects and documenting the results before applying it to unknown objects. In other words, it describes the research that has not taken place before and their results.\n\nIn practice, the accumulation of evidence for or against any particular theory involves planned research designs for the collection of empirical data, and academic rigor plays a large part of judging the merits of research design. Several typologies for such designs have been suggested, one of the most popular of which comes from Campbell and Stanley. They are responsible for popularizing the widely cited distinction among pre-experimental, experimental, and quasi-experimental designs and are staunch advocates of the central role of randomized experiments in educational research.\n\nAccurate analysis of data using standardized statistical methods in scientific studies is critical to determining the validity of empirical research. Statistical formulas such as regression, uncertainty coefficient, t-test, chi square, and various types of ANOVA (analyses of variance) are fundamental to forming logical, valid conclusions. If empirical data reach significance under the appropriate statistical formula, the research hypothesis is supported. If not, the null hypothesis is supported (or, more accurately, not rejected), meaning no effect of the independent variable(s) was observed on the dependent variable(s).\n\nThe outcome of empirical research using statistical hypothesis testing is never \"proof\". It can only \"support\" a hypothesis, \"reject\" it, or do neither. These methods yield only probabilities.\n\nAmong scientific researchers, empirical \"evidence\" (as distinct from empirical \"research\") refers to objective evidence that appears the same regardless of the observer. For example, a thermometer will not display different temperatures for each individual who observes it. Temperature, as measured by an accurate, well calibrated thermometer, is empirical evidence. By contrast, non-empirical evidence is subjective, depending on the observer. Following the previous example, observer A might truthfully report that a room is warm, while observer B might truthfully report that the same room is cool, though both observe the same reading on the thermometer. The use of empirical evidence negates this effect of personal (i.e., subjective) experience or time.\n\nThe varying perception of empiricism and rationalism shows concern with the limit to which there is dependency on experience of sense as an effort of gaining knowledge. According to rationalism, there are a number of different ways in which sense experience is gained independently for the knowledge and concepts. According to empiricism, sense experience is considered as the main source of every piece of knowledge and the concepts. In reference with a specific piece of knowledge, this paper will focus on differentiating between rationalism and empiricism or rational views and empirical views. \nIn general, rationalists are known for the development of their own views following two different way. First, the key argument can be placed that there are cases in which the content of knowledge or concepts end up outstripping the information. This outstripped information is provided by the sense experience (Hjørland, 2010, 2). Second, there is construction of accounts as to how reasoning helps in the provision of addition knowledge about a specific or broader scope. Empiricists are known to be presenting complementary senses related to thought. First there is development of accounts of how there is provision of information by experience that is cited by rationalists. This is insofar for having it in the initial place. At times, empiricists tend to be opting skepticism as an option of rationalism. If experience is not helpful in the provision of knowledge or concept cited by rationalists, then they do not exist (Pearce, 2010, 35). Second, empiricists hold the tendency of attacking the accounts of rationalists while considering reasoning to be an important source of knowledge or concepts. The overall disagreement between empiricists and rationalists show primary concerns in how there is gaining of knowledge with respect to the sources of knowledge and concept. In some of the cases, disagreement at the point of gaining knowledge results in the provision of conflicting responses to other aspects as well. There might be a disagreement in the overall feature of warrant, while limiting the knowledge and thought. Empiricists are known for sharing the view that there is no existence of innate knowledge and rather that is derivation of knowledge out of experience. These experiences are either reasoned using the mind or sensed through the five senses human possess (Bernard, 2011, 5). On the other hand, rationalists are known to be sharing the view that there is existence of innate knowledge and this is different for the objects of innate knowledge being chosen. In order to follow rationalism, there must be adoption of one of the three claims related to the theory that are Deduction or Intuition, Innate Knowledge, and Innate Concept. The more there is removal of concept from mental operations and experience, there can be performance over experience with increased plausibility in being innate. Further ahead, empiricism in context with a specific subject provides a rejection of corresponding version related to innate knowledge and deduction or intuition (Weiskopf, 2008, 16). Insofar as there is acknowledgement of concepts and knowledge within the area of subject, the knowledge has major dependence on experience through human senses.\n\nA.D. de Groot's empirical cycle:\n\n\n"}

Many authors do not admit the existence of such a semigroup. For them a semigroup is by definition a \"non-empty\" set together with an associative binary operation. However not all authors insist on the underlying set of a semigroup being non-empty. One can logically define a semigroup in which the underlying set \"S\" is empty. The binary operation in the semigroup is the empty function from to \"S\". This operation vacuously satisfies the closure and associativity axioms of a semigroup. Not excluding the empty semigroup simplifies certain results on semigroups.

Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and \"p\"-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Évariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two operations defined on that set: an addition operation written as , and a multiplication operation written as , both of which behave similarly as they behave for rational numbers and real numbers, including the existence of an additive inverse for all elements \"a\", and of a multiplicative inverse \"b\" for every nonzero element \"b\". This allows us to consider also the so-called \"inverse\" operations of subtraction , and division , via defining:\n\nFormally, a field is a set together with two operations called \"addition\" and \"multiplication\". An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to \"every\" pair of its elements. The result of the addition of and is called the \"sum\" of and and denoted . Similarly, the result of the multiplication of and is called the \"product\" of and , and denoted or . These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as \"field axioms\". In these axioms, and are arbitrary elements of the field .\n\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called \"addition\" and \"multiplication\"; it is an abelian group under the addition, with 0 as additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under the multiplication, with 1 as multiplicative identity; the multiplication is distributive over the addition.\n\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and their required properties. Division by zero is, by definition, excluded. In order to avoid existential quantifiers, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses, respectively), and two nullary operations (the constants and ). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in constructive mathematics and computing. One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation, (the multiplicative inverse} and two constants 1 and –1, since and .\n\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers that can be written as fractions\n, where and are integers, and . The additive inverse of such a fraction is , and the multiplicative inverse (provided that ) is , which can be seen as follows:\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:\n\nThe real numbers , with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The complex numbers consist of expressions\nwhere is the imaginary unit, i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying .\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for . For example, the distributive law enforces\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the plane, with Cartesian coordinates given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is –less intuitively– combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with compass and straightedge. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle. These problems can be settled using the field of constructible numbers. Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only compass and straightedge. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of square roots of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within . Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments , , and a semicircle over (center at the midpoint ), which intersects the perpendicular line through \"B\" in a point , at a distance of exactly formula_3 from when has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that formula_4 is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a cube with volume 2, another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called , , , and . The notation is chosen such that plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\nThis field is called a finite field with four elements, and is denoted or . The subset consisting of and (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the \"binary field\" or . In the context of computer science and Boolean algebra, and are often denoted respectively by \"false\" and \"true\", the addition is then denoted XOR (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted AND. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with bits.\n\nIn this section, denotes an arbitrary field and and are arbitrary elements of .\n\nOne has and . In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows .\n\nIf then or must be 0. Indeed, if \"a\" ≠ 0, then \n. This means that every field is an integral domain.\n\nThe axioms of a field imply that it is an abelian group under addition. This group is called the additive group of the field, and is sometimes denoted by when denoting it simply as could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the \"nonzero\" elements of form an abelian group under multiplication, called the multiplicative group, and denoted by or just } or . \n\nA field may thus be defined as set equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that is an abelian group under addition, } is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is distributive over addition. Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of groups. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses and are uniquely determined by .\n\nThe requirement follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0. Thus, the trivial ring, consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic (see ).\n\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of \"F\", it is possible to define the product of an arbitrary element of by a positive integer to be the -fold sum\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\nthen is said to have characteristic 0. For example, has characteristic 0 since no positive integer is zero. Otherwise, if there \"is\" a positive integer satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a prime number. It is usually denoted by and the field is said to have characteristic then.\nFor example, the field has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) .\n\nIf has characteristic , then for all in . This implies that \nsince all other binomial coefficients appearing in the binomial formula are divisible by . Here, ( factors) is the -th power, i.e., the -fold product of the element . Therefore, the Frobenius map\nis compatible with the addition in (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism. The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\nA \"subfield\" of a field is a subset of that is a field with respect to the field operations of . Equivalently is a subset of that contains , and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that , that for all both and are in , and that for all in , both and are in .\n\nField homomorphisms are maps between two fields such that , , and , where and are arbitrary elements of . All field homomorphisms are injective. If is also surjective, it is called an isomorphism (or the fields and are called isomorphic).\n\nA field is called a prime field if it has no proper (i.e., strictly smaller) subfields. Any field contains a prime field. If the characteristic of is (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to .\n\n\"Finite fields\" (also called \"Galois fields\") are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example is a field with four elements. Its subfield is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements 1 ≠ 0.\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using modular arithmetic. For a fixed positive integer , arithmetic \"modulo \" means to work with the numbers\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set of integers, dividing by and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if is a prime number. For example, taking the prime results in the above-mentioned field . For and more generally, for any composite number (i.e., any number which can be expressed as a product of two strictly smaller natural numbers), is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since in , which, as was explained above, prevents from being a field. The field with elements ( being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by .\n\nEvery finite field has elements, where is prime and . This statement holds since may be viewed as a vector space over its prime field. The dimension of this vector space is necessarily finite, say , which implies the asserted statement.\n\nA field with elements can be constructed as the splitting field of the polynomial \nSuch a splitting field is an extension of in which the polynomial has zeros. This means has as many zeros as possible since the degree of is . For , it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of satisfy the equation , so they are zeros of . By contrast, in , has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic. It is thus customary to speak of \"the\" finite field with elements, denoted by or .\n\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who observed that permuting the zeros of a cubic polynomial in the expression\n(with being a third root of unity) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of Scipione del Ferro and François Viète, which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown to an quadratic equation for . Together with a similar observation for equations of degree 4, Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups. Vandermonde, also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, Carl Friedrich Gauss, in his \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" (1801), studied the equation\nfor a prime and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic Galois group. Gauss deduced that a regular -gon can be constructed if . Building on Lagrange's work, Paolo Ruffini claimed (1799) that quintic equations (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by Niels Henrik Abel in 1824. Évariste Galois, in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as Galois theory today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an algebraic number field, but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 Richard Dedekind introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the German word \"Körper\", which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by .\n\nIn 1881 Leopold Kronecker defined what he called a \"domain of rationality\", which is a field of rational fractions in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as abstractly as the rational function field . Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since Joseph Liouville's work in 1844, until Charles Hermite (1873) and Ferdinand von Lindemann (1882) proved the transcendence of and , respectively.\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to . In particular, Heinrich Martin Weber's notion included the field F. Giuseppe Veronese (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led to introduce the field of \"p\"-adic numbers. synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections Galois theory, Constructing fields and Elementary notions can be found in Steinitz's work. linked the notion of orderings in a field, and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties. Emil Artin redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the primitive element theorem.\n\nA commutative ring is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses . For example, the integers form a commutative ring, but not a field: the reciprocal of an integer is not itself an integer, unless .\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings in which every nonzero element is a unit (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct ideals, and . Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which is the only prime ideal.\n\nGiven a commutative ring , there are two ways to construct a field related to , i.e., two ways of modifying such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of is , the rationals, while the residue fields of are the finite fields .\n\nGiven an integral domain , its field of fractions is built with the fractions of two elements of exactly as Q is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of are the fractions where and are in , and . Two fractions and are equal if and only if . The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.\n\nThe field of the rational fractions over a field (or an integral domain) is the field of fractions of the polynomial ring . The field of Laurent series\nover a field is the field of fractions of the ring of formal power series (in which ). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\nIn addition the field of fractions, which embeds injectively into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring by means of a surjective map onto a field . Any field obtained in this way is a quotient , where is a maximal ideal of . If has only one maximal ideal , this field is called the residue field of .\n\nThe ideal generated by a single polynomial in the polynomial ring (over a field \"E\") is maximal if and only if is irreducible in , i.e., if can not be expressed as the product of two polynomials in of smaller degree. This yields a field\nThis field contains an element (namely the residue class of ) which satisfies the equation\nFor example, is obtained from by adjoining the imaginary unit symbol i, which satisfies , where . Moreover, is irreducible over , which implies that the map that sends a polynomial to yields an isomorphism\n\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field , and a field containing as a subfield. For any element of , there is a smallest subfield of containing and , called the subfield of \"F\" generated by and denoted . The passage from to is referred to by \"adjoining an element\" to \"E\". More generally, for a subset , there is a minimal subfield of containing and , denoted by .\n\nThe compositum of two subfields and of some field is the smallest subfield of containing both and The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of , which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over .\n\nThe notion of a subfield can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to being a \"field extension\" (or just extension) of , denoted by\nand read \" over \".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its degree , i.e., the dimension of as an -vector space. It satisfies the formula\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions and are of degree 2, whereas is an infinite extension.\n\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions are algebraic elements. An element is \"algebraic\" over if it is a root of a polynomial with coefficients in , that is, if it satisfies a polynomial equation\nwith in , and . \nFor example, the imaginary unit in is algebraic over , and even over , since it satisfies the equation\nA field extension in which every element of is algebraic over is called an algebraic extension. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.\n\nThe subfield generated by an element , as above, is an algebraic extension of if and only if is an algebraic element. That is to say, if is algebraic, all other elements of are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension , i.e., the dimension of as an -vector space, equals the minimal degree such that there is a polynomial equation involving , as above. If this degree is , then the elements of have the form \n\nFor example, the field of Gaussian rationals is the subfield of consisting of all numbers of the form where both and are rational numbers: summands of the form (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since can be simplified to .\n\nThe above-mentioned field of rational fractions , where is an indeterminate, is not an algebraic extension of since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in whose zero is . Elements, such as , which are not algebraic are called transcendental. Informally speaking, the indeterminate and its powers do not interact with elements of . A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension discussed above is a key example: if is not algebraic (i.e., is not a root of a polynomial with coefficients in ), then is isomorphic to . This isomorphism is obtained by substituting to in rational fractions.\n\nA subset of a field is a transcendence basis if it is algebraically independent (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over and if is an algebraic extension of . Any field extension has a transcendence basis. Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form (purely transcendental extensions) and algebraic extensions.\n\nA field is algebraically closed if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any polynomial equation\nhas a solution . By the fundamental theorem of algebra, is algebraically closed, i.e., \"any\" polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are \"not\" algebraically closed since the equation\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing is called an \"algebraic closure\" of if it is algebraic over (roughly speaking, not too big compared to ) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, is an algebraic closure of . The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field is quite special: by the Artin-Schreier theorem, the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and is elementarily equivalent to . Such fields are also known as real closed fields.\n\nAny field has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as \"the\" algebraic closure and denoted . For example, the algebraic closure of is called the field of algebraic numbers. The field is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the ultrafilter lemma, a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the axiom of choice. In this regard, the algebraic closure of , is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing (the ones of order ). For any algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field of Laurent series is the field of Puiseux series, obtained by adjoining roots of .\n\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\nA field \"F\" is called an \"ordered field\" if any two elements can be compared, so that and whenever and . For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering ≥. The Artin-Schreier theorem states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a formally real field, which means that any quadratic equation\nonly has the solution . The set of all possible orders on a fixed field \"F\" is isomorphic to the set of ring homomorphisms from the Witt ring W(\"F\") of quadratic forms over \"F\", to Z.\n\nAn Archimedean field is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements. Equivalently, the field contains no infinitesimals (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of .\nAn ordered field is Dedekind-complete if all upper bounds, lower bounds (see Dedekind cut) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each bounded subset of is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean, since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence , every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism. Several foundational results in calculus follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe hyperreals form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of non-standard analysis.\n\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a topological field, in which the set \"F\" is a topological space, such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps and ) are continuous maps with respect to the topology of the space.\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a metric, i.e., a function\nthat measures a \"distance\" between any two elements of .\n\nThe completion of is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field are filled, if there are any. For example, any irrational number , such as , is a \"gap\" in the rationals in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers , in the sense that distance of and given by the absolute value is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero sequence, i.e., a sequence whose limit (for ) is zero.\n\nThe field is used in number theory and -adic analysis. The algebraic closure carries a unique norm extending the one on , but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is called the field of complex p-adic numbers and is denoted by .\n\nThe following topological fields are called \"local fields\":\n\nThese two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements and (referred to as uniformizer) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in . (However, since the addition in is done using carrying, which is not the case in , these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n\nDifferential fields are fields equipped with a derivation, i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field. For example, the field R(\"X\"), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to differential Galois theory, a variant of Galois theory dealing with linear differential equations.\n\nGalois theory studies algebraic extensions of a field by studying the symmetry in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are finite Galois extensions , which are, by definition, those that are separable and normal. The primitive element theorem shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily simple, i.e., of the form\nwhere is an irreducible polynomial (as above). For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of are contained in and that has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the Galois group is the group of field automorphisms of that are trivial on (i.e., the bijections that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which constructs an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the set of subgroups of and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension . By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not solvable (can not be built from abelian groups), then the zeros of can \"not\" be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving formula_11. For example, the symmetric groups is not solvable for . Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the Abel–Ruffini theorem:\n\nThe tensor product of fields is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension of degree is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of -algebras\nThis fact is the beginning of Grothendieck's Galois theory, a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.\n\nBasic invariants of a field include the characteristic and the transcendence degree of over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields and are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree. This implies that any two uncountable algebraically closed fields of the same cardinality and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, and are isomorphic (but \"not\" isomorphic as topological fields).\n\nIn model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, two fields and are called elementarily equivalent if every mathematical statement that is true for is also true for and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be first-order sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\nThe Lefschetz principle states that is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement holds in if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.\n\nIf is an ultrafilter on a set , and is a field for every in , the ultraproduct of the with respect to is a field. It is denoted by\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields : Łoś's theorem states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many , also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence , this shows that there is an isomorphism\nThe Ax–Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes )\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as real closed fields or exponential fields (which are equipped with an exponential function ).\n\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the absolute Galois group is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs \"all\" finite separable extensions of . By elementary means, the group can be shown to be the Prüfer group, the profinite completion of . This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of are the fields for , and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of -adic number fields (finite extensions of ).\n\nRepresentations of Galois groups and of related groups such as the Weil group are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the Langlands program. The cohomological study of such representations is done using Galois cohomology. For example, the Brauer group, which is classically defined as the group of central simple -algebras, can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n\nMilnor K-theory is defined as\nThe norm residue isomorphism theorem, proved around 2000 by Vladimir Voevodsky, relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\nAlgebraic K-theory is related to the group of invertible matrices with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the determinant of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K(\"F\") = \"F\". Matsumoto's theorem shows that K(\"F\") agrees with K(\"F\"). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\nIf , then the equation \nhas a unique solution in , namely . This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any vector space has a basis. Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in linear algebra both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\nModules (the analogue of vector spaces) over most rings, including the ring of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring is a vector space over a field in its own right. Such rings are called -algebras and are studied in depth in the area of commutative algebra. For example, Noether normalization asserts that any finitely generated -algebra is closely related to (more precisely, finitely generated as a module over) a polynomial ring .\n\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\nin a (large) finite field can be performed much more efficiently than the discrete logarithm, which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution to an equation\nIn elliptic curve cryptography, the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an elliptic curve, i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n\nFinite fields are also used in coding theory and combinatorics.\n\nFunctions on a suitable topological space into a field can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\nThis makes these functions a -commutative algebra.\n\nFor having a \"field\" of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are integral domains. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When is a complex manifold . In this case, one considers the algebra of holomorphic functions, i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of meromorphic functions on .\n\nThe function field of an algebraic variety (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of regular functions, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the -dimensional space over a field is , i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in indeterminates. The function field of is the same as the one of any open dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under isomorphism and birational equivalence of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of abstract algebraic varieties and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the dimension, which equals the transcendence degree of , is invariant under birational equivalence. For curves (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field is very close to : if is smooth and proper (the analogue of being compact), can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions. In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about . The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as birational geometry. The minimal model program attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\nGlobal fields are in the limelight in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.\nThey are, by definition, number fields (finite extensions of ) or function fields over (finite extensions of ). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This function field analogy can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the Riemann hypothesis concerning the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the Weil conjectures (proven in 1974 by Pierre Deligne).\nCyclotomic fields are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form , where is a primitive -th root of unity, i.e., a complex number satisfying and for all . For being a regular prime, Kummer used cyclotomic fields to prove Fermat's last theorem, which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. Ostrowski's theorem asserts that the only completions of , a global field, are the local fields and . Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the local-global principle. For example, the Hasse–Minkowski theorem reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in and , whose solutions can easily be described.\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. Inverse Galois theory studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group for some number field . Class field theory describes the abelian extensions, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the Kronecker–Weber theorem, describes the maximal abelian extension of : it is the field\nobtained by adjoining all primitive -th roots of unity. Kronecker's Jugendtraum asks for a similarly explicit description of of general number fields . For imaginary quadratic fields, formula_16, , the theory of complex multiplication describes using elliptic curves. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 ≠ 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of field with one element, which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields , as tends to 1. In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as quasifields, near-fields and semifields.\n\nThere are also proper classes with field structure, which are sometimes called Fields, with a capital F. The surreal numbers form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The nimbers, a concept from game theory form a Field.\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a \"division ring\" or \"skew field\". The only division rings that are finite-dimensional -vector spaces are itself, (which is a field), the quaternions (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the octonions (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of algebraic topology in 1958 by Michel Kervaire, Raoul Bott, and John Milnor. The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical. It can be deduced from the hairy ball theorem illustrated at the right.\n\n"}
{"id": "1559922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1559922", "title": "Flight dynamics (spacecraft)", "text": "Flight dynamics (spacecraft)\n\nSpacecraft flight dynamics is the science of space vehicle performance, stability, and control. It requires analysis of the six degrees of freedom of the vehicle's flight, which are similar to those of aircraft: translation in three dimensional axes; and its orientation about the vehicle's center of mass in these axes, known as \"pitch\", \"roll\" and \"yaw\", with respect to a defined frame of reference.\n\nDynamics is the modeling of the changing position and orientation of a vehicle, in response to external forces acting on the body. For a spacecraft, these forces are of three types: propulsive force (usually provided by the vehicle's engine thrust); gravitational force exerted by the Earth or other celestial bodies; and aerodynamic lift and drag (when flying in the atmosphere of the Earth or other body, such as Mars or Venus). The vehicle's attitude must be taken into account because of its effect on the aerodynamic and propulsive forces. There are other reasons, unrelated to flight dynamics, for controlling the vehicle's attitude in non-powered flight (e.g., thermal control, solar power generation, communications, or astronomical observation).\n\nThe principles of flight dynamics are normally used to control a spacecraft by means of an inertial navigation system in conjunction with an attitude control system. Together, they create a subsystem of the spacecraft bus often called ADCS.\n\nA spacecraft's flight is determined by application of Newton's second law of motion:\n\nwhere F is the vector sum of all forces exerted on the vehicle, m is its current mass, and a is the acceleration vector, the instantaneous rate of change of velocity (v), which in turn is the instantaneous rate of change of displacement. Solving for a, acceleration equals the force sum divided by mass. Acceleration is integrated over time to get velocity, and velocity is in turn integrated to get position.\n\nFor powered atmospheric flight, the three main forces which act on a vehicle are propulsive force, aerodynamic force, and gravitation. Other external forces such as centrifugal force and Coriolis force, are generally insignificant due to the relatively short time of powered flight, and may generally neglected in simplified performance calculations.\n\nAerodynamic forces, present near a body with significant atmosphere such as Earth, Mars or Venus, are analyzed as: lift, defined as the force component perpendicular to the direction of flight (not necessarily upward to balance gravity, as for an airplane); and drag, the component parallel to, and in the opposite direction of flight. Lift and drag are modeled as the products of a coefficient times dynamic pressure acting on a reference area:\n\nwhere:\n\nFlight calculations are made quite precisely for space missions, taking into account such factors as the Earth's oblateness and non-uniform mass distribution; gravitational forces of all nearby bodies, including the Moon, Sun, and other planets; and three-dimensional flight path. For preliminary performance analysis, some simplifying assumptions can be made: the planet is spherical and uniform; the vehicle can be simulated as a point mass; flight path assumes a two-body patched conic approximation; and the local flight path lies in a single plane) with reasonably small loss of accuracy.\n\nThe general case of a launch from Earth must take engine thrust, aerodynamic forces, and gravity into account. The acceleration equation can be reduced from vector to scalar form by resolving it into its tangential (speed formula_4) and angular (flight path angle formula_5 relative to local vertical) time rate-of-change components relative to the launch pad. The two equations thus become:\n\nwhere:\n\nMass decreases as propellant is consumed and rocket stages, engines or tanks are shed (if applicable).\n\nNumerical integration of the two rate equations from time zero (when both \"v\" and \"θ\" are 0) gives planet-fixed values of v and θ at any time in the flight:\n\nFinite element analysis can be used to integrate the equations, by breaking the flight into small time increments.\n\nFor most launch vehicles, relatively small levels of lift are generated, and a gravity turn is employed, depending mostly on the third term of the angle rate equation. At the moment of liftoff, when angle and velocity are both zero, the theta-dot equation is mathematically indeterminate and cannot be evaluated until velocity becomes non-zero shortly after liftoff. But notice at this condition, the only force which can cause the vehicle to pitch over is the engine thrust acting at a non-zero angle of attack (first term) and perhaps a slight amount of lift (second term), until a non-zero pitch angle is attained. In the gravity turn, pitch-over is initiated by applying an increasing angle of attack (by means of gimbaled engine thrust), followed by a gradual decrease in angle of attack through the remainder of the flight.\n\nOnce velocity and flight path angle are known, altitude formula_11 and downrange distance formula_12 are computed as:\n\nThe planet-fixed values of \"v\" and \"θ\" are converted to space-fixed (inertial) values with the following conversions:\n\nwhere \"ω\" is the planet's rotational rate in radians per second, \"φ\" is the launch site latitude, and \"A\" is the launch azimuth angle.\n\nFinal \"v\", \"θ\" and \"r\" must match the requirements of the target orbit as determined by orbital mechanics (see Orbital flight, below), where final \"v\" is usually the required periapsis (or circular) velocity, and final \"θ\" is 90 degrees. A powered descent analysis would use the same procedure, with reverse boundary conditions.\n\nAttitude control is the exercise of control over the orientation of an object with respect to an inertial frame of reference or another entity (the celestial sphere, certain fields, nearby objects, etc.). The attitude of a craft can be described using three mutually perpendicular axes of rotation, generally referred to as roll, pitch, and yaw angles respectively (with the roll axis in line with the primary engine direction of thrust). Orientation can be determined by calibration using an external guidance system, such as determining the angles to a reference star or the Sun, then internally monitored using an inertial system of mechanical or optical gyroscopes. Orientation is a vector quantity described by three angles for the instantaneous direction, and the instantaneous rates of roll in all three axes of rotation. The aspect of control implies both awareness of the instantaneous orientation and rates of roll and the ability to change the roll rates to assume a new orientation using either a reaction control system or other means.\nNewton's second law, applied to rotational rather than linear motion, becomes:\n\nwhere τ is the net torque (or \"moment\") exerted on the vehicle, I is its moment of inertia about the axis of rotation, and α is the angular acceleration vector in radians per second per second. Therefore, the rotational rate in degrees per second per second is\n\nand the angular rotation rate ω (degrees per second) is obtained by integrating α over time, and the angular rotation θ is the time integral of the rate, analogous to linear motion. The three principal moments of inertia I, I, and I about the roll, pitch and yaw axes, are determined through the spacecraft's center of mass.\n\nAttitude control torque, absent aerodynamic forces, is frequently applied by a reaction control system, a set of thrusters located about the vehicle. The thrusters are fired, either manually or under automatic guidance control, in short bursts to achieve the desired rate of rotation, and then fired in the opposite direction to halt rotation at the desired position. The torque about a specific axis is:\n\nwhere r is its distance from the center of mass, and F is the thrust of an individual thruster (only the component of F perpendicular to r is included.)\n\nFor situations where propellant consumption may be a problem (such as long-duration satellites or space stations), alternative means may be used to provide the control torque, such as reaction wheels or control moment gyroscopes.\n\nOrbital mechanics are used to calculate flight in orbit about a central body. For sufficiently high orbits (generally at least in the case of Earth), aerodynamic force may be assumed to be negligible for relatively short term missions (though a small amount of drag may be present which results in decay of orbital energy over longer periods of time.) When the central body's mass is much larger than the spacecraft, and other bodies are sufficiently far away, the solution of orbital trajectories can be treated as a two-body problem.\n\nThis can be shown to result in the trajectory being ideally a conic section (circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola) with the central body located at one focus. Orbital trajectories are either circles or ellipses; the parabolic trajectory represents first escape of the vehicle from the central body's gravitational field. Hyperbolic trajectories are escape trajectories with excess velocity, and will be covered under Interplanetary flight below.\n\nElliptical orbits are characterized by three elements. The semi-major axis \"a\" is the average of the radius at apoapsis and periapsis:\n\nThe eccentricity \"e\" can then be calculated for an ellipse, knowing the apses:\n\nThe time period for a complete orbit is dependent only on the semi-major axis, and is independent of eccentricity:\n\nwhere formula_24 is the standard gravitational parameter of the central body.\nThe orientation of the orbit in space is specified by three angles:\n\nThe orbital plane is ideally constant, but is usually subject to small perturbations caused by planetary oblateness and the presence of other bodies.\n\nThe spacecraft's position in orbit is specified by the \"true anomaly,\" formula_25, an angle measured from the periapsis, or for a circular orbit, from the ascending node or reference direction. The \"semi-latus rectum\", or radius at 90 degrees from periapsis, is:\n\nThe radius at any position in flight is:\n\nand the velocity at that position is:\n\nFor a circular orbit, \"r\" = \"r\" = \"a\", and eccentricity is 0. Circular velocity at a given radius is:\n\nFor an elliptical orbit, \"e\" is greater than 0 but less than 1. The periapsis velocity is:\n\nand the apoapsis velocity is:\n\nThe limiting condition is a parabolic escape orbit, when \"e\" = 1 and \"r\" becomes infinite. Escape velocity at periapsis is then\n\nThe \"specific angular momentum\" of any conic orbit, \"h\", is constant, and is equal to the product of radius and velocity at periapsis. At any other point in the orbit, it is equal to:\n\nwhere \"φ\" is the flight path angle measured from the local horizontal (perpendicular to \"r\".) This allows the calculation of \"φ\" at any point in the orbit, knowing radius and velocity:\n\nNote that flight path angle is a constant 0 degrees (90 degrees from local vertical) for a circular orbit.\n\nIt can be shown that the angular momentum equation given above also relates the rate of change in true anomaly to \"r\", \"v\", and \"φ\", thus the true anomaly can be found as a function of time since periapsis passage by integration:\n\nConversely, the time required to reach a given anomaly is:\n\nOnce in orbit, a spacecraft may fire rocket engines to make in-plane changes to a different altitude or type of orbit, or to change its orbital plane. These maneuvers require changes in the craft's velocity, and the classical rocket equation is used to calculate the propellant requirements for a given delta-v. A delta-\"v\" budget will add up all the propellant requirements, or determine the total delta-v available from a given amount of propellant, for the mission.\n\nPlane change maneuvers can be performed alone or in conjunction with other orbit adjustments. For a pure rotation plane change maneuver, consisting only of a change in the inclination of the orbit, the specific angular momentum, \"h\", of the initial and final orbits are equal in magnitude but not in direction. Therefore the change in specific angular momentum can be written as:\n\nwhere \"h\" is the specific angular momentum before the plane change, and Δ\"i\" is the desired change in the inclination angle. From this it can be shown that the required delta-\"v\" is:\n\nFrom the definition of \"h\", this can also be written as:\n\nwhere \"v\" is the magnitude of velocity before plane change and \"φ\" is the flight path angle. Using the small-angle approximation, this becomes:\n\nThe total delta-\"v\" for a combined maneuver can be calculated by a vector addition of the pure rotation delta-\"v\" and the delta-\"v\" for the other planned orbital change.\n\nVehicles sent on lunar or planetary missions are generally not launched by direct injection to departure trajectory, but first put into a low Earth parking orbit; this allows the flexibility of a bigger launch window and more time for checking that the vehicle is in proper condition for the flight. A popular misconception is that escape velocity is required for flight to the Moon; it is not. Rather, the vehicle's apogee is raised high enough to take it to a point (before it reaches apogee) where it enters the Moon's gravitational sphere of influence (though the required velocity is close to that of escape.) This is defined as the distance from a satellite at which its gravitational pull on a spacecraft equals that of its central body, which is\n\nwhere \"D\" is the mean distance from the satellite to the central body, and\n\"m\" and \"m\" are the masses of the central body and satellite, respectively. This value is approximately from Earth's Moon.\n\nA significant portion of the vehicle's flight (other than immediate proximity to the Earth or Moon) requires accurate solution as a three-body problem, but may be preliminarily modeled as a patched conic approximation.\n\nThis must be timed so that the Moon will be in position to capture the vehicle, and might be modeled to a first approximation as a Hohmann transfer. However, the rocket burn duration is usually long enough, and occurs during a sufficient change in flight path angle, that this is not very accurate, requiring instead integration of a simplified version of the velocity and angle rate equations given above in Powered flight:\n\nA simple lunar trajectory stays in one plane, resulting in lunar flyby or orbit within a small range of inclination to the Moon's equator. This also permits a \"free return\", in which the spacecraft would return to the appropriate position for reentry into the Earth's atmosphere if it were not injected into lunar orbit. Relatively small velocity changes are usually required to correct for trajectory errors. Such a trajectory was used for the Apollo 8, Apollo 10, Apollo 11, and Apollo 12 manned lunar missions.\n\nGreater flexibility in lunar orbital or landing site coverage (at greater angles of lunar inclination) can be obtained by performing a plane change maneuver mid-flight; however, this takes away the free-return option, as the new plane would take the spacecraft's emergency return trajectory away from the Earth's atmospheric re-entry point, and leave the spacecraft in a high Earth orbit. This type of trajectory was used for the last five Apollo missions (13 through 17).\n\nIn order to completely leave one planet's gravitational field to reach another, a hyperbolic trajectory relative to the departure planet is necessary, with excess velocity added to (or subtracted from) the departure planet's orbital velocity around the Sun. The desired heliocentric transfer orbit to a superior planet will have its perihelion at the departure planet, requiring the hyperbolic excess velocity to be applied in the posigrade direction, when the spacecraft is away from the Sun. To an inferior planet destination, aphelion will be at the departure planet, and the excess velocity is applied in the retrograde direction when the spacecraft is toward the Sun. For accurate mission calculations, the orbital elements of the planets must be obtained from an ephemeris, such as that published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nFor the purpose of preliminary mission analysis and feasibility studies, certain simplified assumptions may be made to enable delta-v calculation with very small error:\n\nSince interplanetary spacecraft spend a large period of time in heliocentric orbit between the planets, which are at relatively large distances away from each other, the patched-conic approximation is much more accurate for interplanetary trajectories than for translunar trajectories. The patch point between the hyperbolic trajectory relative to the departure planet and the heliocentric transfer orbit occurs at the planet's sphere of influence radius relative to the Sun, as defined above in Orbital flight. Given the Sun's mass ratio of 333,432 times that of Earth and distance of , the Earth's sphere of influence radius is (roughly 1,000,000 kilometers).\n\nThe transfer orbit required to carry the spacecraft from the departure planet's orbit to the destination planet is chosen among several options:\n\nThe required hyperbolic excess velocity \"v\" (sometimes called \"characteristic velocity\") is the difference between the transfer orbit's departure speed and the departure planet's heliocentric orbital speed. Once this is determined, the injection velocity relative to the departure planet at periapsis is:\n\nThe excess velocity vector for a hyperbola is displaced from the periapsis tangent by a characteristic angle, therefore the periapsis injection burn must lead the planetary departure point by the same angle:\n\nThe geometric equation for eccentricity of an ellipse cannot be used for a hyperbola. But the eccentricity can be calculated from dynamics formulations as:\n\nwhere h is the specific angular momentum as given above in the Orbital flight section, calculated at the periapsis:\n\nand \"ε\" is the specific energy:\n\nAlso, the equations for r and v given in Orbital flight depend on the semi-major axis, and thus are unusable for an escape trajectory. But setting radius at periapsis equal to the r equation at zero \nanomaly gives an alternate expression for the semi-latus rectum:\n\nwhich gives a more general equation for radius versus anomaly which is usable at any eccentricity:\n\nSubstituting the alternate expression for p also gives an alternate expression for a (which is defined for a hyperbola, but no longer represents the semi-major axis). This gives an equation for velocity versus radius which is likewise usable at any eccentricity:\n\nThe equations for flight path angle and anomaly versus time given in Orbital flight are also usable for hyperbolic trajectories.\n\nThere is a great deal of variation with time of the velocity change required for a mission, because of the constantly varying relative positions of the planets. Therefore, optimum launch windows are often chosen from the results of porkchop plots that show contours of characteristic energy (v) plotted versus departure and arrival time.\n\n\"Atmospheric entry\" is the movement of human-made or natural objects as they enter the atmosphere of a celestial body from outer space—in the case of Earth from an altitude above the Kármán Line, (100 km). This topic is heavily concerned with the process of controlled \"re\"entry of vehicles which are intended to reach the planetary surface intact, but the topic also includes uncontrolled (or minimally controlled) cases, such as the intentionally or circumstantially occurring, destructive deorbiting of satellites and the falling back to the planet of \"space junk\" due to orbital decay.\n\n\n"}

Spee was the first person in his time to present strong written and spoken arguments against torture, especially with regards to its unreliability in obtaining \"truth\" from someone undergoing painful questioning.\n\nHis name is often incorrectly cited as \"Friedrich von Spee\".\n\nSpee was born at Kaiserswerth on the Rhine. On finishing his early education at Cologne, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1610, and pursued extensive studies and activity as a teacher at Trier, Fulda, Würzburg, Speyer, Worms and Mainz, where he was ordained a Catholic priest in 1622. He became professor at the University of Paderborn in 1624. From 1626 he taught at Speyer, Wesel, Trier and Cologne, and preached at Paderborn, Cologne and Hildesheim.\n\nAn attempt to assassinate Spee was made at Peine in 1629. He resumed his activity as professor and priest at Paderborn and later at Cologne, and in 1633 removed to Trier. During the storming of the city by the imperial forces in March 1635 (in the Thirty Years' War), he distinguished himself in the care of the suffering, and died soon afterwards of a plague infection contracted while ministering to wounded soldiers in a hospital.\n\nSpee's literary activity was largely confined to the last years of his life, the details of which are relatively obscure. Two of his works were not published until after his death: \"Goldenes Tugendbuch\" (Golden Book of Virtues), a book of devotion highly prized by Leibniz, and \"Trutznachtigall\" (Rivaling the Nightingale), a collection of fifty to sixty sacred songs, which take a prominent place among religious lyrics of the 17th century and have been repeatedly printed and updated through the present.\n\nHis principal work, the \"Cautio Criminalis\" (Precautions for Prosecutors), is a layout for the prosecution of witchcraft, based on his own experiences in Westphalia. It is thought that he acted for a long time as \"witch confessor\" in Würzburg, as he seemed to have knowledge of what could be considered the private thoughts of the condemned. The book was printed in Latin in 1631 at Rinteln without Spee's name or permission. He did not advocate the immediate abolition of trials for witchcraft, but described with sarcasm the abuses in the prevailing legal proceedings, particularly the use of the rack. He demanded measures of reform, such as a new German imperial law on the subject, and liability to damages on the part of the judges. If these had been carried out, they would have quickly put an end to the mass persecution of suspected witches.\n\nNevertheless, the \"Cautio Criminalis\" did bring about the abolition of witch-burning in a number of places, especially at Mainz, and led the way to its gradual suppression. The moral impact created by the publication was considerable. Even in the 17th century, a number of new editions and translations appeared. Among the members of Spee's Jesuit order, his treatise found a favourable reception. A memorable observation in the book suggested that Germany and England must have more witches and devils than Spain and Italy, since there were so many more stake burnings in the former. This may have been a not so subtle criticism of Protestant reform Europe, which he believed was guilty of even greater abuses than the Catholic countries. His book is still in print.\n\n\"Cautio Criminalis\" contains 52 questions which Spee argued and attempted to answer. Amongst his more notable conclusions were:\n\n\nSpee was particularly concerned about cases where a person was tortured and forced to denounce accomplices, who were then tortured and forced to denounce more accomplices, until everyone was under suspicion:\n\nSpee did not dispute the existence of witches, and opened his work with a declaration that witches are real. However, he was most troubled that innocent people were being tortured and killed alongside real witches, as he strongly believed. He argued (question 13) that the Parable of the Weeds in Matthew 13:24-30 meant that some of the guilty must be allowed freedom, so that the innocent are not condemned either.\n\nSpee wrote the lyrics and tunes of dozens of hymns, and is still the most heavily attributed author in German Catholic hymnals today. Although an anonymous hymnist during his lifetime, today he is credited with several popular works including the Advent song \"O Heiland, reiß die Himmel auf\", the Christmas carols \"Vom Himmel hoch, o Engel, kommt\" and \"\", and the Easter hymn \"Lasst uns erfreuen\" widely used with the 20th-century English texts \"Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones\" and \"All Creatures of Our God and King\".\n\nOther prominent contemporary critics of witch hunts:\n\n"}

The cry originated in the United States.\n\nAt least two different explanations place the origins of the exclamation in Fort Benning, Georgia, where some of the first of the US Army's parachute jumps occurred in the 1940s.\n\nAccording to paratrooper Gerard Devlin, this exclamation dates from August 1940 and is attributed to Private Aubrey Eberhardt, member of parachute test platoon at Fort Benning. The parachute had only recently been adopted for troop drops, and this platoon was the first to test it. On the eve of their first jump, the platoon decided to calm their nerves by spending the day before taking in a film at the Main Post Theatre and a night at the local beer garden. The film they saw was a Western featuring the Native American chief Geronimo. Its title is uncertain, but it was probably the 1939 film \"Geronimo\" with Andy Devine and Lone Ranger star Chief Thundercloud in the title role.\n\nOn the way back to barracks, Eberhardt's comrades taunted him saying that he would be too scared to remember his name. Eberhardt retorted, \"All right, dammit! I tell you jokers what I'm gonna do! To prove to you that I'm not scared out of my wits when I jump, I'm gonna yell \"Geronimo\" loud as hell when I go out that door tomorrow!\" Eberhardt kept his promise, and the cry was gradually adopted by the other members of his platoon.\n\nIn his book \"Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Richard Winters\", Winters offers a different explanation: The 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning was due to go on the first jump. At the time there was a popular song called \"Geronimo\" on the radio, which quickly became a favorite amongst the troops. The cry became known to the commanding officer who insisted they would instead jump out and cry \"Currahee\", the name of a mountain at Camp Toccoa, their first training camp. The paratroopers had run up and down the mountain frequently during training, the run known to the troops as \"3 miles up, 3 miles down\".\n\nThere is also a third explanation. Medicine Bluffs on Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where Geronimo was jailed as prisoner of war and his grave is located, are steep cliffs and have come to be known as Geronimo's Bluff. Tall tales were told about Geronimo while at Fort Sill. It was said that one day Geronimo, with the army in hot pursuit, made a leap on horseback down an almost vertical cliff, a feat that the posse could not duplicate. The legend continues that in the midst of this jump to freedom he gave out the bloodcurdling cry of \"Geronimo-o-o!\"\n\nInitially, the top brass were wary of the cry, claiming that it constituted a lack of discipline. Others said that it showed bravery and should be encouraged. Eventually the latter view won out, and when the Army's parachute infantry grew, the cry grew with it. In 1941, the Army's first parachute regiment, the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR; now called the 501st Infantry Regiment) incorporated the name \"Geronimo\" into its insignia, with the permission of the real Geronimo's family. The cry was also incorporated into the song \"Down From Heaven\" by Lieutenant Colonel Byron Paige.\n\nBy then, the coverage of the paratroopers' exploits during the war had made the cry \"Geronimo\" known to the wider public, and its use spread outside the military and U.S. Army.\n\n"}

It states that if the perianal skin opening is posterior to the transverse anal line, the fistulous tract will open into the anal canal in the midline posteriorly, sometimes taking a curvilinear course. A perianal skin opening anterior to the transverse anal line is usually associated with a radial fistulous tract.\n\nOr in more direct terms, it means that anterior-opening fistulas tend to follow a simple, direct course while posterior-opening fistulas may follow a devious, curving path with some even being horseshoe-shaped before opening in the posterior midline.\n\nFistulas can be described as anterior or posterior relating to a line drawn in the coronal plane across the anus, the so-called transverse anal line. Anterior fistulas will have a direct track into the anal canal. Posterior fistulas will have a curved track with their external opening lying in the posterior midline of the anal canal. An exception to the rule are anterior fistulas lying more than 2.5 cm from the anus, which may have a curved track (similar to posterior fistulas) that opens into the posterior midline of the anal canal.\n\nGoodsall's rule may not be applicable when the fistula is more than 2.5 cm from the anal verge. In such situations, the fistula is almost always indirect. In situations where there are multiple anal fistuale, the course would be similar to that of posterior-opening fistulae because of branching and communication between these openings.\n\nThe investigation of choice for anal fistulas is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fistulograms can be used to demonstrate the track of the fistula.\n\nGoodsall's rule is named after David Henry Goodsall who described it in 1900.\n\n"}
{"id": "47984814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47984814", "title": "Hostile attribution bias", "text": "Hostile attribution bias\n\nHostile attribution bias, or hostile attribution of intent, is the tendency to interpret others' behaviors as having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign. For example, a person with high levels of hostile attribution bias might see two people laughing and immediately interpret this behavior as two people laughing about him/her, even though the behavior was ambiguous and may have been benign.\n\nThe term \"hostile attribution bias\" was first coined in 1980 by Nasby, Hayden, and DePaulo who noticed, along with several other key pioneers in this research area (e.g., Kenneth A. Dodge), that a subgroup of children tend to attribute hostile intent to ambiguous social situations more often than other children. Since then, hostile attribution bias has been conceptualized as a bias of social information processing (similar to other attribution biases), including the way individuals perceive, interpret, and select responses to situations. While occasional hostile attribution bias is normative (particularly for younger children), researchers have found that individuals who exhibit consistent and high levels of hostile attribution bias across development are much more likely to engage in aggressive behavior (e.g., hitting/fighting, reacting violently, verbal or relational aggression) toward others.\n\nIn addition, hostile attribution bias is hypothesized to be one important pathway through which other risk factors, such as peer rejection or harsh parenting behavior, lead to aggression. For example, children exposed to peer teasing at school or child abuse at home are much more likely to develop high levels of hostile attribution bias, which then lead them to behave aggressively at school and/or at home. Thus, in addition to partially explaining one way aggression develops, hostile attribution bias also represents a target for the intervention and prevention of aggressive behaviors.\n\nThe term hostile attribution bias first emerged in 1980 when researchers began noticing that some children, particularly aggressive and/or rejected children, tended to interpret social situations differently compared to other children. For example, Nasby and colleagues presented photographs of people to a group of aggressive adolescent boys (aged 10–16) and observed that a subgroup of these youth exhibited a consistent tendency to attribute hostile intent to the photographs, even when the cues were ambiguous or benign. Similarly, Kenneth A. Dodge and colleagues conducted a study on a sample of school-aged children between 3rd–5th grade and found that children who were rejected were much more likely than other children to exhibit hostile attributions of intent to ambiguous social situations (e.g., when a behavior could have been either accidental or intentional). Furthermore, Dodge and colleagues found that children with high hostile attribution bias then went on to exhibit the most aggressive behaviors later on.\n\nEarly studies investigating links between hostile attribution bias and aggression were somewhat mixed, with some studies reporting no significant effects or small effects and other studies reporting large effects. Since then, over 100 studies and a meta-analysis have documented a robust association between hostile attribution bias and aggressive behavior across various samples ranging in age, gender, race, countries, and clinical populations.\n\nHostile attribution bias is typically conceptualized within a social information processing framework, in which social information (e.g., during an interaction) is processed in a series of steps that leads to a behavioral reaction. Accurate social information processing requires a person to engage in six steps that occur in order.\nHostile attribution bias is theorized to result from deviations in any of these steps, including paying attention to and encoding biased information (e.g., only paying attention to cues suggestive of hostility), biases toward negative interpretations of social interactions (e.g., more likely to interpret situation as hostile), limited ability to generate a broad range of potential responses, and difficulty appropriately evaluating responses and selecting an optimal response. Furthermore, biases in any of the steps affect the rest of the steps. Hostile attribution bias has been particularly linked to step 2 of social information processing (i.e., interpretation of information), but is linked to impairments in other steps as well, including inaccurate perception/encoding of social situations and problems with generating a broad range of potential behavioral responses. For example, a child with high levels of hostile attribution bias may generate fewer potential responses than other children, and these responses may be limited to hostile or ineffective responses to a situation.\n\nDodge theorized that hostile attribution bias arises from an individual's hostile schemas about the world that are formed through an interaction between a child's neural dispositions and his/her early exposures to hostile socialization experiences. These experiences may include disrupted parental attachment, child abuse, exposure to family violence, peer rejection or victimization, and community violence.\n\nIn research settings, hostile attribution bias is typically measured with a laboratory task, in which participants are presented with staged interaction (live actors), video, picture, audio, or written presentations of ambiguous social situations. For example, an ambiguous social situation presented might be a video of a child opening a door, causing the door to knock over a tower of toys that another child was building. After the stimulus is presented, participants would be asked to make attributions about the intent of the actor (i.e., hostile vs. benign). (For example: \"Do you think the girl who opened the door was trying to be mean, nice, or could have been mean or nice?\"). Multiple trials are administered with various ambiguous scenarios, and these attributions are then used by the researchers to determine the level of the child's hostile attribution bias. Careful selection of stimuli and comparison of stimuli across mediums is helpful for accurately assessing an individual's level of hostile attribution bias. A meta-analysis investigating the link between hostile attribution bias and aggressive behavior found that the strongest effect sizes were linked with actual staging of social interactions, followed by audio presentation of stimuli, then video and picture presentation.\n\nSubstantial literature has documented a robust association between hostile attribution bias and aggression in youth. Hostile attribution bias is traditionally associated with overt physical aggression (e.g., hitting, fighting), such that higher levels of hostile attribution bias predict more aggressive behavior. In particular, much evidence suggests that hostile attribution bias is especially linked to \"reactive aggression\" (i.e., impulsive and \"hot-blooded\" aggression that reflects an angry retaliation to perceived provocation) rather than \"proactive aggression\" (i.e., unprovoked, planned/instrumental, or \"cold-blooded\" aggression). Beyond physical aggression, elevated hostile attribution bias is also associated with increased use of relational aggression (e.g., gossip, spreading rumors, social exclusion). This is particularly the case when youth attribute hostile intent to ambiguous relational situations (e.g., not receiving an invitation to a party or not receiving a response to a text).\n\nHostile attribution bias has also been documented in adult populations, and adults with high levels of hostile attribution bias are over 4 times more likely to die by the age of 50 than adults with low levels of hostile attribution bias. Hostile attribution bias is particularly linked to relational problems in adulthood, including marital conflict/violence and marital/relationship dissatisfaction. Finally, parents with high levels of hostile attribution bias are also much more likely to use harsh discipline and aggressive parenting, which may further contribute to the intergenerational continuity in hostile attribution bias and aggression across time.\n\nHostile attribution bias has been tested as a malleable target for intervention for aggressive behaviors in youth, including in cognitive interventions designed to increase accurate identification of others intentions and attribution of benign intentions. Relative success has been documented from these interventions in changing levels of hostile attribution bias, although actual enduring changes in aggressive behavior have been modest.\n\n"}

{"id": "765400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=765400", "title": "Lineage (Buddhism)", "text": "Lineage (Buddhism)\n\nA lineage in Buddhism is a line of transmission of the Buddhist teaching that is \"theoretically traced back to the Buddha himself.\" The acknowledgement of the transmission can be oral, or certified in documents. Several branches of Buddhism, including Chan (including Zen and Seon) and Tibetan Buddhism maintain records of their historical teachers. These records serve as a validation for the living exponents of the tradition.\n\nThe historical authenticity of Buddhist lineage is questionable. Stephen Batchelor has claimed, speaking about specifically Japanese Zen lineage, \"the historicity of this “lineage” simply does not withstand critical scrutiny.\" Erik Storlie has noted that transmission \"is simply false on historical grounds.\" Edward Conze said \"much of the traditions about the early history of Chan are the inventions of a later age.\"\n\nIn the lineage of the vinaya, the requirements for ordination as a bhikkhu (\"monk\") or a bhikkhuni (\"nun\") include the presence of at least five other monks, one of whom must be a fully ordained preceptor, and another an acharya (teacher). This lineage for ordaining bhikshunis became extinct in the Theravada school and in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore, when śrāmaṇerikās like Tenzin Palmo wanted full ordination, she had to travel to Hong Kong.\n\nLineages in the Mahasiddha tradition do not necessarily originate from Gautama Buddha, but are ultimately grounded, like all Buddhist lineages, in the Adi-Buddha.\n\nThe idea of a patriarchal lineage in Chan Buddhism dates back to the epitaph for Fărú (法如 638–689), a disciple of the 5th patriarch, Hóngrĕn (弘忍 601–674). In the \"Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices\" and the \"Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks\", Daoyu and Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.\n\nIn the 6th century biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre the typical Chan-lineage was developed:\nD. T. Suzuki contends that Chan's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had \"no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism\" and that Chan historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.\n\nThe earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma to Huineng. There is no generally accepted 7th Chinese Patriarch.\n\nThe principle teachers of the Chan, Zen and Seon traditions are commonly known in English translations as \"Patriarchs\". However, the more precise terminology would be \"Ancestors\" or \"Founders\" () and \"Ancestral Masters\" or \"Founding Masters\" (), as the commonly used Chinese terms are gender neutral. Various records of different authors are known, which give a variation of transmission lines:\n\nEventually these descriptions of the lineage evolved into a continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha to Bodhidharma. The idea of a line of descent from Gautama is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of Chan.\n\nAccording to the \"Song of Enlightenment\" (證道歌 \"Zhèngdào gē\") by Yǒngjiā Xuánjué (665-713), one of the chief disciples of Huineng, Bodhidharma was the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in a line of descent from Gautama Buddha through his disciple Mahākāśyapa:\nThe \"Denkoroku\" gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission, and 53 overall:\n\nTwenty-four different Zen lineages are recorded to be transmitted to Japan. Only three survived until today. Sōtō was transmitted to Japan by Dōgen, who travelled to China for Chan training in the 13th century. After receiving Dharma transmission in the Caodong school, he returned to Japan and established the lineage there, where it is called the Sōtō.\n\nThe Linji school was also transmitted to Japan several times, where it is the Rinzai school.\n\nIn Jōdo Shinshū, \"Patriarch\" refers to seven Indian, Chinese and Japanese masters before its founder, Shinran.\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama, in the foreword to \"Karmapa: The Sacred Prophecy\" states:Within the context of Tibetan Buddhism, the importance of lineage extends far beyond the ordinary sense of a particular line of inheritance or descent. Lineage is a sacred trust through which the integrity of Buddha's teachings is preserved intact as it is transmitted from one generation to the next. The vital link through which the spiritual tradition is nourished and maintained is the profound connection between an enlightened master and perfectly devoted disciple. The master-disciple relationship is considered extremely sacred by all the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nWallace renders into English a citation of Karma Chagme (, fl. 17th century) that contains an embedded quotation attributed to Nāropā (956-1041):\nGyatrul (b. 1924), in a purport to Karma Chagme, conveys Dilgo Khyentse's 'samaya', diligence and humility in receiving Vajrayana empowerment, lineal Dharma transmission and \"rlung\", as rendered into English by Wallace (Chagmé \"et al.\", 1998: p. 21):\nChöd is an advanced spiritual practice known as \"Cutting Through the Ego.\" This practice, based on the Prajnaparamita sutra, uses specific meditations and tantric ritual.\n\nThere are several hagiographic accounts of how chöd came to Tibet. One \"namtar\" (hagiography) asserts that shortly after Kamalaśīla won his famous debate with Moheyan as to whether Tibet should adopt the \"sudden\" route to enlightenment or his own \"gradual\" route, Kamalaśīla enacted \"phowa\", transferring his mindstream to animate a corpse polluted with contagion in order to safely move the hazard it presented. As the mindstream of Kamalaśīla was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha named Dampa Sangye came across the vacant \"kuten\" or \"physical basis\" of Kamalaśīla. Dampa Sangye was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamalaśīla, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamalaśīla's body. Dampa Sangye's mindstream in Kamalaśīla's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Chöd which contributed to the Mahamudra Chöd of Machig Labdrön. The mindstream of Kamalaśīla was unable to return to his own \"kuten\" and so was forced to enter the vacant body of Dampa Sangye.\n\n\n"}

He or she may be influenced or motivated by the ideology and beliefs of an external group and may act in support of such a group. In its original sense, a \"lone wolf\" is an animal or person that generally lives or spends time alone instead of with a group.\n\nObservers note the attacks are a relatively rare type of terrorist attack but have been increasing in number, and that it is sometimes difficult to tell whether an actor has received outside help and what appears to be a lone wolf attack may actually have been carefully orchestrated from outside.\n\nThe term \"lone wolf\" was popularized by white supremacists Alex Curtis and Tom Metzger in the 1990s. Metzger advocated individual or small-cell underground activity, as opposed to above-ground membership organizations, envisaging \"warriors acting alone or in small groups who attacked the government or other targets in 'daily, anonymous acts.'\"\n\nTerrorism expert Brian Michael Jenkins of the RAND Corporation prefers the term \"stray dog\" to \"lone wolf\". According to Jenkins, most individuals involved in such attacks \"skulk about, sniffing at violence, vocally aggressive but skittish without backup\".\nThough these individuals seem to be acting alone, there are often ties between lone wolves and terrorist organisations for example, terrorist backed online content.\n\nThe term \"lone wolf\" is used by US law enforcement agencies and the media to refer to individuals undertaking violent acts of terrorism outside a command structure. The FBI and San Diego Police's investigation into the activities of a self-professed white supremacist, Alex Curtis, was named Operation Lone Wolf, \"largely due to Curtis' encouragement of other white supremacists to follow what Curtis refers to as 'lone wolf' activism\".\n\nThe term lone wolf is used to distinguish terrorist actions carried out by individuals from those coordinated by large groups. Terrorist attacks that are carried out by small cells are not classified as lone wolf attacks. Lone wolf attacks are far more rare than attacks carried out by groups. Since 1940, there have only been around 100 successful lone wolf attacks in the United States. The number of attacks is increasing, however, and has grown each year since 2000. Lone wolves generally come from different demographics than far right attackers as well. As compared to those on the far right, lone wolf attackers who become inspired by al-Qaeda and ISIS tend to be younger and better educated. According to studies, lone wolves have more in common with mass murderers than they do with members of the organized terrorist groups that often inspire them.\n\nWhile the lone wolf acts to advance the ideological or philosophical beliefs of an extremist group, they act on their own, without any outside command or direction. The lone wolf's tactics and methods are conceived and directed solely on their own; in many cases, such as the tactics described by Curtis, the lone wolf never has personal contact with the group they identify with. As such, it is considerably more difficult for counter-terrorism officials to gather intelligence on lone wolves, since they may not come into contact with routine counter-terrorist surveillance.\n\nA 2013 analysis by Sarah Teich, a research assistant at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, found five emerging trends in Islamist lone wolf terrorism in North America and western Europe between 1990 and 2013:\n\nIn the United States, lone wolves may present a greater threat than organized groups, and terrorists have not been limited to Muslims. According to the \"Christian Science Monitor,\" \"With the exception of the attacks on the World Trade Center, experts say the major terrorist attacks in the United States have been perpetrated by deranged individuals who were sympathetic to a larger cause – from Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to the Washington area sniper John Allen Muhammad,\" both native-born Americans.\n\nAccording to the \"Financial Times\", counter-terrorism officials refer to \"lone individuals known to authorities but not considered important enough to escalate investigations\" as \"known wolves\".\n\nSome groups actively advocate lone wolf actions. Anti-abortion militant terrorist group The Army of God uses \"leaderless resistance\" as its organizing principle. According to \"The New York Times\", in news analysis of the Boston Marathon bombings, the Al-Qaeda activist Samir Khan, publishing in \"Inspire\", advocated individual terrorist actions directed at Americans and published detailed recipes online.\n\nLone wolf terrorists are frequently thought to only be Muslims, however, this is not always the case. Lone wolf terrorists may sympathize with and consider themselves part of larger groups, but they are not truly a part of them. Often, the attacks are attributed to people who have a mixture of political and personal grievances. The attackers can have no actual affiliation to the group that claims them, but instead become radicalized online and through external media outlets.\n\nA large number of terrorists determined by authorities to have been lone wolf attacks inspired by ISIS and/or its ideology, were later found to have been recruited, trained and directed remotely by ISIL to carry out the attacks.\n\nLone wolf terrorists are highly likely to be afflicted by a mental illness. Studies have found that more than 40% of lone wolf terrorists have been diagnosed at some point in their life with a mental illness. This puts lone wolves as being 13.5 times more likely to suffer from a mental illness than a member of an organized terrorist group, such as al-Qaeda or ISIS.\n\nMental health challenges are thought to make some individuals among the many who suffer from certain \"psychological disturbances,\" vulnerable to being inspired by extremist ideologies to commit acts of lone wolf terrorism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18404", "title": "Lorentz transformation", "text": "Lorentz transformation\n\nIn physics, the Lorentz transformations are a one-parameter family of linear transformations from a coordinate frame in space time to another frame that moves at a constant velocity, the parameter, within the former. The transformations are named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz. The respective inverse transformation is then parametrized by the negative of this velocity.\n\nThe most common form of the transformation, parametrized by the real constant formula_1 representing a velocity confined to the -direction, is expressed as \nwhere and are the coordinates of an event in two frames, where the primed frame is seen from the unprimed frame as moving with speed along the -axis, is the speed of light, and formula_3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nExpressing the speed as formula_4 an equivalent form of the transformation is\n\nFrames of reference can be divided into two groups: inertial (relative motion with constant velocity) and non-inertial (accelerating, moving in curved paths, rotational motion with constant angular velocity, etc.). The term \"Lorentz transformations\" only refers to transformations between \"inertial\" frames, usually in the context of special relativity. \n\nIn each reference frame, an observer can use a local coordinate system (most exclusively Cartesian coordinates in this context) to measure lengths, and a clock to measure time intervals. An observer is a real or imaginary entity that can take measurements, say humans, or any other living organism—or even robots and computers. An event is something that happens at a point in space at an instant of time, or more formally a point in spacetime. The transformations connect the space and time coordinates of an event as measured by an observer in each frame.\n\nThey supersede the Galilean transformation of Newtonian physics, which assumes an absolute space and time (see Galilean relativity). The Galilean transformation is a good approximation only at relative speeds much smaller than the speed of light. Lorentz transformations have a number of unintuitive features that do not appear in Galilean transformations. For example, they reflect the fact that observers moving at different velocities may measure different distances, elapsed times, and even different orderings of events, but always such that the speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames. The invariance of light speed is one of the postulates of special relativity.\n\nHistorically, the transformations were the result of attempts by Lorentz and others to explain how the speed of light was observed to be independent of the reference frame, and to understand the symmetries of the laws of electromagnetism. The Lorentz transformation is in accordance with special relativity, but was derived before special relativity.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation. It may include a rotation of space; a rotation-free Lorentz transformation is called a Lorentz boost. In Minkowski space, the mathematical model of spacetime in special relativity, the Lorentz transformations preserve the spacetime interval between any two events. This property is the defining property of a Lorentz transformation. They describe only the transformations in which the spacetime event at the origin is left fixed. They can be considered as a hyperbolic rotation of Minkowski space. The more general set of transformations that also includes translations is known as the Poincaré group.\n\nMany physicists—including Woldemar Voigt, George FitzGerald, Joseph Larmor, and Hendrik Lorentz himself—had been discussing the physics implied by these equations since 1887. Early in 1889, Oliver Heaviside had shown from Maxwell's equations that the electric field surrounding a spherical distribution of charge should cease to have spherical symmetry once the charge is in motion relative to the aether. FitzGerald then conjectured that Heaviside’s distortion result might be applied to a theory of intermolecular forces. Some months later, FitzGerald published the conjecture that bodies in motion are being contracted, in order to explain the baffling outcome of the 1887 aether-wind experiment of Michelson and Morley. In 1892, Lorentz independently presented the same idea in a more detailed manner, which was subsequently called FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis. Their explanation was widely known before 1905.\n\nLorentz (1892–1904) and Larmor (1897–1900), who believed the luminiferous aether hypothesis, also looked for the transformation under which Maxwell's equations are invariant when transformed from the aether to a moving frame. They extended the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis and found out that the time coordinate has to be modified as well (\"local time\"). Henri Poincaré gave a physical interpretation to local time (to first order in \"v\"/\"c\", the relative velocity of the two reference frames normalized to the speed of light) as the consequence of clock synchronization, under the assumption that the speed of light is constant in moving frames. Larmor is credited to have been the first to understand the crucial time dilation property inherent in his equations.\n\nIn 1905, Poincaré was the first to recognize that the transformation has the properties of a mathematical group,\nand named it after Lorentz.\nLater in the same year Albert Einstein published what is now called special relativity, by deriving the Lorentz transformation under the assumptions of the principle of relativity and the constancy of the speed of light in any inertial reference frame, and by abandoning the mechanistic aether as unnecessary.\n\nAn \"event\" is something that happens at a certain point in spacetime, or more generally, the point in spacetime itself. In any inertial frame an event is specified by a time coordinate \"ct\" and a set of Cartesian coordinates to specify position in space in that frame. Subscripts label individual events.\n\nFrom Einstein's second postulate of relativity follows\n\nin all inertial frames for events connected by \"light signals\". The quantity on the left is called the \"spacetime interval\" between events and . The interval between \"any two\" events, not necessarily separated by light signals, is in fact invariant, i.e., independent of the state of relative motion of observers in different inertial frames, as is shown using homogeneity and isotropy of space. The transformation sought after thus must possess the property that\n\nwhere are the spacetime coordinates used to define events in one frame, and are the coordinates in another frame. First one observes that is satisfied if an arbitrary -tuple of numbers are added to events and . Such transformations are called \"spacetime translations\" and are not dealt with further here. Then one observes that a \"linear\" solution preserving the origin of the simpler problem\n\nsolves the general problem too. (A solution satisfying the left formula automatically satisfies the right formula, see polarization identity.) Finding the solution to the simpler problem is just a matter of look-up in the theory of classical groups that preserve bilinear forms of various signature. Equation can be written more compactly as\n\nwhere refers to the bilinear form of signature on exposed by the right hand side formula in . The alternative notation defined on the right is referred to as the \"relativistic dot product\". Spacetime mathematically viewed as endowed with this bilinear form is known as Minkowski space . The Lorentz transformation is thus an element of the group Lorentz group , the Lorentz group or, for those that prefer the other metric signature, (also called the Lorentz group). One has\n\nwhich is precisely preservation of the bilinear form which implies (by linearity of and bilinearity of the form) that is satisfied. The elements of the Lorentz group are rotations and \"boosts\" and mixes thereof. If the spacetime translations are included, then one obtains the \"inhomogeneous Lorentz group\" or the Poincaré group.\n\nThe relations between the primed and unprimed spacetime coordinates are the Lorentz transformations, each coordinate in one frame is a linear function of all the coordinates in the other frame, and the inverse functions are the inverse transformation. Depending on how the frames move relative to each other, and how they are oriented in space relative to each other, other parameters that describe direction, speed, and orientation enter the transformation equations.\n\nTransformations describing relative motion with constant (uniform) velocity and without rotation of the space coordinate axes are called \"boosts\", and the relative velocity between the frames is the parameter of the transformation. The other basic type of Lorentz transformations is rotations in the spatial coordinates only, these are also inertial frames since there is no relative motion, the frames are simply tilted (and not continuously rotating), and in this case quantities defining the rotation are the parameters of the transformation (e.g., axis–angle representation, or Euler angles, etc.). A combination of a rotation and boost is a \"homogeneous transformation\", which transforms the origin back to the origin.\n\nThe full Lorentz group also contains special transformations that are neither rotations nor boosts, but rather reflections in a plane through the origin. Two of these can be singled out; spatial inversion in which the spatial coordinates of all events are reversed in sign and temporal inversion in which the time coordinate for each event gets its sign reversed.\n\nBoosts should not be conflated with mere displacements in spacetime; in this case, the coordinate systems are simply shifted and there is no relative motion. However, these also count as symmetries forced by special relativity since they leave the spacetime interval invariant. A combination of a rotation with a boost, followed by a shift in spacetime, is an \"inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation\", an element of the Poincaré group, which is also called the inhomogeneous Lorentz group.\n\nA \"stationary\" observer in frame defines events with coordinates . Another frame moves with velocity relative to , and an observer in this \"moving\" frame defines events using the coordinates .\n\nThe coordinate axes in each frame are parallel (the and axes are parallel, the and axes are parallel, and the and axes are parallel), remain mutually perpendicular, and relative motion is along the coincident axes. At , the origins of both coordinate systems are the same, . In other words, the times and positions are coincident at this event. If all these hold, then the coordinate systems are said to be in standard configuration, or synchronized.\n\nIf an observer in records an event , then an observer in records the \"same\" event with coordinates\n\nwhere is the relative velocity between frames in the -direction, is the speed of light, and\n\n(lowercase gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\nHere, is the \"parameter\" of the transformation, for a given boost it is a constant number, but can take a continuous range of values. In the setup used here, positive relative velocity is motion along the positive directions of the axes, zero relative velocity is no relative motion, while negative relative velocity is relative motion along the negative directions of the axes. The magnitude of relative velocity cannot equal or exceed , so only subluminal speeds are allowed. The corresponding range of is .\n\nThe transformations are not defined if is outside these limits. At the speed of light () is infinite, and faster than light () is a complex number, each of which make the transformations unphysical. The space and time coordinates are measurable quantities and numerically must be real numbers.\n\nAs an active transformation, an observer in F′ notices the coordinates of the event to be \"boosted\" in the negative directions of the axes, because of the in the transformations. This has the equivalent effect of the \"coordinate system\" F′ boosted in the positive directions of the axes, while the event does not change and is simply represented in another coordinate system, a passive transformation.\n\nThe inverse relations ( in terms of ) can be found by algebraically solving the original set of equations. A more efficient way is to use physical principles. Here is the \"stationary\" frame while is the \"moving\" frame. According to the principle of relativity, there is no privileged frame of reference, so the transformations from to must take exactly the same form as the transformations from to . The only difference is moves with velocity relative to (i.e., the relative velocity has the same magnitude but is oppositely directed). Thus if an observer in notes an event , then an observer in notes the \"same\" event with coordinates\n\nand the value of remains unchanged. This \"trick\" of simply reversing the direction of relative velocity while preserving its magnitude, and exchanging primed and unprimed variables, always applies to finding the inverse transformation of every boost in any direction.\n\nSometimes it is more convenient to use (lowercase beta) instead of , so that\n\nwhich shows much more clearly the symmetry in the transformation. From the allowed ranges of and the definition of , it follows . The use of and is standard throughout the literature.\n\nThe Lorentz transformations can also be derived in a way that resembles circular rotations in 3d space using the hyperbolic functions. For the boost in the direction, the results are\n\nwhere (lowercase zeta) is a parameter called \"rapidity\" (many other symbols are used, including ). Given the strong resemblance to rotations of spatial coordinates in 3d space in the Cartesian xy, yz, and zx planes, a Lorentz boost can be thought of as a hyperbolic rotation of spacetime coordinates in the xt, yt, and zt Cartesian-time planes of 4d Minkowski space. The parameter is the hyperbolic angle of rotation, analogous to the ordinary angle for circular rotations. This transformation can be illustrated with a Minkowski diagram.\n\nThe hyperbolic functions arise from the \"difference\" between the squares of the time and spatial coordinates in the spacetime interval, rather than a sum. The geometric significance of the hyperbolic functions can be visualized by taking or in the transformations. Squaring and subtracting the results, one can derive hyperbolic curves of constant coordinate values but varying , which parametrizes the curves according to the identity\n\nConversely the and axes can be constructed for varying coordinates but constant . The definition\n\nprovides the link between a constant value of rapidity, and the slope of the axis in spacetime. A consequence these two hyperbolic formulae is an identity that matches the Lorentz factor\n\nComparing the Lorentz transformations in terms of the relative velocity and rapidity, or using the above formulae, the connections between , , and are\n\nTaking the inverse hyperbolic tangent gives the rapidity\n\nSince , it follows . From the relation between and , positive rapidity is motion along the positive directions of the axes, zero rapidity is no relative motion, while negative rapidity is relative motion along the negative directions of the axes.\n\nThe inverse transformations are obtained by exchanging primed and unprimed quantities to switch the coordinate frames, and negating rapidity since this is equivalent to negating the relative velocity. Therefore,\n\nThe inverse transformations can be similarly visualized by considering the cases when and .\n\nSo far the Lorentz transformations have been applied to \"one event\". If there are two events, there is a spatial separation and time interval between them. It follows from the linearity of the Lorentz transformations that two values of space and time coordinates can be chosen, the Lorentz transformations can be applied to each, then subtracted to get the Lorentz transformations of the differences;\n\nwith inverse relations\n\nwhere (uppercase delta) indicates a difference of quantities; e.g., for two values of coordinates, and so on.\n\nThese transformations on \"differences\" rather than spatial points or instants of time are useful for a number of reasons:\n\n\nA critical requirement of the Lorentz transformations is the invariance of the speed of light, a fact used in their derivation, and contained in the transformations themselves. If in the equation for a pulse of light along the direction is , then in the Lorentz transformations give , and vice versa, for any .\n\nFor relative speeds much less than the speed of light, the Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformation\n\nin accordance with the correspondence principle. It is sometimes said that nonrelativistic physics is a physics of \"instantaneous action at a distance\".\n\nThree unintuitive, but correct, predictions of the transformations are:\n\nThe use of vectors allows positions and velocities to be expressed in arbitrary directions compactly. A single boost in any direction depends on the full relative velocity vector with a magnitude that cannot equal or exceed , so that .\n\nOnly time and the coordinates parallel to the direction of relative motion change, while those coordinates perpendicular do not. With this in mind, split the spatial position vector as measured in , and as measured in , each into components perpendicular (⊥) and parallel ( ‖ ) to ,\n\nthen the transformations are\n\nwhere · is the dot product. The Lorentz factor retains its definition for a boost in any direction, since it depends only on the magnitude of the relative velocity. The definition with magnitude is also used by some authors.\n\nIntroducing a unit vector in the direction of relative motion, the relative velocity is with magnitude and direction , and vector projection and rejection give respectively\n\nAccumulating the results gives the full transformations,\n\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe projection and rejection also applies to . For the inverse transformations, exchange and to switch observed coordinates, and negate the relative velocity (or simply the unit vector since the magnitude is always positive) to obtain\n\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe unit vector has the advantage of simplifying equations for a single boost, allows either or to be reinstated when convenient, and the rapidity parametrization is immediately obtained by replacing and . It is not convenient for multiple boosts.\n\nThe vectorial relation between relative velocity and rapidity is\n\nand the \"rapidity vector\" can be defined as\n\neach of which serves as a useful abbreviation in some contexts. The magnitude of is the absolute value of the rapidity scalar confined to , which agrees with the range .\n\nDefining the coordinate velocities and Lorentz factor by\n\ntaking the differentials in the coordinates and time of the vector transformations, then dividing equations, leads to\n\nThe velocities and are the velocity of some massive object. They can also be for a third inertial frame (say \"F\"′′), in which case they must be \"constant\". Denote either entity by X. Then X moves with velocity relative to F, or equivalently with velocity relative to F′, in turn F′ moves with velocity relative to F. The inverse transformations can be obtained in a similar way, or as with position coordinates exchange and , and change to .\n\nThe transformation of velocity is useful in stellar aberration, the Fizeau experiment, and the relativistic Doppler effect.\n\nThe Lorentz transformations of acceleration can be similarly obtained by taking differentials in the velocity vectors, and dividing these by the time differential.\n\nIn general, given four quantities and and their Lorentz-boosted counterparts and , a relation of the form\n\nimplies the quantities transform under Lorentz transformations similar to the transformation of spacetime coordinates;\n\nThe decomposition of (and ) into components perpendicular and parallel to is exactly the same as for the position vector, as is the process of obtaining the inverse transformations (exchange and to switch observed quantities, and reverse the direction of relative motion by the substitution ).\n\nThe quantities collectively make up a \"four vector\", where is the \"timelike component\", and the \"spacelike component\". Examples of and are the following:\n\nFor a given object (e.g., particle, fluid, field, material), if or correspond to properties specific to the object like its charge density, mass density, spin, etc., its properties can be fixed in the rest frame of that object. Then the Lorentz transformations give the corresponding properties in a frame moving relative to the object with constant velocity. This breaks some notions taken for granted in non-relativistic physics. For example, the energy of an object is a scalar in non-relativistic mechanics, but not in relativistic mechanics because energy changes under Lorentz transformations; its value is different for various inertial frames. In the rest frame of an object, it has a rest energy and zero momentum. In a boosted frame its energy is different and it appears to have a momentum. Similarly, in non-relativistic quantum mechanics the spin of a particle is a constant vector, but in relativistic quantum mechanics spin depends on relative motion. In the rest frame of the particle, the spin pseudovector can be fixed to be its ordinary non-relativistic spin with a zero timelike quantity , however a boosted observer will perceive a nonzero timelike component and an altered spin.\n\nNot all quantities are invariant in the form as shown above, for example orbital angular momentum does not have a timelike quantity, and neither does the electric field nor the magnetic field . The definition of angular momentum is , and in a boosted frame the altered angular momentum is . Applying this definition using the transformations of coordinates and momentum leads to the transformation of angular momentum. It turns out transforms with another vector quantity related to boosts, see relativistic angular momentum for details. For the case of the and fields, the transformations cannot be obtained as directly using vector algebra. The Lorentz force is the definition of these fields, and in it is while in it is . A method of deriving the EM field transformations in an efficient way which also illustrates the unit of the electromagnetic field uses tensor algebra, given below.\n\nThroughout, italic non-bold capital letters are 4×4 matrices, while non-italic bold letters are 3×3 matrices.\n\nWriting the coordinates in column vectors and the Minkowski metric as a square matrix\n\nthe spacetime interval takes the form (T denotes transpose)\n\nand is invariant under a Lorentz transformation\n\nwhere Λ is a square matrix which can depend on parameters.\n\nThe set of all Lorentz transformations Λ in this article is denoted formula_29. This set together with matrix multiplication forms a group, in this context known as the \"Lorentz group\". Also, the above expression is a quadratic form of signature (3,1) on spacetime, and the group of transformations which leaves this quadratic form invariant is the indefinite orthogonal group O(3,1), a Lie group. In other words, the Lorentz group is O(3,1). As presented in this article, any Lie groups mentioned are matrix Lie groups. In this context the operation of composition amounts to matrix multiplication.\n\nFrom the invariance of the spacetime interval it follows\n\nand this matrix equation contains the general conditions on the Lorentz transformation to ensure invariance of the spacetime interval. Taking the determinant of the equation using the product rule gives immediately\n\nWriting the Minkowski metric as a block matrix, and the Lorentz transformation in the most general form,\n\ncarrying out the block matrix multiplications obtains general conditions on to ensure relativistic invariance. Not much information can be directly extracted from all the conditions, however one of the results\n\nis useful; always so it follows that\n\nThe negative inequality may be unexpected, because multiplies the time coordinate and this has an effect on time symmetry. If the positive equality holds, then is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe determinant and inequality provide four ways to classify Lorentz transformations (herein LTs for brevity). Any particular LT has only one determinant sign \"and\" only one inequality. There are four sets which include every possible pair given by the intersections (\"n\"-shaped symbol meaning \"and\") of these classifying sets.\n\nwhere \"+\" and \"−\" indicate the determinant sign, while \"↑\" for ≥ and \"↓\" for ≤ denote the inequalities.\n\nThe full Lorentz group splits into the union (\"u\"-shaped symbol meaning \"or\") of four disjoint sets\n\nA subgroup of a group must be closed under the same operation of the group (here matrix multiplication). In other words, for two Lorentz transformations and from a particular set, the composite Lorentz transformations and must be in the same set as and . This will not always be the case; it can be shown that the composition of \"any\" two Lorentz transformations always has the positive determinant and positive inequality, a proper orthochronous transformation. The sets formula_36, formula_37, formula_38, and formula_39 all form subgroups. The other sets involving the improper and/or antichronous properties (i.e. formula_40, formula_41, formula_42) do not form subgroups, because the composite transformation always has a positive determinant or inequality, whereas the original separate transformations will have negative determinants and/or inequalities.\n\nThe Lorentz boost is\n\nwhere the boost matrix is\n\nThe boosts along the Cartesian directions can be readily obtained, for example the unit vector in the x direction has components and .\n\nThe matrices make one or more successive transformations easier to handle, rather than rotely iterating the transformations to obtain the result of more than one transformation. If a frame is boosted with velocity relative to frame , and another frame is boosted with velocity relative to , the separate boosts are\nand the composition of the two boosts connects the coordinates in and ,\nSuccessive transformations act on the left. If and are collinear (parallel or antiparallel along the same line of relative motion), the boost matrices commute: and this composite transformation happens to be another boost.\n\nIf and are not collinear but in different directions, the situation is considerably more complicated. Lorentz boosts along different directions do not commute: and are not equal. Also, each of these compositions is \"not\" a single boost, but still a Lorentz transformation as each boost still preserves invariance of the spacetime interval. It turns out the composition of any two Lorentz boosts is equivalent to a boost followed or preceded by a rotation on the spatial coordinates, in the form of or . The and are composite velocities, while and are rotation parameters (e.g. axis-angle variables, Euler angles, etc.). The rotation in block matrix form is simply\n\nwhere is a 3d rotation matrix, which rotates any 3d vector in one sense (active transformation), or equivalently the coordinate frame in the opposite sense (passive transformation). It is \"not\" simple to connect and (or and ) to the original boost parameters and . In a composition of boosts, the matrix is named the Wigner rotation, and gives rise to the Thomas precession. These articles give the explicit formulae for the composite transformation matrices, including expressions for .\n\nIn this article the axis-angle representation is used for . The rotation is about an axis in the direction of a unit vector , through angle (positive anticlockwise, negative clockwise, according to the right-hand rule). The \"axis-angle vector\"\nwill serve as a useful abbreviation.\n\nSpatial rotations alone are also Lorentz transformations they leave the spacetime interval invariant. Like boosts, successive rotations about different axes do not commute. Unlike boosts, the composition of any two rotations is equivalent to a single rotation. Some other similarities and differences between the boost and rotation matrices include:\n\n\nThe most general proper Lorentz transformation includes a boost and rotation together, and is a nonsymmetric matrix. As special cases, and . An explicit form of the general Lorentz transformation is cumbersome to write down and will not be given here. Nevertheless, closed form expressions for the transformation matrices will be given below using group theoretical arguments. It will be easier to use the rapidity parametrization for boosts, in which case one writes and .\n\nThe set of transformations\n\nwith matrix multiplication as the operation of composition forms a group, called the \"restricted Lorentz group\", and is the special indefinite orthogonal group SO(3,1). (The plus sign indicates that it preserves the orientation of the temporal dimension).\n\nFor simplicity, look at the infinitesimal Lorentz boost in the x direction (examining a boost in any other direction, or rotation about any axis, follows an identical procedure). The infinitesimal boost is a small boost away from the identity, obtained by the Taylor expansion of the boost matrix to first order about ,\n\nwhere the higher order terms not shown are negligible because is small, and is simply the boost matrix in the \"x\" direction. The derivative of the matrix is the matrix of derivatives (of the entries, with respect to the same variable), and it is understood the derivatives are found first then evaluated at ,\n\nFor now, is defined by this result (its significance will be explained shortly). In the limit of an infinite number of infinitely small steps, the finite boost transformation in the form of a matrix exponential is obtained\n\nwhere the limit definition of the exponential has been used (see also characterizations of the exponential function). More generally\n\nThe axis-angle vector and rapidity vector are altogether six continuous variables which make up the group parameters (in this particular representation), and the generators of the group are and , each vectors of matrices with the explicit forms\n\nThese are all defined in an analogous way to above, although the minus signs in the boost generators are conventional. Physically, the generators of the Lorentz group correspond to important symmetries in spacetime: are the \"rotation generators\" which correspond to angular momentum, and are the \"boost generators\" which correspond to the motion of the system in spacetime. The derivative of any smooth curve with in the group depending on some group parameter with respect to that group parameter, evaluated at , serves as a definition of a corresponding group generator , and this reflects an infinitesimal transformation away from the identity. The smooth curve can always be taken as an exponential as the exponential will always map smoothly back into the group via for all ; this curve will yield again when differentiated at .\n\nExpanding the exponentials in their Taylor series obtains\n\nwhich compactly reproduce the boost and rotation matrices as given in the previous section.\n\nIt has been stated that the general proper Lorentz transformation is a product of a boost and rotation. At the \"infinitesimal\" level the product\n\nis commutative because only linear terms are required (products like and count as higher order terms and are negligible). Taking the limit as before leads to the finite transformation in the form of an exponential\n\nThe converse is also true, but the decomposition of a finite general Lorentz transformation into such factors is nontrivial. In particular,\n\nbecause the generators do not commute. For a description of how to find the factors of a general Lorentz transformation in terms of a boost and a rotation \"in principle\" (this usually does not yield an intelligible expression in terms of generators and ), see Wigner rotation. If, on the other hand, \"the decomposition is given\" in terms of the generators, and one wants to find the product in terms of the generators, then the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula applies.\n\nLorentz generators can be added together, or multiplied by real numbers, to obtain more Lorentz generators. In other words, the set of all Lorentz generators\n\ntogether with the operations of ordinary matrix addition and multiplication of a matrix by a number, forms a vector space over the real numbers. The generators form a basis set of \"V\", and the components of the axis-angle and rapidity vectors, , are the coordinates of a Lorentz generator with respect to this basis.\n\nThree of the commutation relations of the Lorentz generators are\n\nwhere the bracket is known as the \"commutator\", and the other relations can be found by taking cyclic permutations of x, y, z components (i.e. change x to y, y to z, and z to x, repeat).\n\nThese commutation relations, and the vector space of generators, fulfill the definition of the Lie algebra formula_63. In summary, a Lie algebra is defined as a vector space \"V\" over a field of numbers, and with a binary operation [ , ] (called a Lie bracket in this context) on the elements of the vector space, satisfying the axioms of bilinearity, alternatization, and the Jacobi identity. Here the operation [ , ] is the commutator which satisfies all of these axioms, the vector space is the set of Lorentz generators \"V\" as given previously, and the field is the set of real numbers.\n\nLinking terminology used in mathematics and physics: A group generator is any element of the Lie algebra. A group parameter is a component of a coordinate vector representing an arbitrary element of the Lie algebra with respect to some basis. A basis, then, is a set of generators being a basis of the Lie algebra in the usual vector space sense.\n\nThe exponential map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group,\n\nprovides a one-to-one correspondence between small enough neighborhoods of the origin of the Lie algebra and neighborhoods of the identity element of the Lie group. It the case of the Lorentz group, the exponential map is just the matrix exponential. Globally, the exponential map is not one-to-one, but in the case of the Lorentz group, it is surjective (onto). Hence any group element can be expressed as an exponential of an element of the Lie algebra.\n\nLorentz transformations also include parity inversion\n\nwhich negates all the spatial coordinates only, and time reversal\n\nwhich negates the time coordinate only, because these transformations leave the spacetime interval invariant. Here is the 3d identity matrix. These are both symmetric, they are their own inverses (see involution (mathematics)), and each have determinant −1. This latter property makes them improper transformations.\n\nIf is a proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation, then is improper antichronous, is improper orthochronous, and is proper antichronous.\n\nTwo other spacetime symmetries have not been accounted for. For the spacetime interval to be invariant, it can be shown that it is necessary and sufficient for the coordinate transformation to be of the form\n\nwhere \"C\" is a constant column containing translations in time and space. If \"C\" ≠ 0, this is an inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation or Poincaré transformation. If \"C\" = 0, this is a homogeneous Lorentz transformation. Poincaré transformations are not dealt further in this article.\n\nWriting the general matrix transformation of coordinates as the matrix equation\n\nallows the transformation of other physical quantities that cannot be expressed as four-vectors; e.g., tensors or spinors of any order in 4d spacetime, to be defined. In the corresponding tensor index notation, the above matrix expression is\n\nwhere lower and upper indices label covariant and contravariant components respectively, and the summation convention is applied. It is a standard convention to use Greek indices that take the value 0 for time components, and 1, 2, 3 for space components, while Latin indices simply take the values 1, 2, 3, for spatial components. Note that the first index (reading left to right) corresponds in the matrix notation to a \"row index\". The second index corresponds to the column index.\n\nThe transformation matrix is universal for all four-vectors, not just 4-dimensional spacetime coordinates. If is any four-vector, then in tensor index notation\n\nAlternatively, one writes\n\nin which the primed indices denote the indices of A in the primed frame. This notation cuts risk of exhausting the Greek alphabet roughly in half.\n\nFor a general -component object one may write\n\nwhere is the appropriate representation of the Lorentz group, an matrix for every . In this case, the indices should \"not\" be thought of as spacetime indices (sometimes called Lorentz indices), and they run from to . E.g., if is a bispinor, then the indices are called \"Dirac indices\".\n\nThere are also vector quantities with covariant indices. They are generally obtained from their corresponding objects with contravariant indices by the operation of \"lowering an index\"; e.g.,\n\nwhere is the metric tensor. (The linked article also provides more information about what the operation of raising and lowering indices really is mathematically.) The inverse of this transformation is given by\n\nwhere, when viewed as matrices, is the inverse of . As it happens, . This is referred to as \"raising an index\". To transform a covariant vector , first raise its index, then transform it according to the same rule as for contravariant -vectors, then finally lower the index;\n\nBut\n\nI. e., it is the -component of the \"inverse\" Lorentz transformation. One defines (as a matter of notation),\n\nand may in this notation write\n\nNow for a subtlety. The implied summation on the right hand side of\n\nis running over \"a row index\" of the matrix representing . Thus, in terms of matrices, this transformation should be thought of as the \"inverse transpose\" of acting on the column vector . That is, in pure matrix notation,\n\nThis means exactly that covariant vectors (thought of as column matrices) transform according to the dual representation of the standard representation of the Lorentz group. This notion generalizes to general representations, simply replace with .\n\nIf and are linear operators on vector spaces and , then a linear operator may be defined on the tensor product of and , denoted according to\n\nFrom this it is immediately clear that if and are a four-vectors in , then transforms as\n\nThe second step uses the bilinearity of the tensor product and the last step defines a 2-tensor on component form, or rather, it just renames the tensor .\n\nThese observations generalize in an obvious way to more factors, and using the fact that a general tensor on a vector space can be written as a sum of a coefficient (component!) times tensor products of basis vectors and basis covectors, one arrives at the transformation law for any tensor quantity . It is given by\n\n_\\mu {\\Lambda^{\\beta'}}_\\nu \\cdots {\\Lambda^{\\zeta'}}_\\rho\n</math>               \n\nwhere is defined above. This form can generally be reduced to the form for general -component objects given above with a single matrix () operating on column vectors. This latter form is sometimes preferred; e.g., for the electromagnetic field tensor.\n\nLorentz transformations can also be used to illustrate that the magnetic field and electric field are simply different aspects of the same force — the electromagnetic force, as a consequence of relative motion between electric charges and observers. The fact that the electromagnetic field shows relativistic effects becomes clear by carrying out a simple thought experiment.\n\nThe electric and magnetic fields transform differently from space and time, but exactly the same way as relativistic angular momentum and the boost vector.\n\nThe electromagnetic field strength tensor is given by\n\nin SI units. In relativity, the Gaussian system of units is often preferred over SI units, even in texts whose main choice of units is SI units, because in it the electric field and the magnetic induction have the same units making the appearance of the electromagnetic field tensor more natural. Consider a Lorentz boost in the -direction. It is given by\n\nwhere the field tensor is displayed side by side for easiest possible reference in the manipulations below.\n\nThe general transformation law becomes\n\nFor the magnetic field one obtains\n\nFor the electric field results\n\nHere, is used. These results can be summarized by\n\nand are independent of the metric signature. For SI units, substitute . refer to this last form as the view as opposed to the \"geometric view\" represented by the tensor expression\nand make a strong point of the ease with which results that are difficult to achieve using the view can be obtained and understood. Only objects that have well defined Lorentz transformation properties (in fact under \"any\" smooth coordinate transformation) are geometric objects. In the geometric view, the electromagnetic field is a six-dimensional geometric object in \"spacetime\" as opposed to two interdependent, but separate, 3-vector fields in \"space\" and \"time\". The fields (alone) and (alone) do not have well defined Lorentz transformation properties. The mathematical underpinnings are equations and that immediately yield . One should note that the primed and unprimed tensors refer to the \"same event in spacetime\". Thus the complete equation with spacetime dependence is\n\nLength contraction has an effect on charge density and current density , and time dilation has an effect on the rate of flow of charge (current), so charge and current distributions must transform in a related way under a boost. It turns out they transform exactly like the space-time and energy-momentum four-vectors,\n\nor, in the simpler geometric view,\n\nOne says that charge density transforms as the time component of a four-vector. It is a rotational scalar. The current density is a 3-vector.\n\nThe Maxwell equations are invariant under Lorentz transformations.\n\nEquation hold unmodified for any representation of the Lorentz group, including the bispinor representation. In one simply replaces all occurrences of by the bispinor representation ,\n\nThe above equation could, for instance, be the transformation of a state in Fock space describing two free electrons.\n\nA general \"noninteracting\" multi-particle state (Fock space state) in quantum field theory transforms according to the rule\nwhere is the Wigner rotation and is the representation of .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Malice is either \"expressed\" or \"implied\". Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to unlawfully take away the life of a human being. Malice is implied when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart. Cal. Pen. Code § 188. Malice, in a legal sense, may be inferred from the evidence and imputed to the defendant, depending on the nature of the case.\n\nIn many kinds of cases, malice must be found to exist in order to convict (for example malice is an element of the crime of arson in many jurisdictions). In civil law cases, a finding of malice allows for the award of greater damages, or for punitive damages. The legal concept of malice is most common in Anglo-American law, and in legal systems derived from the English common law system.\n\nIn English civil law (being the law of England and Wales), relevant case law in negligence and misfeasance in a public office includes \"Dunlop v. Woollahra Municipal Council\" [1982] A.C. 158; \"Bourgoin S.A. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\" [1986] Q.B. 716; \"Jones v Swansea City Council\" [1990] 1 WLR 1453; \"Three Rivers District Council and Others v Governor and Company of The Bank of England\" [2000] and \"Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis\" [1995] 2 QB 335 in which Steyn LJ. found that malice could be made out if the acts were done with an actual intention to cause injury. Malice could be shown if the acts were done in the knowledge of invalidity or lack of power and with knowledge that it would cause or be likely to cause injury. Malice would also exist if the acts were done with reckless indifference or deliberate blindness to that invalidity or lack of power and that likely injury. These elements, with respect, are consistent with the views of the majority albeit that some of those views were expressed tentatively having regard to the basis upon which the case before them was presented.\n\nIn English criminal law on \"mens rea\" (Latin for \"guilty mind\"), \"R v. Cunningham\" (1957) 2 AER 412 was the pivotal case in establishing both that the test for \"maliciously\" was subjective rather than objective, and that malice was inevitably linked to recklessness. In that case, a man released gas from the mains into adjoining houses while attempting to steal money from the pay-meter:\n\nLord Diplock confirmed the relationship to recklessness in \"R v Mowatt\" (1968) 1 QB 421:\n\nIn the United States, the malice standard was set in the Supreme Court case of \"New York Times Co. v.

It insinuates a positive feeling towards an opportunity, or fresh start.\n\nAccording to a popular legend in Irish folklore, \"The Giant Boulder\" - the name of the hero in the story was Manan. Manan saved the Irish village from destruction by positioning a giant boulder blocking the sea, preventing the town's inhabitants from drowning; that village later called every clan leader by the honorary name of Manan, and it stands for honor, strength, and greatness.\n\nManan (; ) means deep thought, contemplation, or profound reflection. The root of the word is man (Sanskrit मन) — the mind — i.e., the faculty that produces thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn Vedanta group of Hindu philosophical traditions (see, for instance, ), there are three steps to self-realization: (1) \"shravana\" i.e., careful listening to the teaching of the Vedanta, (2) \"manana\" i.e., repeatedly and deeply reflecting on or contemplating what is learned from those teachings, and (3) \"nididhyasana\" i.e., becoming completely absorbed in contemplation that no other thought enters the mind.\n\nThe Sanskrit derived Manan is a relatively uncommon name given to males in India.\n\nMannan means \"king\" or \"leader\"\nin Tamil.\n\nThe name Manan can also be of Persian background and is given to males. Manan's meaning encompasses the ideas of conscience, mind, and soul. It insinuates the qualities of thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and consideration. The name apparently also means fun-loving, naughty, and joyous as well as disciplined and righteous. A \"Manan\" would not agree with or appreciate wrongdoing, unmannered persons.\n\nManan or Mannan is a name that is also found in Islam; it's an Arabic name. Generally, this is not used alone, as it's preceded by names like Abdul etc. (Abdul Manan or Abdul Mannan, means Slave of the God), it is so because Manan is one of God's names, hence the name Abdul Manan is given.\n\n"}

The exception is the root which is a particular agent often labelled ‘society’ and located on the extreme left of an ontology chart. The root is often dropped in practice but is implied in every ontology chart. If any other particular is present in an ontology chart it is recognised by the ‘#’ sign prefix and upper case letters. In our ontology chart the node labelled #IBM is a particular organisation.\n\nThe arcs represent ontological dependency relations directed from left to right. The right affordance is ontologically dependent on the left affordance. The left affordance is the ontological antecedent of the right affordance. A special category of affordances are determiners. They are recognised by the ‘#’ sign prefix. The two examples above are #hourly rate and #name. All determiners have a second antecedent – the measurement standard. They are usually dropped from the ontology chart but they are implied and obvious. In the case of hourly rate and name they are currency and language respectively. The names on the arcs are role names of the carrier, the left node, in the relationship node on the right. For example, the ‘employee’ is the role name of a person while in employment. No ontology chart node has more than two ontological antecedents. Where you find an arc on the ontology chart between a role name and a node, read that as an arc between the right hand side of the role name.

Ontological dependency is a relationship known mathematically as a partial order set relation (poset). Posets are an object of study in the mathematical discipline of order theory. They belong to the class of binary relations but they have three additional properties: reflexivity, anti-symmetry and transitivity.\n\nOntological dependency is a special poset because it is a binary relation, every thing is ontologically dependent on itself for its existence, two things that are mutually ontologically dependent must be the same thing and if a depends on b and b depends on c then a depends on c. The last of these properties - the transitive property of posets - was exploited by Helmut Hasse to give us the Hasse diagram - a diagram of incredible power, simplicity and if drawn well elegant as well. Because ontology charts have a root that all affordances (realisations/things) are ultimately dependent upon for their existence, they are graphical representation of semi-lattices.\n\n\n\n"}

However, \"unless there is some other legal basis for the search,\" such a search \"must exclude the home and any adjoining land (such as a yard) that is within an enclosure or otherwise protected from public scrutiny.\"\n\nThe open fields doctrine was first articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Hester v. United States\", which stated that \"the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their 'persons, houses, papers, and effects,' is not extended to the open fields.\" This opinion appears to be decided on the basis that \"open fields are not a \"constitutionally protected area\" because they cannot be construed as \"persons, houses, papers, [or] effects.\"\n\nThis method of reasoning gave way with the arrival of the landmark case \"Katz v. U.S.\", which established a two-part test for what constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The relevant criteria are \"first that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable'.\" Under this new analysis of the Fourth Amendment, a search of an object or area where a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy is, in a legal sense, not a search at all. That search, therefore, does not trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nIn \"Oliver v. United States\", the Supreme Court held that a privacy expectation regarding an open field is unreasonable:\n\n… open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance. There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities, such as the cultivation of crops, that occur in open fields.\n\nCourts have continuously held that entry into an open field—whether trespass or not—is not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. No matter what steps a person takes, he or she cannot create a reasonable privacy expectation in an open field, because it is an area incapable of supporting an expectation of privacy as a matter of constitutional law. In situations where the police allege that what was searched was an open field, this has the practical effect of shifting the argument from whether any given expectation of privacy is reasonable, to whether the given place is actually an open field or some other type of area like curtilage. This is because a person \"can\" have a reasonable expectation of privacy in areas classed as such.\n\nWhile open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment, the curtilage, or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home, may be protected. Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person's home (unlike a person's open fields) under the Fourth Amendment.\nAn area is curtilage if it \"harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.\" Courts make this determination by examining \"the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.\" Theoretically, many structures might extend the curtilage protection to the areas immediately surrounding them. The courts have gone so far as to treat a tent as a home for Fourth Amendment purposes in the past. (Note: these are 9th Circuit Court of Appeals cases and would not be binding authority in many, if not most, cases.) It is possible that the area immediately surrounding a tent (or any structure used as a home) might be considered curtilage.\n\nDespite this rather broad interpretation of curtilage, the courts seem willing to find areas to be outside of the curtilage if they are in any way separate from the home (by a fence, great distance, other structures, even certain plants).\n\n"}
{"id": "5006088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5006088", "title": "Orthogonal coordinates", "text": "Orthogonal coordinates\n\nIn mathematics, orthogonal coordinates are defined as a set of \"d\" coordinates q = (\"q\", \"q\", ..., \"q\") in which the coordinate surfaces all meet at right angles (note: superscripts are indices, not exponents). A coordinate surface for a particular coordinate \"q\" is the curve, surface, or hypersurface on which \"q\" is a constant. For example, the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") is an orthogonal coordinate system, since its coordinate surfaces \"x\" = constant, \"y\" = constant, and \"z\" = constant are planes that meet at right angles to one another, i.e., are perpendicular. Orthogonal coordinates are a special but extremely common case of curvilinear coordinates.\n\nWhile vector operations and physical laws are normally easiest to derive in Cartesian coordinates, non-Cartesian orthogonal coordinates are often used instead for the solution of various problems, especially boundary value problems, such as those arising in field theories of quantum mechanics, fluid flow, electrodynamics and the diffusion of chemical species or heat.\n\nThe chief advantage of non-Cartesian coordinates is that they can be chosen to match the symmetry of the problem. For example, the pressure wave due to an explosion far from the ground (or other barriers) depends on 3D space in Cartesian coordinates, however the pressure predominantly moves away from the center, so that in spherical coordinates the problem becomes very nearly one-dimensional (since the pressure wave dominantly depends only on time and the distance from the center). Another example is (slow) fluid in a straight circular pipe: in Cartesian coordinates, one has to solve a (difficult) two dimensional boundary value problem involving a partial differential equation, but in cylindrical coordinates the problem becomes one-dimensional with an ordinary differential equation instead of a partial differential equation.\n\nThe reason to prefer orthogonal coordinates instead of general curvilinear coordinates is simplicity: many complications arise when coordinates are not orthogonal. For example, in orthogonal coordinates many problems may be solved by separation of variables. Separation of variables is a mathematical technique that converts a complex \"d\"-dimensional problem into \"d\" one-dimensional problems that can be solved in terms of known functions. Many equations can be reduced to Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation. Laplace's equation is separable in 13 orthogonal coordinate systems (the 14 listed in the table below with the exception of toroidal), and the Helmholtz equation is separable in 11 orthogonal coordinate systems.\n\nOrthogonal coordinates never have off-diagonal terms in their metric tensor. In other words, the infinitesimal squared distance \"ds\" can always be written as a scaled sum of the squared infinitesimal coordinate displacements\n\nwhere \"d\" is the dimension and the scaling functions (or scale factors)\n\nequal the square roots of the diagonal components of the metric tensor, or the lengths of the local basis vectors formula_3 described below. These scaling functions \"h\" are used to calculate differential operators in the new coordinates, e.g., the gradient, the Laplacian, the divergence and the curl.\n\nA simple method for generating orthogonal coordinates systems in two dimensions is by a conformal mapping of a standard two-dimensional grid of Cartesian coordinates . A complex number \"z\" = \"x\" + \"iy\" can be formed from the real coordinates \"x\" and \"y\", where \"i\" represents the imaginary unit. Any holomorphic function \"w\" = \"f\"(\"z\") with non-zero complex derivative will produce a conformal mapping; if the resulting complex number is written , then the curves of constant \"u\" and \"v\" intersect at right angles, just as the original lines of constant \"x\" and \"y\" did.\n\nOrthogonal coordinates in three and higher dimensions can be generated from an orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate system, either by projecting it into a new dimension (\"cylindrical coordinates\") or by rotating the two-dimensional system about one of its symmetry axes. However, there are other orthogonal coordinate systems in three dimensions that cannot be obtained by projecting or rotating a two-dimensional system, such as the ellipsoidal coordinates. More general orthogonal coordinates may be obtained by starting with some necessary coordinate surfaces and considering their orthogonal trajectories.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the basis vectors are fixed (constant). In the more general setting of curvilinear coordinates, a point in space is specified by the coordinates, and at every such point there is bound a set of basis vectors, which generally are not constant: this is the essence of curvilinear coordinates in general and is a very important concept. What distinguishes orthogonal coordinates is that, though the basis vectors vary, they are always orthogonal with respect to each other. In other words,\n\nThese basis vectors are by definition the tangent vectors of the curves obtained by varying one coordinate, keeping the others fixed:\n\nwhere r is some point and \"q\" is the coordinate for which the basis vector is extracted. In other words, a curve is obtained by fixing all but one coordinate; the unfixed coordinate is varied as in a parametric curve, and the derivative of the curve with respect to the parameter (the varying coordinate) is the basis vector for that coordinate.\n\nNote that the vectors are not necessarily of equal length. The useful functions known as scale factors of the coordinates are simply the lengths formula_6 of the basis vectors formula_7 (see table below). The scale factors are sometimes called Lamé coefficients, but this terminology is best avoided since some more well known coefficients in linear elasticity carry the same name.\n\nThe normalized basis vectors are notated with a hat and obtained by dividing by the length:\n\nformula_9\nformula_10\nformula_11\nformula_12\n\nwhere\n\nis the Jacobian determinant, which has the geometric interpretation of the deformation in volume from the infinitesimal cube d\"x\"d\"y\"d\"z\" to the infinitesimal curved volume in the orthogonal coordinates.\n\nUsing the line element shown above, the line integral along a path formula_14 of a vector F is:\n\nAn infinitesimal element of area for a surface described by holding one coordinate \"q\" constant is:\n\nSimilarly, the volume element is:\n\nwhere the large symbol Π (capital Pi) indicates a product the same way that a large Σ indicates summation.

These numbers suggest that the widely quoted and unsubstantiated figure of 10% of non-paternal events is an overestimate.

Most at risk were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain cultural groups.\n\nA 2008 study in the United Kingdom found that biological fathers were misidentified in 0.2% (1 in 500) of the cases processed by the Child Support Agency. Of that 0.2%, those resolved with DNA paternity testing between 2004 and 2008 showed that between 10 and 19% of mothers had misidentified the biological father; data about why mothers identified the wrong biological father was not available.\n\nThe Victorian County Court in 2002 awarded Mr. Magill $70,000 compensation for damages and economic loss against his ex-wife as a result of DNA testing in 2000 that showed only one of three children he was paying support for were genetically his.\nThat ruling was later overturned in 2005 by the Victorian Court of Appeal finding that \"intent to deceive\" by the ex-wife had not been proven regarding misrepresentations made by Ms. Magill in birth forms about the children's paternity.\nThis ruling was in turn then appealed with the High Court of Australia.\n\nIn 2006 Australia's High Court struck down the appeal, upholding the 2005 Victorian Court of Appeal ruling.\nChief Justice Murray Gleeson in the 94 page High Court Ruling opined, \"Without doubt the appellant's wife deceived him but the hurtful deception was in her infidelity, not in her failure to admit it.\"\nMr. Magill as part of the ruling was also ordered to pay the Child Support Agency's legal fees during the previous 18 months of litigation.\n\nThe 2006 High Court Ruling led to many calls from within Australia for reforms and changes to the Family Law Act and the Child Support Act to help protect men in Mr Magill's situation.\nBy 2008 putative fathers in Australia could begin using DNA testing to confirm paternity regarding support orders after new changes, \"section 143 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act\", took effect regarding Family Court policies. The Magill case is often cited regarding new law reforms in Australia and is considered a landmark type case.\n\nMr. Cornelio began paying child support for his ex-wife's twins after the couple separated in 1998. The former couple settled upon a joint custody agreement in 2002 that continued Mr. Cornelio's monetary child support for the twins.\nShortly afterwards Ms. Cornelio requested a reduction in visitation time along with an increase in support payments. Mr. Cornelio became suspicious of the paternity of the twins. A subsequent DNA test revealed that he was not their biological father. A request was made by Mr. Cornelio to be excused from paying further child support, claiming to be the victim of misrepresentation or fraud when Ms. Cornelio failed to disclose the extramarital affair when he signed the 2002 joint custody agreement.\n\nThe Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2008 ruled against the request to be excused or reimbursed for child support payments. Judge van Rensburg, in deciding to deny the request, noted that Mr. Cornelio had wondered at the time of his separation if an affair by his ex-wife had actually been responsible for the twins. \"It was not until access was interrupted and Ms. Cornelio commenced proceedings seeking increased child support that the respondent began pursuing this issue,\" the judge remarked. \"The fact of that relationship – even if it has now become strained – is sufficient to require Mr. Cornelio to continue to contribute toward the children's material needs.\"\n\nThe default in Finnish law as of 2018 is that the husband is the acknowledged father of the child who is born into wedlock (or to a deceased husband). Only if the wife agrees, can that initial determination be set to something else. However, from 2016 the general right the mother to solely allow or prevent the parental investigation was abolished. The default and immediately forcing juridical assumption of paternity of a husband was not changed in the latest 2015 act.\n\nA man can bring up a later legal action to annul his paternity, disregarding of the resistance of his wife. The legal action for annulment may be brought in the district court by a man whose paternity has been determined on the basis of either marriage or by some other authoratitive decision.\n\nA man who has officially acknowledged paternity relinquishes his rights to further actions if he, knowing the woman had a sexual intercourse with another man, or that she has used foreign sperm for fertilization, has stated in writing following birth of the child that the child is biologically his.\n\nOtherwise legally binding prebirth acknowledgment of a man must be rejected, if either the health care staff of the child supervisor do have a founded suspicion that the man is not a father of the child, or he is for any reason not capable to understand what he is doing when acknowledging the paternity.\n\nIf a mother deliberately gives false information to the authorities, which contributes to the erroneous establishment of paternity, she may be fined.\n\nIn 2004, a South Korean man was awarded $42,380 compensation for pain and suffering when a DNA test established that his ex-wife's paternity claim regarding their child was misattributed. When Mr. Doe, who had married Ms. Doe based on her paternity claim, began a lawsuit against a hospital for switching his child at birth, Ms. Doe claimed to having been pregnant with another man's baby.\n\nOn 5 January 2015, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland (decision 5A_619 of 2015) decided on a case wherein a plaintiff challenged the paternity of his (alleged) daughter. The plaintiff had his sperm examined in November 2009. As a result of the examination, the plaintiff’s fertility was found to be 3%. The court contended that the alleged father should have started investigating his paternity as a consequence of that finding. The plaintiff actually had his non-paternity confirmed via DNA evidence in 2013 upon failure of his marriage. The court held that the one year time limit under Swiss civil code article 260c for filing an action lapsed due to the plaintiff’s (the alleged father’s) inactivity for more than two years. The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland thus confirmed the ruling by the first instance and dismissed the appeal. It follows that the plaintiff’s financial obligations as to his (alleged) daughter will not change.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, paternity fraud, like adultery, is not a criminal offence except in the case of the lineage of the children of the British monarch under the Treason Act 1351 where the adulterers are punishable as adultering against the lineage of the King with the King's \"companion, ... or the wife of the King's eldest son and heir\". Knowingly making a false statement on a public document is a criminal offence, including naming someone who is not the biological father. As of 2008, no individual has been prosecuted in a case involving paternity fraud. A mother is permitted to not state the name of the biological father if she does not know it. Paternity fraud is a form of misattributed paternity.\n\nThe split in 2002 between a couple, identified for legal reasons as Mr. A and Ms. B, prompted Mr. A to pursue a parental contract to establish his non-married rights as their child's father. Ms. B then requested a DNA test that later showed Mr. A was not the (then) five year old's father. Following the discovery Mr. A then sued Ms. B for damages of up to £100,000 as a result of the deceit.\n\nDuring 2007 in what was reported as the first known case of its kind to reach trial in Britain, the High Court ruled in favor of awarding £7,500 distress damages with another £14,943 for holidays and meals out Mr. A spent on Ms. B (not the child). The judgment fell short of listed suit amount because the London court did not allow damages for the child's material costs incurred because of Mr. A's enjoyment of the relationship. The judge, Sir John Blofeld, said he was satisfied that Mr. A's motivation in coming to court was not as a lever for contact with the child but because he did not want \"to be taken for a ride\".\n\nThe United States has historically imposed a strong presumption of marital paternity, and has also imposed barriers to paternity challenges once paternity has been legally established. In more recent years, especially since the advent of DNA testing, laws and guidelines have been proposed or enacted that may allow for a paternity challenge by a legal father who later determines he is not a child's biological father, or by a biological father who learns that somebody else has been named on a child's birth certificate as the child's father.\n\nIn the case of \"County of Los Angeles v. Navarro\", in 1996, the County of Los Angeles entered a default judgment against putative father Mr. Navarro and ordered him to pay monthly support for Ms. Doe's two children. The complaint to establish paternity filed by the Bureau of Family Support Operations was based on information provided by Ms. Doe naming \"Manuel Nava\" as the children's father. The agency determined that Mr. Navarro was the father in question and delivered notice to his sister's residence listing Mr. Navarro as \"co-resident\", a notice Mr. Navarro denied ever receiving.\n\nIn 2001 Mr. Navarro, armed with a DNA test showing he was not the children's father, sued the County of Los Angeles asking to be relieved from the support order. The County of Los Angeles opposed the motion, arguing the motion was filed after the six month limit to contest a default judgment and the mother’s mere assertion that he was the father was insufficient to establish extrinsic fraud. The trial court sided with the County and denied the motion. This ruling was then appealed before the California 2nd Appellate Court of Appeal.\n\nIn 2004 the court of appeal reversed the trial court decision ruling in favor of Mr. Navarro and became the first published California case to hold that the statute of limitations did not apply in setting aside an old default judgment against a paternity fraud victim. Immediately after the ruling was issued, the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department announced that it would request that the case be depublished so it could not be used as a precedent by other men in Mr. Navarro's situation. That request was later denied by the California Supreme Court.\n\nIn the case of \"Parker v. Parker\", as part of their 2001 Florida divorce settlement Mr. Parker was obliged to pay $1200 monthly child support based on Ms. Parker's representations to the court that Mr. Parker was the child's biological father. In 2003 Ms. Parker filed a motion for contempt and a petition to enforce child support against Mr. Parker which prompted a DNA test showing that Mr. Parker was not the child's biological father.\nThe motion was 16 months after their divorce, Florida law (at that time) only allowed the husband 12 months to contest paternity following divorce.\nMr. Parker's court ordered payments would total about $216,000 over the next fifteen years.\n\nMr. Parker filed a petition for relief claiming that the misrepresentation of paternity had resulted in a fraudulent support order. This was dismissed by both the Trial and then, in 2005, the Court of Appeal as being intrinsic fraud and subject to the Florida one year time limit to contest a dissolution decree, not extrinsic fraud, or a fraud upon the court, that can form the basis for relief from judgment more than a year later. This ruling was then appealed before the Florida Supreme Court who, in 2007, denied Mr. Parker's suit upholding the Fourth District Court of Appeal 2005 ruling.\n\nDuring 2006, the Florida statutes changed allowing a DNA test to be considered new evidence to contest a support order after the one year time limit.\nIn its published opinion the Supreme Court Ruling in 2007 noted the change in Florida Statutes, \"which provides the circumstances and procedures under which a male may disestablish paternity and terminate a child support obligation,\" however the court decided not to consider the applicability of this new statute to Mr. Parker's circumstances, kicking the question of a retrial under the new law back to the Trial Courts.\n\nBecause the basic facts are little questioned and the case explores differences between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud, other state Supreme Courts, including Iowa and Tennessee, have cited \"Parker v. Parker\" when writing opinions of their own for paternity fraud type cases.\n\nIn 2012 the Iowa Supreme Court in ruling to allow a paternity fraud tort to proceed as they fall \"within the traditional boundaries of fraud law\", but advised caution in bringing cases, as they would be \"hard to prove, emotional and embarrassing\".\n\nIn the case of \"Barreras v. Trevino\", Mr. Barreras and Ms. Trevino divorced in 1999 with Ms. Trevino shortly afterwards gaining a support order for her supposed daughter with Mr. Barreras named as the putative father. In 2004 a New Mexico court ruled that the child Mr. Barreras had (up until then) paid $20,000 support to Ms. Trevino for did not actually exist.\nMr. Barreras sued a DNA testing laboratory in 2006 for falsifying two separate DNA tests for the supposed child by using samples taken from his adult daughter who, along with one of the lab employees, also face fraud charges.\nMs. Trevino pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of fraud and perjury, and was sentenced to twenty-one years in prison. Trevino served 16 months in federal prison in Arizona for claiming the non-existent girl on tax returns.\n\nAs part of the paternity fraud Ms. Trevino was able to obtain a birth certificate, medicare card and social security card for the fictitious girl prompting (then) Gov. Bill Richardson to direct New Mexico Department of Human Services to explain how several government agencies became not only unwitting partners in the fraud, but also resisted efforts to correct it.\nLetters and calls from Mr. Barreras to the New Mexico child support agency about his vasectomy in 1998 were ignored and when the child support enforcement division's order to bring the supposed child in for more paternity tests were not complied with by Ms. Trevino the agency simply closed the case without further investigation.\n\nIn the case of \"Hodge v. Craig\" in October 2012, intentional misrepresentation of paternity was recognized by a unanimous Tennessee Supreme Court in \"Hodge v. Craig\", a case where the mother intentionally lied to a man about who the father of the child was. Based on the mother's assurances the couple married but later divorced. The plaintiff dutifully paid child support including medical insurance for the child. Based on physical differences between himself and the child he obtained a tissue sample and confirmed his suspicions. Damages were awarded in compensation for child support paid for 15 years. The court's decision was based on the common law remedy of intentional misrepresentation; the court distinguished the award of damages from a retroactive modification of child support. The action was for damages; it was not a suit to disestablish paternity.\n\nThe topic of paternity fraud is controversial. In the \"Journal of Medical Ethics\", Heather Draper writes, \"claims for reimbursement and compensation in cases of misattributed paternity produce the same distorted and thin view of what it means to be a father that paternity testing assumes, and underscores a trend that is not in the interests of children.\" Lyn Turner says that the concept of paternity fraud is about the \"demonization of mothers\".\n"}

The questions comprising this field of research are, for example, what kind of properties colors are (i.e. are they physical properties of objects? Or are they properties of their own kind?), but also problems about the representation of colors, and the relationship between the representation of colors and their ontological constitution.\n\nWithin the ontology of color, there are various competing types of theories. One way of posing their relationship is in terms of whether they posit colors as sui generis properties (properties of a special kind that can't be reduced to more basic properties or constellations of such). This divides color primitivism from color reductionism. A primitivism about color is any theory that explains colors as unreducible properties. A reductionism is the opposite view, that colors are identical to or reducible to other properties. Typically a reductionist view of color explains colors as an object's disposition to cause certain effects in perceivers or the very dispositional power itself (this sort of view is often dubbed \"relationalism\", since it defines colors in terms of effects on perceivers, but it also often called simply dispositionalism - various forms of course exist). An example of a notable theorist that defends this kind of view is the philosopher Jonathan Cohen.\n\nAnother type of reductionism is color physicalism. Physicalism is the view that colors are identical to certain physical properties of objects. Most commonly the relevant properties are taken to be reflectance properties of surfaces (though there are accounts of colors apart from surface colors too). Byrne, Hilbert and Kalderon defends versions of this view. They identify colors with reflectance types.\n\nA reflectance type is a set, or type, of reflectances, and a reflectance is a surface's disposition to reflect certain percentages of light specified for each wavelength within the visible spectrum.\n\nBoth relationalism and physicalism of these kinds are so called realist theories, since apart from specifying what colors are, they maintain that colored things exist.\n\nPrimitivism may be either realist or antirealist, since primitivism simply claims that colors aren't reducible to anything else. Some primitivists further accept that, though colors are primitive properties, no real or nomologically possible objects have them. Insofar as we visually represent things as colored - on this view - we are victims of color illusions. For this reason primitivism that denies that colors are ever instantiated is called an error theory.\n\nIf color fictionalism is true, and the world has no colors, should one just stop color discourse, and all the time wear clothes that clash with each other? \"Prescriptive color fictionalism\" would say no. In \"prescriptive color fictionalism\", while color discourse is, strictly speaking, false, one should continue using it in everyday life as though color properties do exist.\n\nColor vision became an important part of contemporary analytic philosophy due to the claim by scientists like Leo Hurvich that the physical and neurological aspects of color vision had become completely understood by empirical psychologists in the 1980s. An important work on the subject was C. L. Hardin's 'Color for Philosophers,' which explained stunning empirical findings by empirical psychologists to the conclusion that colors cannot possibly be part of the physical world, but are instead purely mental features.\n\nDavid Hilbert and Alexander Byrne have devoted their careers to philosophical issues regarding color vision. Byrne and Hilbert have taken a minority position that colors are part of the physical world. Nigel J.T. Thomas provides a particularly clear presentation of the argument. The psychologist George Boeree, in the tradition of J. J. Gibson, specifically assigns color to light, and extends the idea of color realism to all sensory experience, an approach he refers to as \"quality realism\".\n\nJonathan Cohen of UCSD and Michael Tye of University of Texas have also written many essays on color vision. Cohen argues for the uncontroversial position of color relationalism with respect to semantics of color vision in Relationalist Manifesto. In The Red and the Real, Cohen argues for the position, with respect to color ontology that generalizes from his semantics to his metaphysics. Cohen's work marks the end of a vigorous debate on the topic of color that started with Hardin.\n\nMichael Tye argues, among other things, that there is only one correct way to see colors. Therefore, the colorblind and most mammals do not really have color vision because their vision differs from the vision of \"normal\" humans. Similarly, creatures with more advanced color vision, although better able to distinguish objects than people, are suffering from color illusions because their vision differs from humans. Tye advanced this particular position in an essay called \"True Blue\".\n\nPaul Churchland of UCSD has also commented extensively on the implication of color vision science on his version of reductive materialism. In the 1980s Paul Churchland's view located colors in the retina. But his more recent view locates color in spectral opponency cells deeper in the color information stream. Paul Churchland's view is similar to Byrne and Hilbert's view, but differs in that it emphasized the subjective nature of color vision and identifies subjective colors with coding vectors in neural networks.\n\nMany philosophers follow empirical psychologists in endorsing color irrealism, the view that colors are entirely mental constructs and not physical features of the world. Surprisingly, most philosophers who have extensively addressed the topic have attempted to defend color realism against the empirical psychologists who universally defend color antirealism (a.k.a. irrealism).\n\nJonathan Cohen of UCSD has edited a collection of essays on the topic of color philosophy called Color Vision and Color Science, \"Color Ontology and Color Science\".\n\n\n"}

A strong CS-US association means, essentially, that the CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US, but after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. The model casts the conditioning processes into discrete trials, during which stimuli may be either present or absent. The strength of prediction of the US on a trial can be represented as the summed associative strengths of all CSs present during the trial. This feature of the model represented a major advance over previous models, and it allowed a straightforward explanation of important experimental phenomena, most notably the blocking effect. Failures of the model have led to modifications, alternative models, and many additional findings. The model has had some impact on neural science in recent years, as studies have suggested that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons in mesostriatal DA projections in the midbrain encodes for the type of prediction error detailed in the model.\n\nThe Rescorla–Wagner model was created by Robert A. Rescorla of the University of Pennsylvania and Allan R. Wagner of Yale University in 1972.\n\nThe first two assumptions were new in the Rescorla–Wagner model. The last three assumptions were present in previous models and are less crucial to the R-W model's novel predictions.\n\nand\n\nwhere\nVan Hamme and Wasserman have extended the original Rescorla–Wagner (RW) model and introduced a new factor in their revised RW model in 1994: They suggested that not only conditioned stimuli physically present on a given trial can undergo changes in their associative strength, the associative value of a CS can also be altered by a within-compound-association with a CS present on that trial. A within-compound-association is established if two CSs are presented together during training (compound stimulus). If one of the two component CSs is subsequently presented alone, then it is assumed to activate a representation of the other (previously paired) CS as well. Van Hamme and Wasserman propose that stimuli indirectly activated through within-compound-associations have a negative learning parameter—thus phenomena of retrospective reevaluation can be explained.\n\nConsider the following example, an experimental paradigm called \"backward blocking,\" indicative of retrospective revaluation, where AB is the compound stimulus A+B:\n\nTest trials: Group 1, which received both Phase 1- and 2-trials, elicits a weaker conditioned response (CR) to B compared to the Control group, which only received Phase 1-trials.\n\nThe original RW model cannot account for this effect. But the revised model can: In Phase 2, stimulus B is indirectly activated through within-compound-association with A. But instead of a positive learning parameter (usually called alpha) when physically present, during Phase 2, B has a negative learning parameter. Thus during the second phase, B's associative strength declines whereas A's value increases because of its positive learning parameter.\n\nThus, the revised RW model can explain why the CR elicited by B after backward blocking training is weaker compared with AB-only conditioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rescorla–Wagner model owes its success to several factors, including\n\n\n"}

It believes the social world is too complex and interlocking to understand what causes a behaviour or action. This theory seeks to understand the emerging forms of social control that may lead to crime, and concentrates on assessing risk.\nMajor aspects of this theory are the norms and rules of a society that propel behaviour and private sectors getting involved in citizens lives. This theory does not revolve around issues of justice, the criminal code, or laws, it focuses on questions of how to minimize risk of entrenchments on private security for the general population. Power is a key concept within risk and actuarial criminology. Power is the highest most emergent form of social control, which contains many interlocking sets of networks such as schools, licensing agencies, organizations etc. This theory looks at the effect of these powers on risk, and the risk to our personal private security.\nRisk criminology studies changes such as the rise in private security. Risk criminology sees this change as the social institutions taking more and more interest in the private sector, as well as the public domain such as the government becoming less involved, leaving room for self-governance. This means that because of these changes in social control, individuals behaviour is understood and analyzed with actuary science, because agencies and organizations are taking an interest in the personal security and risk of their clients. \nAnother change that risk assesses, is the blurring of the line between private and public policing. In recent times, private policing outnumbers public policing, which confuses and fragments policing, which explains some patterns of behaviour in our day.\n\nSince risk and actuarial criminology does not focus on the causality of crime, which so many theories focus on, it suggests a different perspective and application to corrections. This theory suggests that we stop reacting and dealing with the aftermath of criminals, but look at pre-meditating factors such as why some groups have become dangerous? and what part of these societies do these groups threaten?\nIt tells us that we need to better prepare the society to understand the risk that offender's hold.\n\n"}

After playing a part in organizing the 10 December 1979 pro-democracy rally subsequently known as the Kaohsiung Incident, (also known as the Formosa Incident or Meilitao Incident), an arrest warrant was issued charging Shih with treason, and following 26 days on the run he was again arrested and sentenced to life in prison.

He led an around the clock sit-in in front of the Presidential Building and Taipei Railway Station in Taipei City, pledging to remain there until such time as President Chen resigned, or the reached the end of his term in March 2008. On 5 December 2006, he left Taipei Railway Station pledging to continue the protest alone in \"self-reclusion\" at an apartment nearby. As of April 2007, this protest has ended.\n\nShih was one of the most prominent personalities of the Tangwai movement and greatly contributed to Taiwan's democratization. He had been referred to by some as \"Taiwan's Mandela\".\n\nShih Ming-te's father Shih Kuo-tsui was a well-known practitioner of Chinese medicine.\n\nIn February 1947, Shih Ming-te witnessed at Kaohsiung Station that would later be known as the February 28 Incident. The student leaders of schools were charged as instigators and some were executed as riots broke out. Students seized weapons from Harbor Garrison and exchanged fires with the guards.\n\nHe entered Kaohsiung's Chung-Cheng Senior High in 1957. In 1959, after failing to pass his college entrance exam, he signed up with the ROC Army, passing the admission exams for the artillery school. On occasion he vowed in public to overthrow the ROC government by force, through an armed coup d'état as an army officer. . That same year, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter when he was 19.\n\nHe briefly served as an artillery officer in Kinmen.\n\nIn 1962 Shih was arrested for alleged involvement in the \"Formosa Independence Movement\"; over 30 more accomplices, mostly army school and university students, were also arrested. Shih's two brothers, poet and painter Shih Ming-cheng and medical school student Shih Ming-hsiung were among them.\n\nIn 1964 Shih was sentenced to life imprisonment for orchestrating the independence movement. He was also stripped of his civil rights for life. Shih was roughened up and suffered the loss of his teeth and spinal damage at the age of 22.\n\nThe Kuomintang regime considered outspoken Shih as a highly dangerous political criminal and therefore prevented him from doing any forced labor that would put him in contact with the world outside prison. This gave him time to do research and study. Shih focused on philosophy, history, international law, linguistics and Japanese. He also developed a strong and resolute personality in prison.\n\nIn the 1970s, Taiwan's government suffered several blows to its international status. First, its seat at the United Nations was taken over by the People's Republic of China, then the United States established official ties with Beijing, severing those with Taipei. A rebellion in the Taiyuan prison, where many of the inmates were political prisoners, was planned. Access to the Taitung radio station and a publicly broadcast declaration of Taiwan's independence from China was one of their goals. Many pro-independence prisoners took part in the plot. On 8 February 1970 five prisoners murdered a guard and tried to take his gun. Ultimately the five inmates broke from prison, only to be caught soon after. The breakout plot was foiled. The Kuomintang believed Shih was one of the masterminds of the uprising and therefore kept him in isolation during his time in Taiyuan. To this date, the investigation documents are still kept confidential and the implication of Shih is disputed by Shih himself, who sued Lin Shu-chi for defamation.\n\nIn 1974, after 12 years of imprisonment, Shih's first wife Chen Li-chu asked for divorce. She had had an affair with one of Shih's friends, who was released before Shih. In 1975, when president Chiang Kai-shek died, his son Chiang Ching-kuo succeeded as KMT Chairman. Under his rule, a leniency policy was implemented. On 16 June 1977, Shih was released after serving only 15 years of a life sentence.\n\nDuring Chiang Ching-kuo's presidency, political opposition to the Kuomintang was suppressed. After Peter Huang's attempt to assassinate Chiang proved unsuccessful, the KMT became more aware of opposition. Shih Ming-teh created a \"party without a name\" amidst the absence of freedom of association in Taiwan at that time. In September 1978 Shih became active in the tangwai movement. In May 1979 this group of non-Kuomintang activists established the \"Meilitao Magazine\"; Shih was named general manager. During this time, he adopted the English nickname \"Nori\", after the Japanese pronunciation of the second Chinese character in his given name, \"Teh\". For historical reasons, this nickname served as a shibboleth to enrage \"Waishengren\" people in Taiwan (mainlanders whose ancestors fought the Japanese), and endear him to the \"benshengren\" (less-recent Hokkien migrants disenfranchised by the Waishengren, and who have a more positive view of Japanese colonization). On 10 December 1979, the Tangwai group commemorated the Human Rights Day in Kaohsiung. The rally operated without prior approval, with specific stipulations that no torches and weapons were allowed. Police intervened and clashed with the protestors resulting in various damages. The event would be known as the Meilitao Incident, a milestone in Taiwan's democratization process.\n\nThree days later, Shih dramatically escaped: Chang Wen-ing, then a dentist and later Mayor of Taichung City, performed plastic surgery on Shih to change his looks so he could escape overseas. Shih was later caught along with the dentist, and sentenced to life in prison for the second time.\n\nDuring the 1980 Meilitao Incident trials Shih was defiant and proud facing a potentially fatal court-martial decision. He declared during his defense: \"Taiwan should be independent, in fact, it already is, it has been for 30 years and currently it is known as the Republic of China\". Shih also demanded an end to the political monopoly of the Kuomintang, the control of the Taiwanese press, and martial law, so that the 30-plus-year rubber-stamping legislative session could be dissolved.\n\nIn 1983, one of Shih's allies, Professor Chen Wen-chen ,was murdered; Shih Ming-te began a 1-month hunger strike to protest what he believed to be an assassination ordered by the secret police.\n\nPolish union leader Lech Wałęsa (Nobel Peace 1983) nominated Shih Ming-teh for the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize..\n\nIn 1985, Shih commenced an indefinite hunger strike. He demanded an end to martial law and state-sponsored political murders, implementation of a democratic system and release of all Meilitao Incident political prisoners. Shih was sent to the Tri-Service General Hospital and underwent force-feeding through a nasogastric tube during his four and half years of protest.\n\nOn 15 July 1987, the 38-year-long order of martial law was declared over by the KMT government, when President Chiang Ching-kuo announced nationwide sentence reductions and conditional releases. Shih declined the offer. In 1988, Shih went on another hunger strike protest with his brother Shih Ming-cheng. His brother died on 23 August 1988; Shih survived.\n\nOn 20 May 1990, the new president Lee Teng-hui officially assumed the presidency and ordered a special amnesty for all Meilitao Incident prisoners. Shih ripped up his amnesty document and demanded an unconditional release. When President Lee announced the invalidation of the Meilitao Trials, Shih Ming-te finally accepted his release as an innocent person. Upon recovering his freedom, he joined the now legal Democratic Progressive Party, which originated in the Tangwai movement.\n\nIn 1992, Shih was elected legislator for the Tainan County constituency in the Legislative Yuan. This election was the first free direct legislative elections in Taiwan history.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996 Shih was elected Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party. During his tenure, he claimed that \"Taiwan is already an independent and sovereign nation, when the Democratic Progressive Party is in power, there is no need and it will not announce Taiwan's independence\". At the same time Shih proposed a political and social Grand Reconciliation. Elected legislator for a new term in 1996, he ran for the presidency of the Legislative Yuan, gaining a vote from former archrival New Party but losing one from Democratic Progressive Party legislator Chang Chin-cheng. Liu Sung-pan was elected the President of the Legislative Yuan.\n\nOn 23 March 1996, Taiwan's first direct presidential election was held. The Democratic Progressive Party's candidate was defeated by incumbent president Lee Teng-hui, with only 21.1% of the vote(The DPP got around 30% in before regional elections). Shih Ming-te resigned to his position as party chief, and Chang Chun-hsiung assumeed as acting leader of the opposition party. Shih shifted his attention to the completion of the \"Meilitao Oral History Records\".\n\nOn 1 April 1997, Shih was indicted for a violation to the Mass Gathering and Demonstration Act. He had organized in 1992 a protest demanding direct presidential elections. Huang Hsin-chieh, Hsu Hsin-liang and Lin Yi-hsiung went to prison with Shih for 50 days. This was the third time Shih was imprisoned, but now as a legislator. He was released after 41 days.\n\nIn 1998, Shih was re-elected legislator but this time representing a Taipei City constituency. He would continue his efforts for the completion of the \"Meilitao Oral History Records\". In three years, 200 individuals of the political spectrum. The oral testimonies amounted to over 6 million words, and were edited to a 600,000 word four volume version. To date, this is the most comprehensive historical research of the 1970–1990 era in Taiwan's development, earning it a publishing prize. This was the result of Shih's individual efforts, using his own financial and personal resources. Neither the Democratic Progressive Party nor the government of Taiwan have helped complete this overwhelming historic research project.\n\nIn 2000, Chen Shui-bian, the former Mayor of Taipei City, was elected president. Shih congratulated the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party Lin Yi-hsiung for the triumph. He said in an interview that since his childhood dream of ousting the Chiang's KMT regime had been accomplished, he would leave the political party. In May, Chen before he assumed the presidency, visited Shih's office to personally ask him if he was willing to be appointed senior political advisor. Shih rejected Chen's offer once more, but instead proposed Hsu Hsin-liang for the position.\n\nShih condemned President Chen for leading the country with a minority government, ignoring the KMT majority in the Legislative Yuan and risking political stability. After Chen rejected his suggestion for an alliance with the opposition majority in the Legislative Yuan, Shih further walked away from the party. Believing that Taiwan's greatest challenge in the 21st century was globalization, together with former colleagues Hsu Hsin-liang and Sisy Chen, famous Wen Shih-ren and a dozen others intellectuals and entrepreneurs, founded the \"\"Shan\" (Mountain) Alliance\". Their goal: to draw a road map for Taiwan in the 21st century.\n\nShih ran as an independent twice, in December 2001 and December 2004. On the first occasion he lost with 24,925 votes, on the second he narrowly lost the race by receiving 26,974 votes in the highly contested Taipei North Constituency. He had proposed a parliamentary political system to overcome the aggravation of political differences in Taiwan's society.\n\nIn December 2002, Shih ran as Mayor candidate for Kaohsiung City. His platform: turn the port-city into a free port, much like Hong Kong or Amsterdam, to cope with the challenge of globalization. Direct maritime links with Chinese ports was also part of the proposal. Shih perceived that the political division was so severe that he decided to announce his withdrawal three days before the election.\n\nIn September 2003, Shih Ming-te was a visiting scholar at George Mason University for a one-year period. During his tenure, Shih researched what he called the \"One China: European Union Model\" as a means of ending the impasse between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and reiterated his proposal for a constitutional amendment in favor of a parliamentary system, in an attempt to put an end to the political polarization into the two camps (blue or Kuomintang-based and green or Democratic Progressive Party-centered) which was deteriorating into ethnic rivalry between Chinese refugees coming to rule Taiwan in 1949, and those who were there before that time.\n\nOn 6 October 2005, the Department of Political Science at the National Taiwan University opens the \"Shih Ming-te Lecture\" series; ethnic harmony, political reconciliation and cross-Strait peace are its core values.\n\nIn May, 2006, \"Shih Ming-te Lecture\" invited Mr. Frederik Willem de Klerk, Former State President of South Africa, to a dialog with Shih Ming-te: \"Maintaining Peace: South Africa's Experience, a Perspective for Taiwan?\" is the topic.\n\nIn May 2015, Shih announced his intention to run for president as an independent candidate in 2016. He again reiterated the Broad One China Framework first proposed in 2014, in which China and Taiwan govern one legal entity separately. Both governments would be allowed to join international organizations and not use military force against the other, instead \"resolving issues through consensus.\" Shih ended his campaign in September, as he had not been able to fulfill the Central Election Commission requirements needed to stand in the 2016 election.\n\nOn 9 August 2006, Shih wrote an open letter to President Chen Shui-bian, whose aides, wife and son-in-law were implicated in several corruption cases. Shih urged Chen to resign as a display of strength in times of crisis, respect for public opinion and acknowledgement of wrongdoing. Ironically, Chen Shui-bian had been Shih's defense attorney in the aftermath of the Kaohsiung Incident and had been imprisoned for 18 months himself.\n\nOn 12 August 2006, Shih gave a keynote speech to kick-start the \"Million Voices Against Corruption-Chen Must Go\" campaign in the February 28 Incident Memorial Park. He argued that the people could not bear with so much corruption anymore. Shih asks all those who support the movement a NT$100 (US$3, €2.3) donation as a symbol of commitment and consent, as well as a display of determination to ask Chen Shui-bian to leave the Presidential Office. Shih vowed to lead the people in a protest until Chen Shui-bian stepped down if the donations came in. By 22 August 2006, a sum equivalent of that from over 1 million people had been received (the actual number of donators cannot be computed because there was no restriction on the maximum amount of money one could transfer to the designated account) in only seven days. The designated account was quickly closed and the preparations for the marathon protest started.\n\nOn 1 September 2006, the anti-corruption campaign organizers started training for the sit-ins (emergency procedures in case of police intervention). The sit-in began on a rainy day on 9 September 2006. According to the Chinapost, over 300,000 people gathered that day on Ketagalan Avenue, in front of the Presidential Building in Taipei under the pouring rain. The Taipei Police Department claimed there were only 100,00 protestors. According to the organizers' request, most of them were wearing red shirts; no controversial flags or political icons should be displayed, not even the Republic of China flag, perceived as a pro-Kuomintang device. Some protestors still brought along a small Republic of China flag or other campaign items with them.\n\nOn 15 September 2006, a Democratic Progressive Party Taipei city counselor booked the Ketagalan Boulevard site where the red-clad protestors were still gathered. Shih Ming-teh decided to move the protest to Taipei Railway Station. A climax was reached the night of the procession: a large perimeter of over 5.5 kilometers around the heavily guarded Presidential Building and Residence at the heart of Taipei was quickly flooded by peaceful red-clad protestors: the \"China Post\" reported that over 8 hundred thousand people had joined the candlelight encirclement; the Taipei Police again contradicted this with an estimate of 3 hundred thousand.\n\nOn 22 September 2006, Shih declared that he would not form his own political party nor participate in any political negotiations, he also made it clear that he was not willing to engage in negotiations with former president Lee Teng-hui; instead he would stay with the red-clad anti-Chen protestors. On 20 November 2006, Shih Ming-te urged Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou (the Kuomintang's 2008 presidential hopeful) to resign amidst accusations of corruption. Shih said he was not contemplating anti-corruption protests against Ma, but insisted there should not be double standards regarding corruption allegations. Ma was acquitted.\n\nOn 30 November 2006, the last night of protest by the Million Voices Against Corruption, Chen Must Go Campaign. Shih Ming-te later travelled to Thailand for a TV interview and panel discussion.\n\nOn 7 December 2006, the Special State Funds case of President Chen and his wife was underway, campaign organizers claimed that Taiwan needed to go back to normal, but Shih would protest until Chen steps down. On 1 April 2007, Shih announced the end to his self-imprisonment and started preparations for the second stage of the anti-Chen campaign. Plans involved presenting candidates for the next legislative elections. Originally schedduled for late 2007, the elections would instead be carried out in early 2008.\n\nShih is often considered a \"romantic revolutionary\" in Taiwan media. He believes that he is rooted in his ability \"to pursue unlimited aspirations and ideals under restrictive conditions\". The latest editions of Taiwan's High-School textbooks list Shih Ming-teh as a political activist. Shih's former Legislative Yuan secretary, cartoonist and writer Yu-fu, thinks Shih \"is never quite sure of his own place in history\".\n\nShih is accused by his ex-wife Chen, Li Zhu, in her book, \"The Innocent Song of a Taiwanese Woman,\" of using her as a sex toy, and failing his responsibility as a husband. Chen also claimed Shih been indifferent to his responsibility toward their daughter. Shih Ming-te often says: \"I have been locked up for 25 years, where were you then?\".\n\nAnother former secretary of Shih, Kuo Wen-pin, wrote about his opinion of Shih on Taiwan Daily (15 October 2000): Taking a look at 40 years of his struggle for Taiwan's democracy, he revealed himself as a visionary, making several pioneering proposals ahead of his time.\n\nOver 20 years ago, Shih already said the four evils of Taiwan's path towards democracy were the political monopoly by the Kuomintang, the press control in Taiwan, the martial law and the \"ten thousand year\" legislative session (萬年國會). Risking death penalty, Shih advocated for a \"Republic of China, Taiwanese Independence Model\", and added that \"Taiwan is already an independent country, it has been so for over 30 years\". For his opinions, Shih was considered seditious and the media, organizations, academia, everyone attacked him and humiliated him, only for the Democratic Progressive Party to adopt and implement his ideas; they even led the way to Lee Teng-hui's \"Silent Revolution\" political compromises. When the Kuomintang's 50 years in power ended, the Chen Shui-bian administration accepted some of his teachings. Arrests and repression are no longer the defensive measures of the regime when facing harsh criticism, but the abuse of public power and the media by individuals to insult, humiliate, and defame others is still common practice. The DPP party has vowed to improve its image with more diplomatic means, but this has yet to be seen.\n\nIn the aftermath of Shih's \"red-shirt\" movement, he became a darling of PRC-controlled media, including CCTVPhoenix TV, and the People's Daily. Shih's efforts in discrediting the DPP have been widely praised and reported by various media outlets controlled or owned by the Chinese government. On 20 November 2006, ifeng.com, web portal of pro-CCP television channel Phoenix TV, reported Shih planned a trip to Thailand to discuss his \"red shirt\" philosophy. In the same article, Shih also rebutted claims by representative of the American Institute in Taiwan that the red shirts instigated violence and caused social upheaval.\n\nOn 16 January 2010, chinanews.com.cn, a PRC media outlet, reported the possibility of Shih running for presidency in 2012. On 19 April 2010, www.chinataiwan.org, a Chinese government sponsored site, reported Shih claimed numerous prominent DPP leaders, including Chen Shui-bian and Hsieh Chang-ting, were undercover agents for the Kuomintang against political dissidents during the 1980s. According to Huaxia.com, yet another pro-CCP website, Shih's accusations have caused a general panic in the DPP. A former supporter and pastor of the Presbyterian Church, Wang, Jie Nan, wrote an opinion piece highlighting his disappointment with Shih, starting from Shih's \"red shirt\" movement and his subsequent efforts to undermine the DPP with outlandish accusations.\n\nOn 17 April 2011, Shih courted controversy when he asked Tsai Ing-Wen to publicly disclose her sexual orientation before she participated in her presidential bid. Despite his own support for LGBT rights in Taiwan, Shih was roundly criticized by major women's groups including the Awakening Foundation, the Taiwan Women's Link and the Taiwan Gender Equity Education Association. Tsai herself characterized the request as \"surprising\" and refused to reply.\n\n•Shih Ming-te, 2006, \"qui shi zhi chun (囚室之春, Spring in a Prison Cell)\",\nnew edition.

{"id": "747279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=747279", "title": "Snellen chart", "text": "Snellen chart\n\nA Snellen chart is an eye chart that can be used to measure visual acuity. Snellen charts are named after the Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, who developed the chart in 1862. Many ophthalmologists and vision scientists now use an improved chart known as the LogMAR chart.\n\nSnellen developed charts using symbols based in a 5×5 unit grid. The experimental charts developed in 1861 used abstract symbols. Snellen's charts published in 1862 used alphanumeric capitals in the 5×5 grid. The original chart shows A, C, E, G, L, N, P, R, T, 5, V, Z, B, D, 4, F, H, K, O, S, 3, U, Y, A, C, E, G, L, 2.\n\nThe normal Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. The first line consists of one very large letter, which may be one of several letters, for example E, H, or N. Subsequent rows have increasing numbers of letters that decrease in size. A person taking the test covers one eye from 6 metres or 20 feet away, and reads aloud the letters of each row, beginning at the top. The smallest row that can be read accurately indicates the visual acuity in that specific eye.\nThe symbols on an acuity chart are formally known as \"optotypes\".\nIn the case of the traditional Snellen chart, the optotypes have the appearance of block letters, and are intended to be seen and read as letters. They are not, however, letters from any ordinary typographer's font. They have a particular, simple geometry in which:\nOnly the ten letters C, D, E, F, L, N, O, P, T, Z are used in the common Snellen chart. The perception of five out of six letters (or similar ratio) is judged to be the Snellen fraction.\nWall-mounted Snellen charts are inexpensive and are sometimes used for approximate assessment of vision, e.g. in a primary-care physician's office. Whenever acuity must be assessed carefully (as in an eye doctor's examination), or where there is a possibility that the examinee might attempt to deceive the examiner (as in a motor vehicle license office), equipment is used that can present the letters in a variety of randomized patterns.\nBS 4274-1:1968(British Standards Institution) \"Specification for test charts for determining distance visual acuity\" was replaced by BS 4274-1:2003 \"Test charts for clinical determination of distance visual acuity — Specification\". It states that \"the luminance of the presentation shall be uniform and not less than 120 cd/m. Any variation across the test chart shall not exceed 20 %.\"\nAccording to BS 4274-1:2003 only the letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z should be used for the testing of vision based upon equal legibility of the letters.\n\nVisual acuity = Distance at which test is made / distance at which the smallest optotype identified subtends an angle of five arcminutes.\n\nSnellen defined “standard vision” as the ability to recognize one of his optotypes when it subtended 5 minutes of arc. Thus the optotype can only be recognized if the person viewing it can discriminate a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc.\n\nOutside of the United States, the standard chart distance is , and normal acuity is designated \"6/6\". Other acuities are expressed as ratios with a numerator of 6. Some clinics do not have 6-metre eye lanes available, and either a half-size chart subtending the same angles at , or a reversed chart projected and viewed by a mirror is used to achieve the correct sized letters.\n\nIn the most familiar acuity test, a Snellen chart is placed at a standard distance: 6 metres. At this distance, the symbols on the line representing \"normal\" acuity subtend an angle of five minutes of arc, and the thickness of the lines and of the spaces between the lines subtends one minute of arc. This line, designated 6/6 (or 20/20), is the smallest line that a person with normal acuity can read at a distance of 6 metres.\n\nThree lines above, the letters have twice the height of those letters on the 6/6 (or 20/20 in the US) line. If this is the smallest line a person can read, the person's acuity is \"6/12\" (\"20/40\"), meaning that this person needs to approach to a distance of to read letters that a person with normal acuity could read at . In an even more approximate manner, this person could be said to have \"half\" the normal acuity of 6/6.\n\nAt exactly 6 metres' distance from the patient, the letters on the 6/6 line shall subtend 5 minutes of arc (such that the individual limbs of the letters subtend 1 minute of arc), which means that the chart should be sized such that these letters are 8.73 mm tall and the topmost (6/60) \"E\" should be 87.3 mm tall. Putting it another way, the eye should be at a distance 68.76 times the height of the top (6/60) letter. The formula is\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere formula_2 is the optotype height or width (which are the same due to the optotype being on a square grid), formula_3 is the distance from eye to chart, and formula_4 is the angle subtended by the optotype, which is 5 arcminutes as specified by Snellen. Another calculation for United States clinics using 20-foot chart distances (slightly more than 6 m), and using a 17 mm model eye for calculations, and a letter which subtends 5 minutes of arc, gives a vertical height of the 20/20 letter to be 8.75 mm.\n\nAcuity charts are used during many kinds of vision examinations, such as \"refracting\" the eye to determine the best eyeglass prescription. During such examinations, acuity ratios are never mentioned.\n\nThe largest letter on an eye chart often represents an acuity of 6/60 (20/200), the value that is considered \"legally blind\" in the US. Some individuals with moderate myopia may not be able to read the large E without glasses, but have no problem reading the 6/6 (20/20) line or 6/4.5 (20/15) line with glasses. By contrast, legally blind individuals have a visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or less when using the best corrective lens.\n\nTo ensure adequate illumination of the Snellen charts, various medical device manufacturers had developed Snellen chart products with backlight or projection.\n\nSince computer monitors typically have good lighting for reading and LCD/LED monitors have high DPI between 96 to 480, they are suitable for displaying optotypes. Commonly digital chart products support randomizing optotypes displayed to prevent patients from cheating through memorizing the chart. In Google Play and App Store (iOS), there are Snellen chart apps for smart phones and tablets.\n\n\n"}

They include plots such as scatter plots, histograms, probability plots, spaghetti plots, residual plots, box plots, block plots and biplots.\n\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) relies heavily on such techniques. They can also provide insight into a data set to help with testing assumptions, model selection and regression model validation, estimator selection, relationship identification, factor effect determination, and outlier detection.
